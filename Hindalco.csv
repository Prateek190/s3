35,2018-01-05,Hindalco,"By Andy Mukherjee

It's hard to believe it now, but once upon a time Indians had a far bigger appetite for outbound M&A than their Chinese rivals.

That was just before the 2008 financial crisis, which dealt a body blow to India Inc.'s global ambitions. Then, in quick succession, came the credit-fueled growth of China's state-owned enterprises; the yuan's appreciation; a string of corruption scandals in India that bred a climate of distrust in 2013 and 2014; and the subsequent meltdown in commodity markets, which hurt the more internationally active Indian buyers.

The tables have now turned so comprehensively it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the rankings to reverse.

Even last year, when Beijing was clamping down on Chinese firms' shopping for trophy assets -- like Anbang Insurance Group Co.'s purchase of the Waldorf Astoria or Dalian Wanda Group Co.'s takeover of Legendary Entertainment LLC -- mainland buyers still ended up committing $144 billion to assets outside of China or Hong Kong. India's tally was a paltry $5 billion.

Still, as the juggernaut of Chinese M&A rolls on (minus the flashy deals for which communist leaders have developed a distaste), Indians may not be down and out for too long. 


Bloomberg
That's the message from Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose Mumbai-listed Hindalco Industries Ltd. is bidding for U.S. aluminum producer Aleris Corp. According to Bloomberg reporters George Smith Alexander and Bhuma Shrivastava, the deal could value Aleris at about $2.5 billion, including debt. The last time Birla attempted anything this bold was when he paid $5.7 billion for Novelis Inc., the vehicle he's using now to buy Aleris. That was 11 years ago.

The timing is impeccable. The automotive aluminum market is forecast to grow at a rate of 8.8 percent a year in the decade through 2026, driven by tougher fuel-economy standards. More than 40,000 new commercial jets will be delivered over the two decades through 2036, according to Boeing Co., representing another major source of aluminum demand.


Forecast annual expansion of aluminum market to 2026

8.8%

Alcoa Inc.'s 2016 split from Arconic Inc. was predicated on the idea that the latter's downstream business -- which, like Aleris, provides specialized parts to key industrial users -- would outperform the other unit's smelting of commoditized primary aluminum.

Then on Thursday, Birla announced a plan to pump a little more than $500 million into his highly leveraged Indian telecom venture, which continues to hemorrhage amid intense competition from billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.

Confident that his Idea Cellular Ltd., which is merging with the local unit of Vodafone Plc, will be among three mobile operators to survive the bloodbath, Birla is bringing in fresh equity.

Bloomberg

This signals an inflection point. In 2013, the scion of the 150-year-old business family caused a flutter by telling Bloomberg News that India's heightened uncertainty and lack of policy transparency were the worst among the 36 countries in which the group operated; he would rather invest overseas, Birla said then.

He didn't quite make that splash abroad. Unlike Thai tycoons who are buying insurance against military control of their country by acquiring assets from Singapore to Vietnam and Myanmar, it's important for the likes of Birla and the Tata Group to do well at home -- that's what gives Indian entrepreneurs the confidence to make big moves overseas.

Take Anil Agarwal. Just two years ago, 2019 dollar bonds of the aluminum czar's Vedanta Resources Plc were trading at less than 50 cents on the dollar.

After zinc prices doubled in a year, Agarwal came back as strong as his bond, and rewarded himself with a 20 percent stake in London-listed Anglo American Plc, becoming its largest shareholder. Nobody knows what he wants to do with Anglo. For clues, though, watch his bid to put together an Indian steel empire by plucking assets out of bankruptcy. If he's successful, Agarwal could launch a global play in mining and metals.

The other Agrawal to watch spells his name like that. The first challenge for Saurabh Agrawal, who left Birla's camp last year to become chief financial officer of the $105 billion Tata Group, was to exit telecom and stabilize a troubled European steel unit. As cost savings from merging that business with Thyssenkrupp AG's metals division materialize, expect Agrawal to slowly put Tata, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea, back in the game as a buyer of global assets.

It's hard to predict the timing, but bankers should be getting ready to say hello to Indian billionaires. They're coming back.

106,2018-01-25,Hindalco,"BHUBANESWAR: Odisha plans to reach out to potential investors with roadshows in Germany, the US, China, Japan and South Korea, as well as several Indian cities ahead of the biennial ‘Make in Odisha’ conclave in November.

Odisha has already started making the pitch with foreign investors. A delegation of its industries department attended the ASEAN-India Business and Investment Meet and the India-Japan Business Cooperation Committee held recently in New Delhi.

Mineral rich Odisha is the largest producer of steel, stainless steel and aluminium in the country, but it is also these sectors that have caused it the most pain. Odisha is keen on erasing the dent caused by failed projects, such as South Korean steelmaker Posco’s mega steel plant, to its reputation as an investment-friendly state. The state has also been on a mission to broad-base its economy.

It has prioritised half a dozen areas to promote investment: ancillary and downstream industry in metals; chemicals, plastics and petrochemicals; electronics manufacturing; food processing and seafood; textiles and apparel; and tourism. Jobs, like in any other state today, looms as a serious challenge for the Naveen Patnaik government. It hopes to get investments of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in these six sectors, helping meet the ‘Vision 2025’ committed to generate 30 lakh jobs.

“Odisha is progressing like a juggernaut and growing faster than the national average. Recognised as the leader in implementation of business reforms, Odisha accounts for 7.5% of total manufacturing investment made in India,” said the state’s principal secretary for industries, Sanjeev Chopra.

Through these planned roadshows, Chopra also hopes to highlight Odisha’s natural advantages and initiatives to make doing business easier. These initiatives include single-window clearance procedures, a platform to track applications, availability of highly skilled labour, sector-specific industrial clusters and low-cost of doing business, a 10,000-km network of national and state highways and 2,540 km of rail corridor connecting the mineral rich hinterland to the ports of Paradip and Dhamra on the state’s 480-km-long coastline.

At the end of the month, a delegation headed by state industries minister Niranjan Pujari will head to Kolkata and invite potential investors to the meet Bhubaneswar planned for November 11-15. Similar roadshows have been planned in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Pune and Coimbatore within India as well as the Middle East, US, Germany, Russia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Japan and South Korea. The state delegations to these places are expected to be accompanied by representatives of existing investors, such as Vedanta, Tata Steel and Hindalco to endorse the government’s sale pitch."

102,2018-01-25,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: With the major disruptions behind and a surge in earnings across the board on the card, partly due to a low base, investor focus is turning to largecap laggards that failed to catch up with the Sensex rally from the 29,000 level in January 2015 to 36,000.

Some analysts feel many of these stocks can emerge potential comeback candidates.

The last three years proved to be disruptive for the market. When earnings were looking to rebound following two years of droughts, the cash ban of November 2016 and the GST rollout in July 2017 pushed that recovery a couple of quarters away.

This led analysts to slash EPS forecasts on a regular interval, after predicting high-teens growth at the beginning of each year.

This was mainly because of the disruptions caused by demonetisation, GST rollout and the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) asset quality review, brokerage Credit Suisse said in a note.

In pharma, IT and telecom sectors large cuts in earnings estimates happened due to competitive pressures and changing sectoral landscapes.

“In our view, these issues are now fading,” the brokerage said, adding that things are about to look up.

Profits of companies such as Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Reliance Industries, State Bank of Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, even if they come to normalised levels, may lift Sensex/Nifty50 earnings from, say, Rs 3.5 lakh crore last year to Rs 5 lakh crore in next two years, says Gaurav Dua, Head of Research at Sharekhan.

Even though earnings growth for the largecap benchmarks remains tepid, a healthy two-third of companies still grew at 15-17 per cent in last three years.

The numbers were weak due to poor performance in select sectors. Going forward, earnings recovery could be broadbased, and those which failed to perform better could outdo the index going ahead. 

This is going to be a year of laggards, said Dua. 

He likes ONGC, SBI, Tata Motors, Infosys and Bharti Airtel from the Sensex pack.

Against Sensex's 25 per cent rise, Tata Motors was down 24 per cent in last three years; ONGC was down 17 per cent, and SBI 3 per cent. Infosys is just 7 per cent, while Bhari Airtel has gained 40 per cent thanks mainly to a recent rally.

Kotak Securities expects Nifty earnings to grow 24 per cent in FY2019 and 17 per cent in FY2020. The brokerage expects a general pickup in consumption and investment demand and normalisation of operating conditions in sectors such as banking (peaking of NPLs and decline in loan-loss provisions), pharma (pick-up in US generic revenues from 2HFY19) and telecom (better pricing). Strong global commodity prices thanks to global economic recovery will also aid this growth, it says. 

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher prefers State Bank of India, Larsen & Toubro, IndianOil, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, YES Bank, Tata Steel and Hindalco Industries, among others.

Some analysts are suggesting investors to make a shift towards largecaps, given the high valuations in midcap and smallcap pockets.

It is safer and better to be in the largecap space, which is where you are likely to make more money going forward, said Anand Tandon, independent market expert."

107,2018-01-28,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: After a record-breaking run for six straight sessions, the bulls finally gave up on Thursday, leading to heavy selloff in select bluechips such as SBI, Infosys, TCS, Maruti and HeroMotoCorp.

The bank recapitalisation details came in as a damper for the state-run lenders. According to Fitch Ratings, the government's Rs 88,139-crore capital infusion in struggling public sector banks (PSBs) should help in part to mitigate risks, but bad assets resolution and continued high credit costs can hinder the sector's near-term performance.

On Thursday, the S&P BSE Sensex shed 111 points to settle at 36,050 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) also took a breather at 11,069, slipping 16 points.

Let’s check out what’s in store for the next week. Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here’s a look at top seven factors that may influence market -


All eyes on the Union Budget

Right now, nothing matters to the market the most than the Union Budget 2018, which will be presented on Thursday, February 1. It is going to be the biggest driver of the market. Industry bodies have been pitching for corporate tax cuts while the salaried class wants lower income tax. Also, going by the reports and speculations, LTCG tax may act as a speed bump for stock investors. Brokerage Kotak Securities says the Modi government may make it harder for investors to claim exemptions on capital gains from equity investments by implementing the LTCG tax.

Shefali Goradia, partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP says, ""The government has to find avenues for generating additional revenue to bridge the fiscal deficit. Tweaking the long-term capital gain break is a low-hanging fruit.”


Next batch of quarterly earnings

Among the prominent names, HDFC, IDFC and Tech Mahindra will announce Q3 results on Monday, January 29, while IndianOil (IOCL) will release its numbers on Tuesday, January 30; ICICI Bank, L&T, NTPC and Vedanta are scheduled to declare their results on Wednesday, January 31. Bajaj Auto and Hindalco Industries will release their number on Friday, February 2.


Tech charts signal weakness in market

On Thursday, the Nifty50 index of National Stock Exchange (NSE) formed a Hanging Man pattern on the daily chart. A 'Hanging Man' is a bearish candlestick pattern, which is formed at the end of an upward trend. In this formation, the market witnesses significant selloff at the start but manages to recoup some of the losses and closes near the opening level at close. ""The Nifty50 registered a Hanging Man kind of formation, suggesting exhaustion in the market. As the momentum oscillators on the lower time frame charts generated a sell signal, the market should ideally remain under pressure and trade sideways with a negative bias over the next few sessions,"" said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


Galaxy Surfactants IPO on Jan 29

Galaxy Surfactants, one of India’s leading manufacturers of surfactants and other speciality ingredients for personal care and home care industries, will come up with its initial public offering on Monday, January 29. The offer will close on January 31. The company will issue 6,331,674 equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each for cash. The price band has been fix between Rs 1,470 and Rs 1,480 per equity share.


US Fed’s policy review

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve will hold its next two-day monetary policy meet on Tuesday, 30 January and Wednesday, 31 January 2018. This will be Janet Yellen's final meeting as head of the Federal Reserve before Jerome Powell takes the charge. The Fed, in a widely expected move, had raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to a range of 1.25-1.5 per cent in its December monetary policy meeting.


India’s macro numbers

Markit Economics will unveil the result of a monthly survey on the performance of India's manufacturing sector for January 2018 on Thursday, 1 February 2018. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 54.7 in December from November's 52.6. A reading above 50 denotes expansion.


Crude prices remain a worry

Higher crude price is a headwind for India. On Thursday, oil hit $71 for the first time since 2014 on tighter supply and weak dollar. However, it settled lower as the US dollar rebounded from early losses and strengthened, denting support for the latest crude rally, but tight US supplies limited the commodity’s decline."

On the contrary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories cracked over 5 per cent in the Nifty50 index in Monday's trade."
110,2018-01-30,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Want to add zing to your equity portfolio? Consider metals. A financial result posted by South Korean steel giant Posco showed good times ahead for global steel makers.

Posco’s annual sales touched 60 trillion won for the first time in three years in 2017, with 4.62 trillion won in operating profit, the biggest gain in the past six years. The company expects top line to rise further in 2018 as Chinese steel prices should remain strong early this year, thanks to Beijing's efforts to scale down production.

On an aggregate basis, metal majors on the BSE Metal index reported a 43 per cent drop in bottom line in 2016-17 compared with 2010-11. Ajay Jaiswal, President - Strategies & Head of Research at Stewart & Mackertich, said, “Posco is not a bellwether, but its results indicate a trend in Asian steel companies. Financial results of the company suggested good performance from other steel companies as well and it also indicates that a cyclical uptrend in the industry has begun.”

“Posco's earnings increased significantly in 2017 mainly as a result of improved industry fundamentals following cuts in China's large-scale steel capacity and due to the company's increasing sales of value-added products,"" said Gloria Tsuen, Moody's Vice-President and Senior Analyst, in a release.

Listed metal players on Dalal Street have been doing a good job since 2016. Take this: the BSE metal index soared 137 per cent to 15,788.74 on January 23, from 6,661.68 on January 22, 2016. 

Vedanta climbed the most by 430 per cent during the same period. The scrip jumped to Rs 342.90, from Rs 64.75 earlier. Vedanta scaled a fresh life high of Rs 494.30 on April 8, 2010.

Other metal stocks that doubled money during the period included Jindal Steel and Power (up 341 per cent), Hindalco Industries (up 266 per cent), Tata Steel (216 per cent), National Aluminium (128 per cent), SAIL (124 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (104 per cent). NMDC gained 86 per cent in the past two years.

Despite the rally, these stocks are trading up to 74 per cent lower than their all-time highs. NMDC hit its all-time high of Rs 571.80 on January 19, 2010 while Jindal Steel is 62 per cent down from its life time high of Rs 778.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal in a research report said, “Steel sector outlook has turned positive, with growth in industrial production across the world and supply-side discipline, despite slowing fixed asset investment. Steel mills’ spreads are at new highs.”

According to market experts, Indian long product prices have spiked in the last few months, bridging the gap with flat products, driven by improvement in domestic demand and tightening of iron ore supply. 

Margins of domestic steel mills are on the uptick. Analysts expect domestic steel mills to report very strong numbers in Q4 FY18. 

“We are raising our EBITDA estimates by 10-15 per cent for FY19 and rolling over our target price to FY20E earnings. JSPL and NMDC are our top picks. We continue to like JSW Steel,” Motilal Oswal said.

The brokerage house added that flat product prices moved up all through CY16-17, in line with the international trend. However, long product prices underperformed flat products by around $100 per tonne due to sluggish construction. Large mills with high share of flat products in the mix – JSW Steel (JSTL), Tata Steel (TATA), Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel – witnessed significant margin expansion, but steel producers with large share of long products and plates in the mix benefited only marginally.

Bhushan Steel soared 73 per cent to Rs 63.80 on January 23, from Rs 36.85 on January 22, 2016. However, it is still trading 88 per cent lower than its all-time high of Rs 536.93, reached on October 22, 2010.

Anish Damania, Head-Institutional Equities, IDFC Securities, believes that metal stocks will continue to beat markets. “We like all the frontline metals companies, including Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta. Asset heavy plays will rule the roost and given the global economic recovery, we feel that metals will continue to outperform the market,” he said in an interaction with ET Now."

5,2018-02-05,Hindalco,"Aditya Birla Group’s flagship Hindalco Industries had its best financial quarter in the past nine years in the three months ended December, riding on higher LME (London Metal Exchange) prices, better realisation for every tonne of aluminium produced, and a lower leverage ratio after repaying some of its high-cost debt. “Hindalco will now be looking at growth opportunities in India while Novelis will seek to invest in China,” its managing director Satish Pai told Vatsala Gaur and Baiju Kalesh in an interview. Edited excerpts:


What is your take on the Budget, especially for the metals sector?
The overall theme of the Budget, with a big push for infrastructure investment, is very good for us. Markets for aluminium have started to pick up from November-December. January was strong. So when the projects on airports, roads and railways are implemented, it will be good for us. When (US president) Trump came to power and said that he would be spending on infrastructure, all metal prices went up. The only slight negative is when you put the extra 10% on the customs duty, some of our input costs will go up. But we should be able to manage with the price of aluminium and copper.


What can investors look forward to with better financial performance?
Realisation per tonne is going up because of the rising LME. Operating profit before tax (EBITDA margin) was 21.7% in Q3 of last year; this Q3, it was 22.3%. However, compared with Q2, EBITDA margin has been flat. Orders are coming and we witnessed sales growth. The market was up 10% and our sales were up 14%. In flat-rolled products, sequentially, sales were up 9%, wire rods sales went by 3%. January has been very good so far in Q4. LME is holding at $2,200 per tonne, so the macro is strong. Going forward, in the last quarter, input costs are going to go up another 2-3% because Coal India raised its price in January. So, if LME aluminium price is $2,200/tonne in the next quarter, we will be flat compared with Q3, but if it comes down to $2,100/tonne, the margins could go down a little.


Will you start investing now?
Now that our balance sheet has strengthened, we are starting to look at growth opportunities, but we will be extremely disciplined with our capital. We have already announced the Utkal expansion for ?1,300 crore. We did a copper rod expansion in Dahej and we will be doing some more downstream expansion in the coming months and have begun evaluating projects. The investment will be based on the merits of the project. For the next five years, I’m not too worried about the debt payment. The net debt to EBITDA ratio at Hindalco is 2.7x. Just 18 months ago, it was at 6.7x so I can take all the cash that we are generating, which is roughly around ?2,000 crore a year, over the next five years and put that amount in projects for the future. Majority of growth opportunities will be organic in India and will be brownfield, because we have enough sites all over India and adequate land in the right places. But we will still look at some places where it makes sense for greenfield as well.


What is the status of your engagement with the defence sector?
We are talking to Niti Aayog in the government as they need to work with us to put a plate capacity, which requires ?1,600-2,000 crore of capex. Just from our point of view, the volumes are too small to put that capacity. So we want them to either give us some orders or a contract for 10 years that they will buy this much from us or they co-invest with us. I think India and China are going to be the two largest producing countries for defence, if the government is successful in doing ‘Make in India’ in defence. This is why we are talking to Niti Aayog that if you are not careful your ‘Make in India’ may become ‘Assemble in India’. So, you should go one step below the plane or the tank and work with us to get the material ready. Defence in any country is a private-government partnership.


What are your plans of expansion for Novelis after you recently announced a greenfield expansion for auto lines in Kentucky in the US?
We are expanding the auto capacities at Novelis. Last quarter, we said we were looking to expand organically. We are doing the Kentucky (where Novelis would build an approximately $300-million automotive aluminium sheet manufacturing facility) first and we will do China next. We are looking at contracts, because we like to lock in some percentage of clients before we put the money."

If you had to write a note to all your clients today would you advise them to liquidate their positions in banking stocks or do you think that at this level, there is an opportunity to buy into it? I am not a stock trader and I cannot really comment on the liquidation or buying or trading of direct equity stocks. But having said that, I will give a general view on the sector. I have never been very positive on the public sector banks because there is a lot more to it than meets the eye. There is a lot of things that were uncovered today. The whole Punjab National Bank story has come to fore. Having said that, the government, has come out with a very credible plan of recapitalising the public sector banks which is worth Rs 2.11 trillion. Rs 880 billion is to be infused this fiscal year itself. The stressed asset framework that they have rolled out on Monday, increases the provisioning cost of the banks because they would be under a lot of stress to make these disclosures every Friday to the RBI credit registry.

But having said that, on a long-term basis, this is a very good structural move because it needs to be done. It is in the right direction but in a short- to medium-term, public sector banks do not look good. Anybody who wishes to trade in financials should look at retail private banks.


What has happened with NBFCs? As you pointed out, the government did a lot of talks on recapitalisation. That would give growth capital to PSU banks and hence they will do good. Bond yields were rising and NBFCs were not doing good and I do not know why a 100 bps rise in bond yields led to NBFCs not doing good when in the first place, two-three quarters back most of the fundamental experts were saying that these business models are really great and it got challenged by 100 bps. Now, people have started talking about how NBFCs would take advantage of it because PSU banks may not have that growth capital and most of the recapitalisation money would go in provisioning. Does this argument make sense and NBFCs become a buy now?Not really. In fact, I would be very cautious in this space. We have never really spoken about this space so far on this show but I think more than the rise of the yields and the interest cost, I would look at the entire asset quality and within this space, I would be very cautious about NBFCs because the asset quality would remain a concern.


Talking about the banking space, are you more upbeat about the NBFCs or would you rather go for the core banking space?I would be upbeat about the capital market companies. I spoke about this entire shift after demonetisation from physical to financial assets. It augurs very well for the capital market companies including the mutual fund companies and life insurance companies. If you are willing to look at financial services as such, as a sector, capital market companies would be something that you could look at.


How do you read the insurance space?I think general insurance, life insurance would do very well. The market potential is huge and it is under penetrated in India. So, listing these companies would augur very well in the long term one could definitely look at that.


It is very easy to see LME prices are going up and hence names like Tata Steel, Hindalco all are moving higher. I understand that is an integral part but what about valuations, what about the comfort zone or expansion plan? How are you mapping metal space when it comes to valuation matrix?Valuations do look fairly rich at this point in time but having said that, we are in a period in which there is an ongoing economic recovery worldwide. So, there is a lot of demand for commodities and metals at large. This has actually added to a lot of volatility in the Indian equity markets because there is also fear that interest rates would rise in the course of this year in developed markets and the days of free liquidity will be over. But having said that, let us not forget the basic fact that the underlying economic growth is there and it is an ongoing economic recovery which the world is poised at this point in time. I would think it is a very positive for the metal sector at large."

38,2018-02-20,Hindalco,"After remaining rangebound with modest gains for most part of the session on Tuesday, the benchmark Nifty50 pared its gains rapidly in the last hour of the trade. It ended negative losing 18 points or 0.17 per cent. Going into trade on Wednesday, we enter the penultimate day of expiry of current derivative series. We expect a tepid start to the trade and also expect volatility to remain ingrained in the session.

In our previous note, we had elaborated on the behavior of the market vis-à-vis the levels of 100-DMA and the support zone of 10,300-10,276. Wednesday’s market analysis will remain no different. Nifty has ended a notch below 100-DMA mark which stand at 10,398. But it has remained within its filters and its behavior vis-à-vis the support zone of 10,276-10,300 would be extremely crucial.

The levels of 10,395 and 10,450 will play out as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports come in at 10,310 and 10,275 zones.

The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 35.4477. It has once again shown a Bullish Divergence against the Nifty. Nifty has formed a fresh 14-period low while RSI has not done so. Daily MACD stays bearish trading below its signal line. No significant formation were observed on Candles.



While having a look at pattern analysis, Nifty failed to clear the resistance area of 10,480-10,500 and while retracing from those levels, also slipped below the 100-DMA mark of 10,398.

However, it stays within its filter and trades near important short term support zone.

Overall, if we take an extremely short term view, persistent Bullish Divergences on the lead indicators reflect the struggle and the attempts of the Nifty to find a base around current levels. However, for this to happen, it will have to move past the 100-DMA mark comfortable and advance further towards 50-DMA. Unless this happens, Nifty will remain at the mercy of the immediate support zone of 10,300-10,275. Any breach of this will bring in fresh weakness.

There are large numbers of shorts opening up in the system. Looking at this input and coupled with the fact that Nifty currently trades near to its short term support, we do not recommend opening fresh aggressive shorts in the markets. We recommend staying away from creating major exposures and continue to make select quality purchases in select sectors wherein relative outperformance will be seen.

49,2018-02-21,Hindalco,"BHUBANESHWAR: In a move that will benefit aluminium maker Vedanta, the Odisha cabinet on Wednesday approved a long-term linkage policy for bauxite. 

Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta has had a long and difficult wait for the key raw material used to make aluminium. Under the policy announced today, the Naveen Patnaik’s governmnet will offer bauxite at market prices discovered through auctions. However, of the three aluminium makers in Odisha, state-owned NALCO, the Aditya Birla Group’s Hindalco and Vedanta, it is only Vedanta that does not have a captive mine. It has been running its Lanjigarh refinery on bauxite sources from outside the operations. 

Wednesday’s announcement comes weeks after the Odisha government owned Orissa Mining Corporation got all its clearances, environment and forest, allowing it to develop the first standalone bauxite mine in the state at Kodingamali. 

Odisha is generously endowed with bauxite that combined with its coal and water resources has attracted billions of dollars in investments.

Odisha has bareserves of 1968.86 million tonnes, annual production is only 9.2 million tonnes. The cabinet today decided that it would explore more blocks and in the future the ones that OMC failed to get clearances, it would surrendered and auctioned. Accordingy a prospecting cum mining lease for a part of the Karlapat bauxite reserve, excluding the mining lease granted to OMC, would be de-reserved and auctioned. 

Under the policy, only 70 per cent of the saleable stock of bauxite would be made available for long-term linkage. The remaining ore would be auctioned with priority given to end-users or aluminium makers. The policy clarified, the floor price for the auction from which the long-term prices would be derived, would be cost of production plus profit margin of 50 per cent. 

The Odisha government had cancelled joint ventures OMC had formed almost a decade ago giving majority shared to mineral-based companies including Vedanta. Under such an agreement, OMC had hoped to provide bauxite from the controversial Niyamgiri deposit. After losing a long battle in the Supreme Court, OMC no longer has rights to the deposit. The governmnet had however formed a committee, under the chairmanship of the Secretary, to look at its commitment on raw material supply under the MoU signed with Vedanta. The policy though is a general one that would give access, and bauxite, to all participants."

66,2018-02-26,Hindalco,"BHUBANESHWAR: Former Union Minister and Indian National Congress leader Srikant Jena has asked the Odisha government to set up a refinery of its own instead of “facilitating” bauxite to Vedanta’s Lanjigarh refinery.

At a press conference on Monday, Jena accused the Odisha government of providing bauxite at a discount to Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta under the long term linkage announced last week. His government, including party president Rahul Gandhi, had played a key in opposing a mining of the Niyamgiri deposit in Kalahandi that left Anil Agarwal’s next door refinery with no captive raw material. For its two million tonne operation at the Lanjigarh the company currently sources bauxite from commercial suppliers in Guinea, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh.

Naveen Patnaik’s government has extended a policy, already in place for iron ore and chrome, to bauxite – a mineral whose rights rest largely with Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC). The state owned miner has just begun operating the first standalone bauxite mine at Kodingamali on the border of Koraput and Rayagada districts.

Under the policy, approved last week by the state cabinet, OMC would provide long-term linkages to end users, at a price derived through e-auction of a third of the bauxite it mined.

“The core issue is, since both the other players (Aditya Birla’s Hindalco and Nalco) have surplus bauxite, there will only be one buyer at the auction. How can OMC get a fair price when Vedanta decided the price?” said Jena. He claimed the average landed cost of bauxite that the company was buying today was Rs 4000 a tonne, even if it were to pay Rs 1000 to OMC, Vedanta still stood to save Rs 3000 a tonne claimed Jena. “Will OMC assure long-term linkage if a group of tribal youth in Koraput today decided to set up a small alumina refinery? The policy was fundamentally a contradiction of the Supreme Court judgement mandating auction of all natural resources,” he added.

Calls and messages made to OMC, Managing Director R Vineel Krishna went unanswered. One contender for OMC’s bauxite will be ANRAK the distressed aluminium maker in Andhra Pradesh whose refinery like Vedanta has no captive supply.

Lanjgarh was to be fed with bauxite mined by OMC from the nearby Niyamgiri deposit under a JV that has long been cancelled. Ironically, the Odisha government’s new long-term policy is a result of its prior obligations to Vedanta. “The government had constituted a committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary to make appropriate recommendation on the nature and detailed modalities for supply of bauxite ore by the OMC to the Lanjigarh alumina refinery as and when any bauxite leases are operated by the OMC,” said the government press note explaining the Cabinet’s decision.

Vedanta’s spokesperson could not be reached for comments. An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that under this linkage the price of ore would effectively be decided by competitors participating in the e-auction. Vedanta, not only stood to gain nothing, but was only vying for 1.26 million tonnes of bauxite, from Kodingamali’s approved capacity currently, against its annual requirement of six million tonnes.

The company’s experience in Odisha hasn’t been an easy one. After multiple brushes with regulatory agencies and courts its Lanjigarh refinery was finally up, but is the only one in the state without captive raw material. Anil Agarwal may also be relocating his dream project, a university for which land had been acquired in Odisha, to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. 

The Congress leader’s allegations come after a bitter by-poll fought in the western district of Bijepur, largely between the BJD and BJP. Vedanta, he alleged was being favoured both by the BJP, whose government at the Centre had granted environmental and forest clearances to this long-dormant mining project, and by Patnaik’s government in the state which was facilitating bauxite from it to the company."

20,2018-03-06,Hindalco,"Mumbai: The BSE Metal index was the worst performer among BSE sector indices on Monday as sentiment turned weak on US President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that he would impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium products. The BSE Metal index ended down 3.3 per cent at 14,534.31 on Monday — the lowest closing since December 22 last year. However, brokerages see limited impact on the Indian steel sector as India’s exports to the US are miniscule.


EDELWEISS SECURITIES
Edelweiss said that the popular perception is that China will be the worst affected by the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium and there will be a cascading effect across all countries including India. The brokerage said it differs in its view as bulk of the US primary aluminium and steel imports are from Canada, and exports from China and India are focused on Asia. There could be near-term stress on domestic stocks due to global pricing pressure and trade flow shifts, but the long-term impact is expected to be marginal, said Edelweiss.


KOTAK INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES
The institutional brokerage firm said that the US trade protection measures will lead to temporary disruption in few regional markets as new trade channels that will open to cater to supplies left behind from being exported to the US. However, it believes the extent of steel-mill or aluminum smelter restarts in the US will not be meaningful to disrupt the outlook on global aluminum and steel over the medium to longer term. The brokerage has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Vedanta and Hindalco Industries, and reiterated ‘add’ rating on JSW Steel.




Brokerages on Steel Sector


ICICI BANK
The bank said that even as a trade war is unlikely to be the outcome of the move by the US, global supply chains will go through sharp changes. The tariff hike by US is unlikely to have a major immediate impact on Indian exports as the country’s steel exports to the US are miniscule, said ICICI Bank. Around 1-2 per cent of US steel imports by volume are accounted for by India. The impact on India may be minimum, but possible retaliatory stances by other countries will vitiate the trade atmosphere, said ICICI Bank.


MORGAN STANLEY
The direct impact of the potential restrictions by the US on Indian imports is likely to be limited as Indian steel exports to the US represent less than 1 per cent of India’s production and 4 per cent of India’s steel exports, said Morgan Stanley. The firm said that the key thing to watch would be the rising risk of counter measures from other countries which may trigger trade issues and lead to pressure on steel and aluminium prices outside the US. With safeguard duty for steel in place and domestic steel prices being at a discount to global steel prices on import parity, a potential increase in steel imports into India is unlikely, said Morgan Stanley."

The development, which overshadowed the optimism over Bharatiya Janata Party’s strong show in the North-East state elections, drove the Nifty down to its lowest level since December 15 while the Sensex closed at the lowest since February 20.

Asian markets were weak as investors continued to shift to safer assets such as the Japanese Yen and gold.

The Sensex fell 300.16 points, or 0.88 per cent, to close at 33746.78 while the Nifty ended down 99.50 points, or 0.95 per cent, at 10358.85. Volatility spiked with the India VIX rising 9.4 per cent to 15.39.

On Thursday evening, US President Donald Trump’s warning of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports sparked off worries about retaliation from trade partners and sent global markets reeling. Since Indian markets were shut on Friday for Holi, investors could not react to the trade war fears.

“Indian markets are playing catch-up with other markets which fell on Friday,” said Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies. “Markets are worried what China and the European Union will do, whether they will retaliate.”


Metal Stocks Melt

Tata Motors was the worst performer on the Sensex, ending down 5 per cent at Rs 352.15. Other laggards included Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Reliance Industries, Coal India, Yes Bank and Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, which ended down 2-3 per cent.

The BSE Metal index fell the most among sectoral indices on the exchange. The index ended down 3.3 per cent at 14534.31points. NMDC, Nalco, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, and Hindalco Industries declined 4.3-5.8 per cent.

With Monday’s fall, the Sensex and Nifty have dropped about 6 per cent since February. BSE’s midcap index too has shed 6 per cent during the period while the smallcap index declined 4.4 per cent. Concernover a global trade war is the latest in a series of factors that have roiled Indian markets. The selloff began with the rise in US bond yield on expectations of a strong recovery in the world’s largest economy.

“While Fed Reserve chairman has said the Fed will gradually hike interest rates, he said that some headwinds have become tailwinds for the US economy, which could mean bigger or more rate increases going ahead. I expect volatility across asset classes in the next few months,” said Holland. The concerns led to the Sensex posting its worst monthly performance in two years in February, led by FII selling.

According to provisional data, foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth?366.6 crore on Monday while domestic institutional investors offloaded shares worth Rs 154.2 crore. Including Monday’s data, FPIs have been net sellers of shares worth Rs 12,434.2 crore in February while DIIs have bought stocks amounting to Rs 17,655.5 crore in the month."

44,2018-03-09,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Sometime late last summer, Shashi Ruia went for tea to the palatial Mittal residence at the leafy Kensington Palace Gardens. The co-founder and one half of the Essar moniker, was recuperating in London after a health scare last year and was happy to catch up with his old friend and fellow steel billionaire Lakshmi for a laugh and a light bite.

By November, the circumstances had changed drastically when Mittal’s son Aditya, the Group CEO of ArcelorMittal, flew in in his private jet for a whistle stop site visit and due diligence of Essar Steel’s expansive plant site in Hazira, Gujarat before flying out to Orissa.

By then the grandest trophy of the Ruia family – one that Shashi himself had built in the 1990s to mark the arrival of Essar in the top tier of the country’s business elite – was up for grabs, going under the hammer as part of its bankruptcy proceedings and ArcelorMittal a prized suitor.

“He was very calm and courteous, exuding a silent confidence but there was a pall of gloom,” recalls an Essar executive on site. “The tension was palpable.”

All of a sudden the equation had changed.

For the Ruia’s, Mittals were the barbarians at the gates. But for Laxmi and his son, after at least three thwarted attempts to build a steel plant from ground up in his country of birth, this was a golden opportunity for a big, bold homecoming. 

“I was born and grew up in India and have always remained close to the country of my birth and citizenship. We don’t yet have a steel-making presence in India,” says Mittal finally breaking his silence. “The country has been attractive to us for a long time – the outlook for steel demand growth makes it a strategic market.”

He isn’t wrong when he says that. With the dynamics of the Indian steel sector fast evolving, much of the lost lustre is back with spreads rising 50% in the past one year, argues sectoral pundits. China’s capacity utilization continues to remain stretched on the back of environment related supply squeeze and consequently, rising steel prices in India along with softening of input costs and import restrictions are likely to drive higher profitability for the entire sector. And for a country, poised to be the world’s second largest steel producing country over the next two years that continues of be one of the lowest per capita consumer, most expect the big boys to grow through consolidation.

“Essar is an attractive opportunity that provides access to the fastest growing steel market in the next decade,” feels Rochus Brauneiser, Head of Steel and Kepler Cheuvreux Equity Research. “A successful bid would mark the entry to a new geography for ArcelorMittal, although the company has been looking at opportunities in the country for quite some time, adds Frasier Jamieson, of JP MorganCazenove. 

But beyond the bidding war and Essar’s frenzied attempt to cling on to their much cherished 10 million tonne steel empire, industry players feel, Mittal’s calculated moves is about his business compulsions.

“Other than Mexico, the biggest strategic gap or handicap in their portfolio he has is his lack of scaled presence in the three sustainable growth markets of China, South East Asia (ASEAN) or India,” argues a senior executive of a global steel major who wished to remain anonymous.” He can’t build capacity in Europe and is yet to get the regulatory sign off for his Italian acquisition of Ilva, US is high cost and he failed to break into India before. I would say he is desperate now.”

In contrast Tatas trebled their operations in India to 13 MTPA within a decade after Corus even at the expense of a hemorrhaging balance sheet. As demand shrunk in Europe, they were forced to descale from 18 MTPA to 10 MTPA. “India saved them to offset the bleed from Tata Steel Europe,” explains the executive. 


THE BEST BRIDE
For Aditya and his team, Essar Steel, despite its complex corporate structure presented the best strategic fit. “It is a fundamentally sound asset, integrated both upstream and downstream and with an attractive coastal position. We feel that our experience in all steel-making technologies makes us highly qualified to run the asset successfully,” says Brian Aranha, Head of Strategy at ArcelorMittal. 

Even then, following their tested template Mittals chose to partner with an old ally Nippon Steel for the Essar bid. The JV is similar to the one the company has in China with Hunan Iron and Steel or even with SAIL in India. With Nippon too, which interestingly has a competing alliance with Tatas in India, Arcelor Mittal have been working as partners for last 30 years in 3 projects in the US. 

“We bring more to the table by joining hands. ArcelorMittal has phenomenal technology, capabilities, world class products, we are the number one supplier of automotive steel in Europe and in other parts of the world. Nippon also has phenomenal capabilities, produces demanding products and has a lot of patents like us and together we can bring an even larger product suite, better technology. This is the no 1 steelmaker and the no 4 in the world teaming up to make a great success out of Hazira (Essar Steel),” says Aditya Mittal, CFO and newly appointed President, ArcelorMittal.

By combining the strengths of the two giants, the resolution plan submitted for Essar involves growing the business. Sources in the know said, phase one includes restoring the nameplate capacity and then ramping it up to 18 MTPA flat steel capacity -- 12 MTPA on the west coast in Hazira itself and 6 MTPA in Paradip, Orissa on the east coast. Within the next 3-5 years, a target of 8.5 MTPA shipments has already been set and this includes new technology to reduce the dependency on natural gas as feedstock.

“There is a lot of potential and we have the capabilities to accelerate that transformation in size, scale and product portfolio,” says Aditya.

The top brass argues that unlike Bhushan – the other asset that the company seriously evaluated but dropped – Essar is the only scaled opportunity. “Our decision to bid for Essar was made after a detailed due diligence process which involved us looking at some of the other distressed assets and judging each of them on their merit and our ability to bring value to them,” feels Aranha. 





TURNAROUND TITAN
After being involved in 50 M&As in the past 25 years, buying distressed assets and turning them around has become second nature for Lakshmi ever since he branched out on his own, starting with one greenfield plant in Indonesia in 1976.

Since then he has grown aggressively to lead a colossal spanning 60 countries that churns and ships out 84 million tonnes of crude steel every year. Along the way, he has negotiated oligarchs of Central Asia; hard-nosed Wall Street hedge fund managers to the Bhoomiputras of Indonesia and the supercillous European elite and even armed coups and cartels in Africa and Latin America. But throughout his model has been to buy low the unwanted assets of other steel groups or snap up worn out state-owned plants. “He’s always seen an opportunity in things most thing is worthless,” says Tom Bouquet, author Cold Steel.

From recovering Polskie Huty Stali from the verge of bankruptcy in Poland in 2004 or Nova Hut in Czech Republic a year before to restructuring Calvert, Alabama to absorbing the transformative $34 billion merger of Arcelor and Mittal Steel in 2006, Mittal always loves a good fight. “He just sails through. You will never see him unraffled even though he has put up with a lot of flack from the French unions, NGOs and governments,” adds Bouquet.

Associates in the steel industry feel its Mittal’s obsession to building a scale steel empire and his razor sharp eye on financial discipline has helped him to be this quiet accumulator. At a time when most steel industry was national or being nationalized and thereby parochial, ArcelorMittal was a global force.

It’s always been an integrated approach, argues Sudhir Maheshwari, a former frontline lieutenant of the Mittal family for 27 years overseeing corporate finance, M&A, risk management and even the India and China operations.

“You have to look at cost control, you have to look at technology gaps and operating constraints, management revamp, process overhaul, strategic recalibration… Overall, one has to go back to the drawing board and prepare a new strategy blue print for turnaround and entrust the management team to execute the same. HR and compensation policies also play a very important role,” says Maheshwari, Founder, Synergy Capital.

And after scripting his own turnaround – the best earnings last year since 2011 after a jaw dropping $7.9 billion loss in 2015 – Mittal is once again ready to up the ante. 

“He inspires awe and fear at the same time,” says a CEO of a leading multinational investment bank. “He’s transformed his board and his management even though there has been charges of nepotism, that family run businesses often face.” “He is as global as global can be. There is Indians who have excelled in niches, but nobody has dominated a major commodity like steel like Lakhhmi,” quips Harsh Goenka, chairman RPG Group, and an old friend of Mittal from his humble Kolkata beginnings. 


HEARTBURN AT HOME
Yet the most intriguing piece of the missing jigsaw remains India. 

Since 2005, ArcelorMittal has been trying to set up greenfield capacities first in Jharkhand, then Orissa (12 MTPA both) and then even as late as 2010 signed an MoU with the Karnataka government for a 6 MTPA plant. But nothing came from each of it. Bureaucratic delays of mines, land acquisition forced an exasperated Mittal to look elsewhere. Even the ambitious partnership with ONGC Videsh (OVL) to hunt for overseas oil and gas acreage, especially in countries where Mittal’s’ has had a steel footprint was mothballed. “The environment was just not welcoming,” agrees Goenka.

“We had 2 JVs -- one for upstream and one for oil trading,” recalls RS Butola, former MD of OVL. “The idea was to leverage each other’s expertise, relationships. We went into Nigeria together, even got Total on board, but the initial deep-water drilling was a mixed success. Over time, the government’s focus changed and so did our leadership and the whole plan fizzled out before the global financial crisis changed the oil scene for ever.”

After 6 years of waiting, at the World Steel Dynamics conference in New York in 2012, Lakshmi Mittal, in a rare public display of anger, finally ripped apart the Manmohan Singh led UPA government saying India was putting progress at risk and subjecting millions to remain poor longer than anticipated. A year later, his company pulled out from at least one of the three proposed steel plants in the country, costing India an investment of Rs 40,000 crore.

“Attracting increasing foreign investment has to be part of realizing India’s potential,” argues Lakshmi.

Local peers feel Mittal gave in too soon. “Foreign companies expect states to deliver… India is a patient watch. You need to invest a lot of productive hours for unproductive outcome,” responds a rival who has confronted the Mittal’s in a few M&A battles in India and abroad. “Vedanta, Hindalco JSW, Tatas have all had to deal with false promises, mining problems… Eventually it’s a leap of faith.” Tatas signed an MoU for Kalinganagar in 2004 with an intent to complete work in 2 years. It started only in 2011 and even today there are no mines. 

Even then, in 2009, Mittals picked up a strategic stake in Uttam Galva – a move that once again yielded no dividends and after cashing at a huge loss, is turning out to cause an awkward problem. Members of the competing consortium Numetal led by Russian bank VTB are using it as a trigger to disqualify the Mittal-Nippon bid. In a recent interview, Makram Abboud, vice chairman of VTB Capital, the dominant partner in Numetal, told ET that having been promoters in two entities – Uttam Galva and KSS Petron that went belly up after defaulting on loans -- ArcelorMittal should be barred. The Ruia family have avoided any direct part in the Numetal bid but 25% of Numetal is owned by a Singapore based trust that has Ravi Ruia’s son as a beneficiary. Most see the Russians as a proxy for Ruias, having bankrolled part of Essar Oil’s $13 billion divestment to Rosneft.

“To run a successful steel business, you need experience. I believe our track record from around the world, combined with the track record of Nippon, speaks for itself,” says Aditya without getting drawn into a verbal duel. The company claims they had no management rights or board position and had written off the investment at least a year back.

The uneasy wait continues as lawyers from Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and turnaround consultancy Alvarez & Marsal prepare opinions on the legality of the bids. Scrapping both would mean start afresh and further prolonging the uncertainty over a large strategic asset.

But is there a plan B for ArcelorMittal in case Essar Steel bid misfires?

“The most exciting opportunity for us is Essar. We not looking at plan B. We are focused on achieving success here,” Aditya Mittal is quick to interject.

Fortunately, even in the middle of frustration, there is positive news flow.

Mittal’s JV with HPCL for a greenfield refinery that has already seen $6 billion investments is undergoing a 25% capacity expansion into petrochemicals that will see an additional $3.5 billion inflow till 2021. Corrosion and abrasion resistant steel for solar panels, a fast-growing segment, remains top focus. Even

venturing into solar power generation itself with a 600 MW farm in Karnataka remains a distinct possibility. “We have recently acquired Exosun, a French company that manufactures solar trackers. This acquisition will allow us to better serve a number of our solar customers and provide a complete turnkey solution,” says Aranha.

And most importantly, the JV with SAIL for auto grade steel is also finally taking off 2.5 years after the initial signing. As Malay Mukherjee, a former senior executive with both ArcelorMittal and Essar puts it – “May be the earlier (greenfield) opportunities did not work out, but Lakshmi should make the best use of the opportunities that have come now."""

57,2018-03-19,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Falling for a fifth straight session, the BSE benchmark Sensex hit over three-month low on Monday on heavy selling in metals and IT stocks, as market participants looked cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s meet on March 20-21.


The 30-share Sensex closed 0.76 per cent, or 252.88 points, down at 32,923.12, whereas the 50-share NSE Nifty index settled 0.99 per cent, or 100.90 points, down at 10,094.25. Both of these indices witnessed their lowest closing since December 6, 2017.

As many as 41 stocks in the Nifty pack ended in red, with HCL Technologies, falling the most at 4.61 per cent, followed by Tata Steel (down 4.37 per cent), Bharti Airtel (down 4.13 per cent), Tech Mahindra (down 3.94 per cent) and BPCL (down 3.70 per cent.

On the other hand, NTPC, Power Grid, Maruti Suzuki, Hindustan Unilever and Larsen & Toubro gained between 0.90 per cent and 1.25 per cent.

Metal counters witnessed severe selling pressure, tracking losses in Chinese iron ore prices. The BSE Metal index cracked over 2 per cent to 13,550.30. Barring Nalco (up 1.82 per cent), other counters in the index closed in red. Share price of NMDC, SAIL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Coal India tanked between 2.50 per cent and 6.50 per cent.

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking said, “Weak global cues and caution ahead of the FOMC meet were weighing on the sentiment. We reiterate our immediate target of 10,000 for Nifty. We feel correction could be steep on broader front thus suggest maintaining extra caution in midcap and smallcap space.”

Chinese iron ore slipped to its lowest level since November 2017, as high inventory levels and a weak domestic steel market weighed on prices. Worries over the potential trade war between the US and China and frustration over US President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs also played spoilsports hurting investors’ risk appetite. 

Among other sectoral indices on the BSE, Realty and Telecom index slipped over 3 per cent each. 

Initial public offerings by Bandhan Bank got subscribed by over 14 times till 4.15 pm (IST), according to the data available with NSE.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “Market continues to drag under global market volatility ahead of the FOMC meet tomorrow, where consensus hints at a 25bps rate hike. Bond yield remains at elevated levels and concern on trade tensions is influencing investors to book profit.”

Asian peers ended mixed on Monday. Nikkei slipped 0.90 per cent, whereas Hang Seng and Shanghai ended marginally higher by 0.04 per cent and 0.29 per cent, respectively."
56,2018-03-19,Hindalco,"In an interview with 
ET NOW,
 Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director Fund Research, Morningstar, said, ""I think managers have been rightfully watchful of the midcap space.""


ET Now: What is exactly happening in the largecap space? It seems they are clearly in favour right now. What are some of the key largecap stocks that you are watching out for?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: There has been a fair bit of activity in the largecap space because money has been coming in from retail investors. You would find that a number of largecap names that are coming up are unusual. For instance, Idea Cellular came up from the communication space purely because there was a QIP and lot of managers subscribed to it. SBI continues to see buying despite the pressure on the prices after PNB scam was unearthed. Then there is Tata Steel coming in on the largecap side, Power Grid, Bharat Petroleum, IT names like TCS and power utility like NTPC. The good part is that last year we saw mostly banks being bought but this year the flavour has changed. You are seeing a number of basic material companies, auto and technology stocks being bought by managers.


ET Now: What should be one's strategy when it comes to midcaps in the current market scenario?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: I think managers have been rightfully watchful of the midcap space not just now but over the last one year when clearly valuations did run up ahead of themselves and there was lot of exuberance that was being shown on some of the stock prices. So managers have been extremely selective in picking up these counters. The largecaps remain the largest pie of what managers are buying but yes, select midcaps do see buying. Investors are buying in Triveni Turbines or Voltas as they are seeing value there. I think managers will continue to cherry-pick midcaps as it is not going to be an all in sort of trade. They will be very careful about where they allocate money in the midcap side.


ET Now: Besides PSBs, are you seeing large ticket exits for some of the large private corporate banks like ICICI or Axis because there has been a fair amount of price correction there too?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: The interesting thing is that there may have been some buying on the PSB counters after the price correction. SBI, BoB have been added a fair bit and even PNB has seen some minor additions. I think the managers need to have that faith that yes the price has corrected, more than we want to get into some of these counters. There has been some profit booking on private banks like Kotak Mahindra, IndusInd and Yes Bank. Financials is not something that has been sold extensively. Yes, some counters have been sold but the likes of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, continue to see addition. Axis Bank is another name which saw a fair bit of addition but I think the enthusiasm with which the managers were buying in 2017 has definitely come off because they are already loaded up in positions and they want to look at other counters or rather sectors which are looking better buys at this point of time.


ET Now: A correction played out in the metals globally and it rubbed off on us too after Trump announcing those tariff hikes. Are people running for cover when it comes to metals? There is enough proof that the commodity is in an upcycle but are you seeing any capital protection within metals?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: Interestingly, we are betting on domestic demand picking up in metals. You can see additions in Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, Hindalco and SAIL. Metals saw a fair bit of buying in the month of February too.


ET Now: How are you looking at the overall oil and gas space? What is your sense when it comes to the connection between crude oil prices and some of the largecap upstream and downstream oil and gas companies?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: In the oil and gas segment the interest has been limited over the last few quarters. We have not seen any large additions like the ones we saw last year. But clearly companies like BPCL and HPCL continue to see minor adding though nothing exceptional. IOC is one counter where we have actually seen selling in the previous month. I think it is a mixed bag. There is obviously a wait and watch situation and see around what level does oil prices stabilise or if they continue to go up. I think managers will take some time before they take a call to get back more aggressively into these counters.


ET Now: What is the kind of churn that you are seeing happening when it comes to largecaps as a whole?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: Since laregcaps saw a fantastic run up in January, where clearly a lot of these stocks moved up, managers did not mind taking some profit off the table. Obviously, we have had a correction in February but still a healthy amount of money was made over the last year or two. The focus is now slowly shifting. You can see a lot of buying happening in power utilities, commodities, basic materials and cement. Banks are no longer the darling of the Street from a fund managers' perspective. That trend has definitely changed.


ET Now: What is the outlook on IT, based on the management commentary as well as the way the currency is shaping up?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: IT remains a very staggered play. I do not think too many of the midcap names really have got into much buying. The one name that pops up was Cyient that has seen some buying. But beyond that buying was prevelant in the largecap IT space and Infosys particularly was that one counter that saw a lot of activity. TCS has been playing a little bit of catch up now but Wipro still remains a flattish bet for manager. So I think it is going to be a very stock specific play right now. It is not going to be broad based buying from managers as yet."

63,2018-03-22,Hindalco,"Corrective phase persisted on Dalal Street a
s Indian equities continued with its modest slide on Thursday. The NSE benchmark Nifty once again failed to sustain above the 200-DMA despite enjoying a modestly positive opening.

The index ended the day with a loss of 40.50 points or 0.40 per cent. In volatile moves, the session remained capped in a range.

As we approach Friday, the analysis remains once again on similar lines. The Nifty has resisted to the 200-DMA, which stands at 10,171 now, and unless Nifty moves past this level, it will continue to pose resistance to the market on a closing basis.

We expect a quiet opening once again. However, the levels of 10,170 and 10,135 will continue to offer strong resistance area for the market. Supports continue to remain at 10,040 and 9,980.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 36.4130 and this continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. Daily MACD stays bearish, while it trades below its signal line. No significant formations were observed on the candles.



Having a look at the pattern analysis, the Nifty dipped below the 200-DMA at close, and while attempting to pullback, this level has offered a stiff resistance.

Any pullback will be seen only after the Nifty moves past and closes above the 200-DMA. Having said this, the oscillators have begun to turn upwards for the Index on the daily charts, while being still oversold on the weekly charts.

The level of 10,040 will continue to offer a strong pattern support for the market. However, it would still remain important to note that in spite of any strong opening that the market may see at opening of during the session, unless it ends itself above 200-DMA, it will continue to remain vulnerable to selloffs.

We continue to recommend approaching markets on a very cautious note until it throws an imminent pullback taking it above 200-DMA at close.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Good technical set up was observed on counters such as Bajaj Finserv, CG Power, Vedanta, Hind Zinc, IndusInd Bank, IDFC, Reliance, Tata Power, Tata Motors, Hindalco and NTPC.

68,2018-03-24,Hindalco,"If money could talk, it would have whooped last year. Consider this: in 2017, India saw more than 1,000 mergers and acquisitions (M&As), the highest in the current decade. The dealmaking happened on the back of a record year in terms of raising equity. A total of Rs 1,81,605 crore was raised in 2017.

Private equity players, too, had their best year in India in 2017. An EY report says private equity players invested a record $25 billion in India in 2017 and also had a record number of exits.

The year 2018 has started on a positive note, with a flurry of initial public offerings (IPOs) in March and M&As surpassing the corresponding 2017 January-February numbers.


 The really big deals, though, have not yet happened. The number of billion-dollar deals, at eight, had declined in 2017, against 12 in 2016.

But appetite for domestic assets is strong. While the number of cross-border deals fell to 340 in 2017 from 368 in 2016, the number of domestic deals increased to 682 in 2017, from 528 in 2016. By deal count, the domestic number is double that of the cross-border one. By sheer value, domestic deals make up more than 75% of the total.



A period of high capital-raising can be a double-edged sword for mergers and acquisitions. It can indicate that a season of M&As is around the corner, like in 2006-07, or it can point to a listless period for deal-making. After all, only 20% of the IPOs that happened in the last year raised fresh equity; the rest were promoters or private equity funds offering their shares for sale.

So what does this capital-raising trend suggest? ET Magazine spoke to at least 10 senior deal-makers in Mumbai and no one was confident of experiencing the exhilarating M&A days of the last decade — which saw the Tatas buying Corus and Jaguar Land Rover, and Hindalco buying Novelis.



Yet, says veteran deal-maker-turned banker Uday Kotak, this phase might redefine Indian business as we know it. “The fundamental basis of doing business in India will change. This round of M&A activity will be around consolidation of business and upgrading to a formalised economy,” says the executive vice-chairman and managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

A Brave New World
KPMG, too, seems to be thinking on these lines. The audit and consulting firm has been trying hard to break into the big league of deal-makers. In February 2018, it hired Srinivas Balasubramaniam, 43, to head its India M&A business. Balasubramaniam was with Arpwood Capital and had recently advised on marquee multi-billion-dollar deals, such as HDFC Standard Life-Max Life and Ajay Piramal’s purchase of a larger pie of Shriram. 

The HDFC Standard Life-Max Life deal was called off, but Balasubramaniam’s work was noticed. He had also had stints at Goldman Sachs and UBS.

KPMG’s M&A play in India has been largely limited to a series of small-ticket deals. Its Big Four brethren EY is one of the M&A leaders in India, often leading the league tables by the sheer number of deals. Between April 1, 2017, and March 21, 2018, for example, KPMG had advised on 16 deals against EY’s 28. KPMG’s deals by value added up to a little more than Rs 3,000 crore, while EY’s was more than Rs 36,000 crore in 2017.



EY, too, is anticipating a surge in mergers and acquisitions. Ajay Arora, partner and head of M&A transaction advisory at EY, says: “There is a strong undercurrent for M&A right now. Many conversations are happening, even if the deal news has not been announced.”

Every phase of strong capital-raising is followed by a period of M&As and that phase is just starting in India, says Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital.

Ganeshan Murugaiyan, managing director and head of investment banking for India at BNP Paribas, says: “The M&A situation is very active and there are several deals under discussion in the strategic and private equity domains.”


Atul Mehra, who heads investment banking at JM Financial, identifies five drivers for M&As. “The factors driving the growth of M&A activities in India are debt reduction, sectoral consolidation, fatigue and challenges of succession planning in family-run businesses, and harvesting by private equity funds. Sale of stressed assets under the Indian Bankruptcy Code is a new chapter in the Indian context.”

Most M&As are expected to be led by the bankruptcy proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The Reserve Bank of India had kicked off the process by asking banks to take the cases of 12 wilful defaulters to the NCLT courts. Corporate heavyweights such as Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel and Power are part of the list. 



The initial list was followed by a second list. The courts now have more than 400 bankruptcy proceedings. As Kotak pointed out earlier this week, the process at the NCLT courts would now be tested as a bad debt resolution process, but the hope was it would turn out to be better than the Corporate Debt Restructuring and the Strategic Debt Restructuring mechanisms tried out earlier.


Equity: Enabler or Dampener?
It may be tricky to guess how the effect of capital raising would play out for M&As, say many investment bankers. First, not all the raised cash is available for companies to buy assets. As Sourav Mallik, joint managing director of Kotak Investment Banking, points out, the bulk of the equity raised in the last one and a half years was via offers for sale of equity by promoters. Only a small share was raised by the companies. Out of that, some money was kept aside to retire debt.

Second, as E&Y’s Arora points out, IPOs can also act as a dampener. “IPOs can provide an exit route for PE investments. Also, a buoyant IPO market as of today is able to provide better valuation for a promoter, than being something of interest for a strategic investor.”


For example, strategic investors recently valued a consumer company at 20-25 times of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Merchant bankers pushing the IPO option, however, pegged the valuation at 30-35 times EBITDA, effectively closing the strategic investment option.

Kaustubh Kulkarni, head of investment banking at JP Morgan, does not agree with the argument that equity-raising can boost M&As.

“First, it is not correct to relate this phase to what happened 10 years ago. India was a $1 trillion economy then and is a $2.2 trillion economy now, and I see capital-raising as a normal activity to cater to the needs of sectors.” Kulkarni also points out that much-needed reforms are pending in important sectors such as natural resources, roads and electricity, and so one should not expec t a spurt in M&A in these areas.



Murugaiyan of BNP Paribas says the recent capital-raising spree was primarily either to correct balance sheets (repay loans) or to provide an exit to shareholders. However, he sees other drivers of growth.

“The key drivers of M&As are strong growth momentum returning in some of the developed markets, especially the US and Europe; growth and margin pressures in Indian markets leading to capital allocation outside India, and consolidation in the domestic market, driven by distressed assets,” says Murugaiyan.


Game is Changing The investment banking universe in India is a storied affair, with foreign banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Citi and Morgan Stanley having access to global funds and eyeing only the very large deals. Players such as JM Financial and EY aims for deals across the spectrum. 



There are, of course, smaller players, working with smaller deals. The M&A league table, by deal value, is dominated by foreign names. Morgan Stanley is the top dog. In deal numbers, EY leads — for calendar year 2017. JM Financial tops the list of investment bankers based on fee income ($23 million in fees). In fact, three Indian players — JM, Axis and ICICI — are part of the top five.

 Now, a narrative seems to be developing around how Indian investment banking firms are doing better, especially with the dominating domestic M&A flavour. Mehra of JM says Indian investment banking firms understand bankruptcy issues here much better and are best poised to benefit.



Three broad changes have led to the evolution of investment banking in India, says Ashok Wadhwa, founder of Ambit Capital: the emergence of local banks, equity capital market becoming a dominant source of funds for companies and resolution of stressed assets under the IBC.

And, Wadhwa feels, the first and second are linked. “Investments by local mutual funds have started directing the flow of the market, replacing foreign institutional investors, as there is a shift in investment from gold and real estate to financial intermediaries,” Wadhwa says.

With desi money becoming more prominent, desi banks have started aiming higher.



“It took a longer time for local banks to become stronger after India opened the gates to global banks, unlike in other countries,” says S Subramanian, managing director-M&A, Axis Capital.

 Relationships with global banks are not unique anymore, adds Wadhwa of Ambit, which itself is one-fourth owned by a sovereign fund from West Asia. “For financial sponsors, there is no distinction between global and local firms. Access is no longer unique.”



There is another way the game is changing. KPMG’s Balasubramaniam says M&As in India have traditionally had a heavy cash element. That is set to change. “M&As, whether cross-border or domestic, always used cash as the acquisition currency. We are a high netdebt country, so it is imperative that mergers should use stock as currency. It’s the only way shareholders, promoters and strategic investors will be on a par and the underlying company will benefit.”



The process of a merger can be protracted, as compared to a cash acquisition, he says. “But advisors need to realise that while cash, in an Indian context, is critical, shares as currency will increasingly find acceptance.”"

38,2018-04-11,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: Sanctions imposed by the Trump government on Russia’s largest and world’s second-largest aluminium producer RUSAL will take away over 6 per cent of global supply, and 14 per cent outside China. Since this announcement, LME prices have gained 7 per cent to $2,140 a tonne. Indian aluminium companies such as Hindalco, Nalco and Vedanta will benefit from the higher prices due to the supply disruption if the sanctions last.

The US has barred its companies from dealing with RUSAL and said that other countries transacting with it would also be punished. RUSAL’s biggest export markets are the US and the EU, which are also the biggest aluminium deficit markets with a reported deficit of 4.7 and 3.8 million tonnes, respectively.

India imported around 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium in 2017, mainly from China. Given the sanctions on RUSAL, China may find it more lucrative to target the Western markets for exports thereby reducing its exports to India, giving a boost to domestic producers.

The sanctions may also impact RUSAL’s expansion plans at a time when new projects are hard to come by. Of the four major project ramp-ups globally, two are to be commissioned by RUSAL which now face uncertainty. China, which accounts for half of the world’s production and consumption, is going slow on capacity addition due to environmental issues and will not have any new capacity after 2020.

Also, the global aluminium inventory is lowest in the past seven years. These factors together are expected to keep prices firm. This augurs well for the Indian aluminium producers. What will benefit Hindalco and Nalco more is that they are backward integrated, that is they can procure alumna, a major raw material, from their own mines. This makes them among the lowest-cost producers in the world. Prices of alumina have risen 22 per cent in the past month after a partial shutdown of Brazil’s Alunorte, the world’s largest alumina refinery, contributing 5 per cent to global output. Vedanta is not fully backward integrated. On Tuesday, Hindalco, NALCO and Vedanta shares gained 4 per cent, 3 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively."

Metal stocks outperformed in Thursday’s trade on uptick in global metal prices, with the BSE Metal index surging 4.5% to 14828.33-its highest closing level since March 1.

Hindalco Industries was the best gainer on the metal index, surging 9.1% to Rs 264.75 followed by National Aluminium Company, Vedanta and JSW Steel which rallied 4.3-9.0%.

The BSE Metal index is down 0.7% for the current calendar year 2018, underperforming the benchmark 30-share Sensex which is up 1.1% so far this year.

The rise in Thursday’s session came after aluminium prices hit their highest level in nearly seven years the previous day on growing supply concerns after US sanctions on Rusal. Nickel prices have rallied to over three year highs on growing concerns over US sanctions to Russia.

Edelweiss Securities sees Hindalco Industries as one of the beneficiaries of the surge in aluminium prices. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 325. The brokerage also has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Vedanta with a target price of Rs 425.

“We believe the current upswing in LME Al price is likely to benefit integrated players Hindalco, Alcoa and South32 the most.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “Market rallied owing to ease in global trade anxiety and RBIs stance on cut in inflation to 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1FY19 due to sharp moderation in food prices and expectation of normal monsoon. Policy was in consonance with the neutral stance and limited the chances of rate hike in the near term due to favourable domestic triggers and consequent decline in yield. On the other hand, volatility in oil price and rising interest rate globally may influence central bank to remain status quo.""

68,2018-04-23,Hindalco,"India’s biggest domestic institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) was on a major shopping spree on Dalal Street this March quarter, even as the broader market weakened thanks to a series on domestic as well as global headwinds.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 20 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 35 companies from the BSE500 index. The insurer had exposure to nearly 200 companies on the index.

The insurance behemoth booked a record equity profit of Rs 25,000 crore last financial year, compared with Rs 19,000 crore it had earned in financial year 2016-17.

The domestic equity market witnessed a lot of volatility in the second half of March quarter owing to a Budget proposal to tax long-term equity gains, fears of a trade war following some protectionist measures by the Trump administration, geopolitical crises and signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates more rapidly than expected. This also triggered strong FII outflows from the domestic market.

But the domestic institutional investor increased stake in a couple of companies from across sectors, including rating agencies, IT, pharma, downstream oil and gas players, housing finance, select private banks, FMCG and power companies.

Among the large caps, Coal India saw LIC stake go up to 10.30 per cent at the end of March from 9.66 per cent as of December 31, 2017. LIC also raised its holding in oil marketing company HPCL (from 2.08 per cent to 2.17 per cent), L&T (17.94 per cent to 17.96 per cent), Tech Mahindra (3.60 per cent to 3.77 per cent), UltraTech Cement (2.33 per cent to 2.41 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (3.84 per cent to 4.89 per cent).

Oil marketing companies have since come under pressure amid soaring of crude oil prices, which are currently hovering around their three-year high levels.

Infrastructure major L&T has been seeing a lot of interest from institutional investors in recent times.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recently named it as one of its preferred picks.


The public sector insurer also showed confidence in rating agencies during the quarter gone by, hiking stake in ICRA to 8.98 per cent from 7.45 per cent in December quarter. It held 5.88 per cent in Crisil as of March 31, 2018 against 5.45 per cent at the end of December quarter. ICRA shares are down 8 per cent in last one year, having slipped to Rs 3,812.50 as of April 20, 2018 from Rs 4,152 on the same day last year. Crisil is down around 0.77 per cent at Rs 1940.85 from Rs 1,955.90 that it had quoted a year ago.

LIC also showed confidence and raised stake in Castrol India, Adani Transmission, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Hindalco, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, Swan Energy, Power Grid, Oracle Financial Services, ONGC, NHPC, Mindtree, ICICI Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indraprastha Gas, Granules India and YES Bank.

Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance are up 38 per cent in last one year. The company on Friday posted a 22.6 per cent rise in net profit for March quarter to Rs 1,030 crore from Rs 841 crore reported for the same period of last year.

Hindalco has been among top buy recommendations of analysts on Dalal Street following a major spike in aluminium prices. The stock is up 40 per cent in last one year.

Brokerage Edelweiss says Alcoa’s Q1CY18 numbers and guidance reinforce the belief that LME aluminium price will stay robust in the near term as unprecedented constraints in the global supply chain post sanctions on Rusal and cut in Alunorte’s production, smelter restarts/new capacity are expected to be slower or lower in China and ensure steady growth in global aluminium demand at 4.25-5.25 per cent. Alcoa is world’s sixth largest aluminium producer.

Taking cognizance of the improved outlook, Alcoa has revised its CY18 Ebitda guidance higher by 30 per cent. 

All domestic aluminium companies — Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco — will benefit in the near term, Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

Meanwhile, LIC holdings came down in companies such as Dena Bank, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank, UCO Bank, Tata Steel, Indian Hotels and Cipla."

The Nifty50 index formed a higher wave Doji candle as it traded in a wider range between 10,514 and 10,638 levels all through Monday after moving in a narrow range move for last four sessions.

The index witnessed buying interest in morning dips, but saw selling pressure at higher levels, as it failed to hold above the immediate hurdle of 10,630 in the last hour of trade.

The index got stuck in the grip of option writers ahead of the expiry of April series derivative contracts. Now, as long as it holds above the 10,480-10,500 zone, the immediate trend could continue for a potential upward move towards 10,630 and then 10,700 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,400 while maximum Call OI is at 10,700, followed by 10,600. There was Put writing at strike prices 10,600 and 10,550 while minor Call unwinding was seen at all strike prices, which are creating scope for further upside.

The option band suggests an immediate trading range between 10,500 and 10,700 levels.

India VIX moved up 1.15 per cent to 13.08. Overall lower volatility is supporting the major bullish bias of the market.

Bank Nifty opened flat and then corrected towards the 24,470 level. It has been making lower highs and lower lows from last four sessions. It formed a ‘Hammer’ candle on the daily chart, which implies that the decline got bought into and it recovered sharply from low.

As long as Nifty holds below 25,250, it can extend losses towards 24,750 and then 24,500 levels, while on the upside, major hurdles are seen at 25,250 and then 25,500 levels.

Nifty50 futures closed flat at 10,585. Long buildup was seen in NIIT Tech, Mindtree, Shriram Transort Finance, HCL Tech, LIC Housing Finance, Bharat Financial and Aurobindo Pharma while shorts were seen in Cummins India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, UPL, Tata Motors DVR, Hindalco and Bharti Infratel.

90,2018-04-25,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: After imposing sanctions on the Russian aluminium producer Rusal less than two weeks ago, the Trump administrator has said it may consider lifting them. Aluminium price on the LME, which had surged by over 20 per cent after the sanctions were announced, crashed 7 per cent on Tuesday.

Shares of Indian aluminium companies like Hindalco, Nalco and Vedanta mirrored the fall in aluminium price. However, while they may show weakness for a few more trading sessions, long-term investors may find them attractive given better future prospects for the sector.

A sharp surge in aluminium price soon after the sanctions earlier reflected the supply constraints in the global market due to years of under-investment despite 5 per cent increase in the demand. The capacity additions in the coming years are likely to be limited given the US’ ongoing trade war with Russia and China.

Industry trackers expect Rusal, the largest aluminium producer outside China, to curtail expansion. At the same time, demand is likely to grow.

The US and Europe are expected to be the largest aluminium deficit regions with deficits of 4.8 million tonnes and 3.7 million tonnes, respectively. This would be beneficial for the domestic producers in the long-term. There are only a handful of major aluminium expansion projects lined up for the next three-four years; one is by Rusal and two by Indian companies Hindalco and Vedanta. China too is going slow on capacity additions due to environmental issues.

Domestic producers may gain further if the rupee continues its slide. The cost of domestic aluminium production is in Indian rupees given Hindalco and Nalco are fully backward integrated, that is they have bauxite mines. A slide in the rupee will not only make Indian producers more competitive but also help them increase the domestic market share. The share of imported aluminium in India’s total consumption is around 40 per cent. A weak rupee may make the Indian market less lucrative for Chinese and Russian aluminium producers."

In a clarification to the BSE, the company said, “We do not find any justification or reason behind sudden decrease in price of equity shares of the company in the recent past. However, we would like to once again assure our investors, shareholders and other stakeholders that the fundamentals of the company remain strong and it continues to move ahead as per its laid-down business plans.”

It added: “We want to confirm that there is no change in the management control and growth strategy of the company and also there is no change in the company's operating effectiveness. We have already opened 7 new showrooms during March 2018 and further opened two more showrooms during April 2018.”

44,2018-05-10,Hindalco,"Edelweiss Financial Services has a buy call on Hindalco Industries Ltd. with a target price of Rs 325. The current market price of Hindalco Industries Ltd is Rs 237.9. Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Hindalco Industries Ltd. price can reach defined target. 

 Hindalco Industries Ltd., incorporated in 1958, is a large-cap company with a market cap of Rs 53678.95 crore.


Investment rationale by Edelweiss
Novelis’ Q4FY18 adjusted EBITDA of USD319mn (up 9% YoY) came slightly ahead of estimate led by: 1) higher profitability in the US on sustained focus on value-added auto sales & operating leverage benefits in Latin America; and 2) better operating efficiencies resulting in raw material spread rising to a record of USD575/t. We are upbeat on sustenance of the earnings momentum as: a) contracts facilitate cost pass on despite current price volatility; and b) deleveraged balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA at 2.9x) will enable growth-oriented capex in auto. Maintain ‘BUY’ with TP of INR325, implying an exit multiple of ~7.0x FY20E EBITDA.


Outlook and valuations: On the growth track; maintain ‘BUY’We are upbeat on Novelis due to its focus on margin-accretive auto and specialty segments while maintaining fiscal prudence complemented by strong cash flow generation. Despite current price volatility, we believe quarterly EBITDA run rate of ~USD300-320mn is likely to be maintained. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with TP of INR325."

53,2018-05-13,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Neither Karnataka election jitters nor simmering oil prices globally could dampen the spirits of the bulls last week, as the domestic shares posted their biggest weekly gain in five weeks.

Upbeat quarterly earnings and soft US inflation data acted as catalysts to increase investors’ risk appetite on Dalal Street during the week gone by.

On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 290 points to settle at 35,535, while NSE’s 50-share Nifty pack reclaimed the crucial 10,800 level to end at 10,806, up 90 points or 0.84 per cent. On a weekly basis, the indices gained 1.77 per cent each.

The outcome of Karnataka assembly elections will set the market tone. A majority win for the Modi led-Bharatiya Janata Party will increase investors’ confidence and the market could move towards a new high, said Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities.

However, any setback may force the Modi government to turn populist and go slow on bold reform measures, Jain added.


Let's take a look at the key events/developments that could influence investors' sentiment in the coming week: -


Karnataka poll outcome: A lot will depend on the outcome of the assembly elections, as it will set the tone for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Voting for Karnataka elections, which took place on Saturday, saw around 70 per cent turnout. Exit polls suggested a fractured mandate, but were split over whether the Congress or the BJP will emerge the single largest. However, no one seems to be winning.

""The elections are crucial for the incumbent Congress as well as the BJP in the run up to the federal elections in May 2019. Opinion polls suggest a hung state assembly (nearly 95-95-40 seat split between BJP-Congress-JDS (a regional party),"" foreign brokerage CLSA said in a note. If the BJP ends up forming the government, market sentiment would improve but that could be the local peak, it said. The verdict for Karnataka elections will be out on May 15, 2018.


Next batch of Q4 earnings: Corporate earnings will continue to be one of the key market drivers. Hindustan Unilever, Bombay Dyeing and Abbott India are some of the notable names that are slated to release their Q4 earnings on May 14. Lupin, Punjab National Bank, Britannia, Reliance Communications and Syndicate Bank are expected to unveil their numbers on May 15, Tuesday, while Hindalco Industries, ITC, JSW Steel, Muthoot Finance and Tata Steel will announce theirs on Wednesday and JK Tyre and Voltas on May 17. Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, Dalmia Bharat and Den Networks are scheduled to release their results on May 18, Friday.


Macro data: India’s industrial output expanded at its slowest in five months in March, pulled down by slow growth in mining and contraction in the production of key items such as hand tools, gold jewellery, paper and readymade garments. The index of industrial production (IIP) rose 4.4 per cent from a year ago, data issued by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February 2018. For the full year 2017-18, industrial production grew 4.3 per cent, compared with 4.6 per cent in 2016-17. The consumer price inflation (CPI) and wholesale price inflation (WPI) prints for April 2018 will be out on Monday, May 14. CPI and WPI stood at 4.28 per cent and 2.47 per cent, respectively, in March 2018.


Tech charts show upside potential: The Nifty50 on Friday breached a strong hurdle at the 10,784 level on a closing basis to reclaim the 10,800 mark. In the process, it formed a bullish candle on daily and weekly charts, suggesting bulls are in the commanding position. Nifty needs to hold above 10,785 zones to extend its move towards 10,888 and 10,950 levels, Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said, adding that supports for the index at 10,725 and 10,680 levels.

""We are of the opinion that 10,610 levels for current month remains crucial support for the indices,"" says Anita Gandhi, Whole Time Director at Arihant Capital Markets. Hence, as long as Nifty holds the mentioned level, there is a high probability that the index may test 10,897, 10,949 and 11,009 levels in a couple of weeks, Gandhi adds.


Cement stocks may hog limelight: According to a Reuters report, the government is planning to propose nationwide ban on petroleum coke to comply with a Supreme Court request as part of a long-running case to clean the country’s air. An oil refinery by-product, petroleum coke, or petcoke, is used as a fuel because of its higher energy content than coal, but it releases larger amounts of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, which can cause lung disease and acid rain. Shares of cement companies which use petcoke as feedstock, and petcoke producers may hog limelight when trading resumes on Monday. Local producers of petcoke include IndianOil, Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp.


Keep an eye on PSBs: Four state-owned lenders – Canara Bank, Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank and Dena Bank – on Friday reported a combined net loss of Rs 11,729 crore ($1.74 billion) for March quarter due to a jump in bad-loan provisions, following a tightening of central bank rules. Indian banks, already burdened by a near-record Rs 9.5 lakh crore of bad loans as of last year, were expected to report a further rise in NPAs in the March quarter after the central bank withdrew half a dozen loan-restructuring schemes and tightened some rules in February. Shares of the banks may react when market opens on Monday.


Crude oil prices: Crude prices fell in a see-saw session on Friday, retreating after early gains as it looked likely that US allies would push to maintain a deal with Iran, which could keep that country’s crude exports on global markets, Reuters reported. However, the prices remained just below multi-year highs, with Brent on track for a weekly 2.8 per cent gain and US crude a 1.2 per cent weekly rise. Tarun Satsangi, Head of Research for Commodities and Forex at Globe Commodities, says oil prices could touch $80 a barrel in medium term on Iran chaos.

Last week, US President Donald Trump decided to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. If oil prices rise to fresh peaks, it will disturb the math of global economy, including India."

54,2018-05-14,Hindalco,"Santosh Singh, Head of Research, Haitong Securities, calls on investors to go stock specific rather than sectors. He told ET Now that impact of GST and demonetisation on consumption is thinning. And that's a major tailwind.Edited excerpts: 

The Karnataka Exit Poll results came by on Saturday. Could the reaction to the exit polls which are indicating a hung assembly be a little stark in the near term?
The exit polls appear confused. The market is also going to remain confused today. But tomorrow, when results come out, is more important. The macro trends are not looking so great and if tomorrow results are not so great for the ruling party at the Centre, then we will definitely see some amount of profit taking in the market. 


What are you advising clients to do at this point in time -- fresh positions or raising cash?
The micro trends are quite positive. In case of a lot of companies, there are earning upgrades. So, on a macro front we might see headwinds but on the micro front, we are seeing a lot of positive things happening. We would advise our clients to be stock-specific rather than buying the market or buying the sectors.


How should one read into commentary from US President Donald Trump on pharma. It is a mixed kind of feeler. On one side, Donald Trump is acknowledging that US healthcare costs are high and generic players have to increase their total presence in the US healthcare market, on the other hand he has not come out with anything specific to take the cost down or keep a check on insurance companies and the distributors. What does it mean for Indian pharma companies in the generic market? 

US generic is the key for Indian pharma companies and whatever we heard from President Trump appeared positive. At least talking about generics being important seems positive for the Indian pharma companies. For Indian pharma stock prices, there is a lot of negativity on the generic side. At this juncture, given the way rupee is moving, I would rather look at this sector because they have gone through a real tough times in last one year.


Sun TV has already done pretty well on year-to-date basis. The overhang of political uncertainty also is well behind it. Is there merit in buying the stock right now?
This is one of the strongest name in southern states. They have got really good franchise. The only problem has been the political uncertainty which keeps on coming. Although the numbers are really strong, given that next year is election year, you would not want to bet on something which is going to move on political uncertainties. I would rather look at it post elections when there is more certainty.


Ideally, paint companies should do poorly when crude prices or oil derivative prices are moving but Asian Paints has done the reverse. They have managed to report a volume growth and margin expansion at a time when oil and derivative prices have gone higher. What is your view?
The effect of GST and the DeMo are wearing off in the consumption sector. That is a positive, As such Indian consumption has been on a very strong footing for some time now. For the next one or two years, there will be a lot of focus or spending in this sector from the government side. So, whatever happens to the underlying inputs, demand is going to be very high this year and moving into next year. In this sector, we should not look at the second level derivative that is input prices. If the franchise is really strong, consumption as a story is going to play out very strongly in India.


How are you combing through the commodities basket for opportunities right now?
For last one, one-and-a-half month, we have been not much positive on the commodity stocks simply because the movement has been really sharp across the board in commodities and given the expectation of a revival of demand in Chinese economy and firming up of commodity prices globally, at this juncture. we are not big fans of mining, especially the metal side of the business. However, the only stock which we like for some time is Hindalco because non-ferrous is an area where we have been slightly positive on.



Are telcos really an avoid given all that is happening with part of the disruption?
Yes, for a long period of time, we have been talking about it. This is a matured sector which has been forced to become new entrant because a new entrant has come in and changed the rules of the game totally. Their profits are reducing and it does not seem like that competition is going to reduce from Jio. Also some of the rules are not really favouring the existing players. Clearly this is one sector I would not be buy into now.


Do you continue to steer clear of the PSU banks space?
One of the positives which is coming out is that we are seeing a peaking out of NPAs. If we are just going to look at that, then these companies might look interesting but my view has always been that leaving aside a State Bank of India or a Bank of Baroda, where is the franchise value lying in the PSBs? 

A lot of them are already into this PCR and then you have got hardly any franchise which is left with them. They are going to lose market share and I do not know for how much time they can keep the deposits because one of their biggest strengths has been that they did not lose deposit market share. They have been losing the retail loan market share. But I would think that if the things go on like this for some more time, then they might start losing deposit market share as well. 

That means they will lose franchise value as well. Within PSUs, we do not look at prices. The only buys we have or the only stock we like in this space is State Bank of India because that has been a totally different story within the PSU space. It is better run, NPL problems are not that high. They have not lost market share. They are competing with all other private sector banks. So, that is the only one. If we have to put a bet on PSU, that is the only one which we would like at this juncture."

In a choppy session on Wednesday, Sensex traded in the lower terrain, as selling prevailed across sectors, barring some realty, FMCG and IT counters. 

Risk appetite of investors got a hit after BJP missed the majority mark to form the government in Karnataka. Moreover, weak global cues and mixed earnings from bluechip firms such as ITC and Hindalco offered no respite.

Global cues faltered after North Korea called off talks with Seoul and threatened to cancel talks with the US if it was pushed into giving up its nuclear arsenal.

60,2018-05-16,Hindalco,"For Siddhartha Khemka, Head-Retail Research, MOSL, IT is a contrarian play, to be sure. Rural housing finance is another, he told ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Today Tata Steel and Hindalco results are coming out. Given the kind of rally that has already played out in the entire sector, what are you expecting from these two names today?
Today lots of results are coming out for metals and heavy weights. We are not expecting much, given that they are already on a high base. However, as metal prices have already gone up, the companies’ commentary on the terms of the latest hedges as well as their outlook on the metal prices is something that we will watch out for. We are largely positive on the overall metal sector as of now with a more positive bias towards aluminium companies.



How are you positioning yourself in pharma names? Are you taking any selective call on pharma?
Pharma is still sluggish. Their numbers are not showing any sign of improvement. Lupin was a case in point where the numbers disappointed both ours as well as Street expectation. We believe that going forward, things should revive but the outlook for the near term, that is, FY19 is really subdued. Go for larger pharma names like Sun Pharma and Lupin pharma only if it is a really long-term view, with more than two years’ horizon. However, near term, number-wise we do not expect any comfort from these stocks.



How critical is it for ITC to reduce their dependence on cigarettes considering the largest chunk of their revenue pie continues to be from the cigarette business? Pricing continues to weigh heavy on the volume growth as well. Would the market like to hear that they are focussing more on FMCG and maybe that pie would see a bigger contribution in the quarter gone by?
Yes, that is something that the management has been focussing on for quite a while and last month there was a lot of talk in the market about how ITC’s FMCG business is taking precedence over the cigarette business. On the back of the strong expectation in the FMCG business, the ITC stock started doing well. So yes, if the FMCG business does really pick up as the case has been, along with the pickup in the rural demand and the threat of Patanjali now slightly fading, that is something the market will like going forward, given that the cigarette business has been under pressure mostly due to regulations on health issues concerns.


Where would you take a contrarian bet in this market? Can momentum build up in real estate or infrastructure?


Siddhartha Khemka: One of the contra bets can be IT which has already been playing out. So there is not much room there. Infra is something that the Street has been positive for quite some time and it has somewhat played out. One sub-segment that can be a contrarian bet is the rural financing sector. We have a positive view on Repco Home Finance, Shriram Transport and M&M Finance where we see a strong demand growth especially given that the rural consumption story has been picking up over the last few quarters. Monsoon has been good as well. The expectation for this year also is of a normal monsoon. 

MSP price hikes have been taken. The MSP prices for this year is likely to be announced soon as well as given that in an election year the government has been focussing on increased spending on the rural side.


Has anything surprised you in this earning season?
The IT pack has been one of the major positives for us. In Q3, the companies had reported better numbers and had started guiding for higher growth. The IT pack has been a surprise for us on an overall basis."

This is Abhinav Kaul and I will get you today's market wrap along with cutting-edge analytics from some of the sharpest brains.

No prizes for guessing why the market today behaved the way it behaved.

The usual suspects were: Falling rupee, the 'ugly' inflation and spiralling US bond yields.

As if these were not enough, the Karnataka thriller is playing out in full force as the BJP fell short of the crease.

Earnings from bluechips such as ITC and Hindalco turned out to be mixed and investors seemed unimpressed. 

The bottomline is fear is in the air and the market hates uncertainty. The market did manage to cover up, but in the end it was just not enough.

The demand for the fourth quarter was very strong. For aluminium, it was 9% higher year-on-year this fiscal. Demand is coming mostly from the power sector, affordable housing, electric vehicles, and packaging. The demand is being pushed primarily by the government for infrastructure development.

89,2018-05-21,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: Leading aluminium producer Hindalco Industries is set to raise about Rs 5,000 crore by selling corporate bonds to repay bank loans, a move that is expected to reduce its credit costs.

“We want to pay back at least Rs 5,000 crore this year and probably refinance it with a bond in the Indian market,” Satish Pai, MD at Hindalco, told ET.

The company’s current net debt stands at Rs 15,000 crore.

However, Pai said that even though it is considering such a move, the company is waiting for the right window. “Right now is not the right time, with the rupee weakening and inflation going up,” said Pai.

Hindalco may be in talks with domestic investment bankers to assess the market condition while it may have also approached large institutional investors (large insurers, the provident fund manager, or mutual funds) to place those debt securities directly, said market sources.

About a year ago, it tapped the corporate bond market.

Going by current market rates, Hindalco bonds with 10-year maturity are expected to be priced in the range 8.75-9 per cent. The company will go ahead with the bond sale only if it receives a premium price.

“Notwithstanding the rise in yields over the last two-three months, higher or top rated entities can still save around 25-50 basis points if today they were to replace/ refinance funds raised three-five years back,” said Karthik Srinivasan, senior vice president at ICRA. The savings to these companies would have been higher at 100-150 bps if they had replaced the funds a couple of quarters earlier.

Hindalco is rated AA by Crisil Ratings.

The benchmark bond yield in India raced to a three-year high on May 16 amid rising US Treasury yields.

“Bond market volatility could pose a challenge hurting investment appetite,” said Ajay Manglunia, executive VP (fixed income) at Edelweiss Finance. “The company may time the market appropriately to allow the appetite to improve.”

“This should help it obtain a premium in pricing over its peers,” he said.

Hindalco is not a frequent issuer. For quite some time, the company did not tap the bond market. Many mutual funds such as Kotak, IDFC, and ICICI Prudential have invested in their bonds in the past.

“Hindalco papers are quite acceptable among investors especially when the commodity cycle is turning,” said Lakshmi Iyer, CIO (debt) & head - products, Kotak AMC. “If it does sell now, it may have to offer a few basis points extra as the yield curve is elevated. But there will be buyers for the papers.”

Even though the weakening rupee has triggered concerns of a rise in interest rates that may impact the debt serving ability of corporates, Hindalco is unfazed.

“We have got SBI MCLR lock ins. If the interest rates go up, the impact will be much less as the loans are much smaller now,” Pai said.

Hindalco Industries reported a 25 per cent fall in its fourth-quarter profit, missing Street estimates. Net profit dropped to Rs 377 crore in the three months through March 31, from Rs 503 crore a year earlier."

98,2018-05-22,Hindalco,"The pace of wealth creation has slowed down on Dalal Street this calendar. Fund managers and investors are puzzled that nearly 80 per cent of the liquid companies on BSE have eroded investor wealth since January this year.

Total market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies has plunged by over Rs 6 lakh crore to Rs 145.62 lakh crore as of May 21 from Rs 151.74 lakh crore in December last year. 

Second-rung stocks have underperformed the largecaps so far this year, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices falling 12 per cent each against 2.38 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex between January 1 and May 21.

But when the entire market is looking like an ocean of red, little-known stocks such as Sadhana Nitro Chem, Bullish Bonds and Holdings, RMG Alloy Steel, GSS Infotech, Shukra Pharmaceuticals and Mega Corporation have rallied between 200 per cent and 355 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Some of these stocks have even doubled investor wealth in just five months. They included Fairdeal Filaments, Laurel Organics, Excel Industries, Maha Rashtra Apex Corporation, Navkar Builders, Gorani Industries, Coastal Corporation, Lime Chemicals, Indiabulls Integrated Services, Ashari Agencies, Sinner Energy, Creative Castings, Capital India Finance. 

Shares of Swaraj Automotive, Chokhani Securities, Zenith Exports, Satia Industries, Dolat Investments and Econo Trade have rallied between 150 per cent and 195 per cent in this period.

But here is a disclaimer: these stocks are being mentioned only for information purposes. Consult your financial advisor before taking a decision to buy or sell any of these based on such short-term performance. 

Even market veterans are cautious at the moment. Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO of Equity, Kotak Mutual Fund said it is time to remain cautious, because given the many macro headwinds, the market has not really given up those valuation levels; that’s particularly true of largecaps. The midcaps are still trading at a premium to their largecap peers.

A falling rupee, elevated crude oil prices and sustained foreign fund outflows have been haunting the domestic equity market over the past few months. Crude prices last week hit the $80 mark for the first time since November 2017.

Portfolio management services, which largely bank on smallcap shares to deliver superior returns, have also been feeling the heat of the recent market correction. 

Porinju Veliyath, founder of Kochi-based Equity Intelligence, who aggressively bets on smallcaps or microcaps, wrote in a recent letter to his clients that he was baffled by the extent of erosion in portfolio value within a very short period.

“We have nothing much to do right now in a market, which absolutely lacks buying interest, but wait patiently,” Veliyath said in his letter, addressing the underperformance of the PMS since January this year. 

With up to 93 per cent fall, shares of Gitanjali Gems, Vakrangee, Talwalkars Better Value Fitness, Bombay Rayon, Reliance Naval, Orient Paper, Jaypee Infratech and Jyoti Structures have been among the biggest wealth destroyers so far this calendar.

This year is going to be volatile, says Nischal Maheshwari, Head of Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities.

“Global factors are becoming much more powerful than the domestic ones and we have seen the dollar strengthen and all emerging market currencies have come off. Yield of 10-year US bonds have gone up to 3.1 per cent and it looks like they are still set for three to four rate hikes this year,” he told ETNow in a chat.

More and more countries, like Indonesia, have increased interest rates in recent times. Maheshwari said the same is going to happen in India soon. “In this kind of a scenario, the stock market would be volatile and may see a bigger correction,” he said.

128,2018-05-26,Hindalco,"Chances of recovery in PSU bank stocks are extremely high, but pharma stocks are still not entirely out of the woods, Kunal Bothra told ETNow. Edited excerpts:

ET Now: How would you describe the week gone by?

Kunal Bothra: The market made a remarkable recovery on Thursday and Friday. It may be because of the change in the tone for the markets. At the start of the week, markets were going through an extreme amount of pessimism, sector wise. Stocks corrected about 15-20 per cent. But market recovered on Thursday and Friday. What stood out on Friday was not the index moving 100 points, but the improvement in market breadth. There were a lot of beaten-down stocks which managed to rally 8-10% on an individual day. This was one of the key takeaways on Friday. The Bank Nifty managing to make a strong comeback was the added sign.

On weekly charts, the Nifty has formed a bullish hammer pattern. The carry forward sentiment for start of next week would be on the positive side. You may look at maybe 100-150 points further rise on the index before the Nifty starts inching up towards the first key resistance mark of 10,800.


ET Now: Which are some sectors where you have seen maximum reversal?

Kunal Bothra: Friday’s session was more important because it categorised a lot of sectors which were trying to make a good comeback. OMCs were one of the few sectors which not just on the volume and price front but on the open interest position seemed to be making a strong comeback. OMCs are one sector which should see a follow-through price action.

The other sector I believe is the Nifty IT. It reversed most of the gains both in the largecap and midcap space. This sector might see a short-term correction, not a big correction. But for the next one week, these stocks may witness profit booking.

On the other side, reversal was seen in many metal stocks. Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco are among a lot of stocks that hit their 200-day moving averages.

The erstwhile defensive sectors like IT could see some bit of correction.


ET Now: How are you reading into the banking space, especially the PSBs, given the kind of amendments that we saw? PSBs have also rallied a fair bit on the back of IBC amendments, but going forward how are they looking on the charts?

Kunal Bothra: SBI is prominent as it holds a lot of weightage in the PSU banking index. It's a Nifty50 stock as well.

But after SBI’s price performance in the past few days, the price is not seeing a correction. Generally, whenever these stocks rallied 5-7% in the last few months, they corrected and managed to make new lows. But that was not the case.

The behaviour for many of these PSU banking stocks, especially post SBI earnings, has changed. You have now seen volume accumulation, short covering data on the futures side for many of the private sector midcap banks stocks as well as tier-2 largecap names. So, this is a sign of stability.

I think post the big correction these stocks could now go into a bottom formation process. It may take a couple of weeks, but I believe the chances of reversing the trend for PSU banks on a positional basis are extremely high. Anyone who is looking to buy the stocks in this space can look at SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and even PNB as these stocks might rally 15-20% in the next 3-5 weeks.


ET Now: What do you make of pharma stocks as some of them have done well in terms of numbers, but the reaction has not been that great?

Kunal Bothra: The prices are not reflecting the buoyancy because it has been not been consistent. If you look at Sun Pharma, the stock has recovered in the last one week, especially in the fag end of the last week. Dr Reddy’s post results has been unable to find its momentum back. Volumes were very high on the results day and the candle stick pattern was positive, but there is no follow-through price action.

If you look at other stocks like Biocon, it has been trading with a stronger and a fair degree of upside. The stock remains to be on a strong uptrend trading below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages as well. It is in a comfortable territory and the stock may continue to head higher.

Cadila also had a very good candle stick breakout on Friday post its results, but whether the results would translate into a meaningful uptrend still needs to be watched.

I would look out for something like an Ajanta Pharma as a short covering trade because it has been beaten down significantly in the last two weeks, almost 25-30 per cent in the last two weeks, and the indicators are extremely oversold.

A trading bet here and there could be possible in individual pharma names, but the sector overall is still not out of the woods.


ET Now: What are some trading ideas that you have picked out for our viewers?

Kunal Bothra: I am trying to trade a bit contrarian on the OMCs as many of these stocks have seen not just good volumes data on the cash side but even on the F&O side; there was a good amount of short covering.

BPCL is the stock which I am recommending for a buy with a target price of Rs 400 and stop loss at Rs 370. My second stock recommendation is a buy call on Just Dial. It not just crossed a swing high on Friday, but also managed to cross almost a two to three-month high, both in terms of volumes and price. So, it is a buy with a short-term target price of Rs 550 and stop loss of Rs 475."
129,2018-05-27,Hindalco,"Calling Asia
The second India Mobile Congress, which was launched last year as a marquee annual event by the industry, will have a distinctly Asian vibe. The government will be rolling out the red carpet for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical & Economic Cooperation or Bimstec. The mission is to give these Asian neighbours a sense of India’s digital prowess and emerging opportunities in the high-speed broadband realm as the country gets set for 5G. By involving the Bimstec members–Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, apart from India– the government is looking to turn IMC into a powerhouse Asian telecom event. The Department of Telecommunications has its work cut out, with the Prime Minister’s Office said to be directly monitoring Operation IMC-Bimstec.


Travel PlanA fund manager with one of the biggest private equity funds has moved to Singapore, ostensibly to start his own venture. The real reason is said to be tax planning — he’s set to get close to $150 million as carry fees for exceeding a threshold return for the fund. At 10% in Singapore, tax amounts to $15 million, while it would be three times that in India. That’s a $30 million homecoming (or farewell) gift.


Land LordWhat his collection of Tanjore paintings couldn’t do, a Scandinavian retailer just might. We’re talking about the Delhi descendant of a storied business family who, despite his khandaani surname, has fallen on hard times. Like many before him, he’s pinning his hopes on the family’s real estate holdings across the country. Fortunately, a much sought-after furniture and lifestyle retailer is in search of large land parcels for its sprawling stores and a deal is said to be in the works.


Cinema ParadisoA big shoutout to Nisaba Godrej and Radhika Piramal for being India Inc’s LGBTQ champions. We saw them in action at the recently held Kashish film festival for the community. Nisaba’s uncle Nadir Godrej had even written a special ditty for the evening. Just goes to show that Mumbai can shed the stuffy suits for some goodhearted fun and frolic in aid of the right cause.


Jumping ShipIs this former Tata executive and blue-eyed boy of Bombay House joining the Shapoorji Pallonji Group after leaving his previous organisation just months ago? That’s the buzz in Mumbai. Some of his peers have also joined rival conglomerates but, given the recent history of conflict, this one could burn a few bridges.


Higher BenchmarkIndia’s largest aluminium maker Hindalco Industries announced record earnings last week, thanks to rise in commodity prices and strict cost controls. However, group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has posed a stiff challenge to Hindalco’s low-profile managing director Satish Pai, raising the profit target of the company for the next quarter.


New StudioThe Aditya Birla Group’s one-time flagship Grasim Industries is looking for greater international acceptance from garment manufacturers for the viscose that it makes, by setting up a 20,000-square feet design studio to fulfil the needs of global clients. It’s also launching a branded viscose product for its women apparel buyers as it looks to make gains on cotton.


Back on TrackNot long ago, the Welspun Group’s BK Goenka was fighting battles on various fronts, including alleged mislabelling of products as being made of Egyptian cotton and challenges faced by the debt-heavy solar power business. With the solar power unit divested and the textile issue fading from memory, Goenka’s business seems to be back on the rails. On top of that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged his contribution in completing phase I of the Delhi-Meerut expressway well ahead of schedule. The Prime Minister wished him success in his “future endeavours” in the May 23 note. Welspun is the contractor for the section of highway that was inaugurated on Sunday by PM Modi.


Constant GardenerWhat happens when the Piramals join forces with the Jindals, Tatas, Godrejs and Mafatlals? Before you think matrimonial alliances or distressed assets, let us say this — let a thousand flowers bloom. Swati Piramal and her girl pals conceived of a cricket-themed garden for the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show in London. The perfectly manicured roses, orchids and poppies dazzled the Royal Horticulture Society’s guests and won a prize. Don’t know if this season’s Indian Premier League was the inspiration, but we can tell you this — Swati continues to surprise all. First, with her homemade cakes and desserts and now, with her gardening.


Getting OutHowever, the lobby group that represents the country’s handset makers is said to be pulling out of the India Mobile Congress. Hardware companies, including some handset brands, were peeved at the focus on carriers at the inaugural event. Still, given the government’s strong backing for the event, could there be a reconsideration?


Ace Investor
Ratan Tata’s private investment firm RNT Associates, which had invested in Chinese handset maker Xiaomi a few years ago, could make about three times that amount. The company had been valued at $30 billion at the time and is now pegged at a listing valuation of about $90 billion.

134,2018-05-28,Hindalco,"It is high time that we started to deliver in line or even better than expected earnings. Otherwise, this outflow on FIIs might continue for some more time, says Inderjeet Singh Bhatia, Head of Research and Associate Director, Macquarie Capital, talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Crude is down 4%. What is the impact on India?
Crude coming off the high level is definitely a big positive for India though we believe that it is not the only concern with the market. There is a few set of things which are yet to be sorted out later in the year. It would be critical if you have to move significantly higher from the current range where we are stuck for the last few months. 


Things like MSP increases, what happens to overall inflation domestic inflation and what the government policies are going to be in a election year, what happens to the Indian politics, are bigger concerns. But for the time being, lower crude prices leading to lower bond yields are definitely a key positive for India.


Why are FIIs suddenly selling in India? Is this largely because of what is happening in the world and adjustment because of weakness in emerging market currencies and dollar index? Are they selling India because of India specific factors or is this more a call on emerging markets?
In the very short term, what happened to the emerging market currencies would have played a role but if I were to look at last 12-18 months, India seems to be at the risk of losing its TINA (There is No Alternative) factor where India kind of stood out as the kind of best shirt in a basket of dirty laundry. 

What you have seen in the last couple of years is that a lot of emerging market companions have started to report better earnings. Most of the countries are going through an earning upgrade cycle and the macros are also improving for them. 

This was a time when India delivered much more strongly on the earnings front. We have seen for last three-four years now that the earnings are practically being flat every year. Something or the other is going wrong. Even on the banking side, the entire resolution process has dragged on for some period of time. Meanwhile, there has been some corporate governance related issues as well. All that is leading to a potential compression of the premiums which the Indian markets used to enjoy over the global markets. It is high time that we start to deliver in line or even better than earnings. Otherwise, this outflow on FIIs might continue for some more time.


How are you looking at the PSU banks?
There have been several false starts on PSU banks till now, where we expected them to turn the corner. May be this is the time when the incremental NPA creation is kind of slowing down but if I look at PSU as an asset class, what we are getting is that a bulk of that or large portions of PSU banks are in PCA. They are not allowed to lend incrementally. Some of them are not even allowed to take deposits. Structurally, these companies will find it very hard to invest in technology, digital banking etc. 

It appears inevitable that the entire PSU banks will lose market share very significantly over the next few years. May be one or two banks out of this will come out. SBI would turn out to be a better bank after all these things but as an asset class, generally we have a negative call on that.


Macquarie needs no introduction when it comes to understanding of the commodity cycles. Crude is anyone’s guess. What is your understanding of commodity cycle and what is your take on Indian commodity stocks?
In the commodity side, we are confident on base metals. That part of the rally is likely to sustain. There is a genuine demand supply situation in favour of the prices going higher from these levels. Steel is one area where clearly China has surprised us on the positive in terms of the actual plant closures. What we expect is the steel prices might sustain at these levels for some period of time but between the two, we are more positive on base metals compared to steel. 

We still believe that at some point of time, steel prices should come off. If I look at the domestic companies, it is generally more constructive on commodities or actually the entire global cyclical pack. Within that, we like companies more on the base metal side. So, Hindalco, Vedanta are the companies that we kind of like ahead of steel companies.


Would you be a buyer in metal stocks across the board? Do you prefer ferrous to non-ferrous, do you like both or do you like integrated and global players? Which way do you think there is scope for outperformance?
Clearly, we prefer non-ferrous over ferrous. Within non-ferrous, something like Hindalco is our top pick at this point of time. The market attributed a lot of risks to their Novelis business and thinking that they will not be able to pass on price hikes in aluminium. We believe that business is fairly protected from those aluminium price hikes so the risk reward at this point of time is better with Hindalco compared to other names.


Where would you be contrarian in this market and what are your pet contrarian themes if any in the current market ?
Since late 2017, we had a very clear view that the midcaps need to come off. It was a pet theme for the market given the views that the domestic flows are structural and that will continue. We have already seen that entire space has lost a bit of steam and the valuation premiums have come down. We still believe this will remain an area of concern for the markets. 

The second area I would say is the entire consumer pack which is an extremely loved sector and we would tend go very selective in that space. The valuations do not leave too much of room for any kind of upside here. We look at domestic cyclicals also which we think can actually surprise on the positive and as the valuation gap between the cyclicals and the defensives is fairly large and the way domestic cyclicals are starting to do better would also imply an incremental pressure on domestic consumption names where valuations are large. 

After Q4, we have already seen that only companies which have managed to deliver strong volumes and earnings growth have sustained multiples. The other consumption names have seen a fairly sharp correction. We think that entire theme will continue."

131,2018-05-28,Hindalco,"In his first media interview since the violent protests at the Sterlite Copper smelter in Tuticorin, Anil Agarwal, chairman, Vedanta Resources, alludes to vested interests behind the tragic events. India produces only 2% of the world’s copper, and the rest is supplied by Canada, the Middle East, and Europe. “Right from day one, I have been saying this that this happens only in India. All the time, people take advantage of our democracy,” Agarwal tells ET’s Vatsala Gaur and Satish John in an exclusive interaction over the telephone from London.

“Copper is the most auspicious material; the world can't run without copper. The people who make copper will be relishing that they can now use our country as their market,” Agarwal rued. “Hum log zindagi bhar import karte rahenge kya (Will we keep importing all our lives)?"" That is my question.”

Excerpts:


Q) More than a dozen people have died protesting against the expansion of the Sterlite Copper plant. How do you address such a tragedy?
 I am saddened by the loss of 13 innocent lives. It took place a few kilometres away from our plant. Vedanta as a responsible corporate citizen and on humanitarian grounds, we will extend all possible support to families of the deceased and severely injured. The basic premise of the protest was unfortunate, as the plant was non-operational, awaiting Consent to Operate from TNPCB. False propaganda dominated over the truth, and we will continue to bring out the truth to the general public.


Q) Did the company fail to read the situation?
It is unfortunate what happened about 5 km away from our plants. When we had the information that something like this was being planned for the 22nd, we reached out to the court and the court was quick to inform the local administration for it to be prepared… and section 144 was imposed.


Q. Given your London listing, how will you address investors concerns overseas?
We are stricter than anybody else in the world. We have room to grow our industry at least seven times more. We can supply the Indian subcontinent including Nepal, Bangladesh, from India. Hum log zindagi bhar import karte rahenge kya (Will we keep importing all our lives)? That is my question. As far as the question of environmental damage is concerned, we are stricter than other nations in the world. You will not believe that we have 25 world-best experts who look at the complete environmental aspect of the company.


Q) The key contention of protestors is that effluents are harming the ecology and also the community’s health…
I'm ready to have an independent agency to look at it. I will completely abide by the law of the land. I will come forward if something is found amiss because I am very confident that we have zero discharge (from the plant). If some independent agency comes in to verify, they are most welcome.

…We are open to scrutiny by any independent technical committee either from India or from any part of the world to prove that Sterlite Copper is among the best smelters in the world with world class environmental practices. We follow zero harm, zero discharge and zero waste policy across units.


Q) What do you think is the cause for protest by locals and how do you propose to mitigate it?
We believe that lack of awareness among various stakeholders has been the key reason for such opposition and fake activists have used this to their advantage by spreading fake news. Even before the protests started, we had the practice to invite people from various walks of life to visit our factory and witness first hand the best practices; on the same lines, we had even extended the invitation to several activists and leaders but none of them visited. We are open to meeting and clarifying the doubts of the people of Tuticorin about any aspect of the company’s operations.


Q) Are you disappointed with the Tamil Nadu government for the way it has handled the issue?
It is not right to point fingers at anybody in this situation as whatever has happened is unprecedented and everyone was caught unaware by the course taken by the protestors. Many factions within the protestors were willing to have a discussion and get their doubts clarified about the project but the separatists have hijacked their agenda in a violent manner.

My request is to keep business away from politics. I fully agree with the fact that we need a strong government but we need to keep business away from politics. All over the world, successful economies don't mix politics with business. Having said that, it is very important for the government to get to the bottom of this episode.


Q. How does Sterlite Copper compare with the two other smelters in India and with your global peers?
We produce only about 5% of the copper of the world and 95% is supplied by Canada, Middle East, Germany Europe etc. and I can stand by that our plant has been rated the best among all those plants. India has three plants producing copper- Hindustan Copper, Birla Copper and ours. We have been there for twenty years…The air quality of the area has improved than what it was ten years ago. The groundwater quality has improved and we supply all the drinking water to everybody and we have zero discharge.… We have invested more than Rs 500 crs in environmental protection measures….Right from inception, our plant works on the principle of Zero Liquid Discharge.

Q. Industrialists including you have talked about vested interests. Who are they and are they funded by foreign interest groups?
Anti-development associations/ groups have whipped up emotions of the public against several projects in Tamil Nadu and Sterlite is also a victim of such fake activism. Such activists are time and again raking up the sentiments of the public for their vested interests which have now cost the lives of innocent people. They wish to destabilize the Indian industry through orchestrating protests for various reasons.


Q. You have been under attack from NGOs etc. for Sesa Goa or at Niyamgiri….
 We are the only resources (mining) company in India. Secondly, we are the only company listed there and listed outside (LSE). And we have been openly championing about our country’s natural resources and not depend on imported coal, or iron ore, copper, crude oil..

… In the past too, other companies such as Tata, Maruti, Hindalco etc have faced such events. Unfortunately, misinformation spread by vested interests gets taken on the face value by the public at large, leading to such incidents. But it becomes dangerous when anti-social elements masquerade as activists.


Q. Are you willing to engage with the protestors?
We were always willing to have a dialogue with the protestors and address their concerns. This was even communicated to the general public and other stakeholders through print media. We even invited them to come and visit our facilities to see for themselves how we have undertaken environmental friendly initiatives. They did not respond.


Q. Some allegations levelled against you by activists, say that the plant is located 14 km's from the Gulf of Mannar when according to a condition laid down in the NOC that was given in 1994, it had to be 25 km away from the gulf.

Gulf of Mannar is not yet notified as National Marine Park as per Environmental Protection Act or as per Wildlife Protection Act. This matter was debated in detail in the Hon’ble Supreme Court (Case: Sterlite Industries (India) Versus Union of India & Ors. Etc Etc) and both State Government and Central Government accepted that it is not yet notified as National Marine Park. Moreover, the latest EIA notification prescribes a limit of 10 km from any national parks and they have also stated that in case of setting up industries within 10km then the MOEF can be approached for the same.

All allegations have already been dealt with by the Supreme court and the National Green Tribunal which has given us a favourable judgment.




Q. They have also alleged that the TN Pollution Control Board has been soft on you since the beginning….
The TN government had set up the SIPCOT industrial complex in Tuticorin within 15km from the Gulf of Mannar in the early 1980s. Since this industrial complex was meant for Red category industries, Sterlite was also allotted land in this complex when it approached the TN government in 1994. Moreover, TNPCB had laid down the stringent condition of Zero Liquid Discharge for Sterlite right from inception, which means not a single drop of wastewater can be let out of the company premises, while many industries in Tuticorin are even now allowed to let their effluents into the ocean. The presence of Zero Liquid Discharge plants means there cannot be any concern to marine life because of Sterlite Copper.

Also, we ensure that non-toxic wastes or by-products generated in a month have to be sold to sustainable applications within that month whereas several other industries in the country have huge stockpiles of such by-products. There also have been other unique and stringent conditions such a fence line monitoring, Flue gas desulphurization system which have been imposed on Sterlite Copper.

Hence conditions imposed by TNPCB are much more stringent than for other companies across the country and calling them biased towards Sterlite is completely baseless.


Q. In another event when in 2004, it was discovered that Sterlite had started production of some units of its proposed expansion without a license, and without an environment clearance?
We commenced production only after obtaining Consent from TNPCB and even the construction was started after obtaining necessary approvals. All these issues were adequately handled and deliberated in depth by the Supreme Court during 2013 and laid to rest."
130,2018-05-28,Hindalco,"Metals magnate Anil Agarwal has told ET that his group is ready to “undergo scrutiny” by any technical committee to prove to the people of Tuticorin that all the allegations against Sterlite Copper were done with “mala fide intentions” and that the unit is a victim of “fake activism”.

“Anti-development associations/groups have whipped up emotions of the public against several projects in Tamil Nadu and Sterlite is also a victim of such fake activism,” he said in an exclusive interaction, his first with the media after 13 protestors died in Tuticorin.

“Such activists are time and again raking up the sentiments of the public for their vested interests that have now cost the lives of innocent people. They wish to destabilise Indian industry through orchestrating protests for various reasons,” Agarwal told ET over telephone from London, where his Vedanta Resources Plc is listed and based.

It is not new for the oil-to aluminum, zinc and copper metals conglomerate to face opposition from environmental groups and NGOs. Agarwal, however, views them as actions by vested interests that would not like India to become self sufficient in natural resources.

“Hum log zindagi bhar import karte rahenge kya (Will we keep importing all our lives)? That is my question,” Agarwal said, when asked why his group faces repeated protests from activists.

He also debunked all talk of his group not adhering to environmental norms, stating that Vedanta had all the permissions for the copper plant to operate. The group was planning to double the production when the agitation started.

Citing instances of other Indian business groups facing similar opposition, Agarwal said activism is common, especially when the country is pushing the development agenda.

“Every industry, small or big, has faced the wrath of activists in some way or the other. In the past, too, other companies like Tata, Maruti, and Hindalco have faced such events,” he said. “Unfortunately, misinformation spread by vested interests gets taken on the face value by the public at large, leading to such incidents,” he rued.

While observers say the Tamil Nadu government was caught unaware by the agitation that turned violent, Agarwal is not willing to be drawn into finding who is at fault for allowing events to come to such a pass.

“Let us not point fingers at anybody in this situation,” he remarked, although his grouse against vested interests remains. “…it becomes dangerous when antisocial elements masquerade as activists.

And it is for the company to clear the doubts raised by such activists. We believe it is only a matter of time before people get to know the truth similar to what happened in the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant.”"

137,2018-05-29,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Solid buying in financials, auto, pharma and oil stocks lifted domestic equity indices for third day in a row on Monday. Twin positive cues of softening crude prices and a rupee recovery boosted investors’ sentiment. 

The S&P BSE Sensex added 240.61 points to end at 35,165, while NSE’s Nifty50 gained 83.50 points to close at 10,688.

In the process, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled upward crossovers for 151 stocks on NSE.

MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in a traded security or index.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Jet Airways, Sun Pharma, IDFC Bank, IndianOil, SAIL, NCC, Lupin, Hindalco and Bharat Petroleum. 

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes lately, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included Unitech, Oriental Bank of Commerce, NCC, Rural Electrification Corporation, Allahabad Bank, India Cements, Rashtriya Chemicals, Edelweiss Financial Services, Castrol India, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Can Fin Homes.



MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.

MACD alone may not be a sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

MACD charts also signalled bearish crossovers for five stocks on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. They included Nandan Denim, Manpasand Beverages, SH Kelkar & Company, Monte Carlo Fashions and GOCL Corporation. 



On Monday, the 50-share Nifty index rose 83.50 points, or 0.79 per cent, to close at 10,688. It hit the 10,700 level on an intraday basis, but saw selling pressure towards close. 

On Tuesday, the index will need to trade consistently above the 10,700 level to retain the same bullish undertone. “In that scenario, we can expect the rally to get stretched up to 10,777 level. However, major breakthrough in the indices can be witnessed on a sustainable close above 10,800,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


Understanding MACD
A close look at the chart of Sun Pharma shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

India faces a copper supply shock after a state government ordered billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. to shut down a plant permanently following deadly protests in a move that will slash nationwide output and stoke demand for imports. The company’s shares fell.

The Tamil Nadu government directed the southern state’s pollution control board to seal the 400,000 metric-ton-per-year smelter in Tuticorin in the interests of the people, it said on Monday. About 13 people died at the site last week after police opened fire as locals protested against alleged pollution.

The order to shut the smelter will reduce India’s production by about half, spurring imports as industrialization and increased consumption of cars and appliances fan demand. Vedanta had suspended output from the plant in March for maintenance, and the closure was extended as the protests mounted. The shutdown is an “unfortunate development,” and Vedanta will study the order before deciding on a course of action, the company said.

“If the closure is permanent, then what we expected to happen two years down the line will happen with immediate effect,” said Jayanta Roy, senior vice president at ICRA Ltd. In April, the local arm of Moody’s Investors Service had pegged India to flip to becoming a net importer by the next fiscal year.


Shares Sink
Vedanta shares lost as much as 6.2 percent to 237.90 rupees in Mumbai, the lowest since June. The stock has collapsed 24 percent this year, making it the worst performer among the top 10 metal companies in India. A closure of the plant would shave about $200 million to $250 million from Vedanta’s annual pre-tax earnings, according to an estimate from S&P Global Ratings.

Copper is used to make pipes and wires, and the Australian government forecast last year that India will require vastly more of the metal to feed its economy by 2035. Prices on the London Metal Exchange have rallied 22 percent over the past year, and were last at $6,882 a ton after paring an early drop.

India’s annual copper consumption is expected to almost triple to 2 million tons in the next decade, according to a projection from Hindalco Industries Ltd. Vedanta produced about 48 percent of the country’s total copper output of 842,961 tons in 2017-18, according to government data.

“So far our capacities were large enough for our total requirement, so we were a net exporter,” said Roy at ICRA Ltd. “Now, with no new capacities coming in and if almost 40 percent goes out on top of that, we will be in a deficit.”"

148,2018-05-30,Hindalco,"Get ready to pay more for your electrical products and pumpsets as prices and import of copper, a raw material used in making them, have gone up ever since the closure of Sterlite’s Tuticorin copper smelter on March 27 when the plant shut down for a 15-day scheduled maintenance turnaround. The state government issued a permanent closure order on May 28.

With the plant that has the capacity to produce 4 lakh tonnes of copper per year, and meets a third of the sales in the country, being shut, user industries such as makers of electrical cables, which have seen a sharp spike in imports, are planning to increase prices following the rise in input costs.

Salzer Electronics, which makes electrical cables and wires, had to nearly double its copper imports due to the closure of the plant. The company, which was importing 100 tonnes of copper per month, has increased it to about 180 tonnes per month in the past two months.

“We will have no choice but to increase prices of electrical cables and wires as copper is the main ingredient in these products,” said R Doraiswamy, managing director, Salzer Electronics. The company was buying about 250 tonnes of copper rods every month from Sterlite’s Tuticorin plant.



“We already have 7%-8% shortage of copper wires. The closure would result in a huge shortage of copper. This would lead to higher prices,” said a senior official in the pumpsets industry. “We will have to increase pumpset prices,” he said.

Since hitting a low of ₹425 per kg on March 27, copper prices have been on a steady uptrend. It is now ruling at around ₹465 per kg in the spot market. Prices hit a high of about ₹470 per kg on May 23. Prices are ruling above the 200-day moving average levels.

Though Salzer also buys copper from Birla Copper, a unit of Hindalco Industries, the company said it would not be able to source more locally. “We would not be able to get more copper locally as the demand is very high,” a senior Salzer official said.

If the domestic demand for copper grows at the current rate of about 7%- 8%, the market is likely to turn into a deficit in the next couple of years, ratings agency ICRA has estimated in an April 4 forecast, just days after the Sterlite unit was shut for scheduled maintenance. “The scope of increasing copper production in India is limited as the refiners are already running their plants at high capacity utilisation levels,” it said.

“Hence, with demand increasing at a healthy rate, India may turn into a net importer of copper by FY2020 (2019-20) if no new plant is commissioned in this period,” the agency said. Sterlite, which is a subsidiary of UK-based Vedanta Resources plc, owns one of the two custom copper smelters in India and, according to International Copper Association (India), had a 33% market share by sales volume in fiscal 2017, which ended on March 31, 2017. The other major custom copper smelter in India is operated by Hindalco Industries.

Consumer durable companies such as Bluestar and Godrej, however, see no immediate impact owing to the shutdown. B Thiagarajan, joint managing director, BlueStar, said the copper tubes used in their air conditioners are imported and hence, the shutdown would not have much impact.

The Nifty50 index opened with a gap down on Wednesday, but managed to hold its support of 10,550 and bounced to the 10,650 level. However, the index remained highly volatile during the session ahead of Thursday’s F&O expiry. The index formed a bullish candle on the daily scale and got stuck in the grip of option writers.

Now, it has to continue to hold above 10,550 to extend the gains towards 10,680 and then 10,725 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,550 level.

The Nifty50 is flattish on an expiry-to-expiry basis as the April series closed at 10,617 and it hovered near the same zone. The volume weighted average price or VWAP of the entire series and week was at 10,680 and that is likely to act as an immediate hurdle. Nifty remained volatile in a broader trading range between 10,418 and 10,929 levels, but option writers kept their grip on the market for most part of the series.

It has seen lower rollover compared with the average of last six months, while roll cost was very low comparatively, which suggests a neutral market stance for the foreseeable future.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was intact at 10,500 followed by 10,600, while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by 10,700. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,500 while significant call writing was seen at 10,600 then 10,550. Options data suggested a broader trading range between 10,550 and 10,700 levels.

India VIX moved up 2.16 per cent to 13.41 level.

Bank Nifty opened with a gap down but managed to hold its support in the 25,950-26,000 zone and rebounded to 26,400 level. It remained highly volatile throughout the session. It erased intraday losses and formed a Bullish Candle, which suggests the decline was bought into.

Bank Nifty has to hold above 26,250 to witness any upward move towards 26,500 and then 26,750 levels, while on declines, major support is seen near 26,100 and 26,000 levels.

Bank Nifty is up 5.27 per cent on expiry-to-expiry basis as the April series settled at 25,010. Bank Nifty outperformed the Nifty index significantly, on buying in HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank.

Bank Nifty is trading higher than its series VWAP of 26,000, while the weekly VWAP comes near the 26,500 level. The VWAPs are now likely to act as support and resistance for the index.

Nifty futures closed flat at 10,613. Long buildup was seen in Petronet, M&M Financial, Bharat Financial, PowerGrid, Tata Elxsi, Havells, M&M, Pidilite Industries and TVS Motor while shorts were seen in Shriram Transport Finance, Motherson Sumi, Tata Motor DVR, Ambuja Cement, Hindalco and Oil India.

5,2018-06-01,Hindalco,"KOLKATA: The permanent closure of Vedanta’s Tuticorin copper smelter will reduce the company’s scale and business diversity, adding pressure to its other businesses to maintain their strong performance and make up for decline in revenue, global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said.

However, Moody’s said it expects Vedanta's other businesses - zinc, aluminium and oil & gas - to deliver a solid performance in the fiscal year ending March 2019, boosted by strong commodity prices and higher production volumes. While shutdown of the smelter is “marginally credit negative,” it will have no immediate impact on Vedanta's ratings, the agency added in its latest report on Friday.

On 29 May, Vedanta Resources plc announced that it received an order from the government of Tamil Nadu to close the company’s copper smelter plant in Tuticorin with immediate effect. The project faced protests from the local population, which opposed the smelter expansion because of environmental concerns.

“We expect the company’s scale, as measured by revenue for fiscal 2018, to decline by 25% to $11.5 billion from $15.4 billion. Vedanta’s reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) will decline by 5% to $3.85 billion from $4.1 billion proforma for fiscal 2018,” Moody’s said.

Vedanta's copper operations have generated low profitability compared to other business segments since its operational and financial performance depends upon the availability and price of copper concentrates used to produce end products such as copper bars, rods and wires. Vedanta's EBITDA margin, excluding the margin dilutive copper operations in India, was 33% in fiscal 2018 against 26% reported for the consolidated operations including it, the report said.

Moody’s added the cancellation of Vedanta’s land rights towards the copper expansion is a key concern in view of the company's ability to restart copper smelting operations. Sipcot, the Tamil Nadu state industries promotion arm, cancelled the land allotment a day after the government order on the closure of the unit.

The ratings agency said it is yet unclear as to what extent the company will be compensated for the land acquired for the expansion. “Only 26% of the $717 million capital spending was incurred until March 2018, but the company’s ability to recoup the amount spent is likely to be difficult,” it added.

Vedanta has declared a 'force majeure' clause, such that it is not able to deliver its outstanding production volumes and is not able to purchase copper concentrate. Vedanta’s copper operations had a 33% market share in copper bars and rods by sales volume in fiscal 2017, according to International Copper Association (India).

The Tuticorin smelter is one of the two copper smelters in India, with the second operated by Hindalco Industries Ltd with an annual production capacity of 5,00,000 tonne. State owned Hindustan Copper, which has its own captive mines, also has smelting operations, though it is much smaller than the other two units. While Hindalco''s copper smelter is located in Bharuch, Gujarat, Hindustan Copper has a smelter in Ghatshila, Jharkhand."
4,2018-06-01,Hindalco,"CHENNAI: Copper consuming industries are switching to a combination of imports and increased sourcing from the other large private producer Hindalco after the closure of the Vedanta-Sterlite factory cut domestic production and raised concerns over future supply. 

Industrialists, however, confirm that there is no immediate supply crisis. 

The Vedanta-Sterlite smelter accounted for 48% of the country’s refined copper production in the last fiscal. It supplied 2.5 lakh tonnes of its annual output of 4 lakh tonnes to domestic manufacturers, who use the refined copper for applications in making electrical wires, cables, tubes, motors, transformers, automotive harnesses, and other engineering products.

Sterlite exports well over of a third of its total production, according to Vedanta-Sterlite’s CEO P Ramnath. The factory’s closure, he said, is expected to cause disruption among user industries in the market. “Ideally, we should have restarted the factory by mid-May had we obtained the necessary clearances from the government,” he told ET. 

Coimbatore-based Stark Industries, which sells nearly 2,000 alternating current electric motors every month, is finding the supply of copper wires getting delayed after the shutdown of the Sterlite plant. The company sources the wires from an intermediary who converts refined copper into wires after enamelling and insulation processes. 

“The supply is not streamlined as before,” said J Nithyanandam, managing partner at Stark. “The situation now is definitely not alarming; not a crisis. But, going forward, this may hit supplies. Prices of copper wires have gone up from Rs 520 a kg to Rs 550.”

Manufacturers who had sourced from Sterlite Copper say the closure has not had any material impact, so far. A global commodity, copper is usually sourced in India through a combination of domestic suppliers and imports, with Aditya Birla Group company Hindalco and Sterlite Copper being the two large producers in the country. 

“In place of two factories in India, we have only one. This simply means that we have to plan in advance to tap external sources in the interim,” said Milan M Mehta, managing director of Precision Wires, a Mumbai-based wire manufacturer with a capacity of 35,000 tonnes a year.

Mehta said Precision had switched to a combination of imports and increased supplies from Hindalco after copper from Sterlite stopped by end of March this year. “The panic sentiment whipped up in the market is untrue because copper can be sourced from other places.”

Analysts say Sterlite’s closure will turn India from a net exporter of copper to a net importer. According to Urvisha H Jagasheth, analyst at CARE Ratings, production of domestic refined copper in India is expected to see a 36% drop in FY19. India produced 843,000 metric tonnes in FY18 and this may fall to 540,000 metric tonnes in FY19 due to the Sterlite’s closure.

In a similar closure of the Sterlite plant ordered by the Madras High Court in 2013, Vedanta Resources had imported refined copper from its Dubai unit to offset the supply loss for its customers. Due to the supply crunch, average prices of copper rods had shot up during 2013.

However, India accounts for less than 10% of global copper production, according to commodity experts, and a change in copper prices is impacted more by global concerns. “The sudden change in domestic demand-supply equation is likely to lead to an increase in domestic spot prices in the near term, but ultimately domestic prices will track LME prices and INR-USD exchange rates,” said Jayanta Roy, group head-corporate ratings at ICRA."

7,2018-06-02,Hindalco,"The Ganga has for long been split in Kanpur, with the streams diverging near the Green Park cricket stadium and then reuniting under the Kanpur Ganga Bridge, before again separating to accommodate Majhara Pipar Ehatmali in Unnao District. This summer, the stream along the right bank of the river, adjacent to Kanpur, has no water. 

What flows, instead, is a dark discharge of effluents laden with organic waste, chromium and sulphide from the tanneries in Jajmau area. The discharge from a tannery drain flows past Bangali Ghat and the ruins of a fort, to meet the lefthand stream of the Ganga under the bridge. 


The air is heavy with the smell of hydrogen sulfide. Residents hope the monsoon will bring water back to the dry bank. However, just as Ganga seems to have given up on the city, Kanpur seems to have given up on its air and water.


The industrial city in Uttar Pradesh has been trying to solve its tannery discharge problem for the past 20 years, with little progress. Today, the discharge is considered to be as high as 50 million litres a day (mld). The state government’s common effluent treatment plant can deal with only 9 mld a day. On top of that, Kanpur is now infamous for having the most polluted air among global cities, according to a World Health Organization study released in May. Fourteen of the world’s 20 most polluted cities are in India, said the report.



The president of the top industry body in Kanpur, Merchants Chamber of Uttar Pradesh, BC Lahoti, says he finds it “very embarrassing” that Kanpur has topped the list of polluted cities. It should also be an embarrassment for India, which is set to host World Environment Day celebrations on June 5.

Kanpur is home to an Indian Institute of Technology that has a Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering on its campus. Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a former head of this centre and the current head of the civil engineering department, says he has never received a request from industry or the local administration for help to improve the environment. He is working on a couple of projects on air-pollution with multi-lateral funding.



Tripathi says there is little will in Kanpur to enforce environment norms. Rakesh Jaiswal, and his NGO Eco Friends, has been fighting for a cleaner Ganga since 1994. “Our campaigns seem to have no impact on either the people or the authorities.” Even the educated in Kanpur are not worried about the air quality, says activist Mahesh Pandey. Tripathi’s research shows 20% of polluting gases in the city’s air comes from industry, while 28% comes from power plants and diesel generator sets. Burning of domestic fuel contributes 46%.



Industrial pollution is the low-hanging fruit and should be targeted first, says Greenpeace campaigner Sunil Dahiya, who was involved in writing a recent report on pollution in north India. But Tripathi is not very sure it can be done, as many polluting units are small and often run from homes. These fuel the economy of small industries.

Kanpur is not the only place caught in the industry-environment conflict. The most recent has been the protests in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, against Sterlite’s plan to expand its copper smelter. On May 22, police opened fire to disperse protestors who, according to a first information report, had deadly weapons.

The firing killed 13. The plant had been closed many times in the past on complaints of sulphur di-oxide emissions. The firing and the uproar after that led the state government to order the permanent closure of the plant. Sterlite is an associate of the London-listed mining giant Vedanta.

If the polluter is big, the battle also becomes large. In 2016, Hindustan Unilever signed an agreement with ex-workers of its now closed thermometer factory in Tamil Nadu’s Kodaikanal making an ex-gratia payment to settle multiple law suits seeking compensation. The move came after rapper Sofia Ashraf released a video of a song, Kodaikanal Won’t, a year earlier that talked about mercury pollution due to the plant and the resultant illness among ex-workers. The video went viral. 

Responding to queries from ET Magazine, a Hindustan Unilever spokesperson says the company is committed to supporting its former employees and cleaning up its factory area and a small area which sits on the perimeter. 



“We believe that industry and environment go hand in hand. There should be stringent and clear rules. These rules must be followed rigorously. For the overall development of a particular region, industry plays a crucial role. Therefore, it is important to ensure that industry is allowed to operate uninterrupted within the parameters that have been set. Any concern raised by the stakeholders needs to be backed by scientific evidence and facts, and not hearsay.”



Vedanta was again at the receiving end of a green battle in February 2018, when the Supreme Court ordered that all iron ore mining in Goa be stopped. Vedanta was the largest miner in the state. The Goa Foundation, led by Claude Alvares, has been fighting the mining industry for a decade, demanding sustainable exploitation of resources. Vedanta’s iron ore operations in Goa, too, have been stopped on and off since 2012 due to environment concerns and licencing issues, like its copper smelter at Tuticorin.

The country is going through some kind of an “environmental emergency”, says lawyer MC Mehta, a veteran campaigner against polluting industries. Mehta, noted for his efforts to clean up the Ganga and preserve the Taj Mahal, is a winner of the Goldman Environmental Prize, the first winner from India. The award honours grassroots environment activists. It is also called the Green Nobel.



Mehta, a resident of Delhi, can count himself luckier than another Green Nobel winner, Ramesh Agarwal. The resident of Raigarh, Agarwal has had to battle bullets. In 2012, he was shot in his legs. The case has not seen a conviction. Agarwal has been highlighting the damage caused by coal mining in Raigarh area. His fight has been against all miners. In January, he wrote to the Prime Minister seeking his intervention to grant him an arms licence as he feared for his life. The district administration had refused him a permit because a first information report was lodged against him.

There is no love lost between industry and environmentalists in India. But no matter how difficult it is, a middle ground has to be found, for the sake of development and industrial growth. Industry always pays lip service to environment and sustainability.

How much of the commitment is honoured becomes clear only much later. By then, the unit concerned is often up and running. Satish Pai, managing director of Hindalco Ltd, says industry will have to go through a “mindset change” and a “behaviour change” to become sustainable. 

“We all need to act together.” Pai says he came to Hindalco, an Aditya Birla Group company that operates 17 mines across the country, after spending almost 28 years in the oil industry. He claims to have seen the wild side of industry, having worked in Nigeria and Azerbaijan. “If you do not take care of sustainability and environment, industry will not have the licence to operate.”

Pai also stresses on the crucial role industry plays in development. Only mining will bring industry and employment to the Indian hinterland. Therefore, exploitation of mineral resources has to be allowed. But the mining industry must ensure that the area concerned continues to prosper even after minerals have been extracted and the company has stopped working in the area, he adds.

Jindal Power and Steel also says a balance has to be maintained. “Environment protection is among the topmost factors and strict compliance to the stringent environment norms is paramount, while ushering in socio-economic growth,” a spokesperson adds.



Activist Mehta says the middle path is not so difficult to find. Just follow the rules. “Coexistence is possible only if there is compliance with laws. India has the best environment laws.” What is the point of celebrating Environment Day on one day, Mehta asks. “We must work for it every day.”

What has added to the complex debate is the role played by governments and the political leadership, and the habit of being politically expedient — supporting industry at times and activists at other times, instead of just upholding the law.

Veteran environmentalist and editor of Sanctuary Asia magazine in India Bittu Sahgal says: “The system has been creatively tweaked so that up and down the chain money sluices project clearances.” He points out that in his experience of sitting on government panels for clearances of projects or deciding on important issues, he has almost always found the uncompromising expert or scientist pitted against a pliant majority, left to filing a dissent note, which would sometimes not even be placed on record.

Since 2014, the government has taken it upon itself to ease the environment clearances regime. The government went after non-government organisations (NGOs), asking them to follow norms and file their returns. There was also a squeeze on foreign funding to several NGOs. In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report last year had criticised the Centre for not following the norms on granting environment clearances to more than 200 projects.



ET Magazine spoke to three senior officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, but none of them wanted to be identified. They argued that environment clearances have been granted faster in the past couple of years largely due to computerisation of the process, which started in July 2014. Empowering the ministry’s regional panels and delegating certain powers to district-level authorities for minor minerals such as sand mining also eased clearance procedures. 

There has been a sense of urgency in the clearance process because of India’s aspiration to improve its ranking in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business. India moved up 30 slots to reach 100 (of 190 nations) in the annual ranking announced in October 2017.

However, officials insisted, faster clearances do not mean leniency. “All processes are duly followed. Domain experts, mostly retired scientists in our expert panels, ultimately have to say yes for a proposal to be cleared,” says an official.

Anshul Dhiman, deputy director of industries in the government of Himachal Pradesh, says while some issues are genuine, some are manufactured by people with vested interests. The administration has to be alert to preempt protests at an early stage, says Dhiman, who oversaw the Baddi industrial town between 2012 and 2015.

One Union environment ministry official says: “It’s incumbent on us to find out whether the concerns flagged by any section are genuine or not. At times, we find a handful of people with grudges teaming up against an industry and fomenting protests so that the industry is denied clearance. In that case, the environmental concern is a mere excuse.” Industry spokespersons, while talking off the record, are seen eager to paint activists as extortionists.



But that does not take the onus away from industry to ensure it is on the right side of the law. Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry, says: “The question of striking a balance between business and environment is increasingly irrelevant... In fact , good quality environmental ecosystem is becoming a source of comparative advantage for many industries or sectors of any economy. We have cleared the period of debate on industry and environment. We are in the phase of mainstreaming and scaling up mutual dependency between industry and environment.”

Omkar Goswami , economist and chairman of CERG Advisory, says: “Resolving these conflicts require consistent dialogues b a c ked by major environment preserving investments and significant tax treatments. Such issues have never been solved quickly. But they must be solved, as they have been over time in the US, Canada and western Europe. I hope that the central and state governments will seriously put their heads together to solve this major problem, instead of blaming each other and doing little else.”



Industry vs Environment: The Flash points

TUTICORIN: Expansion plans of Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper smelter led to protests. Police opened fire, killing 13


KODAIKANAL: In 2015, singer Sofia Ashraf released a rap video titled Kodaikanal Won’t that highlighted mercury pollution in Kodaikanal because of a HUL plant. It went viral. In 2016, HUL signed an agreement to provide for the well-being of its former employees at the thermometer factory in the hill town. Months after the HUL pact, Ashraf released another video rebutting the company’s claims, which again went viral


GOA: Vedanta, along with other local miners, had a face-off with activists led by the Goa Foundation for over a decade. It had led to a mining ban in 2012. This was revoked by the state but the Supreme Court stopped all mining here in 2018


RAIGARH: Green Nobel (Goldman prize) winner Ramesh Agarwal and his organisation, Jan Chetna, have been battling several miners for much of the past 10 years. In 2012, Agarwal was shot in his legs. Earlier this year, he wrote to the Prime Minister seeking an arms licence as his application was not approved by local authorities


MUNDRA: Greenpeace and Adani Group have been at loggerheads for some time. The environment group had brought out a report in March 2014 detailing violations by the group. The allegations were not just against the Mundra project but also against those at other places in India


DABHOL: The naphtha-based mega power project from now-defunct Enron Corporation is situated around 100 km from Mumbai. It saw a lot of protests due to environmental concerns. The protests led to arrests and other police action, and further scrutiny by human rights organisations


BHOPAL: The Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984 is often a reminder of what kind of devastation an industrial unit can cause. After Union Carbide was bought by Dow Chemicals, the new company has become a regular target of protesters demanding that it pay up for the sins of Union Carbide"
6,2018-06-02,Hindalco,"KOLKATA/MUMBAI: The US decision to impose a tariff of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU, revoking the temporary exemption, is likely to impact metal stocks like JSW Steel, JSPL, Tata Steel, Hindalco which have exposure to export markets in the US and Europe.

“We believe that there would be short-term pressure on metal stocks due to uncertainty around material flow (particularly steel) and retaliatory measures by the affected regions,” Edelweiss Research said in its latest report.

The report said steel is more vulnerable than aluminium as concerns persist on around 18 million tonne (mt) of imports by the US (almost the entire incremental global demand) getting diverted elsewhere.

“This is likely to reduce export attractiveness of Indian steel companies, particularly JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) that might have to compete against the material diverted from the US,” Edelweiss Research analyst Amit A Dixit said in the report. While JSW Steel and JSPL, for which exports comprise almost 20 per cent of sales volume, might see pressure on pricing and volume, Tata Steel might also see pressure in its European operations to the extent of US exports, he added.

Among aluminium companies, Edelweiss said it believes Hindalco would be able to pass on the price hikes, while Vedanta should also be able to maintain its export sales given that the trade flow disruption is expected to be lower in case of aluminium.

The issue of safeguarding steel exports to the US by Tata Steel’s unit in the Netherlands amid Washington’s decision to impose tariff on this sector in Europe was discussed during a recent meeting between Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi in a bid to protect mutual interest."

17,2018-06-06,Hindalco,"KOLKATA: State-owned Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) is gearing up to cater to domestic copper demand following the shutdown of Vedanta’s copper smelter at Tuticorin by exploring the full extent of its smelting capacity.

HCL hopes to realise its entire primary smelting capacity in the July-September 2018 quarter, following renovation of its 20,000 tonne per annum (tpa) smelter at Ghatshila by June 15, company executives said.

In the second quarter of this financial year HCL will also have the option of using its entire secondary smelting capacity of 50,000 tpa at the Gujarat Copper Project. With this, its smelting capacity is expected to be 50% higher than that a year ago.

“The unfortunate incident will have an impact on the domestic market for refined copper. We want to come strongly into the market. We can sell whatever we are able to produce. We will ramp up smelter capacity though our focus remains on mining capacity,” said HCL chairman Santosh Sharma.

The closure of Vedanta’s copper smelter came after the death of 13 people in police firing on locals protesting against alleged pollution from the plant.

A recent report by credit rating agency Moody’s said: “Vedanta’s copper operations had a 33% market share in copper bars and rods by sales volume in fiscal 2017, according to International Copper Association (India).”

HCL, a relatively smaller player, is also poised to seize the opportunity to increase its market share. Its product line consists of metal-in-concentrate (MIC), copper cathode and wire rods. Sharma said while the company’s strategy is being attuned to attain flexibility of approach, prevalent market conditions will determine whether the company decides to sell refined copper or MIC.

So far, the company has been able to utilise only about 30% of its secondary smelting capacity. HCL’s name plate smelter capacity is around one lakh tpa (ltpa), though it can at best achieve 70,000 tpa since one of its smelters at Khetri remains redundant since December 2008. The state-owned copper producer has also sought the mines ministry’s nod to add greenfield smelting capacity. However, Sharma did not disclose the details of the project since it is pending approval.

Vedanta and Hindalco are the two big players in the domestic copper market, each importing around 4 ltpa and also exporting. The domestic demand is around 6 ltpa, with traders’ imports of refined copper estimated to be 2 ltpa. In Vedanta’s absence, the industry estimates the shortage to be minimised, if a portion of exports is used to cater to domestic demand.

HCL is creating new units independent of the London Metal Exchange and delinked from the vagaries of the copper market. These include a Rs 200-crore copper ore tailing project at Malanjkhand, Madhya Pradesh, due to be commissioned in July 2018. The 3.3 mtpa venture will process nearly 100 mt of ore tailings, earlier considered as waste, to yield gold, silver and copper. “This is expected to directly add Rs 60 crore to the company’s bottom line every year,” Sharma said. A similar project is being planned in Khetri, Rajasthan too.

The company also plans to monetise waste rock– the granite-like ore burden removed during extraction of copper ore. It is in talks with the Indian Railways and the surface transport ministry for supplying waste rock for use as railway ballast and in road construction. This ‘wealth from waste’ project is likely to bring in good margins of nearly Rs 50 crore per annum without any additional expenditure. Besides, HCL has received approval from the mines ministry for operating as an independent exploration company."

24,2018-06-07,Hindalco,"The equity market had a relatively stable and strong session on Thursday despite the NSE benchmark Nifty coming off nearly 50 points from the high point of the day. The index finally settled 83.70 points or 0.78 per cent lower.

Though gains were observed across board, the stocks and sectors, which received a good beating in the previous few sessions, saw some value buying from the lower levels.

From the structure on the charts, the upmove is likely to continuing on Friday as well. A modestly positive start can be expected, but in the same breath, the zone of 10,820-10,845 will offer resistance at higher levels. At these levels, we see market taking a breather and entering into some fresh consolidation before any decisive move.

Friday will see the levels of 10,820 and 10,850 acting as potential resistance zone. Supports may come in at 10,735 and 10,680 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 58.3524. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish, but it does not show any divergence against the price. The daily MACD has reported a positive crossover and is now bullish while trading above its signal line. On the candles, a ‘Rising Window’ occurred. It is essentially a gap, which implies continuation of the upmove.

Pattern analysis suggests that the market has got some steam left. However, these upmoves will find resistance in the 10,820-10,850 zones as this happens to be a major pattern area resistance for Nifty.

Overall, the momentum may persist in the market, and we may still continue to see the dips, if any, being used to make quality purchases. However, in the pursuit of momentum, the zones of 10,820-10,850 are expected to offer formidable pattern resistance to the market.

We recommend continuing making fresh purchases with each opportunity that volatility offers, but at the same time, profit needs to be vigilantly protected at higher levels, as the possibilities of some volatility and profit taking cannot be ruled out if the Nifty tests 10,820-10,850 zones.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were seen being added in SAIL, Vedanta, CG POWER, Bank Of Baroda, ICICI Bank, Power Grid, Axis Bank, YES Bank, UBL, Reliance, Tata Motors, Hindalco and ITC.

30,2018-06-08,Hindalco,"Chakri Lokapriya, CIO and MD, TCG AMC, tells ET Now that the focus is on large, well-run companies with visible earnings growth in the midcap space.Edited excerpts:

The big news this morning is the fact that after nearly three decades, the truck axle load factors are going to be up to 20-25%. How big a positive could this turn out to be for logistics?
More than logistics, the usual fleet operators, Shriram Transport type of companies will benefit. Second, there us still room for Ashok Leylands of the world to benefit. The company is well positioned. These are the companies that I would focus more on because the logistics companies have slightly different issues facing them as well. 


What about commodities? Copper and aluminium are touching multi-month highs once again. If the commodities trade intact, can somebody look at buying Tata Steel or Hindalco even at these levels?
 The latest data coming out says US is at full employment levels, which is a phenomenal thing to do and the economy is really strong. Very robust numbers are coming out. Europe is also doing fine. There has been some noise in the last couple of weeks about Italy, but the developed countries are doing well and in this environment, metals companies do well. 

Some of the metal companies have corrected recently. The frontline players like Tata Steel and Hindalco would do far better than some of the smaller companies or the government owned metal companies.


You have been tracking real estate for a while. After a great run last year, some of these stocks have paused of late. Is it time to take a relook and would Prestige be on your radar at all?
Real estate stocks are well positioned because there are pockets of regional players like Prestige in the south or maybe Godrej in the west. These are the companies which are going to benefit because of RERA. Again, the smaller players are finding it tough while the larger players are gaining share. 

Second, given how the economy has evolved in the last couple of years, there is a huge amount of unsold inventory of real estate still out there and now it is being priced out. So, against this backdrop, that is beginning to being reflected in the valuations. So, RERA gaining market share and selling down of inventory will help the bigger regional real estate players.


PSU banks led by SBI are going to be meeting with the interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal today. Do you expect something substantial?
I hope a resolution of how they are going to treat loans to the power sector comes out of this meeting. If they try to follow the RBI classification of February 12th of one day delay, it becomes an NPA then that is really going to help. I would focus on some kind of clarification by the RBI relaxation on NPA norms for power sector loans. 

Of course, capital raising is a bigger issue for the banks but I doubt further capital infusion is going to happen in the immediate future, other than what has already been announced by former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.


How are you looking at your investment in the financial space? NBFCs have delivered an excellent set of numbers, but they are expensive. The consolidation of PSU banks is under way and private banks are a bit of a differentiated trade?
 We are underweight on financial services overall as a space. Within that, we are looking at selective NBFCs like Magma Fincorp. It is an inexpensive stock, trades at 1.5 times book, benefits from commercial vehicle loans and benefits from small ticket loans.

The company has gone through a huge amount of restructuring. A new management is in place delivering on earnings in Shriram Transport. On the other hand, we are staying away from some of these corporate private banks and among the PSU banks, we will still have to stick to the larger ones because the government is talking about the larger banks buying out or JVs absorbing the smaller banks. We are sticking to the SBIs of the world.


We are sitting at Rs 67.51 against the dollar. Will the currency tailwind benefit the IT pack for some more time to come? 
Yes, IT as a sector will continue to benefit: a) because of the demand in developed markets and b), the currency is a tailwind. Companies like HCL Technologies, in particular, has corrected quite a lot in the last couple of weeks. Many other stocks like Tata Elxsi, TCS are looking attractive in the IT sector. We would continue to be buyers of IT as a pack.


It looks like the move in the last two days both for the benchmarks as well as the broader markets was rather a feeble one. Do you continue to keep a close eye on midcaps that have fallen quite a bit or do you wait because it does not appear to have settled down yet?
We would look at midcaps because even SEBI has now changed the definition of midcaps and any company which is less than Rs 30,000 crore is supposed to be a mid-cap. That means these are very large companies. We are looking for midcap or largecap companies with visible demonstrated earnings growth potential for next two years. There are a number of companies like that. For example, Phillips Carbon which supplies raw material to the metal space, has corrected a lot, but is still at an extremely attractive valuation. 

There are tons of large, well run companies with visible earnings growth, which we would focus on within the midcap space."

35,2018-06-08,Hindalco,"On May 29, Vedanta announced that it received an order from the Tamil Nadu government to close the company’s 4 lakh tonne per annum (ltpa) copper smelter plant in Tuticorin with immediate effect. The project faced protests from the local population opposing the smelter expansion because of environmental concerns, leading to a loss of 13 lives in police firing.

It is ironic that in the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt, ‘ankh’, the symbol for copper, was believed to represent life. The abrupt decision threatens to stall almost half of the country’s copper output since Vedanta had a 48% share of the 842,961 tonnes of the metal produced in India in 2017-18. This is slated to have a significant impact on the domestic copper market in the medium to long term.

According to International Copper Association (India), Vedanta had a 33% market share in copper bars and rods in fiscal 2017. Tuticorin smelter is one of the two copper smelters in India, with the second one being operated by Hindalco Industries Ltd with an annual production capacity of 5 ltpa. State owned Hindustan Copper (HCL), the only producer with captive mines, also has smelting operations, though it is much smaller than the other two units.


PRICE IMPACT
With Vedanta accounting for a third of the country’s copper supplies, the shutdown will drive up copper prices at a time when domestic copper demand is showing a firm uptick. India’s copper consumption has been growing at an average annual rate of 5.9% in the last 10 years led by electrical and transport sector needs. 

The government’s thrust on electric vehicles is also slated to boost copper demand in the next 5-10 years. Prices did react, almost immediately. A day after the closure, it was reflected in an increase in copper futures price on MCX, the country’s largest commodity exchange, which coincided with a depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar, amplifying the magnitude.

While 3-month rolling forward copper on London Metal Exchange (LME) was flat at $6856 a tonne, the near-month contract on MCX traded up 1% at Rs 464 a kilo. Analysts remained divided on the reason behind the differential in MCX and LME prices. It was believed to be an indication of the markets beginning to factor in supply pressure from the closure of the Tuticorin plant.

While the immediate supply crisis in the near to medium term can be averted, analysts are worried about the longer-term impact on the copper market. “It looks like this could take 3-6 months to get resolved. Ahead of the general elections, the plant’s problems have become a political issue,” Kishor Ostwal, chairman CNI Research said.


DOWNSTREAM IMPACT
n the medium term, it will affect over 800 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the downstream electricals industry sector that the Vedanta smelter catered to. It is also a major supplier of copper to the country’s defence sector and to infra, cement and fertilisers sectors. While it could lead to copper imports, the shutdown will also hurt India’s copper exports, as 1.6-2 lt of the production is sold internationally. 

The move to shut down the Tuticorin facility may also push up global copper prices to an extent, analysts said. At current price of $6865 per tonne, the import of 240,000 tonne of copper (net of export) will cost the nation an additional $2 billion per annum. 

“Since Vedanta Sterlite is one of the largest copper producers in the country, manufacturers in sectors ranging from electrical to defence will have to turn to imports and that will push up the nation’s annual import bill by an estimated $2 billion based on the current price,” P Ramnath, CEO, Sterlite Copper said. Vedanta currently holds a 36% market share in India’s refined copper demand. In its latest report, global ratings agency Moody’s said the shutdown will reduce Vedanta’s scale and business diversity, with fiscal 2018 revenues likely to shrink by 25% to $11.5 billion from $15.4 billion.


SUPPLY IMPACT
Between them, Hindalco and Ved anta have 9 ltpa capacity and while state-owned Hindustan Copper Ltd or HCL has a nameplate capacity of one ltpa, it can at best produce 70,000 tpa. India’s demand for refined copper is estimated at around 6.75 to 7 ltpa. That leaves a surplus of around 2 ltpa, which constitute exports. HCL chairman Santosh Sharma said this week the company will take all possible steps to explore its full smelting potential. 

Its primary 20,000 tpa smelter at Ghatshila in Jharkhand will be up and operational by June 15 after renovation. It is also stretching itself to realize the full smelter capacity of 50,000 tpa at its Gujarat Copper Project. Since June and July see seasonally low demand, the real impact is likely to be felt only from the Oct-Dec 2018 quarter. And, if a part of the exports is diverted the shortfall due to Vedanta closure can be addressed, industry watchers pointed out. This is what Hindalco, which has just commissioned a new 2.4 ltpa rod mill, seems to be doing.

“We set this up to cater to the rising demand for more volumes of rods in the Indian market. As a consequence, export commitments for this year in any case were on the lower side. In the current situation, with a slight downward adjustment in export shipments, Hindalco is trying to cater to the domestic demand,” it said in a statement. With copper sales up by 8% in FY18 to 408KT, Hindalco’s new cast copper rod plant commissioned in Q4 nearly doubled its capacity of CCR to 4.84 ltpa in Gujarat. CCRs used in agrochemicals, automobiles, consumer durables, electrical equipment, railways, wire and cable industry have been witnessing a supply demand gap in the domestic market."

70,2018-06-19,Hindalco,"Kotak Institutional Equities has a buy call on Hindalco Industries Ltd. with a target price of Rs 315. The current market price of Hindalco Industries Ltd. is Rs 231.2. Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Hindalco Industries Ltd. price can reach defined target. . Hindalco Industries Ltd., incorporated in 1958, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 51905.60 crore. 


Investment rationale by Kotak

We expect Hindalco to benefit from multiple earnings tailwinds across businesses as (1) aluminum recycling spreads have improved to multi-year highs in the US, (2) BRL/US$ rate has weakened sharply—both of these can act as strong triggers for Novelis. In India, higher aluminum prices (partially hedged), improved copper premiums and weaker INR/US$ will aid earnings. Over the long term, we remain positive on the aluminum price outlook due to continued deficit outside China and fast declining inventories. The soon-to-be published policy by China on captive coal fired plants can lift costs and prices. We maintain BUY with a target price of Rs 315."
72,2018-06-20,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: The highly-leveraged balance sheets of Indian companies, which caused concern among investors and deterred fresh capital infusion over the past few years, are gradually showing signs of recovery. The net debt of India Inc relative to the operating profit before depreciation (net debt/EBITDA ratio) was at a four year low in FY18.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s analysis of the BSE500 companies excluding banks, finance and software companies, net Debt-EBIDTA ratio fell to 2.5 in FY18 from 3.3 in FY15. This was largely due to higher increase in the EBITDA compared with the increase in debt.

The ratio of net debt (total debt less cash and equivalents) and EBITDA is widely used to measure the debt paying ability of a company. A ratio below three is considered healthy. The total debt of the sample increased 8 per cent to Rs 20.2 lakh crore. During the same period, EBITDA increased by 35 per cent to Rs 8.04 lakh crore.

The deleveraging was mainly driven by the improved earnings of the commodity companies, thanks to the reversal in the global commodity prices. This is also expected to revive the capex cycle.

The net debt-EBITDA ratio of the BSE500 metals and mining companies in FY18 was less than one compared with 3.7 in FY16. Thanks to improved earnings, all major metal and mining companies including Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel and Hindalco have given a strong capex guidance (including expansion through acquisitions) over the last one year. These companies together are expected to incur capex of over Rs 70,000 crore in FY19.

Similar trends are observed in other heavily-indebted industries such as real estate where the ratio fell to 4.6 from 6.2 three years ago; for textiles, the ratio dropped to 2.6 from 2.9 and for the power companies, it was marginally down to five from 5.4 by a similar comparison.

The only sector which has seen increased debt concerns is the telecom sector. Major contributors to this include Reliance communications followed by Idea."

80,2018-06-22,Hindalco,"CHENNAI: Appearing for the state government in the hearing of a batch of petitions regarding the Vedanta-Sterliet factory in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu Advocate General Vijay Narayan submitted with the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that the Government Order permanently shuttering the corporate copper smelter in Thoothukudi was a reflection of a ""policy decision"" to shut down the factory. 

""The policy decision was taken at the highest-level in government, by none other than the Honourable Chief Minister,"" advocate General Narayan confirmed with ET as his submission with the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Friday. 

The advocate General's submissions today arrive after the Bench comprising judge CTSelvam and judge AM Basheer Ahmed had asked the government if the Government Order permanently closing the factory had been backed by a policy decision. With the Advocate General's submissions today, the court disposed of a writ petition by MDMK chief Vaiko against the Environment Clearance given to the second phase of expansion to the smelter to raise capacity to 8 lakh tonnes a year. 

Since April 9 this year, the state government headed by Edappadi K Palaniswami had executed a series of measures against Vedanta-Sterlite, beginning with refusal to grant the Consent to Operate licence for the period 2018-2023 on grounds of non-fulfilment of conditions on pollution control and environment impact mitigations. After the police firing that killed 13 people in the protests against the factory on May 22, the state pollution control board had issued a closure order after it found the factoy had undetaken measures to restart the unit. On May 28, the state government, through a GO, had permanently closed the factory. The state land bank monitor SIPCOT had subsequently withdrawn the land allotted for the second smelter. As another blow, the state informed by way of reply to an activist that it had also withdrawn the Consent To Establish, an important licence to start a factory, for the second unit. 

The Vedanta-Sterlite unit has been shut since March 27 this year. Its CEO P Ramnath had told ET in an earlier interview that the factory should have restarted after its scheduled annual maintenance mid-May. The Sterlite factory is a key copper supplier for the state besides Aditya Birla Group's Hindalco and the Government-owned Hindustan Copper."

78,2018-06-22,Hindalco,"Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor talks to ET Now about his favourites in auto, pharma, OMCs and commodity sectors.Edited excerpts:


Does Tata Motors seem to be the haziest story in the auto pack right now?
Yes and it is not that the street is just discovering that now! Tata Motors has been a rank underperformer compared to Nifty as well as other auto stocks in the last three years. That stock has either not given returns or has been in the negative in last 12 to 18 months.
We can see a change in growth trajectory in Bajaj Auto and some of the other companies but in Tata Motors, the uncertainty on growth continues. More than 80% of earnings come from the JLR but a big question remains on how sustainable the growth is for JLR in China, Europe or US. The tariffs war development may be a couple of months old, but the Tata Motors growth disappointment or underperformance has been going on for at least 8 to 10 quarters now.


Among auto stocks, which would be your top bet? Please do not say Maruti.
Among auto stocks, in terms of two-wheeler companies Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto are the preferred bets . Otherwise, Maruti is a high conviction bet on declines. It has been on a slight downtrend where according to technical analysts, the supports lie. Fundamentally, in terms of valuations at about 80 times one year forward and about 16% to 18% growth being sustained for the next at least two-three years led by volumes, led by new product and variant launches, Maruti is a terrific story going ahead.


OMCs were highlighted in trade yesterday. They have had a rough patch in the last six months. A good 25% to 30% odd correction has already played out in OMCs for the last quarter or so. Is there merit in nibbling into OMCs?
OMCs had a dream run between 2015 and 2016-17 on back of low oil prices and lower underrecoveries/subsidy contributions. We are back to the scenario of five years ago with high crude prices and under recoveries and oil PSUs taking that additional burden because the consumer prices cannot be raised in line with crude prices. That is one side of the story. I would be neutral to negative on as far as the oil OMCs -- IOC, HP, BP -- are concerned. 

In HPCL, there is an additional complication of a merger with ONGC going through. That is going to cause some sort of disturbance in the stock price as well.


How are you placing yourself in pharma?

Vivek Mavani: I will break up pharma into three parts. Fortunately, all the three parts of pharma seem to be firing as far as the growth is concerned. If we look at the Indian pharma focussed on exports, they have had a rough run over the last two-three years on back of regulatory and USFDA and quality issues.

The Halol unit of Sun Pharma getting certified a few days back is a huge shot in arm and a huge trigger on the export side. Domestic pharma has continued to consistently deliver earnings growth quarter of 15% odd, quarter after quarter, year after year.

Cipla is a very interesting bet really. Among the midcaps, Cipla has no regulatory issues and a consistent growth story. Alkem and Ajanta Pharma are again interesting domestic consumption plays. 

The third leg which has been a rank underperformer over the last 12-13 years have been the multinational pharma companies. They seem to be coming back very strongly. Glaxo or AstraZeneca were forgotten names. I am sure an entire generation of young traders and investors probably have never even looked at some of these companies which were darlings of the markets may be 15 to 25 years ago. That segment seems to be coming back in a major way and I see lot of opportunities in multinational pharma as well.


Do you have a call on Rites or Fine Organics?
I have not really looked at Fine Organics. But the other IPO which is closing today, Rites is quite an interesting play. It is a consultancy business, asset light, with high return on capital, return on equity and generates free cash flows. It is also a debt-free company in the infrastructure consulting space. Major part of work is coming from railways and capex is being planned out over the next 5-10 years. Rites could be sustainable. It has a steady earnings growth story with the hefty payouts for investors going forward. Valuation too is also not very demanding. Rites is something worth investing in both in the IPO and on listing and the oversubscription numbers at the end of second day itself speaks about it.


Coming on the commodities basket, is there still merit in looking at a Hindalco, Tata Steel as well as Vedanta at these levels?
Commodities are an interesting sector. The China factor seems to be coming back but for a different reason. In commodities, I am not so bullish on Tata Steel or Hindalco but some of the other names like Jindal Steel and Power, which has a huge deleveraging story over the next two-three years. The gross debt would come down by almost Rs 15,000 crore from about Rs 42,000 crore of peak debt in 2017.

In the next 18 months or so, the gross number should be around Rs 28,000-29,000 crore and driven by higher volumes which would jump from about 3.5 million tonnes to about 6 million tonnes by 2020. On back of higher prices, higher volumes, higher prices and a meaningful debt reduction, JSPL looks a better bet than Tata Steel. 

In the non-steel category, Hindustan Zinc looks attractive because zinc prices are still at elevated levels and Hindustan Zinc is quite an interesting bet with free cash flows, tonnes of surplus cash sitting on the balance sheet and expected hefty dividend payouts.

When the Government of India will divest the 26% stake nobody knows but assuming that does not happen in the near future, just the earnings growth and dividend payouts are enough triggers for me."

104,2018-06-30,Hindalco,"MUMBAI/KOLKATA: Beleaguered IDBI Bank getting ₹9,000 crore in equity investment from Life Insurance Corp of India may be a lifeline for the lender, but to regain its past glory it requires a new vision and strategy from B Sriram who has taken over as its new chief executive.

For a bank that is stuck with more than a quarter of loans as bad loans and not much of a retail presence, a new strategy on how to ride the digital revolution and changed corporate loans landscape are the much needed solutions.

“The speed with which it got done is remarkable,” said Ashvin Parekh an independent industry analyst and a former consultant at EY.

“Between policyholders and shareholders of IDBI Bank, nobody should benefit at the cost of the other. There is no proposal as how LIC will bring the bank out of the rut. There will be constraints. When it will come to technicalities related to banking, we have to see whether they have the bandwidth.”

Capital alone is not enough for IDBI Bank. In the past decade, IDBI Bank has received capital from the government to the tune of ₹22,884 crore, data from ICRA shows. Even last fiscal it received ₹12,471 crore in capital IDBI Bank transformed into a universal lender from having been a term lending institution specialising in project funding in the pre-liberalisation era when the country faced enormous capital deficiency. Even as it changed its stripes, it was unable to cope with the challenges and competition.

IDBI Bank’s stressed assets from the state, far higher than any other bank. If the past capital investments did not help it much, it is doubtful whether LIC’s investment alone can bring the bank out of the slump.

“If the bank recovery happens in the next 4-6 quarters, then policyholders will benefit, else the money is going down the drain. LIC will have to provide more capital in the next few quarters,” said Parekh.

IDBI's stressed assets are at 27.95% of total, the highest among all banks. Its capital adequacy is at 10.70%. It hasn’t made a profit in the past three fiscal years.

“LIC will now have higher representation in IDBI board. So, there will be fresh thinking which should help IDBI in the long run. This is the first step by the government in reviving state-owned banks,” said Sanjeev Jain, an analyst with Ashika Stock Broking. “Shareholders should see IDBI Bank as a longterm bet.”

While its immediate rival ICICI managed to become a fullfledged retail bank under the stewardship of KV Kamath, the continued government ownership and diktat from New Delhi restricted the activities of IDBI Bank.

But given its precarious financial position, it would be a tall order for it to cut cheques for thousands of crores for single project and sit pretty. With most banks switching out of project lending, the glory days of IDBI Bank may be behind.

Also, big companies such as Reliance Industries and Hindalco Industries are shifting their funding profile with them accessing the bond markets more often which give them better pricing than a bank loan.

So, IDBI Bank faces challenge in its traditional stronghold as well."

11,2018-07-04,Hindalco,"Utkal Alumina International, a fully-owned subsidiary of Hindalco, today said it will complete the 500-kilotonne expansion, involving a capital outlay of Rs 1,300 crore, over the next 30 months. 

""Our Utkal plant remains the most efficient producer of alumina globally and continues to provide strong support to our upstream aluminium business. The Rs 1,300-crore capacity expansion by 500 kt has already began and is expected to be over in the next 30 months,"" Hindalco managing director Satish Pai told reporters here this evening. 

He further said the company is completing the expansion plan fast as it thinks the worldwide third-party alumina market will remain tight. 

In FY2018, the company had achieved record production at 1,291-kt with alumina (including from Utkal) at 2,881 kt. 

Commenting on the expansion in the domestic market, Pai said, ""we will wait for some more time because we still need to be little bit careful about coal availability and coal prices going forward. 

""If more coal mines become productive, and supply becomes adequate, we will certainly think of doing a brownfield expansion at Aditya or Mahan."" 

Arguing that recent import duty hike by the US may see huge amounts of Chinese aluminium scraps being dumped to the country, he said Hindalco has asked the government to curb cheap imports. 

Pai said during the past two months, aluminium imports have increased in double-digits. 

The Aluminium Industry Association has already approached government to avert a steel-industry like situation, when supply from China threatened the viability of local manufacturing a few years ago, he said. 

Intense lobbying by steel companies prompted government to resort to several measures ranging from higher duties to import price controls to curb imports last year, he pointed out."

18,2018-07-10,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Metal and mining stocks rallied on Monday as copper prices surged in global commodity markets. Riding on the rally, the BSE Metal index gained 1.3 per cent, compared with just 0.8 per cent gain of Sensex.

But stock performance of metal companies is expected to remain muted despite attractive valuations, given the twin overhang of trade brawls and a strengthening dollar, said analysts.

Shares of Vedanta gained 3.14 per cent while Jindal Steel and Hindustan Zinc rose 2.5 per cent each. National Aluminium, SAIL, JSW Steel and Hindalco gained between 1 per cent and 2 per cent on Monday.



Copper prices bounced back strongly on Monday after crashing nearly $1,000 a metric tonne since touching a four-year high on June 7 due to an escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the US and China.

Analysts believe that ferrous companies are on a stronger wicket on the earnings front led by a favourable domestic supplydemand balance, but they still anticipate headwinds due to the trade wars and a strong greenback.

“Valuations of metal stocks are likely to remain under pressure, given the twin overhang of trade brawls and a strengthening USD index,” said Amit Dixit, analyst, Edelweiss Securities.

“We expect ferrous companies to outpace non-ferrous players on earnings growth for the first time in nine quarters as global steel spreads remain at a record high, and domestic steel consumption in April-May grew 8.5 per cent YoY though India became a net importer for the first time since December 2016,” he said.

The BSE Metal index has grossly underperformed so far this year with a negative return of 15 per cent, compared with Sensex’s 6 per cent gain. Non-ferrous companies faced headwinds on the cost front, particularly coal, crude derivatives and alumina, whereas price growth in base metals showed signs of flattening out.

However, favourable steel prices in both domestic and international markets have resulted in an improvement in profitability for steel players, said analysts.

“Given the ongoing insolvency resolution process of five steel companies which are likely to result in substantial haircuts for lenders, debt levels of the steel industry are expected to decline in FY2019, which coupled with better operating cash flows, is expected to result in an improvement in coverage ratios for the industry in FY 2019 and FY 2020,” said Jayanta Roy, analyst, ICRA Ltd.

Jefferies in a recent note recommended a hold rating for Tata Steel with a target price of ?614, while maintaining its underperform rating on SAIL and JSW Steel."

31,2018-07-12,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: Steel and aluminium companies will likely post better sequential performance in the June quarter, led primarily by metal prices. This could lead to a technical bounceback in the stocks of Tata Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, Hindalco and Nalco, which have seen sharp corrections over the past few months due to global concerns over punitive tariffs.

Domestic steel prices in the quarter were up 3-4 per cent, helped by a weak rupee and higher demand. Local demand for steel in April and May climbed 8.5 per cent on-year. Realisation for exporters will also be higher due to the depreciation of the rupee, which has been among the biggest losers against the dollar this year.

Cost pressures, meanwhile, moderated. After the sharp increase in March, coking coal costs fell 15 per cent sequentially, while iron ore prices declined 2 per cent. However, the total benefit of lower raw material costs will not be visible in the June-quarter performance due to the inventory lag effect, with plants using materials on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The September quarter will show the full effects of lower input costs.

Against this backdrop, analysts expect Tata Steel’s operating profit or EBIDTA to jump 10 per cent over the March quarter and 45 per cent over the year-ago period. Jindal Steel should deliver 8 per cent EBIDTA growth on a sequential basis and 70 per cent y-o-y. In case of JSW Steel, analysts expect a 3 per cent sequential growth and 80 per cent y-o-y growth in EBIDTA, driven by higher realisations, which should help offset the seasonality impact of tapering demand.



Aluminium makers Hindalco and Nalco are also expected to deliver better numbers, given 5 per cent higher sequential prices of the metal. Furthermore, the 25 per cent rise in alumina prices in the quarter that faced supply bottlenecks should help both producers, which have the benefit of backward integration.

Hindalco’s Indian operations, which include aluminium and alumina production, should deliver 20 per cent sequential EBIDTA growth, driven by higher realisations and lower hedging costs. State-run Nalco, which sells two-thirds of the alumina it produces (the remaining used for internal aluminium production), will be the biggest beneficiary of the sharp rise in alumina prices. Analysts expect the company to deliver a 40 per cent sequential increase in EBIDTA.

Stocks of these companies have seen a correction over the past few months: They now trade at the lower range of their three-year average EV by EBIDTA multiples, the metric used in the valuation of metal companies. EV, or enterprise value, includes market capitalization and net debt."

Sterlite Copper CEO P Ramnath told that statistics don't bear out ""myths"" like Tuticorin being the cancer capital of Tamil Nadu and the firm's factory the biggest polluter in the region.

""We have been in Tuticorin for more than 20 years now and have maintained very close contact with villagers and fishermen,"" he said.

""All these years, we invited locals on every Saturday to spend half a day at the plant to give them an overall picture of what is happening. Our doors were absolutely open and over these years several people had come including students, lawyers, and doctors.""

Protests, however, ""suddenly erupted"" in February as the company, after securing all approvals, began work on doubling the capacity of the plant to 800,000 tonnes per annum, he said.

""When we look back at the kind of social media messages that were circulated inciting locals, it certainly looks like it was a completely planned kind of an affair,"" he said, adding that fishermen were idle during those times as it was dangerous to fish in choppy sea and school and colleges were closed for annual break.

""There were NGOs (non-governmental organisations) who hijacked the whole thing and put out social media messages inciting the public,"" he said without naming anyone. ""Whole lot of myths were put out"".

The Tamil Nadu government in late May ordered the permanent closure of a copper smelter of the firm after 13 people protesting to demand its shutdown on environmental concerns were killed in police firing.

Ramnath said a myth was spread that Tuticorin is the cancer capital of Tamil Nadu and every death that happens in the district is linked to Sterlite Copper.

""This is absolutely wrong. There is statistics to prove that this wrong. Out of 32 districts (in the state), Tuticorin ranked 14th in male cancer cases and 25th in female cancer,"" he said. ""Complete misinformation and misconception were propagated. They hyped up the matter to stoke public sentiments.""

Stating that the plant followed strict pollution control standards, he said there was ""zero discharge"" of sulphur. In comparison, there is 4,000 MW of power plant running on coal containing sulphur which when burnt releases harmful sulphur dioxide directly into the atmosphere, he said.

""The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board data shows there hasn't been any change of sulphur dioxide level in Tuticorin after our plant was shutdown,"" he said.

He said there are similar copper smelters at Dahej in Gujarat run by Hindalco as well as in the heart of Hamburg in Germany running without any problem.

Ramnath said the company will seek relief from the Supreme Court in the case."

Coal India (up 0.17 per cent) was the only stock in the index that was trading with marginal gains. 

Market sentiment was positive owing to gains in IT, bank and auto stocks.

Buying in heavyweights including Infosys, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Larsen & Toubro and Tata Consultancy Services boosted equity benchmarks.

56,2018-07-20,Hindalco,"IT is top sectoral preference followed by select pharma with select private sector banking in the third place, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Both Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have been performing stocks. We pay a lot of attention discussing Bajaj Finance but do you think Bajaj Finserv also deserves an equal attention because Bajaj Finserv is the holding company of Bajaj Finance and the insurance business of late has done rather well?
Both of them have been enormous wealth creators. In the top end of the market, high quality names and high pedigree managements are getting high valuations and Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv are good examples of that. The market cap of both the companies put together has surpassed many frontline banks as well. That shows the kind of wealth that the companies have created in the last 10 years. 

Since Bajaj Finance is an operational company it gets more attention. Bajaj Finserv as a holding company understandably will always get second priority and be at a discount. But between these two, there is probably some valuation at Bajaj Finserv but I am sure the market will be keeping Bajaj Finance as the top priority.


Between HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank, which one would you like to buy?
Both are high quality banks with proven track records. HDFC Bank is the market’s favourite. In terms of valuation, both are fully priced and priced to perfection. And that may be a little bit of concern even. HDFC Bank will be rock solid and if you have to choose between the two, probably HDFC Bank will score at this moment.


Is this decline a time to buy or would you say the heydays for metals are over?
The January sentiment is not there anymore and will take time to come back. At this moment, we maintain a neutral view on the metal space. In terms of capital allocation, one has to be very selective and preferably be with the largecaps and large midcaps. If you are even slightly off in terms of the stock selection, markets have become quite unforgiving.

In terms of sectoral preferences, IT understandably will score top and select pharma will come second and the third will be select private sector banking. 

Metals do not feature in the top three in terms of at least capital allocation at this moment. Their time will come but not now. Of course, there’s Hindalco and some deal specific things may make news. Stocks remain under pressure with the fear that any extra bit of debt will come in on to their books. Even in terms of Tata Steel, understandably the Bhushan Steel deal has created some hiccups and additional debt."

59,2018-07-23,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: Novelis, the US-based downstream arm of India’s largest aluminium producer Hindalco Industries Ltd, is closing in on a $2.3-2.5 billion acquisition of Aleris Corp. 

Talks between both sides are gathering momentum after a lull of over six months, said several people with knowledge of the matter. The discussions are now being steered by Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla himself, they said. He stepped in to lead talks with the private equity owners of Aleris to get negotiations moving again.

This follows talks of more than a year between China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd, that country’s biggest supplier of processed aluminium, and the Cleveland-based aluminium parts maker having floundered on heightened US national security concerns.

A formal announcement is expected in the next few days, possibly as early as the coming week. Spokespersons of both the Aditya Birla Group and Aleris declined to comment on what they regarded as market speculation.

“There are no other serious buyers in fray but the talks have been going nowhere even though both sides have been engaged for months, forcing the sponsors to get into the act themselves and resolve it either way,” said an official directly involved on condition of anonymity

To be sure, Aleris refinanced more than $1 billion of its debt earlier this year, moderating the urgency for a deal.


Investment banking sources said Hindalco has already held informal discussions with global banks for financing support that would be required if a deal was reached.

The last time Birla attempted anything this bold was when he paid $5.7 billion for Novelis, the vehicle he’s using now to buy Aleris, 11 years ago.

Goldman Sachs is advising the Aditya Birla Group.

ET reported October 16 last year that Hindalco was weighing a $3.1billion bid for Aleris.

Aleris declared Chapter 11bankruptcy in 2009, brought low by the global financial crisis and heavy debt taken by TPG, its private equity owner at the time. In 2015, it withdrew plans for a long-delayed initial public offering in a blow to its new owners led by private equity firms Oaktree Capital and Apollo Global Management.


SCALING UP
An acquisition of Aleris will help Hindalco and Novelis consolidate further in the can and auto segments, the margins for which have been improving steadily in recent times.

Novelis has been keen to increase its auto shipments to 25% of the total to tap rising demand for aluminium sheets used for automotive purposes. Novelis derives most of its revenues from the beverage can segment, followed by auto body sheets. It’s gradually moving away from speciality steel, says analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Aleris recently commissioned its $425-million automotive body sheet (ABS) unit in Kentucky and has already started shipping products from there. The expansion comes as US President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on aluminium imports.

A takeover would add 1million tonnes to Novelis’ 3.6-million-tonne downstream capacity, where organic growth usually needs about five years of gestation, brokerage firm Macquarie said in a note. It would also help Novelis increase its presence in North America and Europe — the two biggest contributors to Aleris’ revenue.

According to JP Morgan, the ABS project in particular would allow Novelis to add capacity quickly and save three years that a greenfield project would take. Novelis clocked $1.2 billion ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) in FY18.

The company has already undertaken about $3 billion in capital expenditure since the Hindalco takeover to grow its auto lines and other recycling capacity. Between Novelis and Hindalco, the two companies generate $350-400 million of free cash flows every year.

“Analysts have been pushing the company to spend the cash lying with it,” said a company official, “Of late, the question has been, are we to prepay debt or pursue growth opportunities.”

Novelis chief executive Stever Fisher said last August that it was looking to boost capacity and serve customers. “We have become a preferred choice for automotive aluminium sheets,” he had said. 

“As more and more automakers turn to aluminium solutions to produce the next generation of vehicles, we are actively looking at opportunities to increase capacity to support our customers and reinforce our leadership position in this growing market.”

Hindalco managing director Satish Pai had said earlier that the company was considering expanding Novelis’ auto lines in the US and China to tap rising demand from the sector. As of FY17, while the auto segment accounted for 18% of Novelis sales by volume, aluminium cans contributed 60% and specialties the rest.

Aleris’ $201million adjusted ebitda for calendar 2017 included a $38 million impact of outages at its aerospace and auto facilities.

The company, in its annual presentation, said aerospace and automotive could have a positive impact of $30 million and $75 million on its Ebitda, respectively, in 2019. That could increase underlying ebitda to $344 million. This doesn’t include any synergy benefits that the company would start incurring.

However, US regulatory approvals can still be a deal breaker. The Aleris deal, which would have been China’s biggest buyout of an overseas metals processor, is one among many transactions that got caught in the regulatory crosshairs.

The all-important Committee on Foreign Investments in the US, which vets proposed acquisitions, has effectively frozen several transactions. The Aleris sale drew additional criticism from a group of senators who alleged Liu Zhongtian, the aluminium billionaire and majority owner of Zhongwang, had links with the Chinese army, raising the prospect that proprietary technology used by the US defence services could be compromised."

70,2018-07-24,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: Until about a couple of weeks ago, metal analysts had generally backed local producers to make money for investors despite the sharp recent cuts in stock prices. For them, the pronounced slide was less structural than transitory, masking the likely effects of competitive currency devaluation by the ‘factory to the world’.

But with Beijing devaluing the Chinese Yuan to unprecedented levels to help its producers hurdle the newlyerected tariff walls, Indian manufacturers are staring at potentially lower prices for their output.

Since mid-June, the yuan has fallen more than 6 per cent, while aluminium, zinc and copper on the LME are down 19.4 per cent, 9 per cent, and 14.5 per cent, respectively. China remains the biggest consumer and producer of metals and its currency movements can impact global commodity prices.

This is because commodities are traded in US dollar. With a weaker Chinese unit, commodity prices in the local currency increase, leading to eventually declining demand and consequently lower global commodity prices in US dollar. Hence, the Chinese currency depreciation is highly deflationary for commodities across the planet. The US Fed, too, has become more active in the currency market, and its involvement may temporarily arrest the fall in commodity prices.


Yuan’s Fall to Hit Indian Metal Companies’ Pricing Power
But the bigger question concerns the future trend.

Analysts tracking Vedanta, Hindalco and Hindustan Zinc have retained ‘BUY’ or ‘HOLD’ on these stocks through the recent fall. These ratings have been based on earnings estimated at certain price levels. LME metal prices are now at levels below which the estimated earnings of these companies will be much lower than expected.

Most analysts, for instance, have assumed LME Aluminum prices of around $2,100 per tonne. Currently, LME Aluminum prices are $2,080 per tonne. Similar is the situation with other base metals that are now trading sharply below their 100 and 200 DMA.

Lower realisation could not only impact the profits of these companies, but also lead to derating for these stocks."

69,2018-07-24,Hindalco,"Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Equity Advisory, Motilal Oswal Securities, says he is expecting around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. He was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Do you believe UPL’s acquisition of Arysta Lifescience is going to be value accretive and the synergy realisation can provide a significant upside even after yesterday’s upmove in the stock?
UPL has a fantastic track record of acquiring overseas companies in last 20-25 years. They made 20-odd acquisitions in so many years. With Arysta, it will be increasing $3 billion worth of debt on UPL’s special purpose vehicle and that would be a dilution. Net debt to equity will go higher. How they will be able to service the debt, the interest cost on the debt is something needs to be watched.

There will be a bit of postponement. It will be there for the earnings over FY20-FY21. It is very much priced in and it is not going to be value accretive at this point in time for next one-one and a half years.


Talking about the big earnings which the market is going to be reacting to and besides ACC’s good numbers, one wonders what went wrong with United Spirits? How to explain that kind of muted volume growth?
There was high expectation that post highway ban, there would again be a significant jump in the quarter, but the premiumisation is not working well. The Prestige and other brands have shown a very tepid growth and the cost has also gone up significantly.

EBITDA has improved but margin is not improving and the EBITDA margin and the profit margin both are very much flattish. Topline is growing but bottom line is growing a little less -- 10% to 15%. Plus, the earnings volatility is such that it is unpredictable whether one quarter will be a good enough to show traction for profitability in FY19 or FY20 or any other financial year. It is just a flipflop kind of an earning trajectory. They are still struggling with trying to rationalise operations again the regulatory actions.


What could we expect from Asian Paints today given that it is the leader in the paints segment? It is the go-to story when it comes to paint stocks and the fact that the market is betting big on the segment especially after the GST rates are being cut?
Asian Paints has 60% odd market share in the paint industry. It is a dominant player. This quarter, Asian Paints could see a 10-15% kind of a growth. Crude volatility, which is a raw material margin, needs to be watched out for. Crude has now retraced back from 80 to odd 72-73 odd. That gives some kind of a breather for rest of the financial year. We expect around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. That means it can show further growth also.


In the metal story, do you think Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta are buys even at the current levels?
Currency headwinds are almost there for the metal sector but trade war between the two elephants is showing a worrisome sign for these companies. Prices are declining day by day. Realisation will get hit for at least next one to two quarters and that is visible from here. Plus, we believe that the metal companies have done their capacity expansion to the fullest. Now there is not much of a scope there but if demand declines, then bad days will start for them. 

It is not a linear growth for metal stocks at any point in time throughout the year. With 100% capacity expansion, if demand slows down and price realisation is down, then they will have to suffer. However, with Hindalco, there is a different story. They have acquired Aleris and that is a different ball game. One can enter the stocks at around 8% to 10% correction. Even JSW Steel or Hindalco or Vedanta will provide a good opportunity in the longer term.


What is your perspective on mid-tier cement names? Cement is more of a regional play and if names like ACC are doing well, one can only extrapolate that some of the smaller companies will also see traction in their earnings. Would you agree?
I would say even UltraTech Cement has delivered in line with expectation. ACC is beyond comparison because traditionally, it is a very old plant and has had limited capacity expansion. Now the premium segment is picking up in ACC and so it is not comparable with others.

Irrespective of ACC cost per tonne has been reduced, the other cost has gone down and EBITDA has improved slightly, that does not mean that other midcap company which we are talking about is going to be performing better. It is a different ballgame for ACC at this point in time. We believe volume growth will be tepid enough. There will be 6% to 7% average volume growth for all the companies.

In midcaps, Birla Corp is something which needs to be watched out for in terms of results and ongoing for next one-one and a half year, the stock has corrected significantly and Reliance Cement which was the recent acquisition of one-one and a half year back, is running at 80% capacity. There are high chances that the stock can react to the positivity for next one-one and a half year. But it would be an investment perspective and not for trading. So for midcaps, almost 5% to 7% volume growth will be there in this quarterly numbers.


Beside earnings, this week is very critical in terms of a Nifty earnings composition. L&T, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Industries will report their numbers. Which ones are you looking out for and what is your expectation thereof?
This week, the result to watch out for would be ITC. We have to see where are its growth numbers and how the food and the non-cigarette business is shaping up. It can surprise positively rather than negative. 

In Hero MotoCorp, again a price war is taking place at the domestic level with Bajaj. The entry level segment will again be dampening the sentiment. It is not something which would be exciting.

Reliance needs to be watched to see how the margin will come up for this quarter and whether it has taken anything out of the crude advantage. On EBITDA front plus, Jio is doing very well and the retail needs to be watched. Maruti is our favourite."

89,2018-07-27,Hindalco,"The Aleris deal is worth $2.58 billion. About $775 million is through equity which will be paid for Novelis. The balance is debt of Aleris that Novelis will take over,  Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, Hindalco – Novelis, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


At $2.6 billion, 7.2 times EBITDA, there are fears that maybe, you have paid too much for Aleris. How do you look at the valuation?
Those fears are completely unfounded. The way to look at valuation is to see other comparable transactions in the same sector. I would say that 7.2 times is, if not very reasonable, on the lower side in the sector especially given the quality of the asset.


Why would you say Aleris is a perfect fit for Novelis and Hindalco? I understand they are into value added products and that will give it a boost, but going forward what is the kind of synergy benefits that you see between the two companies?
Aleris is in the same space as Novelis which is aluminium controlled products. Novelis is the world leader globally -- the largest in every market that it is in. Aleris is a very high quality, large player, with revenue of about $3 billion. It has 13 very hi-tech manufacturing sites across Europe, the US and China. It gives Novelis a stronger franchise in the auto market and therefore solidifies its position in the auto market.

As you know, auto is using more and more of aluminium from the point of view of light weighting to be able to meet environmental norms. It also gives it foray into some new sectors like building and construction. Very interestingly, the high margin aerospace sector with customers like Bombardier, Boeing – all marquee names -- come along with the transaction. This transaction is completely financed on the balance sheet of Novelis and that is hugely value creating.


How does Novelis finance this transaction? 
Without getting into too much of complexity, the deal size is $2.58 billion. About $775 million is through equity which will be paid for Novelis. The balance is debt of Aleris that Novelis will take over and the idea is to at some point soon after the takeover, refinance that debt. We believe that Novelis can get the debt at least a couple of 100 bps if not even lower as compared to Aleris. It is all of the balance sheet of Novelis which is the point to underline.


Doesn’t Hindalco play any direct role in this transaction?
Hindalco plays no role at all in the financing for this transaction.


Would there be any change in Hindalco’s inorganic expansion plans, Aditya Aluminium Mahan ?
I do not think there is any change in track there. What is important is that as a whole Hindalco is becoming a larger value-added player in terms of its proportion of portfolio. 





For the Hindalco Group as a whole, the proportion of value-added products will increase considerably post this deal.
It does, it takes the value added part to about 70% plus from practically zero about 10 years ago. It also makes the Hindalco combine the largest aluminium company in the world with the turnover of about $21 billion.


Aleris’ deal with the Chinese company did not make the cut because of security reasons. How would you make sure that the deal goes through with Novelis?
So I do not know about the previous transaction. It is best to ask them but in our case it is very clear. Novelis has been around for a very long time. Novelis provides employment to almost 7,000 people in the US and in Canada. The intent is to grow, we have no intention of shutting down any facility. The idea is to create more jobs. There’s hardly any overlap in terms of portfolio in the sense that the only common vertical is auto. If you look at auto and you compare the use of aluminium in auto with the use of steel, aluminium is still such a small player that there is no comparative threat at all because of which the permissions might get held up.


What would be the combined capacity and where does it put Hindalco in the global pecking order?
Hindalco has VAP or downstream product of about 400,000 tonnes per annum. Novelis is about 3.3 million tonnes per annum. Aleris has about a million tonnes per annum. This acquisition makes Hindalco -- if you take into account the primary metal production as well -- the largest aluminium company in the world.


How do you expect this acquisition to play out when it comes to the domestic market? The Indian auto segment is changing quite fast. Electric vehicles could become the norm in some years. Do you see big demand coming up from the Indian auto sector per se?
I do not think this transaction is pivoted on the Indian market. This is for the future. Who knows how EV picks up but some elements of technology that Aleris gives us in the building and construction segment would be invaluable to Hindalco in India. There is huge value creation all over.


About 11-12 years back, you acquired Novelis for $5-6 billion, It was a big one at that point in time. Do you think the Novelis acquisition played according to script in the next 3-5 years? What kind of upside did you see from Novelis?
Yes, it played to the objective that we had like. The objective was to have a much larger portion of downstream products compared to upstream and products and Hindalco at that point in time was only an upstream player. Novelis is a very valuable company today. It would be valued at about $10 to $12 billion. 

We invested $6 billion and within the first four years Novelis had given back about $3 billion by way of reduction in capital. It is hugely accreted, very valuable franchise and above all it is a global leader.


This deal also comes amid fears of a trade war. Have you also factored that in? How do you ringfence Novelis, Aleris to make sure that there are no fresh hurdles along the way?
This is largely a localised business. It doesn’t have too much of transportation of material. Therefore, we do not think that the tariff tussle that is happening just now will have any impact on Aleris.


Voda-Idea Meger: A New Chapter Starts

It is almost like double delight for you. DoT has given the much-awaited approval for the Vodafone-Idea merger. What does it mean for you?
It has been a very complex process but from our point of view, it is a new chapter in the telecom business, It is a much larger business. We are talking about 400 million subscribers and we are really excited at the potential of it.


Going forward, do you expect the merger to start playing out very soon? What happens next?
A lot of internal stuff would precede anything seen from the outside but at the end of the day, the idea is to give the customer a much stronger value proposition.


But the competitive landscape and the kind of tariff bloodbath that you have seen over the last few months, do you expect that to continue?
That is a little bit of crystal ball gazing, I do not want to get into that. It is difficult to say but I think that one of the ideas behind this merger was to be able to survive and thrive in this very competitive market.


You had projected a market share of 36% from the combined entity. Some of the analyst reports say that over the next 1-2 years, they see the combined market share go down to 30% because of the kind of competition that we are seeing. Do you share that kind of a concern?
Again, it is very difficult to say but when you have very large capacity and market share, there is some logic in saying that you might lose market share but on the whole a very powerful base to be based from.


There will be duplicity of functions with people doing the same role in 22 different circles. How do you ensure very little disruption because in a big merger like this, job losses are feared?
These are things that have been planned for the last several months and very much part of any merger -- whether large or small. I do not think that we are really worried on that front.


Looking for Acquisition in Cement

Turning to the cement sector, we see a lot of activity in the cement sector. What is the target for UltraTech? This is by far India’s largest cement company and with demand reviving, how do you see UltraTech play out over the next 12 months?
Targets can be on many dimensions but the basic idea is to solidify our position as the country’s largest player by far. We are looking at an acquisition potentially. Of course, the courts will take a final view on that. We are always looking at servicing customers better and providing them with complete solution.


It is almost a year since the IBC came into effect. What is your take? Has the law played according to script? Do you think more could be done or are you happy with the way things happened in the last 12 months?
First, it is important to recognise the fact that IBC is not just a reform but a very deep reform. When we think about reforms, we think about GST, we think about DeMon no one talks as much about IBC. It has changed the face of the Indian entrepreneurship forever. 

Having said that, there are some loose ends in a new legislation that need to be ironed out. Other than that, it is very much a step in the right direction.


Finally, you have completed a $2.5-billion acquisition, going ahead for the group as a whole. Will acquisition remain one of the prime ways to grow business or would it be a fine balance between organic and inorganic?
If you look at the last 10 years, Hindalco has also grown substantially on the back of organic expansion -- be it Aditya or Mahan smelters, Utkal Alumina. The real question to ask is what creates most value and on that basis, you need to decide whether inorganic or organic growth is the way ahead."

85,2018-07-27,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Hindalco rallied more than 4 per cent in early trade on Friday after the company said it will acquire US-based aluminium producer Aleris Corporation for $2.58 billion through its wholly-owned subsidiary Novelis.

The scrip was trading 4.09 per cent up at Rs 215 at around 9.35 am (IST), while the BSE Sensex was up 230 points, or 0.62 per cent, up at 37,215 at around the same time.

Announcing the acquisition, Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman, Aditya Birla Group, said, ""Acquiring Aleris, in a debt-funded deal, will help diversify the product mix for Novelis by giving access to the aerospace segment.""

Global brokerage firm CLSA belives that sharp scale up in Aleris’ Ebitda is required to justify the deal valuation. “Good strategic fit for Novelis but not cheap,” CLSA said. It maintained ‘Underperform’ rating on Hindalco with a target price of Rs 212.

Jefferies said that Aleris deal is rich in valuation but risk reward still positive. “The deal may diversify Novelis’ product mix and lift its auto sheet capacity. Aleris EBITDA could rise to $290 million by FY20,” said Jefferies. It maintained ‘Buy’ on Hindalco with a target price of Rs 318.

""The acquisition of Aleris is the next phase of our aluminium value added products growth strategy. This will solidify our position as the world's No.1 aluminium value-added products player,"" Birla added.

""We will have presence throughout the downstream aluminium value chain in Asia, positioning us for future growth in the region,"" said Birla."

82,2018-07-27,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: Hindalco’s acquisition of aluminium convertor Aleris through its subsidiary Novelis will offer strong synergies in the long run.
Not only will the debt-funded, $2.6-billion buyout strengthen the Novelis footprint in the global aluminium products industry, but it will also add to Hindalco’s revenue share from the steadier non-commodity business, eventually boosting Hindalco valuations.

With Aleris, Novelis’ capacity will increase by 1 mt to 4.3 mt. This will lead to 30% capacity addition; the bigger benefit, however, is that the buyout will help the company diversify into higher-margin, value-added products in the construction, aero and truck trailer industries.

Novelis, mainly a beverage can manufacturer earlier, has worked towards increasing the share of its value-added output, such as automotive parts and other speciality products. With Aleris, the share of low-margin beverage cans will come down to 47% from 61% currently.

Further, Aleris will give Novelis access to a new set of clients and help strengthen its position in the US and Europe. For Aleris, which had revenue of $2.9 billion in FY17, 51% of the business came from US and 45% from Europe. Its EBIDTA for FY17 was $201 million, yielding a 7% margin.

This appears very low given that Aleris has a high-value product. But according to Hindalco, Aleris completed $900 million of investments into high-growth, high-margin projects, the returns on which are not fully realised in the latest adjusted EBIDTA. Also, it does not include incremental EBIDTA from additional growth in aerospace and specialities, or synergies, the Hindalco management said.

The $2.6-billion acquisition includes $1.8 billion debt on the books of Aleris. The rest will be the cash consideration. There will be no equity dilution for Hindalco shareholders.
In the short run, the acquisition may not much enthuse the Street. Although strong synergies are likely to play out over a period of time, the acquisition at a valuation of 12.8 times EBIDTA is slightly expensive. Also, some short to medium term investors may be concerned about the increase in debt. Hindalco’s total debt would increase by $2.58 billion against an increase in EBIDTA by around $201 million."
81,2018-07-27,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: After scaling newer heights, the domestic equity benchmarks seem to have developed cold feet, as Asian stocks struggled to gain traction on Friday, following a mixed end to Wall Street trade and as the worsening Sino-US trade dispute kept investors in the region cautious.

Key earnings from top companies like RIL, ICICI Bank, HCL Tech are likely to dominate proceedings all through Friday’s session.


Here is a list of buzzing stocks that you should be watching on Dalal Street during the day.


RIL: Reliance Industries is set to announce its financial performance for Q1 on Friday, and the Street will look for more details on the rollout and investment of the home-to-fibre, which the company announced earlier this month.

Kumar Mangalam Birla said the acquisition will insulate Hindalco from aluminium price fluctuations and help grow its valueadded product business.


Airtel: Bharti Airtel eked out a modest net profit on a consolidated basis in the first quarter, helped by a one-time exceptional gain, but losses worsened in India as pricing pressure mounted.

HCL Tech: The IT major is scheduled to announce its June quarter earnings during the day.
ITC: ITC announced a 10.1 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 2,818 crore for the first quarter on back of 13.5 per cent jump in gross sales value (GSV) at Rs 18,171.66 crore which the conglomerate said was driven by cigarettes, packaged food, personal care, stationary and agri businesses.


IndiaOil: IOC has opposed GAIL’s pitch for a unified tariff for its pipelines, saying such a move would raise input cost for its three refineries by Rs 1,000 crore.


Yes Bank: YES Bank said its first quarter net profit increased 31 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1,260 crore or Rs 5.39 per share as both interest as well as non-interest income rose sharply.

80,2018-07-27,Hindalco,"The acquisition of Aleris will insulate Hindalco from aluminium price fluctuations and help grow its value-added product business, said Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla in an interview to Vatsala Gaur and Megha Mandavia. He added that aluminium consumption is set to grow in India, but imports of the metal from China remain a concern. Edited excerpts:

How does this deal fit in with your strategic plan for Hindalco?
It is essentially about getting to a more value-added portfolio. It takes us into aerospace which is a marquee space to be in. It helps our valuation but more importantly we have a great customer franchise there. We have been saying for many years that we want to de-risk ourselves from the LME (London Metal Exchange prices).

This is a business we have seen in the last 10-11 years that it is far more insulated than primary metals.


After the acquisition how much much would be the contribution from value-added services for Hindalco consolidated?
From the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or operating margin before tax) point of view, it will be 75% from value-added services and 25% will be from aluminum primary.


Is Hindalco making any contribution to the deal?
No, not at all. It’s all from the books of Novelis.


Hindalco shares have been falling before the acquisition was announced.... 
There are too many unfounded concerns that Hindalco is raising equity. How do you see your metals business going forward?

We are at a point where growth of aluminium and copper is very strong. Globally, aluminium growth is expected to be 5-6%. In India we are already seeing 8% growth in aluminium consumption. Auto, electric vehicle, building and construction... it’s the metal of the future.

Copper is also growing now with electrification, electric vehicles. Both metals will have high grown room rate going forward.


Would you say demand for metals has recovered post demonetisation and GST?
Yes, it has recovered. Now, is it at an inflection point? We are at $2,000 GDP per capita. When China was at this point it accelerated quickly. India is right now at 2.2 kg per head for aluminium consumption. It can jump to 5.5 kg. What we are concerned about is Chinese imports into India. As China is not able to sell to the US it is selling it to India. Imports have spiked 19% in April and May.

Our fears are now being founded. It’s a real concern we are talking to commerce ministry about. We want quantitative restrictions.


Have there been any impact on your sales?
Not so far. It takes 4-5 months. We have flagged this because it’s pretty obvious it will happen.


Could you walk us through how will Aleris be merged with Novelis and will there be any redundancies?
We will bring Aleris under Novelis.

We will integrate their workforce and we don’t expect any operational redundancies. We see synergies more in procurement, IT infrastructure and selling, and general and administration expenses. We will backward integrate our Chinese assets into their upstream facilities. It gives us access to local priced metal which is $200-400 per tonne cheaper.


How is your business doing globally?
It is doing very good. We see strong markets in the US. Building and construction, industrial and manufacturing is very strong. Even our beverage can business is very strong. Europe is one region where we have a little over capacity so we are letting the mark absorb it. There will be opportunity in Europe again.


Has the business improved overall?
It is picking up. We are concerned about the sectors where Chinese material is coming in. We don’t have a system in place for anti dumping.


How do you see the Indian economy?
Demand is coming back in many sectors. Cement is doing well on back of government spending on infrastructure, individual home builders, bullet train and western-eastern corridor.


Coming to the Idea-Vodafone deal, is everything done?
We got the final approval today.


Are you going to the Supreme Court over the payment?
We have to still take a call on that. We made the payment under protest. That doesn’t necessarily mean we will go to court.


What do you think of the insolvency resolution process at the NCLT? 
It is evolving. They are going up the learning curve very quickly. Their understanding of issues has gone up tremendously."

96,2018-07-28,Hindalco,"The bullish trend should continue on back of strength in individual sectors, especially Bank Nifty, Kunal Bothra, independent market analyst, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


Nifty has closed at a record high. We are almost in an uncharted territory. Is there more room for bulls to move?
Absolutely and this is coming at a time when there has been a lot of confusion and misses by a lot of traders because most of the focus was on midcaps. All of a sudden there was capitulation and carnage in the midcaps while the largecaps kept standing tall. Over the last one week and especially this week, a lot of midcaps bounced back. When you see rise of 15%-20% in individual stocks and even sectors, that means a trend reversal is in process. 

This implies that the bull trend is continuing and that comes at a time when the world market and especially the emerging markets are still in a wobbly zone. This trend for our market should continue on the back of some strength in individual sectors, especially Bank Nifty.


What is your view on Hindalco? There was a steady decline in Hindalco stock and prices came down to a one-year level under Rs 200. Subsequently, there was a very smart bounce back?
Last week played out pretty well for the stock price. There was a good bounce back and more intriguing was the volume patterns in the last six -seven days. When the fall got into the final stages in terms of short-term trading, there was a sudden pick up in terms of volumes. Then there was a sharp, almost a V-shape reversal in prices. 

Whenever you see such patterns in a short-term time-frame, you can probably bring in a case of a short-term bottom in place. The stock could gradually get into a mean reversion process. What is worrying for the prices of many metal stocks is the weekly breakdown because many of these stocks have shown clear signs of weekly chart patterns breakdown.

In order to reverse those kind of weekly breakdowns, you need to have a more powerful move. This is a very short-term signal for Hindalco. You might see the stocks coming back to Rs 230-225 range but on weekly charts, there is a lot of resistance that the stock has to clear to come back in the full swing it had at the end of 2017.


Give a few technical recommendations which could be profitable?
A couple of them look very attractive. One is Gas Authority of India (GAIL). Price patterns in the last three-four weeks show that it is going to a steady sort of an uptrend. Last week, it closed almost at its weekly highs and the price patterns are now suggesting that the stock should continue to ride higher. From a positional play, in may be one or two weeks, you could look at even Rs 400 as a possible target on GAIL. I am suggesting a buy with a stop loss at Rs 365. 

The second would be PFC. Both PFC and REC have managed to come back quite strongly last week but if you look at the price patterns, there seems to be a bigger reversal happening in these names. They are coming back after multi-weeks of downtrend. Any sort of reversals last for a longer duration and that is what I am anticipating could happen for PFC. I suggest a buy with Rs 92 as a target and stop loss at Rs 80."

101,2018-07-30,Hindalco,"Edelweiss Financial Services has a buy call on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 280.

The current market price of Hindalco Industries is Rs 210.30.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Hindalco Industries price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by Edelweiss Financial Services:

Good fit: Better product mix and stronger competitive position: We see the Aleris deal as a good fit for Novelis as it: 1) provides a foothold in the sophisticated and sticky aerospace and high-margin Building & Construction (B&C), Truck and Trailer segments; 2) reinforces the competitive position in Asia—Aleris recently commissioned the Zhenjiang facility close to the Novelis facility in Changzhou and; 3) enhances the company’s share in the attractive US automotive market.


21 per cent CAGR (CY17-20E) to lift EBITDA to USD360mn: We expect EBITDA to increase at a 21 per cent CAGR (CY17–20E) to USD360mn driven by: 1) one-time outage (75 days in Q3CY17) add-backs in the US and Europe; 2) contracted auto volume and; 3) ramp-up of the remaining auto finishing capacity. With capex plan of USD900mn largely over, we expect benefits from ABS projects in the US and Wingskin project in Europe to start flowing in Q2CY18 onwards.


Outlook and Valuation: Aleris a value-accretive deal: We are upbeat on the Aleris acquisition as it is value-accretive for Novelis coming at a fair valuation, in line with peers. We also see this as an opportunity for Novelis to reinforce its presence in the lucrative US market through value-added product offerings. On the leverage front, we do not expect Novelis’s D/E to breach 4x, implying the balance sheet would remain healthy. Maintain ‘BUY/SO’ on HNDL with a TP of Rs 280, translating to an exit multiple of 6.6x FY20E EBITDA."
99,2018-07-30,Hindalco,"ICICI Bank’s stock price move will also have some amount of ruboff on the Axis Bank as well, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

ICICI Bank has posted the maximum amount of loss since 2011. Is the fact that they are trying to clean up their books in one go, is a positive sign?
This time, the ICICI Bank cleanup may be two fold. One, of course is aggressive NPA cleanup measure as pushed by RBI. Second is the sheer change of the CEO level management. 

We have seen it in the past in case of many PSU banks that when the new CEO or the new Chairman in, comes they tend to clean up all the old issues to start afresh. That could be an inbuilt mechanism and that could have been reflected in this quarter results. 

Hopefully, the cleanup may be for good and let us hope that we will not go back to bad old days. In terms of NPAs, probably good times are here to stay. The ICICI Bank ADR is suggesting the same in terms of the hope that probably the worst is over and we may be here for good times especially in terms of the sheer valuations.

Optically, ICICI Bank definitely looks undervalued than many other corporate lenders and private sector banks so. In that sense, ICICI Bank has a huge comfort factor. Centrum House has a buy recommendation on ICICI Bank with Rs 360 as a target. But in terms of NPA cleanup measure, we have to see how things will unfold. But let us hope the worst is behind us.


What will be the pecking order in technology after HCL Tech’s numbers?
Yes, in terms of revenue size, the industry pecking order definitely changes now. HCL Technologies has become the third largest IT company, pipping past Wipro. Wipro has been struggling to keep that third place for almost last three-four years and eventually they had to give in. Probably this time, HCL Technologies taking the third place may be a permanent kind of change meaning it is not just a temporary phenomenon. 

Wipro probably will have to be content with the fourth place for some time. In terms of investing ideas, probably Infosys and TCS will still fight for top sot because of sheer size and the dominance especially for the global investors. 

HCL Technologies will be a player to reckon with. Whatever said and done, IT is definitely the theme one should stay invested in because rupee weakness is appearing to be more structural at this moment. RBI’s intervention can at best slow but cannot stop the process of rupee weakening. Even if rupee weakens to say 70 or even beyond 70, probably IT will be the clear beneficiary. 


Axis would be reporting its numbers today. What are you expecting? In terms of Axis Bank, some of the commentary of ICICI Bank will have to read for Axis Bank as well considering the situation is similar. Whether Axis Bank will take the same aggressive stance as ICICI Bank did in terms of the asset quality cleanup and in terms of how they will show the numbers, will need to be seen. Markets will be keenly watching. In terms of pecking order in the corporate lenders also, it is in the top and there is a lot of frustration among investors in terms of the stock price performance. 

Every day, HDFC Bank making all time high and ICICI Bank and Axis Bank languishing creates a strain in terms of the perception. Markets will be watching whether Axis Bank will take the same aggressive stance in terms of asset cleanup once and for all. Moving on from here, in terms of other businesses of Axis Bank, be it on wealth PEs etc, they are doing quite well. Today, ICICI Bank’s stock price move will also have some amount of ruboff on the Axis Bank as well. Considering the results are around the corner, we will remain in focus. 

We are probably turning the cycle around and in terms of the perception at some point because of subsidiaries listing of some of these companies. ICICI Prudential and ICICI Lombard now have a new currency for raising the new money by selling the stake. Even for example, ICICI Bank selling the stake of ICICI Prudential itself will garner thousands of crores whenever they wish. Capital adequacy and raising new capital should not be a major concern and they need not even dilute the ICICI Bank shareholding. 

Unless they do any fresh mistakes, if they can learn from the previous mistakes, there is some comfort to be taken from here on.


HDFC AMC hitting the markets on expected lines saw a resounding subscription reaction from all classes of investors. Will it give a face lift to the entire AMC business?
Whenever we see the IPOs from HDFC Group companies, I recall a quote from Rahul Dravid about Sourav Ganguly. He said, on the upside first there is God and then Sourav Ganguly. Probably in terms of capital markets, first is God and then HDFC Bank companies. This is amazing in the sense that year after year, we see HDFC Group companies coming for listing and even sophisticated investors get excited. No matter, whether you are QIB, HNI or retail, people aggressively pick up the allotment. 

It is probably a salute given by the market to the credibility they have gained over the years. Be it the HDFC Bank, HDFC, or HDFC AMC, everything is definitely overvalued compared to their peers but the market is more than willingly ready to give that valuation. It is a case study to learn from the capital markets that if you enjoy that credibility, you will get that higher valuation. The kind of money that you can make is much more if you have credibility. The listing should be good even at the short-term end and in terms of long term. 

Even if you do not get allotment, there will be much pent up demand because many people would like to see HDFC AMC in their portfolios. Good times are here in terms of HDFC AMC.


In Friday’s session, there was a fair amount of activity on Hindalco on the back of Aleris buy. Does it keep the boat afloat when it comes to the metals basket?
The metals basket had fantastic time last week. It could have been a technical breakout or it may be a short-term move but some of the moves were quite strong. The way the market is going, probably metals can provide a comfort for the current market rally. 

In terms of Hindalco, the specific view is that some of these acquisitions with the dollar denominated debt will take time to integrate because it is not a small transaction. It will take some time for the results to unfold and till that time, there will be debt pressure and debt repayment pressure.

All in all, it is a positive development for long term and in the short term in terms of EPS impact. Probably in next two-three quarters, we will have to see how the things unfold. At this moment, Hindalco wants to move in an aggressive manner with inorganic as well as organic growth opportunities. The stock price may remain with the overhang of the acquisition related debt."

102,2018-07-30,Hindalco,"The Aditya Birla Group has roped in about a dozen banks including Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Standard Chartered to garner up to $2.6 billion in short-term loans to finance the acquisition of US aluminium processor Aleris.

The move spotlights the increasing role of global lenders in raising cash for outbound M&As by Indian companies.

“We have tied up with a consortium of lenders to arrange a bridge loan of $2.6 billion as debt financing will support the acquisition,” Satish Pai, managing director of group company Hindalco Industries, told ET, confirming the matter. “The bridge loan will be available on the deal closing officially. This is a backstop debt financing,” he said.

The company will later refinance the bridge, or short-term, loan “depending on the market condition,” he said. “It could be a combination of bonds and loans.”

The Aleris buyout is aimed at strengthening the conglomerate’s aluminium play.

Hindalco’s American subsidiary Novelis, which is acquiring Aleris, will raise the finances, also giving its shares as additional collateral, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter told ET.

A large home-grown private sector bank too is likely to be one of the participants as domestic banks are permitted to fund outbound acquisition deals. “Both foreign and large (local) private sector banks are part of the consortium. They will offer the loan from their offshore branches,” one of the sources said.

The existing debt of Aleris is a cocktail of loans and bonds totalling $1.80 billion — about $400 million is in bonds. But, the company’s ratings are all in weak junk categories — Moody’s rates it B3, multiple times lower than the investment grade, with a developing outlook.

Novelis has a slightly better rating at B1 with a negative outlook. Going by this, the company may refinance Aleris debt with bond sales at a later stage after the acquisition deal formally closes.

Back home, Hindalco has an above investment-grade rating of AA from Crisil, a local unit of Standards and Poor’s.

Hindalco on Thursday announced the acquisition of Aleris, its second biggest deal, building on the $5.9 billion buyout of Novelis in 2007. The acquisition gives it a strong foothold in supplying to the aerospace industry and other value-added businesses globally. The $2.6 billion transaction will include $775 million of equity from the Birla Group and $1.8 bn of debt, which will be funded through Novelis.

“As many as 20 banks have been approached, but the company may end up giving the mandate to about a dozen banks. The pricing is not yet decided but banks are keen to extend the credit line. It is a bridge of shorter maturity, maybe in the range of 18-24 months,” said one of the sources.

Overseas loan is increasingly becoming popular among Indian companies as it costs less than dollar-denominated bonds, which are priced at fixed rate.

Dollar bonds are priced in proportion of US treasury yields, which remain elevated this year. An overseas loan, other than bonds, is priced after adding a mark-up or spread over the US dollar-based London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

For example, if the six-month LIBOR is 2.528%, adding a spread of 110 basis points, the final rate would be 3.628%. However, issuers take different maturity LIBOR rates. The rates are variable in nature, but still are cheaper now.

“What these corporates are doing is they are swapping floating rate LIBOR-linked loans with fixed rate in the derivative market,” said a senior executive at a large foreign bank. This way, they are locking the lower rates, which are likely to go up amid winding up of easy monetary policies globally.

Domestic banks are not allowed for acquisition funding if it is an inbound deal, meaning buyout of domestic companies. But they are permitted to fund outbound overseas deals.

The value of M&A deals announced globally hit a record $2.5 trillion in the first half of 2018, up 64% from a year earlier, recording the strongest year-to-date period since such data collection started in 1980, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. The prior high was $2.3 trillion in the first half of 2007."

While the Union Budget for 2017-18, the government had introduced a provision to tax notional income on unsold ready-to-move inventory, this case has been in the court even prior to that.

Positive consumer sentiments, higher footfalls and a series of interventions are helping the franchise to deliver industry highest average unit volumes, driving solid margin gains, said CLSA. The firm has increased EBITDA estimates on Westlife by 5-6 per cent over FY19-FY20 as it has increased its growth and margin forecast. 


Hindalco Industries: HSBC has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 320. The firm views the Aleris deal to be positive as it helps Hindalco further de-risk its business. HSBC viewss this deal positively also because the entire deal is debt funded without significantly compromising Novelis’s balance sheet strength, leading to a lower cost of capital for the acquisition and making it value accretive."
103,2018-07-31,Hindalco,"The markets have continued their record-setting spree in the August derivatives series and many stocks are seeing significant increase in open interest. Many of them are from the midcap space, which has seen some recovery after a sharp fall in the past few months. ET takes a look at five such stocks which are gaining momentum in the futures segment and their outlook in the near term:


V-Guard Industries
CMP: Rs 215.15
Open interest Change in August series (%): 46.61 
Stock Price Change in August series (%): 4.26 
YTD Change (%): -11.75

V-Guard Industries has seen interest on the long side in the run-up to its June quarter result and has seen the highest increase in open interest in the futures segment in the August series. Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal said the stock has given a breakout above Rs 205 recently. “It is likely to respect the Rs 205-leve and we see upside in the stock till Rs 230,” said Taparia. V-Guard will report earnings for June quarter on Tuesday.


Indian Bank
CMP: Rs 362.30
Open interest Change in August series (%): 44.51
Stock Price Change in August series (%): 2.27
YTD Change (%): -3.82

Indian Bank has seen a surge in interest on the long side in the futures segment amid the rally in public sector shares. “PSU banks have bottomed out. Indian Bank has seen formation of positive price pattern on charts,” said Taparia. Taparia sees the stock rising to Rs 375- Rs 400 in the near term. “One can buy the stock on a dip and keep a stop loss of Rs 340,” said Taparia.


Hindalco Industries
CMP: Rs 211.25
Open interest Change in August series (%): 17.15
Stock Price Change in August series (%): 2.28
YTD Change (%): -22.77

Hindalco has been on the radar of the bulls following announcement that its subsidiary Novelis Inc will acquire Aleris Corporation for $2.6 billion. Analysts see the acquisition as a strategic fit and value accretive for Hindalco. Analysts said the Aleris deal will help Hindalco further derisk its business. However, Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities believes that the overall trend in the stock is weak. “The stock is likely to face resistance at Rs 220-Rs 225. One should sell it at higher levels,” said Shetti.


Ajanta Pharma
CMP: Rs 1,130.40
Open interest Change in August series (%): 27.96
Stock Price Change in August series (%): 8.32
YTD Change (%): 24.21

The pharmaceutical company’s futures have seen build-up of long positions ahead of the announcement of result for the quarter ended June on Tuesday. Last week, the firm said that the US drug regulator did not make any observations after completion of inspection of its Dahej facility in Gujarat. Analysts said this factor is also aiding sentiment for Ajanta Pharma. Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities sees the stock rising to Rs 1,250 in the next two to three weeks. Shetti said one can buy the stock at current level or on a fall to Rs 1,080- Rs 1,085 and maintain stop loss of Rs 1,060.


Bank of BarodaCMP: Rs 152.05
Open interest Change in August series (%): 5.35
Stock Price Change in August series (%): 9.51
YTD Change (%): -5.35

The PSU lender has seen a surge in interest after its profit more than doubled in the June quarter led by higher interest income and a drop in provisions. Analysts said there has been short covering and build-up of long positions in the stock futures. Jefferies has upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ and raised target price to Rs 180 from Rs 161. Jefferies has increased earnings estimates on Bank of Baroda for the current financial year by 10.8% to account for stable growth, improving net interest margin, lower slippages and higher recoveries. “We upgrade BOB to Buy - we derive greater comfort on its asset quality and earning capacity resulting in RoE (return on equity) of 14-16% over FY19-FY21,” said Jefferies in a note."

  Edited excerpts: 

What would Harley Davidson coming to India mean for Eicher?
Harley is in a completely different segment. They are in a high range of motorcycles and a higher segment of the market. That is definitely going to work in favour of companies which are in India. If we study the pattern of how Bajaj Auto has systematically built in KTM into their portfolio, it suggests that on one side, they took advantage of strong engineering and used the brand KTM for distribution purpose.

Harley probably brings in a similar kind of an equation wherein the cost of manufacturing is brought down to the level at which the world or Indian markets can afford them. 

So, certainly it would be an interesting play. I do not see too much of a problem but at the same time, you can argue that there would be a pressure on the margin for likes of Eicher who have been commanding around 30% margin. One will have to see how they react on the pricing front.


After Tech Mahindra’s earnings, how are you positioning your preference within the IT pack? I am going with the assumption that TCS would still be your top pick but other than that, is it the right climate to initiate calls among the largecaps within the space?
TCS gives us a distinct clarity. They have the visibility of long-term contracts which they have been signing every quarter. So, there is a visibility of revenue from their conventional model. The way in which the shift is taking place to the digital model is giving a conviction that somewhere down the line, inorganic growth would be a reality in case of TCS and even for Infosys. 

Tech Mahindra has already shown the desire for inorganic growth. From that perspective, TCS would still rank better compared to the others. We will continue to hold on to the positions that we have in TCS. The important part in the IT would be the growth because TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra kind of companies may end up producing 10% to 20% price appreciation, subject to price at which you enter in a given year. Only if you entered in a corrective downside, you will have the opportunity to earn between 15% and 20%. Otherwise, the outlook is 10-15% appreciation in these three companies.

But in midcap IT companies like Tata Elxsi, we find there is an opportunity to make 25% CAGR from this business given the kind of a growth programme that the three IT largecaps are continuing within each of the verticals in which they are operating. All said and done, I would prefer to stay with some of the good quality midcap IT companies like Tata Elxsi and KPIT where we have relatively larger amount of clarity about the growth going forward.


Bank of Baroda (BoB) has in a sense, rerated the entire PSB sector. Are you hopeful that after an Indian Bank and BoB, we could see similar performances from some of the other PSU banks as well? Or should the list stop at SBI after BoB?
Let us also accept the fact that due to the lower pressure of providing for the non-performing assets, PSBs are now showing relatively better performance in the quarterly results. With the NCLT programmes continuing, they are auctioning the assets and getting money back into the books. It is positive only, going forward as well. As the downside in the PSB has been kept limited, the upside in PSB would depend a lot on the basis of earnings outlook with the produce from lending.

Currently, that is an area where most of the analysts are not as confident as they would have been otherwise. The PSU banks are passing through a restructuring programme in their operations including for lending and other activities. I am not too sure whether you would have an equal amount of credit growth which some of the private sector or the corporate banks are registering as of now. But, valuation wise, these PSBs have become attractive. Downside is limited and any kind of positive news could result in upside in stock prices and that is where the traders delight as they function in a market where positive news would drag the stock price up while the fundamentals take time to catch up. 

It would be a buy in dips strategy for PSBs at this point of time.


Vedanta is going to come out with earnings. Last week, the Aleris buy by Novelis helped lift sentiment on Hindalco. The three metals majors -- Tata Steel, Vedanta as well as Hindalco -- come on the back of a two-year mega bull run in commodities. Does that continue?
Certainly the white metals as well as the ferrous metal would continue to have volume-led growth in the economy. All these companies fortunately do not carry even the inventory for few days in their godown. This means the offtake is much faster than one would have imagined in the past. Because of the global market conditions including China factor where they have switched over to the electric car furnaces in steel, the prices of steel have remained stable comparatively. As a result, realisation is better. So, on one side, you have a high demand scenario and on other side, realisation is better. 

Crude oil price is increasing and that is having the impact but at the same time you have much favourable delta on the pricing front vis-à-vis the cost. That is giving opportunity for white metal as well as the ferrous companies and that is an area where the demand scenario along with the profit margins, would probably drive the stock prices. 

Any corrections would be meaningful. This is not generalisation. There would be a correction in respective companies from time to time. But that would be a meaningful way to look into the commodity players like the metal companies and buy them into portfolio during downside. We believe that two-three years of upcycle in metal is a given. If the scenario is buoyant, you should make money in the upcycle in the commodity space.


Why would anybody in their right mind vote against Deepak Parekh? The large wealth which has been created for HDFC shareholder is because of the way the checks and balances and the corporate ethos of HDFC Ltd. HDFC Bank has evolved in last 30 years. Now, 22%, nearly one-fourth of the total shareholders, do not want him as the Chairman anymore?
Generally, as an entrepreneur, promoter and a prudent manager of the finance business, you ultimately end up managing the risk well. That is what Deepak Parekh’s USP has been. He has been managing his risks so very well that we have seen some of the best institutions coming out of the HDFC group. Today there are investors in the company who are not necessarily looking at the risk in a same manner in which he has been looking at it. They probably want to accelerate the pace of growth in various businesses in which they are operating. They are trying to position themselves more aggressively.

Ever since I have started learning how to read corporate annual accounts, I have seen HDFC remaining the most prudent company in management of risks. I am more convinced that the style of working is far more superior than one would have asked for but yes some part of investors have been demanding a aggressive path and that is where the discontent is. 

I have not talked to any investor honestly but this could be the reason for which there may be some kind of a negative voting against Parekh."

7,2018-08-04,Hindalco,"Talking to ETNow, Kunal Bothra, independent market expert, says the market has sailed higher in the face of global negative cues, and this bullish streak may stay.
Edited excerpts:


ET Now: This week, we have spent a large part of our time just circling around the 11,300 mark, with some intermittent dips also coming in. What are we in for next?


Kunal Bothra: It was that kind of a week for the indices, but there were no two ways to look at midcap stocks, because the market breadth remained positive for good part of this week. I sense that, with the market breadth now coming positive and midcap stocks making a comeback, largecap stocks have got that breather in terms of correction. I believe, it is going to be quite positive to take away. 

This week Asian markets, as well as the emerging market cues were extremely negative. Despite those negative cues, our market has sailed higher. In technicals, we look at price action and respect what the price says. The prices indicate that we are into a bullish trajectory and this bullish momentum should continue for the indices going forward as well.


ET Now: The entire auto pack was active this week, especially because of the monthly auto sales numbers. There were concerns around Eicher. The fact that it is richly valued, what is going to happen to it once Harley Davidson comes into play? You saw this week that Eicher Motors got pounded for three consecutive trading sessions. Is it building up for a higher move or do you think the pressure on the stock would remain because of this report? It will report its numbers also next week.

Kunal Bothra: I believe that the pressure is now getting into the stock and it has made a negative candlestick pattern. Generally, when you expect bottom formation processes to happen, we expect the stock to remain sideways for good amount of time without any negative triggers, at least in terms of price patterns. But, what you saw this week, compared to the last week, price action is more of a bearish engulfing price pattern. The indicators on monthly charts for Eicher Motors have broken lows, which were almost closer to 2,009-2,010 when the stock was at 8,000-10,000 odd level. So, with indicator action breaking on the long-term charts and the weekly price patterns getting negative, I believe that the stock is building towards the downward trend or opening up a downward trend and you might see the stock correcting.

So, I am not sure how the stocks would react post results, but if the stock breaks this 27,000 mark support levels on weekly basis, you should see a bigger correction for the stock.


ET Now: Do we see Reliance Industries scale up fresher and fresher highs because the move has been steady after its AGM?


Kunal Bothra: Absolutely. I think from 2017, when the stock broke that 9-10-year of sideways range, it has not looked back anytime in the last one-and-a-half years. Yes, on the long-term patterns, the stock is getting into that high acceleration mode where you see higher price appreciations, that too on a short span of time. I think that should augur well for the stock. If you see volume built up happening, which is what the charts are now showing, it means there is increased amount of participation into the stock prices. 

So, it indicates that this stock may not see that kind of volatility which could have been surfacing couple of months or quarters back and the stock is into a stable uptrend. I believe Reliance could continue to ride higher from current levels as well.


ET Now: Any interesting trades for Monday morning?


Kunal Bothra: Quite a few. I think one of them which I am suggesting to buy is Hindalco from the metal pack. I think it is making a good comeback over the last couple of days. Even though it has been sideways, but the price patterns have become positive for Hindalco so that is a buy, target of Rs 230 and a stop loss of Rs 204. 

State Bank of India, I believe that the stock has now confirmed a strong weekly breakout at this 290 odd mark. It also crossed the 200-day moving average quite convincingly last week, so that is also a buy with a target price of Rs 320 and a stop loss of Rs 289. 

The third stock is a midcap stock, Bombay Burmah. I think the stock is staging to a bullish flag pattern breakout. It is a liquid midcap name, would suggest a positional buy with the strong upside of at least Rs 1,700 to Rs 1720 zone, stop loss to be kept at Rs 1,555."
8,2018-08-05,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Renewed trade tensions between the US and China and a 25 bps rate hike by the RBI failed to dampen the bulls' spirits, who showed who was in-charge in the week gone by. 

On a weekly basis, BSE benchmark Sensex gained 0.58 per cent to end at 37,556 while NSE's Nifty added 0.73 per cent at 11,361.

""The gradual tightening by the RBI with a focus on maintaining balance between inflation and growth is a welcome sign. Moderation in crude price on the expectation of oversupply and better quarterly results is expected to extend the current positive momentum,"" said Vinod Nair, Head Of Research at Geojit Financial Services. ""Largecaps and consumption-related sectors which offer safety net for investors are likely to do well."" 

So, what's in store next week? Here's a look at major events that will shape the market in the week ahead. 


Next set of Q1 results: The coming week will see some of the leading names of D-Street unveiling their June quarterly numbers. Among big names, Adani Ports is lined up on August 6 while Mahindra & Mahindra will come out with its report card on August 7. Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Cipla, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Lupin and Siemens are all due to report their earnings on August 8. Aurobindo Pharma and Eicher Motors will keep their date with earnings on August 9. For GAIL (India), Hindalco Industries and State Bank of India, it's August 10.


India to impose import tariffs on US goods: According to a Reuters report, India will impose delayed tariffs on some US goods in September. Trade differences between India and the United States have been on the rise since US President Donald Trump took office. Bilateral trade rose to $115 billion in 2016, but the Trump administration is keen to bring down its $31 billion deficit with India and is pressing New Delhi to ease trade barriers, the report said. 


Sino-US trade war: Tit-for-tat tariff sanctions between the two largest economies -- the US and China -- on the trade front is likely to keep investors on edge. The Trump administration tightened pressure for trade concessions from Beijing this week by proposing a higher 25 per cent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Striking back, China on Friday unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft. 


US jobs data: US job growth slowed more than expected in July as employment in the transportation and utilities sectors fell, but a drop in the unemployment rate suggested that labour market conditions continued to tighten, Reuters reported. Non-farm payrolls increased by 1,57,000 jobs last month, still more than the roughly 1,20,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population, the report added. 


Monsoon progress: Monsoon rains will be normal in August and September, the India Meteorological Department said on Friday. ""The rainfall during August-2018 is likely to be 96 per cent plus/minus 9 per cent of LPA (Long Period Average) and expected to be higher than predicted in June,"" it said. However, Skymet has downgraded its forecast for this year's monsoon, stating that the country might receive below normal rainfall, citing the continuing warming of the sea surface in the Pacific Ocean.


HDFC AMC IPO listing: Shares of HDFC AMC will list on the bourses on Monday. The IPO, which ran on July 25-27, was a big hit with 83 times subscription. Experts believe that the stock will see strong listing gains. HDFC AMC is India’s most profitable fund house and made a profit of Rs 722 crore for the year ended March 2018 and ranks No. 2 by assets under management (AUM) in the local mutual fund industry.


What does the tech chart say?
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a large bullish candle, just a day after it made a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the daily chart, suggesting that the bulls were not ready to give up easily. “The uptrend shall remain intact as long as the Nifty50 stays above the 11,230 level, which can be regarded as a stop loss for all long positions. It looks prudent for traders to book some profits as we head towards the said resistance zone,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

This apart, trend in global markets, investment by foreign and domestic investors, the movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price movement are other factors that may have a bearing on investors' thinking in the coming week."

Its sales increased 16 per cent to USD 3.1 billion, driven by higher average aluminium prices, higher shipments, and more favourable product mix, partially offset by lower conversion premiums on some products, the statement said.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Bajaj Finance, Gravita India, Filatex India, Menon Bearings, Som Distilleries & Breweries, Maithan Alloys and RPG Life Sciences.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Market experts say the MACD alone may not be a sufficient indicator to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

24,2018-08-09,Hindalco,"Right now, we are not going for any long-term contract. It is a short- term contract which is giving the dividend, TK Chand, CMD, Nalco, tells ET Now. 
  
  
  Edited excerpts:

The outperformance from Nalco continues. Do you think more than the aluminium business, alumina or the ore business is really adding to bulk of the Nalco profits?
Nalco’s alumina arm is very strong and it is alumina profit which is pushing the profitability of Nalco. This quarter also, the PBT from alumina segment is Rs 1125 crore. Right now, in global market, aluminium is quite warm and we expect this revenue segment to be giving a decisive push to Nalco profitability.


What were the average realisations that you witnessed in both aluminium as well as alumina?
In Q1, the average realisation for alumina was $555. It is quite high and as far as aluminium is concerned, the average was around $2300. We expect that in the second quarter, alumina prices may be average and we may get around $520 or $530. The average aluminium price may come down but the profitability will remain high because of the alumina segment. Traditionally, Nalco’s strength is its alumina segment.


Your production volumes have gone up across bauxite and alumina and aluminium. What has been the average capacity utilisation? 
Right now, in case of alumina refinery we have more than 100% capacity utilisation. In fact, this year we are planning to produce 50,000 more than the capacity. That itself will be a big boost to profitability and as far as aluminium segment is concerned, right now we have capacity utilisation of around 93% to 94%. This time we are increasing 2% to 3% more because aluminium segment capacity utilisation is critically dependent on coal supply. Due to unavailability of coal, very frequently, capacity utilisation in aluminium segment goes down. Right now, we are importing power from the state grid because of non-availability of coal.


Volatility in caustic soda prices was responsible for the margin hit earlier. Has it stabilised? 
If we compare Q4 and Q1, there was only a marginal increase. By and large, the caustic soda prices have stabilised and in Q2, we expect that same level of prices will be going on because we have made a global tender and we have got the price which is just marginally higher than the previous price. As far as caustic soda prices are concerned, it will not have any significant dent on margin of alumina.


How much of your current production would you be able to sell in the spot market? How much is currently locked up in long-term contract?Right now, we are not going for any long-term contract. It is a short- term contract which is giving the dividend because long-term contract is linked to LME and the movement of LME is very slow. In case of spot market, we get a better price and last year we were in the spot market and this year also we will continue to be in the spot market. 

In Q1, we have sold 10 shipments and in Q2 also we are planning to also same level of 10 to 11. The spot market is better as far as alumina is concerned. Right now, the alumina market is marginally in the deficit and with Brazil producing around 45% of its capacity and also cuts coming in China, the alumina market has become quite warm. We hope that our strategy of continuing in the spot market would yield better dividend in the coming days as well.


The world is facing the heat of a trade war. Everywhere there is a fear that the China consumption may slow down and imposition of US taxes could have impact on global commodity demand. If I look at the trend in aluminium and alumina and what your counterpart Hindalco has reported, aluminium seems to be following a different kind of a cycle. Why is that?
As far as aluminium is concerned, the imposition of the tariff by USA has some indirect impact on India because bulk of the exports from China and Middle East are getting hit and now the obvious target market is Asia and India will be the obvious destination where consumption is taking place in a big way. 

I do not think that will be a problem as far as Indian aluminium industry is concerned we have a consumption level of 3.6 million tonnes and that is likely to be doubled in the next five to six years and will touch 7-8 million tonnes. Right now, the capacity right is only 4.2 to 4.3 million tonnes. Even if Nalco adds one more smelter, still the capacity will remain at 5-5.5million tonnes.

Therefore, between demand and supply, there would be gap still. The sub continental size of economy that India has, would be sufficient to support the aluminium consumption and there is really nothing to worry.

Rather, we are now trying to encourage creating more capacity in aluminium segment. At present, the market is a little subdued and because the power rates are quite high, it is becoming a little difficult. If you see the cost quartile. mostly in the first quartile. the low-cost hydro based smelters come and then the gas- based smelters come. Last, only thermal-based smelters come and in India most of the smelters are thermal based. 

We are also putting up our point before the government that some kind of a policy, particularly in the matters of energy should be taken in a power intensive industry like aluminium, so that aluminium can meet the requirement of the country. Otherwise, in the next seven to eight years. We will be spending around $15-20 billion in importing aluminium."

32,2018-08-11,Hindalco,"By Swansy Afonso

Indian billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Hindalco Industries Ltd. reported a jump in quarterly profit aided by a rising appetite for aluminum and copper in the world’s fastest growing major economy and better prices.

Net income was 4.14 billion rupees ($60 million) in the three months to June from 2.89 billion rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said Friday. Earnings fell short of analyst estimates of 4.4 billion rupees. Including its Utkal Alumina unit, Hindalco’s profit more than doubled to 7.34 billion rupees, while sales rose 2.5 per cent from a year earlier to 106.7 billion rupees.

Hindalco is benefiting from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” program that’s driving manufacturing growth and infrastructure spending, and boosting aluminum capacity and demand. Domestic prices of copper, which accounts for 20 per cent of Hindalco’s revenue, rose after the closure of a smelter belonging to rival Vedanta Ltd. sent buyers scrambling for supplies.

Adding to optimism are predictions this month by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that global metal prices are forming a bottom as China’s policy easing supports economic activity.

The company boosted profits because of a strong economy, higher prices and stable operations despite challenges from higher input costs and increased imports of aluminum and copper, it said in the statement.

Hindalco’s US unit Novelis Inc. earlier this week reported a nearly 10 per cent increase in first-quarter profit to $113 million from a year earlier. The company’s recent investments in North America and Asia along with the pending acquisition of Aleris Corp. will diversify its product portfolio and give it access to high-value, high-demand markets, it said."

  Edited excerpts:

Do you think there is a strong case for a re-rating in SBI after its numbers?
Any decline should be a buying opportunity. In the last two weeks, corporate banks have taken the lead from the front and whether it is Axis or ICICI. SBI numbers were well in line. They have done all the provisioning which was to be done over a year in one quarter. Mr Rajnish Kumar is a standout performer and he has guided for at least a Rs 50,000- crore write back in the next two to three quarters. I would buy any decline. If the stock price gets closer to Rs 285, start adding it in your portfolio. Bond yields have peaked and inflation and rates may maintain status quo for some time. SBI would definitely be a buy on all declines.


While a constrictive price action is visible in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India, there is no real evidence of credit growth. The fact that NPAs are coming down is great news. But what about the basic business? Banks are in the business of lending and the lending cycle has really not picked up.
That is the market expectation. Consumption and retail credit are strong points and private capex is going to be the next. The only obstacle is what would be the election volatility? Corporate results and macros are very positive. Whether it is IIP numbers, bond yields or overall GDP, it is telling us that most of the pessimism is behind us. Most of the banks have cleaned their balance sheets and now they are on the cusp of lending more. 

As for recapitalisation. SBI already has enough capital. It is just not retail or mortgage lending but the whole gamut of corporate expansion on private capex which is going to pick up. And markets are always forward looking. If you had to be a foreign fund manager and you were underweight India, the first thing you will do is catch liquid names. 

So ICICI, Axis banks stand out and the consumption part has always been expensive. It is going to be at a premium to the broader market that banks are going to take on the expectation that the next two quarters could surprise you on the upside on credit expansion and earnings could catch up over a period of time.


Would you say Hindalco and Tata Steel are the outliers within the commodities space?
Correct. It is Hindalco and on the ferrous side, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and SAIL are the outstanding plays. The idea is to buy the weakness in these stocks. Seven-ten days back, Hindalco was available at Rs 195 and that was when you had to go for the kill. Aleris was the buyout. Novelis is performing better than ever. It is the best historical quarter they have had and that tells us that they are the best plays on the global outlook. 

If they are doing an acquisition at this cycle which is just about to be peaking, then they can still see a lot of visibility on commodities for the next three-four-five years. I am extremely bullish on the commodity pattern and any decline in Hindalco, Tata Steel or a JSW, should be a buying opportunity. While Hindalco provided a buying opportunity at Rs 195, for Ashok Leyland, it is Rs 104 because of the axle norms and so on. That stock is again being an outperformer.


What is your top idea from the midcap space?
My top idea would be the consumption plays like Havells, Voltas, which have been outperformers. However, my dark horse sector continues to be power. We have been bullish on Adani Power from 22 levels. Now they have got the gas licenses. We think that could be a dark horse. CG power is something which we very much are bullish on from the Rs 58 level and we like some of the power financers. So, 74 and 95 is where we have been bullish on PFC. In REC, we still see a 30% upside.

Everyone, six months back was overweight on China and not highlighting the issues related to the trade balance. Now, what you have actually seen in EM selloff on currency is also the weakness in the offshore Chinese yuan. We have been an outperformer but we do not want to pat our backs. We will continue to see enlarged flows from the next quarter and this weakness in rupee will also be short-lived. So, the underlying mantra remains buy India on any fall because that could be an outperformer in 2019."

50,2018-08-17,Hindalco,"Currency depreciation is good for India because we have become uncompetitive relative to other economies, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, tells ET Now. 
  
  
  Apollo Tyre and Hindalco are his best picks at this juncture.Edited excerpts: 


How are you reading into the move by Maruti? As miniscule as it may be, they are beginning to react to higher commodity costs as well as currency fluctuations. They have hiked product prices across categories.
It is clearly a positive, considering that last quarter was marred by raw material cost increase. Going forward with currency depreciation, there could be further pressure on margins. Maruti being the leader is showing the trend and considering that the stock price is lower than a couple of months back, it could be a good opportunity to look at Maruti because they are likely to do better, given that the rural market is showing signs of improvement. 

Hopefully with the currency depreciating, one could see some improvement on the export side as well because last couple of years export has not been that great a story from India. It is overall a good thing that Maruti is increasing prices. It should be taken positively by the investors.


What is your take on SAIL? It is a local steel manufacturer. It has got nothing to do with what is happening in Europe or America. If at all, SAIL will benefit because realisations are linked to global international prices and because of weakness in rupee SAIL’s realisations should go higher. Should one buy the weakness in SAIL?
I am not sure one can completely delink because in the last quarter, we have seen that the import of steel from South Korea and Japan has drastically increased to the Indian markets. India now has become a net importer of steel which will clearly have an impact on companies like SAIL. 

Having said that, the main issue with SAIL over last couple of years has been the high employee cost that the company has been plagued with, considering it is a PSU. In terms of valuations, from a risk-reward perspective, one can look at accumulating this particular stock because the auto sector and the engineering sector growth is likely to be good. There could be some volatility because of currency movement and impact on global commodities. But one can look at buying these stocks.


Does it make sense to go beyond the largecaps and look at some of the smallcaps for a short-term trade?
Yes absolutely. We have been advocating the same for last couple of months -- whether it is Zensar or higher market cap -- something like a Tech Mahindra where the growth is going to be pretty decent going forward. These look like absolute buys to us at this particular juncture. It is not only to do with the currency depreciation but otherwise as well.

There have been some green shoots in the US banking (BFSI) space. Some of the bigger ones are still a little bit worried about the growth but in smaller ones, I have seen some kind of traction in terms of growth. One should invest in IT sector. It is a good sector to be in considering that global volatility is making people go for sectors which have more margin of safety. From that perspective, it is a good space to be in.


Where do you see the current account deficit balance pan out? Ruchir Sharma for instance in his interview this morning to Economic Times says the current account deficit is something that is being watched. Whenever we have a strong dollar, he says, it has never been good for developing economies like India. Do you sense that the current account deficit is going to weigh heavy on markets?
There is the risk of current account deficit going to around 3%. If you analyse the latest numbers in terms of export-import, exports have gone up by 14% whereas the imports are up by close to 28%. A large part of the increase in import has happened because we have seen the oil import number going up substantially in addition to what we are seeing on electronics plus more than 40% increase in case of gold imports. 

Currency depreciation is in fact good for India because we have become uncompetitive relative to other economies. In last four years, there has been hardly any growth in exports from India. Our currency has already appreciated by close to 20% and RBI last year tried to wane in appreciation of rupee. This year, if it trying to sell dollars to ensure stability in rupee, that is more or less fine considering where our reserves are right now. 

Currency moves in a sharp way and depreciation of rupee is quite healthy for the Indian economy. What Made in India was not able to do in terms of growth of engineering and core sectors, could see a rebound going forward as we see the benefits of the depreciation in the economy. The only negative could be inflation but if the crude price comes down, then overall it would be quite bullish for the economy.


What about some stock ideas which are still a conviction buy for you?
There is Apollo Tyre, where we are expecting to see a significant improvement in capacity utilisation at the Hungary plant as well as the robust growth in the commercial vehicle segment. Although there could be some small time impact because of the rains in Kerala in terms of the rubber plantation plus depreciating rupee, in next two to three quarters, the tyre sector should do pretty well. That could be an interesting stock to own at this particular juncture. 

In addition to that, from metal space, something like Hindalco also looks quite good to us at this particular price in terms of risk reward because the new acquisition is also likely to be EPS accretive. Further, getting into new products within automobile in the US market is likely to be pretty good for the company."

52,2018-08-18,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: When a clutch of foreign investors recently voted against the reappointment of Deepak Parekh, one of the senior-most persons in the corporate and financial world, for “over-boarding” — or, presence in boards of more than 6 companies — many, probably including Parekh and his team, were stunned, even outraged. First, corporate India has no law against “over-boarding”; second, does it really make a difference?

But there aren’t many who are on the same boat with Parekh. Among the non-executive chairmen in the list of BSE100 companies — the universe of Indian listed entities that primarily interest the foreign portfolio investors — only Kumar Mangalam Birla and Harsh Mariwala have presence in boards of more than 5 companies.

Do they have to grapple with a similar predicament as Parekh?

Harsh Mariwala (similar to Parekh) is non-executive chairman of Marico and Kaya (both group companies), and is on the boards of L&T Finance Holdings, Zensar Technologies, Aster DM Healthcare, JSW Steel and Thermax. In contrast, Birla is director only on the boards of his group companies.

While Birla declined to respond to queries from ET, Mariwala spelt out his views that possibly echoes the belief among corporates.

“I endorse the view that multiple directorships beyond a reasonable limit may pose challenges to a director in allocating sufficient time to the companies, thus hindering his ability to play an effective role. In light of which the Kotak Committee on corporate governance recommended a limit of seven listed companies for a director to hold positions in and the same has been enforced by Sebi through its recent amendments to the listing regulations. While global views on this differ as they treat a director having more than 5 public directorships as overboarded versus 7 public directorships which is the limit in India, investors need to give due regard to some of the factors like the capability of the individual serving the board, his contribution to the company, the needs of the board on which he serves and the depth and quality of executive leadership, when they (the investors) are insinuated with such views from the proxy firms,” said Mariwala, founder and chairman of Marico.



According to him, the law in India has already put many checks and balances in place to ensure that each director fulfils his fiduciary responsibility.

Birla and Mariwala each serve on boards of nine and seven publicly-listed companies, respectively. FPI holding in companies such as Idea Cellular, Grasim Industries, Ultratech Cement, Hindalco and Marico is more than 20%.

ISS, the global proxy advisory firm, had voted against Parekh’s re-appointment on ‘over-boarding’ concern since he served on boards of more than six listed firms. Explaining the reason for voting against the re-appointment of Parekh, ISS has mentioned in its voting recommendation report: ‘investors may be concerned whether directors are able to fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities when they are serving on a large number of boards, as in this case. While the demands of each board will vary, and the capacity of each person will vary, holding the equivalent of more than six directorships with publicly-listed companies may make it challenging for a director to devote adequate time to the affairs of each company’. None of the chairmen of companies from the S&P 100 and FTSE 100 indices serve on more than four and six listed companies, respectively.

These checks, said Mariwala, take various forms — public disclosure of attendance of directors, limit on his membership in board committees, board evaluation, recommendation of re-appointment based on the outcome of evaluation, succession planning, provisions on disqualification of directors, etc.

“Merely, a number on directorships may not necessarily hinder the capability of a director in fulfilling his duties but one has to evaluate the ends and means of a board before deciding if a person can be boarded or not to be boarded, else, it may go on to deprive a company from retaining a good leadership/independent directorship,” he said.

However, he agrees that corporates should take a cue from this to strengthen their disclosures as regards to matters like appointment or re-appointment of directors for investors as well as proxy advisory firms to take pragmatic views on such matters.

While the global norms consider more than six companies to be over-boarding, the Sebi regulations notified in May this year have a slightly higher threshold for individuals having board memberships in listed firms.

The newly notified Sebi (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 limits the number of directorship of a person to eight listed entities with effect from April 1, 2019 and not more than seven listed entities with effect from April 1, 2020."

56,2018-08-21,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: The June quarter earnings season has come to an end.

The overall results of the 50 companies in the Nifty pack witnessed a gradual recovery largely on account of smaller base in the year ago quarter. 

However, some took a hit to their profitability owning to currency volatility and pressure on operational performance given higher commodity prices. Moreover, PSU banks disappointed on the back of higher provisioning along with slippages and mark-to-market losses.

Among private banks, ICICI Bank reported its first quarterly loss (since its IPO) of Rs 120 crore.

In the non-BFSI segment, Grasim Industries (in net sales terms, second quarter in a row) and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (in profit terms) stood among the best performing companies.

69,2018-08-27,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks have been on an upward trajectory for five consecutive weeks now, despite less favourable global cues and a depreciating rupee.

During the week gone by, Sensex and Nifty rose 0.80 per cent and 0.75 per cent, respectively, with five of the 10 most valued companies – RIL, TCS, HUL, HDFC and Maruti – adding Rs 65,564 crore to their combined market capitalisation. On Thursday, Sensex scaled a record high of 38,487, while Nifty50 marked its all-time high of 11,620. 

This week is likely to be a volatile one, as August series futures and options contracts expire on Thursday. Moreover, there are some key macro data lined up for release during the week, including GDP numbers for June quarter, fiscal deficit data and infrastructure output data for July. All these factors will sway market this week.

However, analysts see stock-specific opportunities in pockets of the market. Based on their recommendations, here are 12 stock ideas that can potentially deliver healthy gains over the next 11-21 sessions. 


Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

BHEL | Buy | Target price: Rs 90 | Stop loss: Rs 74 
This stock has almost formed a higher bottom on the daily chart, taking support at the significant 50 DMA, which lies at around 72. The stock has been maintaining a positive bias. The RSI has also been on the rise, with the chart looking attractive. “We anticipate a decent rise from here on for the stock to scale Rs 88-90 levels in the coming days. With good volume participation, we recommend a buy rating on this stock,” Parekh said.


Cadila Healthcare| Buy| Target price: Rs 440| Stop loss: Rs 380 
This stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart at around Rs 332 level and has seen a decent bounce. It has moved past the previous peak of Rs 385, which is also the 200 DMA, thus signifying a positive bias. “We expect the stock to rise in the coming days. With RSI on the rise and good consistent volume participation, we recommend a buy rating on this stock,” Parekh said.


Gajendra Prabu, Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

India Cements | Buy | Target price: Rs 134 | Stop loss: Rs 114
The stock has validated the Hammer Candle pattern formed on the weekly chart in the previous week (moved above the candle’s high), which is the confirmation of a bullish reversal. The price is in a larger upward retracement leg from the low of Rs 97, in which two legs were completed and third rising leg is on the cards. Apart from this, it has formed higher top and higher bottom in smaller degree, which is a bullish Dow signal. More upside is expected in the coming days. In addition, the price is well above the key moving averages of 21 and 50-day EMA; and this could add strength to the bulls.


Tata Chemicals| Buy| Target price: Rs 800| Stop loss: Rs 690
The stock price has validated an Engulfing Bull pattern on the weekly chart in the previous week, which confirms a bullish signal. The price pattern has completed a major three-wave decline from Rs 782 to Rs 648 with an irregular “Wave B”. In that move, the stock has formed a double bottom around Rs 648. Interestingly, that is the zone for change of polarity. Now, the stock is in a rising leg from the low of Rs 648, which could head towards a new lifetime high. In addition, the price is placed well above the important 21-day, 50-day and 200-day EMAs, and this could add further strength to the bulls. 


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA

Hindalco Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 250| Stop loss: Rs 200
This stock peaked in the last quarter of 2017 in the Rs 280-284 range and after forming a minor double top, it was in a sideways trajectory. The stock has been consolidating in a broad range after having stalled its upward move. It has been forming a good base in the Rs 195-210 zone. Currently, it rests at its 100-WMA after pulling back from those support levels. The RSI is neutral against the price, showing no divergence, but it is marking higher bottom and moving out of a pattern. The weekly MACD has shown a positive crossover and is now trading above its signal line, indicating a bullish signal. The prices have pulled back after forming a reversal candle near its pattern support. Some upward move in prices cannot be ruled out. “We expect the stock to test its upper range of the channel. Any move below Rs 200 will be negative for the stock,” Vaishnav said.


TVS Motor Company| Buy| Target price: Rs 620| Stop loss: Rs 520
This stock has exhibited strong signs of an end to the corrective move and signalled a potential trend reversal. After peaking out near Rs 795, the stock has witnessed a corrective move over the past few months, while making subsequent lower tops. It is also showing signs that point towards a likely trend reversal. While the stock saw a sharp corrective decline, On-Balance Volume or OBV did not fall. The bottom is forming in the Rs 530-550 zone, and the recent pullback from the immediate lows has been accompanied with higher volumes. A fresh buy signal has emerged over Stochastic on the weekly charts with a bullish divergence against the price. An upward price revision cannot be ruled out over the coming days. Any move below Rs 520 will be negative for the stock.


Jay Anand Thakkar, CMT, assistant vice president- equity research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

Pidilite Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,210| Stop loss: Rs 1,120

Pidilite has seen a breakout from the downtrend line resistance and is moving in an upward sloping parallel channel. Momentum indicator MACD is in buy mode, both on the daily as well as weekly charts. The stock seems to have completed a Wave IV correction and wave V up seems to have started. “Hence, we recommend buying this stock,” said Thakkar.


Axis Bank| Buy| Target price: Rs 664| Stop loss: Rs 620
Axis Bank has seen a breakout form the symmetrical triangular pattern on the monthly charts with a buy crossover in momentum indicator on the monthly chart, which is an absolutely bullish indication for the medium term. With this, the stock seems to have completed a Wave IV correction and Wave V up has started.


Lupin| Buy| Target price: Rs 945| Stop loss: Rs 864
Lupin has formed an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the daily charts, and seems to have completed the right shoulder of the same. The stock has again started forming higher tops and bottoms, which is positive in the short to medium term. It is likely to test the neckline of the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the upside from here on. “Hence, we recommend buying this stock,” the analyst said.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

PowerGrid | Buy| Target price: Rs 207| Stop loss: Rs 184
After a multi-month correction from the high of Rs 226 registered in August 2017, this counter appears to have formed a durable bottom around Rs 174 last July. The subsequent rally from the low of Rs 174 to a recent high of Rs 194 also retraced 38.2 per cent, thereby creating a short-term bottom of Rs 184. If the trend has changed for good, then it should scale much higher levels in due course. Hence positional traders should buy this stock for an initial target of Rs 207 with a stop loss below Rs 184 on a closing basis.


Cummins India| Buy| Target price: Rs 798| Stop loss: Rs 735 
After a multi-quarter underperformance from the high of Rs 1,247 registered in August 2015, this counter appears to have hit a bottom last month at a low of Rs 613, as it tested the lower boundary of the two-year-old downsloping channel. Subsequent price action with sharp rallies suggests the counter is back on the radar of the bulls. Traders are advised to make use of the current correction to create fresh longs at current prices and add further on declines around Rs 740 for a projected price target of Rs 798. Stop loss is suggested for the trade below Rs 735 on a closing basis.


BHEL| Buy| Target price: Rs 97| Stop loss: Rs 75
This counter has registered a strong technical breakout on massive volumes above its 100-day moving average from where all the pullback rallies got sold off on multiple occasions in the past. Hence, sustaining above Rs 77 level can potentiality lift the stock to its logical target of Rs 99. Positional traders are advised to buy this stock for a target of Rs 97 with a stop loss below Rs 75 on a closing basis."

75,2018-08-28,Hindalco,"Pharma, insurance and power could be the dark horses of 2019, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, India Infoline, tells ET Now. Sun, ITC, 
  
  
  L&T, Hindalco and UltraTech are the five stocks that will prop up the market.Edited excerpts: 

We were just talking about the new leadership in the rising market. It has been about ICICI Bank, a comeback by Axis Bank and Reliance also has had a fair share of contribution. Do you think the next 500 points we be led by a new set of leaders or would leadership remain with corporate banks?
We are going to have a very early Diwali and Christmas and a Happy New Year, 12000 may be achieved before Diwali! Also 30,000 on the Bank Nifty seems very much seems on the cards. 

The leadership has clearly changed. You mentioned three stocks but we have been placing our bets on Sun, ITC and L&T. Those are now going to be the next prop up.

 ITC is leading the FMCG pack. It has gained almost 20% from the Rs 260-265 level where we have been extremely bullish. Sun is again in the eye of the storm as FDA investigations go on in the Halol plant. 

L&T has come out with a buyback and they are sounding extremely positive on the economy. So, with those three, you can add a Hindalco and UltraTech and you will have the perfect five that will give the leg up to the market. And yes, like you said, Reliance, ICICI are taking it from the front.


Which stock to your mind will lead the surge on the Nifty, so far it has been a rotation between Reliance, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, will this so-called trio of three horsemen will they continue to take the charge forward?
Correct. And these have been-- Reliance for five years was in a hiatus and now in one and a half year it has been the best performing stock with a Rs 8 lakh crore market-cap, looking set for a Rs 10 lakh crore market cap next year. If the going is good, follow the strength. 

And ICICI, Axis have been rerated after the change of guard and looking very good on the corporate side. 

State Bank of India chairman says most of the NPA resolutions are over, you should see write-backs. So for the first time, corporate India and corporate lending is on the cards. State Bank itself will be a very good contributor. We are also placing bet on three of the underdogs -- Sun, ITC, L&T. Hindalco looks set on the back of the Novelis buyout and that has been playing out brilliantly. We have seen a firming of both alumina and copper prices globally.


Do you have a view on Zydus Wellness?
No, I do not cover Zydus Wellness but I would say look at Pfizer. That stock has been on a tear and some of the MNC pharma are looking extremely good. Pharma, insurance and power could be the dark horses of 2019 and pharma will be an equal if not an outperformer contributor on the Nifty. 
You can look at the midcap MNC stocks but I have not covered Zydus Wellness in the near term.


Look Out for This Doubler in Next 2 YearAs the market rises, so do these stocks. It is quality that is sitting at record highs. What do you do with the names like RBL Bank?,Do you buy afresh? Do you profit take or continue to hold? 
A disclosure, we have had a positive coverage on RBL all the way from Rs 450. We think their branch expansion, management were extremely confident and their control of NPAs has been a standout. 

If I can be contrarian and suggest a name, it would be Capital First and IDFC Bank. They are getting shareholders’ approval by the first week of September and in next two months, the merger will be through. Almost two crore accounts are going from retail and the merger of MSME accounts. The franchise is good, Mr Vaidyanathan will take charge. The IDFC Bank management was clearly pathetic. There will be a new realm and that would lead to spurt in lending in both the MSME and the retail front. I am extremely bullish on this franchise and you could look for a doubler in the next two years.


The REC management is clearly of the view that the impact of Allahabad High Court provisioning will not be that large. The market reaction could be negative today but somewhere one should be a buyer in some of these power financing companies. If the industry makes a comeback, banks will be the first one to revive and after banks, the power sector will make a comeback?
Correct. As a disclosure, we have been very bullish on PFC, REC. There was a 8.5% dividend yield but we were chasing those around Rs 75 and Rs 100 on REC. 

In the price to book, dividend payout and the road forward, SBI itself has said that most of the provisioning has taken care of what the fallout would be. And this is not a one-day event. There will be a follow through from RBI, government, power ministry. In Delhi, 7,000 megawatts was consumed on a single day in June, the hottest and the maximum ever and there was not a single day of outage. 

The government discom is clearly indicating a 6% dividend, the first time in 16 years, given that transmission and distribution losses are at the lowest. If you have a one-year window, you could look for a 50% upside in both these power financers. Most of the woes are over and you will see a positive uptrend in banks and on the power sector.


In a market, where breadth is also opening up, consumer stocks are still at the top of the heap. The PE multiples for some of the consumer names are expanding as if there is no tomorrow. Are you telling your clients to book out of consumer names, if yes, which ones?
Yes, it is a difficult answer. We have told them to hold on. Some of our plays Nestle, Page Industries, Dabur, Exide have given much more returns than most people could have imagined. And the only way they have made money is by just holding on.

Even those three months which were painful all you had to do was to stay invested. It is not easy to time the market. I continue to think you will have less dependence on those stocks. 

Like you said, the brick and mortar stocks, look at cement, steel, infra and corporate banks. These are the ones with higher delta or higher beta and most of the public want to be in these type of names where there is more volatility. So, expensive will continue to remain expensive. I do not see them getting drastically cheaper but I do expect lot of rotation at least from mutual funds and foreign investors who will try to get into the riskier bets. 

You could be in for good times given that cement and mortar companies are going to be outperformers and industrial capex is seeming to be very much on the cards. Given that L&T has announced a buyback and continue to say that the next three, four years they could be looking to buyback their stock whenever the stocks seems to be undervalued, the return on equity will improve. It will be more of an institutional play and that would be reflected in the rotation of stocks."
76,2018-08-28,Hindalco,"Smallcaps are yet to see any respite from selloff despite the record-chasing run of benchmark Sensex and Nifty. This is best reflected in the performance of smallcap-oriented equity funds. 

Smallcap funds (down over 6 per cent on an average) have been the worst performers in last three months, followed by the funds focussed on the infrastructure sector (down 5.50 per cent), international opportunity (down 1.82 per cent) and midcaps (down 0.21 per cent).

Despite their underperformance, some 450 smallcap stocks figure prominently among the favourites of domestic mutual funds.

The biggest gainer among them is Merck, which has rallied 113 per cent so far in 2018. The scrip features in the portfolios of HDFC Smallcap Fund, Sundaram Select Micro Cap and IIFL Focused Equity Fund as of July 2018. 

NIIT Technologies (up 104 per cent) next on the list and is held by UTI Focussed Equity Fund, Reliance Small Cap Fund, Tata Ethical Fund and Principal Focused Multicap Fund. 

Among others, V-Mart, Muthoot Capital Services, VIP Industries, KPIT Technologies, First Source Solutions, Zensar Technologies, Astrazeneca Pharma, Intellect Design, Tata Elxi, Mastek, HIL, Orient Refractories, WPIL, Radico Khaitan, Emami Paper Mills, Zydus Wellness, Vinati Organics, Phillips Carbon Black, JK Paper, Garware Technical Fiber, Rajratan Global Wire and Sonata Software are smallcap stocks owned by at least two mutual fund schemes as of July end.

These stocks have gained in excess of 30 per cent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis till August 17. Companies with market capitalisation less than Rs 10,000 crore as of August 17 were classified as smallcaps for this writeup.

In terms of popularity, V-Mart Retail stood out, being part of portfolios of an entire batch of schemes such as Aditya Birla Sun Life Regular Saving Fund, Baroda Pioneer ELSS96, Invesco Multicap Fund, IDFC Sterling Value Fund, BOI Axa Mid & Small Cap Equity & Debt Fund, IDBI Small Cap Fund and ICICI Pru S&P BSE 500 ETF.

VIP Industries came next, with presence in the portfolios of Aditya Birla Sun Life Small Cap Fund, Canara Rob Equity Tax Saver Fund, Franklin India Smaller Cos Fund, LIC MF Tax Plan, Invesco Contra Fund, Reliance Smallcap Fund and ICICI Pru S&P BSE 500 ETF.

Other smallcaps such as Talwalkar Better Value Fitness (down 90 per cent), Vakrangee (down 89.28 per cent), KSK Energy Ventures (down 85 per cent), Jyoti Structures (down 80 per cent), Kwality (down 79 per cent) and PC Jeweller (down 79 per cent) were among the favourites of many mutual fund schemes as of July 2018, but each one of them has eroded wealth so far in 2018. 

It is possible that mutual funds have picked up some of these stocks recently after continuous hammering since the start of the calendar year brought them down to attractive levels, creating value buying opportunities.

For instance, Talwalkar is among the key holdings of Aditya Birla India GenNext Fund, Aditya Birla SL CPO Fund-Sr 30, Aditya Birla SL Dual Advantage Fund and Aditya Birla SL CPO Fund-Sr 29, while Vakrangee featured prominently among the portfolio holdings of Motilal Oswal Midcap 100 ETF, ICICI Prudential Midcap Select ETF, ICICI Prudential S&P BSE 500 ETF.

KSK Energy was part of ICICI Pru Midcap Fund, ICICI Prudential Infrastructure Fund, HDFC Infrastructure Fund and ICICI Prudential India Recovery Fund as of July end. 

Little-known Easun Reyrolle had investments from ICICI Prudential Infrastructure Fund and HDFC Infrastructure Fund as of July 2018, but the stock is down more than 60 per cent year to date.

“Midcaps and smallcaps, which had been beaten down since the start of the year, are seeing some traction, as mutual funds and other investors have started accumulating value picks. The fear and pessimism have created good opportunity in a few pockets for value investors. However, one must be cautious, because the kind of volatility and valuations that largecaps are commanding is unprecedented. One must go shopping cautiously and not pick up all the beaten-down midcaps and smallcaps blindly,” says Jimeet Modi, founder & CEO of SAMCO Securities, StockNote.

Nitasha Shankar, Senior VP, Research, Yes Securities, said the Nifty has been running up because of select stocks. “If you look outside this space, there has actually seen quite a good beating down. So, valuations have become extremely attractive in that space, both midcap and smallcaps, wherein you can pick up good stocks, especially in the consumer, retail and agri segments,” she told ETNow.

Benchmark indices are scaling fresh record highs on a regular basis, buoyed by firm global cues and sustained foreign fund inflows.

Here are the top stocks to bet on this week.NextHindalco | BUY | Target Price: Rs 250 27 Aug, 2018The stock peaked in the last quarter of 2017 in the 280-284 range and after forming a minor double top saw itself in a sideways trajectory. The stock has been consolidating in a broad range after having stalled its up move. It is seen forming a good base in 195-210 zones and presently it rests at its 100-wMA after pulling back from those supports. RSI is neutral against the price showing no divergence, but it is seen marking higher bottom and moving out of a pattern.

Weekly MACD has shown a positive crossover and it is now bullish while trading above its signal line. The prices have pulled back after forming a reversal candle near its pattern support. Some up move in prices cannot be ruled out and we can see the stock testing its upper range of the channel. Any move below 200 will be negative for the stock.NextTVS Motor Company | BUY | Target Price: Rs 62027 Aug, 2018The stock has exhibited strong signs of end of the corrective move and a potential reversal can be expected. After peaking out near 795, the stock witnessed a corrective move over past either months while making subsequent lower tops. Presently, it has shown signs which point towards likely reversal of trend. While the stock saw a sharp corrective decline, On-Balance Volume – OBV did not decline. The bottom is seen forming in the 530-550 zones and the recent pullback from the immediate lows have been accompanied with higher volumes.

A fresh buy signal has emerged over Stochastic on the Weekly Charts with a bullish divergence against the price. Upward revision in prices over coming days cannot be ruled out. Any move below 520 will be negative for the stock.NextTOrrent Power | BUY | Target Price: Rs 29527 Aug, 2018After marking highs near 300-odd level, the stock has been under large range-bound correct move. Though it has remained in a broad trading range, it has formed a slightly skewed symmetrical triangle formation and is seen attempting to breakout of this range. While the stock corrected, the On-Balance Volume – OBV did not decline. This is a positive sign. The RSI has seen breaking out of a formation and is also seen marking higher bottoms and inch higher.

A big white candle occurred near strong pattern support area with higher -than-average volumes which also marks a potential reversal. A positive crossover is seen on the Weekly MACD and it is now bullish while trading above it signal line. Minor consolidation within this range cannot be ruled out but higher price moves can strongly be expected. Any move below 220 will be negative for the stock.NextABB | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,48027 Aug, 2018After marking high near 1615, the stock attempted to breach that previous high. Though it managed to mark the levels near 1743, that breakout failed, and the stock slipped into corrective downtrend. It is seen forming a base in the 1150-1225 and is seen moving up again. While the stock corrected, the On-Balance Volume – OBV did not fall and now it has reported a fresh high which is a bullish sign.

Weekly MACD remains in a continuing buy mode. RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high and shows a bullish divergence against the price. It is also seen breaking out of a formation making higher bottoms. The prices have closed above the upper Bollinger Bands. There are chances that the prices pullback a bit temporarily inside the band but in most likelihood, the breakout is expected to continue. Any move below 1250 will be negative for the stock.Next"

1,2018-09-03,Hindalco,"Automobile and pharmaceutical companies have emerged as big beneficiaries of the commerce ministry's export incentive scheme 'MEIS' as they have received the major portion of the disbursals.

Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), the government provides duty benefits at different rates depending on product and country.

Rewards under the scheme are payable as percentage of realised free-on-board value and MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties including the basic customs duty.

The top 10 companies that have obtained maximum disbursals during 2017-18 under the scheme includes JSW Steel (Rs 301.5 crore), Ford India (Rs 272.8 crore), Bajaj Auto (Rs 246.5 crore), Dr Reddys Lab (Rs 240.6 crore), Aurobindo Pharma (Rs 211.3 crore), Mylan lab (Rs 192.9 crore), Hyundai Motor India (Rs 189.3 crore), Vedanta Ltd (Rs 180 crore), Lupin Ltd (Rs 155 crore), and Nissan Motor India (Rs 150 crore).

The other firms which have gained from the scheme include Tata Motors, Hindalco Industries, Hetero Labs, Maruti Suzuki India, Cipla Ltd, Reliance Industries, General Motors India and Shahi Exports.

Similarly in 2016-17 also, companies from automobile and pharmaceutical sectors topped the chart in getting the maximum benefit under the MEIS.

In 2017-18, the ministry disbursed about Rs 31,000 crore to exporters under the scheme, while it was over Rs 23,000 crore in the previous fiscal.

Going ahead, the government may have to change the scheme as it was challenged by the US in the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement system.

The US had alleged that such incentive schemes were harming American companies and they are not in compliance with the global trade rules.

Government officials have earlier stated that they may look at reviewing the existing export incentive schemes to ensure that they comply with the WTO norms.

The US had alleged that thousands of Indian companies are receiving benefits totalling over USD 7 billion annually under various export promotion programmes."

29,2018-09-11,Hindalco,"Prospects are bright for this Chennai-based export oriented auto ancillary company, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


Are IT and pharma the only story now or should one seriously look at metals?
I would tend to agree with you. We have been playing the IT right for last couple of months and still believe that there is more upside because clearly on the rupee side, whatever level one talks to, it keeps on going down. 

On metals, Rusal is a key trigger that is likely to be there for the market in next one month or so. If the sanctions against Rusal return, that could create some kind of a panic in the market for some time. One needs to look at that but coming in from valuation perspective, something like Hindalco looks quite attractive as the domestic industry is doing pretty well with less emphasis on imports and a better integrated model relative to something like Vedanta. 

Novelis is also likely to do pretty well going forward with the exposure to the auto sector and the Aleris acquisition also playing well. 

I would say that in addition to stocks like Aurobindo Pharma, where the acquisition of Sandoz’s businesses could bring in additional earnings of close to around 17% by FY21, IT, pharma and metal would be the best suited right now considering where we are right now.


Is it time to log out of some wholesale NBFCs – be it Shriram Transport or Bajaj Finance or Cholamandal?
There is going to be an increased pressure on NBFCs which are looking at funding from the short-term maturity. We have seen a plethora of fund raising from the market over last couple of years led by belief of people that interest rates are going to come down and reduce their cost of funds. But there is clearly a duration risk for NBFCs. I would say for sure that though the growth opportunity in terms of loan growth still remains, on the margin, I would see a cut in earnings for all the wholesale NBFCs going forward because market liquidity is pretty tight. 

If you look at the overall situation, around $220 billion of short-term liabilities are likely to be met by March 2019, which if they are rolled over, could put further pressure on the yields. From that perspective, considering the tightness in bond market, one needs to be more circumspect about which particular NBFC to invest in so that some of these NBFCs might look good at a decent price or something like Shriram Transport could be very attractive at the price of around Rs 1100, considering that the growth opportunity on the commercial vehicle space is good. From a valuation perspective, the stock looks good. 

Other than that, we would be more bullish on the non-financial space at this particular juncture until we see further reduction in the bond yield from these elevated levels.


What is going to happen to HDFC Bank, HDFCs, Bajaj Finance?
An exuberance was clearly seen in these stocks. Nothing has changed at least on the loan growth fund for these companies. However, with the rising bond yield, clearly NBFCs are likely to be under pressure because of higher cost. We have seen Bajaj being able to give rates at significantly lower rates to what competition was giving in market leading to significant growth in AUM. 

The impact of bond prices going up will have to be faced by even Bajaj Finance. Depending on where bond yield rate, one could see analysts revising estimates down for such companies by at least 8% to 10% for this remaining period during this year. That is clearly being reflected in the downgrades that we are seeing in these financial companies over last couple of days. So, it is a good story. It is a good stock to own but the price needs to be reasonable and somewhere close to around Rs 2,400, it will be quite an attractive stock to buy, considering that the growth opportunity going forward on the consumer finance side is pretty good for the company and their ability to cross sell products is significantly better than anyone who is there in the NBFC space, as of now in the market. 


Any stock ideas which you think can be bought in this current market decline?
One idea which I am really bullish right now is not from the IT, pharmaceutical or the metal pack. It is from the auto ancillary pack -- MM Forging, which is one of large export oriented forging companies from Chennai. Two-thirds of the sales of the company are from exports and with the kind of traction that we are seeing in overseas market for truck sales and significant increase in order book for the sector, this company is going to do pretty well.

Even on the domestic side, we are seeing the HCV segment continuing to do well on the back of tailwind of rupee depreciation as well as good domestic growth. Earnings growth in this particular company could be at least 25% CAGR going forward and with the valuation being relatively cheap at around 13 times, this is a very good stock to own at this particular juncture, looking at companies which will directly benefit from currency depreciation."

  Investment Advisor, tells ET Now. Mavani also says in midcaps, he likes all three gas distribution companies as also auto ancillaries.Edited excerpts: 


Where are you finding value now?
In a falling market, seemingly it may look attractive but for next couple of weeks, it is best to sit on the side lines and one of the reasons is that historically when we look at the movements on the currency markets, basically INR-USD, whenever the currency has been weak, markets have corrected very sharply in a very short timeframe. 

The rupee in the 72-73 band, does not augur well for equity markets. And again, it is not that rupee has found stability. So, rather than sticking my neck out on taking a call on where the equity markets would go, I would be looking more at INR movements and any further weakness in rupee means weakness in the equity markets as well.


Would you look to trade or invest in the currency sensitives? Would exporters be a theme that you would look at or would some of the paint companies or cement (RMC) costs actually go higher and you could look to either profit taking or selling into those names?
Two things. The first segment which you mentioned was the exporters. What comes to mind is obviously is the IT and pharma and some part of manufacturing which has sizeable exports. 

The IT sector, in the shorter term, will be an area of strength amidst overall weakness in the whole markets but over a period of time, with currency movements, even they are adjusting prices. This year will be good for technology companies because rupee earnings will be higher. They have 10% bonus in terms of earnings coming just from the currency translation but obviously that will not last forever. But in the short term, it will be an area of strength.

Coming to paints which is import sensitive, it is also crude oil sensitive and that is trending higher. The paints sector is dominated by four players controlling more than 90% of the market and they have tremendous pricing power. When you look at over five, ten-year periods, the margins do not see any blip or impact of the currency, despite the currency having gone from 39-40 levels to 72 plus levels today. But margins of Asian Paints or Berger Paints or Nerolac have stayed in a range. So, going forward also, price adjustments, end consumer price adjustments will happen.

In the shorter term, there may be an impact in the current quarter and next quarter depending upon their booking of the raw material and ability to pass on price increases or revisions. But I am not so much concerned about the paint sector specifically. I would look to buy the weakness as far as Asian Paints is concerned. 


There are two other segments which are bound to get impacted by a) the crude spiral up and b) the currency weakness. These are high debt companies like Jain Irrigation, Jet Airways, Bharat Forge, Hindalco, Tata Power and Bharti Airtel among others. Would the case be weaker for some of these names in the backdrop of the currency weakness?
Well absolutely. In a few of the companies you mentioned, like Jain Irrigation, even if the currency had not depreciated, or a Jet Airways for that matter, the performance had not been anything to write home about. 

I mean, there has been general weakness in their business performance. The currency only makes it worse. In case of Hindalco and Bharat Forge, one cannot really draw a straight line or connect the dots directly because they have dollar denominated debt. It is negative for them because at the same time, they also earn in dollars. So earning in dollars and interest outgo in dollar terms, may cancel out depending on what kind of repayment and servicing commitments they have on an annual basis versus annually how much they earn in foreign currency. 

But in case of a Bharat Forge or a Hindalco, I do not see the situation to be as grim a Jet Airways or a Jain Irrigation.


On the point of crude, though OMCs at this point would be the obvious short as they get negatively impacted, is that a trade you would look to make?
I would stay away from OMCs in any case. The trade in OMCs was fantastic in 2017. In 2018, basically there is really no trade to look for as far as OMCs are concerned with or without crude simply because they had run up a bit too much, number one. 

Number two, so long as the current government does not have a policy regarding fuel prices like the previous government where they were made to bear the subsidy burden both in the short term and long term and there were cash flow mismatches. Actually things are not so bad for the OMCs in that case. 

If crude prices continue to stay at elevated levels but at the same time, the retail prices or the end product prices of petrol, diesel, aviation, kerosene etc are also revised upwards so that they are not in a losing proposition, then I will be neutral on that. And at least at this point of time, that is what seems to be the scenario. But the closer we get to the elections, my sense is they will probably be not as good for the OMCs. 


In all the cases which are pending in NCLAT, minus the debt, the assets are very productive. Is there any particular business or story that you particularly fancy if they were to win an asset? I am not talking about Maharashtra Seamless but any of the bidders?
I have tried to find value in some of those -- whether it is Electrosteel or Bhushan or Essar. The argument that is being made out that minus the debt, the business is good but then I do not think things work out so smoothly in this country because of two-three reasons. Debt alone was not the problem. The problem in most cases is also the viability of the businesses with or without debt.

Again, if we were to assume the best-case scenario that banks were to take 100% writeoff and you start on a clean slate with the asset which is available and which is right now ideal, I am absolutely certain and this is a feedback I have got from some of the corporates which have looked at some of these assets is that even without debt, some of those assets probably are not viable for various reasons. Either the cost structure if those assets were to put to running or were not viable, maybe the technologies are outdated. I would give this a miss in terms of an opportunity, if at all there is an opportunity. 

There are a whole lot of other good quality stocks that one can look at which have been correcting very sharply. I have been noticing NBFCs today seem to be singled out as a sector for some bit of pasting and all of them are down anywhere between 5% and 10%. So, why not look at some of those sectors where growth opportunity is sustainable and you really do not have these kind of other issues to deal with. You are only dealing with the price correction in the market.


So any favourites there or would it be the obvious, Bajaj Finance?
Well, yes. Bajaj Finance is a must have but I would also look at a Mahindra Finance because if we were to recollect on your programme, rural is the theme in terms of next 12 to18 or 24 months and Mahindra Finance is best placed to take advantage of that situation. The other is Cholamandalam Finance which also has a fair bit of rural play plus it has the other parts of the financial services business of the group, basically the Cholamandalam Group. That is another one which I would look at.


What are some of your top midcap ideas right now?
In terms of the new ideas, if I were to deploy money at this point of time then Mahanagar Gas, Indraprastha Gas and Gujarat Gas -- basically the gas distribution business is what appeals to me. All the three companies in this sector. I will also put a disclaimer. I already have an interest in Mahanagar Gas both for myself as well as on behalf of clients. I am also looking to add IGL and Gujarat Gas over a period of time. 

The other space is autos, not necessarily midcaps, but Bajaj Auto and Maruti are other two stocks that I would be looking at. Among the midcaps, within auto ancillaries, there is a company called JTEKT. It used to be Sona Koyo Steering. Then the Sona Group exited and now it is a Japanese company and they have renamed it as JTEKT which basically is into shock absorbers and suspension systems for passenger cars. 

Maruti also has a holding in this company is a sort of a co promoter and even Suzuki has a little holding in JTEKT. At Rs 135-140, I see significant opportunities in terms of business transformation over the next two, three years with margin expansion likely to play out."
32,2018-09-12,Hindalco,"The selloff in the domestic equity market has dragged the benchmark Nifty over 3 per cent down in September so far. The index slipped to 11,287 on September 11 from 11,680 on August 31.

In the process, more than 20 stocks in the Nifty50 index have slipped below their 200- day moving average (DMA). The list included Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Eicher Motors, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco Industries, HPCL, IOC, Maruti Suzuki, Power Grid, Tata Steel and Vedanta. 

On the Nifty500, as many as 344 stocks or as much as 69 per cent of the index pack, now trade below their 200-DMAs, reflecting intense selling pressure across sectors. 

Other stocks trading below this crucial support line include ACC, Aditya Birla Capital, Aegis Logistics, Ashoka Buildcon, Avanti Feeds, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bajaj Electricals, Birla Corporation, Emami, Engineers India, Finolex Cables, Godrej Properties, Indiabulls Housing Finance and MMTC, among others. 

Moving averages normally help market participants analyse an emerging trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance points.

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major DMAs or daily moving averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is said to be in a continuing uptrend. 

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections make stocks test their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause a stock not only to test the 200 DMA but also slip below it.







“Without doubt stocks quoting below their 200-day moving averages are sentimentally weak, suggesting that they are in a long-term downtrend. However, as the bull market remains intact at this point, if any scrip from the largecap space or midcap space with promising fundamentals is trading below its 200-day moving average, it can be considered as an investment opportunity,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

“We advise traders to read 200 DMA only as one a tool to gauge long-term trends, but not as a trading tool, unless a particular scrip has a history of testing its 200- day moving average and bouncing back. Often, we find scrips or indices yo-yoing around these averages which don’t help take a near-term trading call,” Mohammad said.

NSE’s Nifty index traded almost flat at 11,300 in morning deals on Wednesday. 

In the recent corrective move that the market has seen after marking a high at 11,760, there were many stocks ruling at or below their 200-DMAs. These stocks present an attractive opportunity for value purchase. While doing so, investors need to exercise some discretion, said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“Not all such stocks that rule below 200-DMA may offer value buying opportunity. While attempting to make a value purchase, one will need to remain highly sector specific and pick stocks only from those sectors which are showing an improvement on the relative momentum front,” Vaishnav said."

36,2018-09-13,Hindalco,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 322.

The current market price of Hindalco Industries is Rs 237.75.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Hindalco Industries price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by Motilal Oswal Securities:
Revenue increased 15 per cent in FY18, driven by 2-8 per cent volume growth across segments and a 21 per cent increase in LME prices. Indian aluminum smelters witnessed a revenue loss of USD74/t due to hedging. Product premiums have stabilized, indicating there is no incremental pricing pressure in the Indian aluminum space.

Cost of production (CoP) for aluminum smelters increased by USD224/t (Exhibit 4), largely driven by a rise in raw material cost and wage hikes. CoP of alumina at Utkal increased by USD16 to USD186/t, which is still most competitive in the world. Conversion cost for copper smelters was stable at USc21.6/lb.

EBITDA increased 11 per cent to Rs 138b (Exhibit 7), nearly 71 per cent of which is insulated from volatility in LME (Exhibit 8). Novelis’ EBITDA grew 8 per cent, equally driven by expansion in margins and volumes. Benefiting from coal and bauxite mining integration, aluminum EBITDA increased 20 per cent, despite a hedging loss and an increase in CoP as LME prices increased 21 per cent.

Interest cost declined sharply by 32 per cent to Rs 39b, led by (a) full benefit of annual savings of USD79m on refinancing of USD4.3b at Novelis in FY17 and (b) pre-repayment of debt in India. HNDL reduced its gross debt by Rs 123b (including prepayment of Rs 79.7b) during the year. Adjusted PAT increased 121 per cent to Rs 42b.

Rs 6.7b was provided in wage cost toward various future benefits. Total unfunded defined benefit obligation (DBO) remained unchanged at Rs 59b. MTM value of quoted equity investments is Rs 65b.

Book value increased more than EPS on fair value gains of Rs 30b.

Cash flow from operations (CFO) before working capital (WC) changes increased 6 per cent to Rs 127b. WC increased by Rs 18b due to a marginal increase in the cash conversion cycle and growth in both prices and volumes.

Free cash flows (FCF) increased 59 per cent to Rs 73b, while net debt declined by Rs 65b to Rs 400b. Return ratios are trending up. RoCE (pre-tax) improved 110bp to 9.3 per cent, which we believe will increase to 10.4 per cent in FY20, even after integrating the leveraged acquisition of Aleris.

We expect EBITDA and EPS CAGR of 15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, over FY18-20, driven by growth at Novelis and the acquisition of Aleris. Higher LME and Rs depreciation will benefit the Indian business. By FY20, RoE is expected to improve by another 70bp to 13.5 per cent, while RoCE (pre-tax) is expected to increase by 110bp to 10.4 per cent.

HNDL has a very strong balance sheet, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.9x. Management’s focus has now shifted toward growth in the downstream business. The stock is trading attractively at EV/EBITDA of 5.9x FY20E. We value the stock at Rs 322, based on 6.5x EV/EBITDA and book value for CWIP."

38,2018-09-16,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: Aditya Birla Group flagship Hindalco Industries will seek shareholders' approval for the issue of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on private placement basis for aggregating Rs 6,000 crore at its forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM) next week.

The company seeks shareholders' approval for raising around Rs 6,000 crore through NCDs on private placement basis in order to augment resources for the ongoing capital expenditure, repayment of existing loans, and for general corporate purposes, according to the company's annual report.

""To further bolster the balance sheet, the company has prepaid close to Rs 8,000 crore of long-term project loans in India. This has led to a significant improvement in the consolidated net debt to EBITDA at below 3x at the end of March 2018,"" Hindalco chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said in shareholders' note.

The current net debt stands at Rs 15,000 crore.

Birla pointed out that the ongoing government initiatives such as the creation of 100+ smart cities, thrust on infrastructure, especially rural infra development, along with 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' will continue to support the demand for aluminium and copper.

He noted that although India's GDP growth slowed from 7.1 per cent in FY17 to 6.7 per cent in FY18, the economy recorded a seven-quarter-high GDP growth of 7.7 per cent in the exit quarter of FY18.

""This reflects momentum. Investors seem to be positive on India's economic prospects. The foreign direct investment (FDI) flows continue to be encouraging,"" he said.

The prevailing sense of optimism accentuates India's continuing economic growth in the future as well.

It is attributable to the country's solid fundamentals, such as deleveraging by corporates, resulting in much stronger balance sheets, better capacity utilisation with consumption demand becoming stronger and insolvency and bankruptcy process weeding out non-performing assets, among others.

Birla, however, warned that the near-term challenges, including concerns like rising oil prices, hardening inflation, firming bond yields and widening current account deficit, cannot be ignored.

He also pointed out the ongoing global trade frictions, particularly between the US and China, are worrisome and can have a spillover negative effect on countries like India.

""The terrain ahead could be a tad bumpy depending on the economic and geopolitical environment,"" Birla added."

42,2018-09-17,Hindalco,"India has initiated an anti-subsidy probe into increased imports of select copper wire rods from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam following complaints by domestic players including Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Industries.

The commerce ministry's investigating arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in a notification stated that there is ""prima facie evidence"" of existence of subsidies on production and exports of 'continuous cast copper wire rods' in these four countries.

Such subsidised imports into India are causing material injury to the domestic industry through their volume and price effects, it said.

""The authority hereby initiates an investigation into the alleged subsidisation and consequent material injury and threat of injury to the domestic industry,"" it has said.

In the probe, the directorate will determine the existence, degree and effect of alleged subsidisation and to recommend the amount of countervailing or anti-subsidy duty, which if levied, would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.

Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Industries (Sterlite Copper) had filed an application on behalf of domestic industry before the DGTR alleging subsidisation of the products from these four nations and requested for initiation of an anti-subsidy investigation.

The petitioners have alleged that the producers/exporters of the goods in these countries have benefitted from the ""actionable subsidies"" provided at various levels by the governments of these countries, including the their different provinces and municipalities.

The period of investigation is 2017-18 (12 months). It would also cover the data of 2014-17.

Countervailing duty is a country specific duty which is imposed to safeguard domestic industry against unfair trade subsidies provided by the local governments of the exporting nations.

India has already imposed countervailing duty as well as anti-dumping duties on various kinds of steel from China to protect domestic players, which are facing problems."

Nearly 72 percent of Indian business travellers feel pressured to work longer hours when travelling for business. But it’s not just all work for them, as 91 percent view business travel as a time to re-energise both professionally and personally. In fact, 90 per cent say business travel has taught them skills they can use to solve challenges in their personal life. And when you don’t have home responsibilities to take care of, many in the survey said that they indulge in a little pampering. Around 61 per cent of biz travellers try local cuisine and 33 percent admitted to binge watching TV.

63,2018-09-19,Hindalco,"WASHINGTON: Keeping up with emails may be preventing bosses from achieving their goals and being good leaders, a study has found.

The research, and published in Journal of Applied Psychology, is one of the first to examine how distractions from email impact managers, their productivity and their role as leaders.

According to the researchers from Michigan State University (MSU) in the US, employees spend more than 90 minutes every day - or seven-and-a-half hours every week - recovering from email interruptions.

""Like most tools, email is useful but it can become disruptive and even damaging if used excessively or inappropriately,"" said Russell Johnson from MSU.

""When managers are the ones trying to recover from email interruptions, they fail to meet their goals, they neglect manager-responsibilities and their subordinates don't have the leadership behaviour they need to thrive,"" said Johnson.

What further makes managers different from other employees is that when feeling overwhelmed and unproductive because of email demands, they recover by limiting leader behaviours and pivoting to tactical duties.

This action is strategic and intentional so that they feel more productive, Johnson said.

""We found that managers scaled back 'leader behaviours' more so than initiating 'structure behaviours',"" Johnson said.

""The former behaviours relate to motivating and inspiring subordinates, talking optimistically about the future or explaining why work tasks are important; the latter are more concrete and task-focused, such as setting work goals, assigning duties or providing feedback,"" he said.

Not only are managers not managing -- but they are also focusing on smaller tasks for the sake of feeling productive.

To test how email demands hinder managers, researchers collected surveys from a group twice a day for two weeks.

Managers reported their frequency and demands of emails, their perceived progress on core job duties, how often they engaged in effective transformational leader behaviours and initiating structure leader behaviours.

""We found that on days when managers reported high email demands, they report lower perceived work progress as a result, and in turn engage in fewer effective leader behaviours,"" Johnson said.

Beyond failing to complete their own responsibilities, email distractions cause subordinates to suffer from a lack of leader behaviours, or those that motivate and inspire.

""When managers reduce their leader behaviour and structure behaviours, it has been shown that employees' task performance, work satisfaction, organizational commitment, intrinsic motivation and engagement all decrease, and employees' stress and negative emotions increase,"" Johnson said.

Leader behaviour has a strong correlation to employee performance which, unfortunately, were the behaviours that got put on the back burner because of email distractions.

""The moral of the story is that managers need to set aside specific times to check email. This puts the manager in control - rather than reacting whenever a new message appears in the inbox, which wrestles control away from the manager,"" Johnson said.

62,2018-09-19,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities ended in the negative territory for a third consecutive session on Wednesday on losses in bank, FMCG and tech stocks, even as global stocks advanced for a second day in a row and rupee recovered against the US dollar.

Market opened in the green and traded with mild gains for the most part of the day, but lost steam in late afternoon session, eventually closing in the red.

The 30-share Sensex finished 169 points, or 0.45 per cent, lower at 37,121, with 14 stocks in the green. The NSE Nifty suffered a loss of 45 points, or 0.39 per cent, settling at 11,234, with 27 stocks advancing and 23 declining.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices trailed benchmark Sensex, falling by 0.72 per cent and 0.98 per cent.


Let's take a look at the highlights of Wednesday's session:

Rupee gained some ground
Indian rupee recovered on Wednesday by rising 58 paise to 72.38 against the US dollar on fresh selling of the US currency by exporters and banks. Weakness in the dollar against other currencies and easing crude prices in the global market helped the domestic currency rebound. 


Sensex movers and shakers
HDFC twins contributed over 100 points to the fall in Sensex. IndusInd Bank, Maruti, ITC and Reliance Industries also featured among top drag. In terms of percentage loss, IndusInd Bank (3.03 per cent), Maruti (2.30 per cent), HDFC Bank (1.58 per cent), YES Bank (1.44 per cent) and HDFC (1.35 per cent) were the top five losers.

Metal pack bucked the trendEven as market ended the day on a dull note, metal pack dazzled on reports that the government was to raise import duty on some steel products to 15 per cent. Another media report suggested that the US may exempt Indian steel and alumimium from the higher tariff regime announced by President Donald Trump's administration this March. But the exemption is likely to come with riders. The BSE Metal pack climbed 1.25 per cent, with JSW Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, Nalco and Hindalco among top gainers. 


Sugar stocks ralliedAfter approving a hike in ethanol purchase price by up to 25 per cent, the government is likely to raise minimum selling price for sugar to Rs 32,000 per tonne for the 2018/19 season from Rs 29,000 in the current season, Reuters reported.

China's Shanghai SE Composite Index and Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed over 1 per cent. French, German and UK stocks too were in the green at the time of writing this report.

Kumar Mangalam Birla, the billionaire chairman of the acquisitive Indian conglomerate that bears his name, said he’s hungry for more deals after creating the nation’s biggest mobile-phone operator.

His Aditya Birla Group continues to look for targets in the US, Europe and India that make business sense and are likely to add value, the 51-year-old said at Bloomberg’s India Economic Forum on Sept. 18 in Mumbai. He didn’t specify any names.

Birla, who runs a $44 billion conglomerate that sells everything from insulators to insurance, helps illustrate India’s emergence as a mergers-and-acquisitions powerhouse, with transactions involving local companies setting records by exceeding $100 billion this year -- a trend that PwC India predicts will continue in 2019. One main driver: banks are tackling bad loans by putting companies owned by defaulters on the block.

That’s because the nation’s central bank is pushing local lenders to restructure an estimated $49.3 billion of soured loans in the wake of a new bankruptcy law implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration.

“This government is starting to address it and taking the bull by the horns,” Birla said. “Bad loans have been around for a long time and just got brushed under the carpet.”

Though he didn’t name targets, Birla’s track record indicates he won’t just be spectating the expected flood of assets that will be put up for sale.

His companies have carried out scores of deals, with recent one being Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd.’s merger with the local unit of Vodafone Group Plc to create India’s biggest carrier. In July, his Hindalco Industries Ltd. announced the purchase of Aleris Corp. for about $2.6 billion to tap global automotive metal demand. UltraTech Cement Ltd. is also seeking to buy distressed Binani Cement, though that pursuit is in a legal wrangle.

Part of Birla’s appetite for deals is because of his optimism about India’s economy, which he likened to an elephant that’s starting to run. Gross domestic product grew 8.2 percent in the June quarter from a year earlier, the government said last month.

“You can’t ignore India,” Birla said. “There’s no legitimate reason for not investing in India.”"

65,2018-09-20,Hindalco,"Accel partner Subrata Mitra opened up about the one failure which he will always remember, the decline of 'Chakpak'. Mitra spoke about the factors responsible for it and the lesson he learnt from this experience. 

“Chakpak [a film news portal]. It was an early internet company and also one of the early engagements for me at Erasmic Venture Fund [the firm he co-founded and which became part of Accel]. Cofounders Nitin Rajput and Gaurav Singh Kushwaha made rapid progress after our seed investment. Soon it was a famous brand among the large moviegoing audience in India. It caught the attention of Canaan Partners, and we raised a decent series A. The failure, however, came when the founding team started to waver on how to make decisions, which path to take, etc. It came to a point where they couldn’t work with each other. This quickly created a downward spiral that we couldn’t get out of. My team and I spent a lot of time with Chakpak in the early days. The company returned significant money to investors and finally shut shop. What I learnt from my experience was that no matter how good the founders may be, team-related issues can derail any startup.”

64,2018-09-20,Hindalco,"Edelweiss Financial Services has a buy call on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 307.

The current market price of Hindalco Industries is Rs 235.95.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Hindalco Industries price can reach the defined target.


View of the brokerage on the company:

At the cusp of transformation: The acquisition of Aleris at an attractive valuation (7.2x FY21E EBITDA) is an important milestone in HNDL’s journey—overseas downstream operations’ foothold in the aerospace segment would complement its global leadership in the auto segment. Besides, HNDL’s earnings would get increasingly independent of LME volatility due to Novelis and Aleris. Management believes that it might take almost two years to integrate Aleris, implying HNDL will be in a consolidation phase until then.


Robust model- EBITDA stability and balance sheet strength: We are positive on the stock as: 1) more than 70 per cent of consolidated EBITDA is expected to be LME-neutral; 2) VAP would drive domestic business’s incremental growth; and 3) net debt/EBITDA to be maintained less than 3x post-Aleris consolidation in two years.


Outlook and Valuation- Trumping macro concerns; Maintain ‘BUY’: We are upbeat on the HNDL stock in light of management’s focus on downstream products and the increasingly neutral earnings impact to LME cyclicality. On revised USD:rupee estimates, our FY19E/FY20E EBITDA has risen 13 per cent each while we trim the domestic multiple to 6.5x (from 6.8x) as we expect an unfavourable macro environment to suppress valuations. Maintain BUY with revised target price of Rs 307, implying exit multiple of 6.6x FY20E EBITDA."

Instead, he’s wearing a white shirt and jeans, perhaps reflecting his personality, fuss free and to the point. And thankfully, Patel isn’t wearing a mask. His heart is on his sleeve.

The quick-witted Patel says his life has been a “unique rollercoaster”. Home-schooled in South Africa, where he grew up surrounded by circus performers, Patel studied to become a doctor. Instead, he set up a liquor distribution company in Mumbai, before getting the idea for Mswipe (a portable card payment device) in 2011. Since then, his company has raised $31 million from Ratan Tata’s UC-RNT Fund. And late last year, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin of B Capital invested $10 million into the Mumbai-based company.

In an interview with ETPanache, Patel talks about growing up in Africa, business lessons he has learnt and why entrepreneurs always need to learn new tricks.

AgenciesPatel says that his life has been like a rollercoaster ride

Wine, medicine and tech — you’ve had a varied career. How do you know when to identify that something is or isn’t for you?
I don’t think of it as a change in careers. I have always pursued what I have liked to do. Life has charted out a nice journey for me, and I have played along. A lot of these things seem reckless at times but there is a lot of thought that goes into it. I need to enjoy what I am doing and I need to be solving a problem. What you see are only the projects that have worked out, there have been some failures as well.


You grew up in Africa in a circus. What was that like?
My dad owned a circus. It made for a very interesting childhood as I was home-schooled. For me, school was wandering around the circus camp. I would interact with the artists. The only thing I really retained was this one act I would watch every single day and I never got tired of it. One performer had a big bowl of water with four goldfish and he would swallow it all. And I would say ‘Wow!’ And then he would regurgitate it back in the bowl and the fish would all be alive. I don’t know why but that has really stuck with me (laughs). Another favourite was this dog who had the ability to do math.

If you had to describe your life now, who would you be — the juggler, the clown or the ring master?
None of the above. I would like to think I am a little like Darth Vader with an Imperial Fleet at my command.


Did you learn anything about people or business at the circus that you use today?
I’m not sure if I was old enough to take away lessons. But I did in retrospect. It taught me that nothing in life is constant. You need to evolve, and over the years the pace of change has only gotten faster. If you can’t adapt to that, then you’re not really going to have fun. I’ve seen it from my father’s work in entertainment. When cinema got more affordable and widespread, no one went to the circus anymore. As a consumer, you can enjoy the ride but from the business side of it, you have to adapt.


How do you deal with change?
People are not scared to change, they are scared of learning. You need to learn new tricks.


Mswipe received $10m in funding last year. How did you react when you heard the news?
(Laughs) I always knew the news was coming. It wasn’t one of those things where I was waiting with baited breath, wondering whether Eduardo was going to say yes. There was no reaction moment, as it was an evolution. He has ambassadors who sent a message. So, it grows on you rather than blowing you away. The whole process took about five months.

We started working by late 2010 and by New Year’s, we were very close to the launch. However, due to some urgent work, the key person who was working on the payment gateway’s code had to leave.

  How closely is Saverin working with you? What is the one thing he said that has stuck with you?
I am learning a new approach to business in newer economies. I have always done business in a conservative and typical fashion. But the approach that Silicon Valley has is different. When it comes from people who are putting money where their mouth is, I feel that I should give it some more thought and try to implement models adapted for India. 
Scale is also something he [Saverin] said that has stuck with me. The second is that you need products which are simple in a way that the common person can work with. A lot of the engineers come to the table with overengineering. What they need to understand is that there is no engineer on the other side, only normal people.

68,2018-09-22,Hindalco,"Mumbai: The ongoing global trade war, especially between the US and China, could have a spillover negative effect for India, chairman of Aditya Birla Group Kumar Mangalam Birla said on Friday. He also expressed concern over the rising aluminium scrap imports into the country.

Birla also said that with copper imports going up to make for the deficit, the company does not stand to gain from the closure of Vedanta's 400,000 tonnes copper plant in Tamil Nadu.

He also identified rising oil prices, hardening inflation, firming bond yields amid widening current account deficit as areas of concern in the near term.

“The ongoing global trade friction, more so between the US and China, is worrisome. It can have spillover negative effect on India,” Birla said at the annual general meeting of group company Hindalco that is one of the major producers of aluminium and copper in the country.

""Since there is a tariff imposed on Chinese imports into the US, there is a threat of those imports finding their way into India,"" Birla said in response to multiple shareholders' questions regarding the health of the company amid the trade war unleashed on the globe by the US.

The chairman's concern is not unfounded. With the imposition of a 25% import duty on US scrap imports by China, diversion of scrap into India has led to a 128% increase in scrap imports between the first quarters of last year and this year, according to data by the Aluminium Association of India. In volume terms, the figure has now reached 36.2 kilo tonnes.

""Half of the country's consumption of aluminium is met sadly through imports,"" Birla said."
69,2018-09-25,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: August was a tricky month for domestic equity fund managers, as there was a spike in redemptions and a marked slowdown in flows to equity-linked funds, thanks to fragile investor sentiment amid US-China trade war, emerging market contagion and a rupee depreciation.

Amid such volatility, fund managers were busy buying some of the Nifty stocks such as Adani Ports & SEZ, Vedanta, Tech Mahindra, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC and Asian Paints, data showed. 


Top MF picks in volume terms

Adani Ports, where each of 18 funds held 2 per cent or less, saw the holding of the institutional category rise 15.4 per cent by the end of August from that in July. MFs held 3.95 crore Adani Ports shares at the end of August.

Some 18 funds raised their cumulative holding in ITC by 11.9 per cent in August from that in July. Among others, Tech Mahindra (up 11.9 per cent), Indiabulls Housing (up 10 per cent), HDFC (up 6.6 per cent) and Asian Paints (6.3 per cent) witnessed good buying by MFs during the month.

Bharti Infratel, TCS, Grasim Industries and Hindalco were other Nifty stocks that saw brisk buying by mutual funds during the month.

While inflows to equity funds rose 9 per cent month-on-month to Rs 28,300 crore by August end, redemptions surged 66.1 per cent month-on-month to Rs 22,400 crore. Net inflows to equity and equity-linked funds during the month stood at Rs 5,900 crore against an average of Rs 8,900 crore seen during the March-August period, data showed.


Increase in MF holdings in value terms

There were also counters where mutual fund holding rose in value terms, primarily due to a rise in stock prices. Six of the top 10 stocks that saw a largest change in mutual fund holding in August were from financials and technology sectors, said Motilal Oswal Securities.

BSE Bankex gained 2.4 per cent during the month, and BSE IT index 7 per cent. The Sensex gyrated in a 1,900-point range during the month, while Nifty50 swung in a 500-point range.

77,2018-09-28,Hindalco,"Nischal Maheshwari, CEO, Institutional Equities & Advisory, Centrum Broking, talks to ETNow about how one should look at Yes Bank and the NBFCs after correction and his top bets in metal stocks. Edited excerpts: 


Is Yes Bank in a value zone after corrections or an avoid? 
The uncertainty will continue till we find out who is going to lead it. But I agree that at 1.2 time, 1.3-1.4 times price to book to FY20, the stock is in a value zone. One may come back and say that if something new comes out of the system and there is a bit of kitchen sinking, that might put the stock down for some time. But definitely, it is in a value zone at around 1.3-14 times current price to book and 18% to 19% ROE. One should accumulate the stock at current levels.


On top bets in metal
Tata Steel continues to be our top pick given that they have got Bhushan Steel as well as Usha Martin in their fold now. It is going to increase their leverage but given that the outlook remains very strong, there can be a significant increase in profitability for both the acquisitions that they have made. Their Europe problem is getting sorted out. So, Tata Steel at 5.2 times EV to EBITDA FY20, seems to be in a very good spot. 

On the non-ferrous side, we like Hindalco and also some of the smaller names like Tata Metaliks and Tata Sponge. A lot of these companies are doing pretty well and seem to be on a good wicket. Some say that cycle seems to have peaked out. We are in the middle and there is some more way to go as far as the metal cycle is concerned.


Should one buy beaten down names like Indiabulls Housing or DHFL?
Definitely. Both these names have corrected quite a bit and definitely and are very good value at these prices. Panic has been set in the market. Three-six months later when we once again sit back and look at it, maybe people will think that these were opportunities to go out and look at these stocks. As far as housing finance is concerned, I do not see a major issue as far as NPAs are concerned. 

There may be some short-term liquidity issues but I do not see any big NPA issue. We have a long history of housing finance in the country and both these companies have very seasoned books. Dewan is a 40-year-old company, Indiabulls is more than 150 years old. I do not see any reason for such panic in the market. These are good prices to look at these stocks."

In 2014, Russia Today viewers were taken aback when anchor Liz Wahl announced her resignation mid-broadcast because she could no longer ‘be part of a network that whitewashes the actions of Putin’. During her on-air resignation, Wahl elaborated on the ‘ethical and moral challenges’ she faced as a reporter for a news network operating out of Russia. “My grandparents came here as refugees during the Hungarian Revolution ironically to escape the Soviet forces and that is why personally, I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government,” she said.

Tired of the “toxic and destructive” culture at Goldman Sachs, executive director Greg Smith penned a scathing op-ed for The New York Times in which he not only ended his 12-year career with the firm but called them out for placing profits above customers. “The firm has veered so far that I can no longer in good conscience say that I identify with what it stands for. I knew it was time to leave when I realized I could no longer look students in the eye and tell them what a great place this was to work,” Smith wrote. The same day, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and COO Gary Cohn issued an internal memo refuting the claims.

Quitting doesn’t need to be difficult or elaborate. Sometimes all you need are six words and a furry blue friend as aspiring puppeteer Gwen Dean proved during the 2014 Super Bowl. Pairing up with GoDaddy for a 30-second commercial that aired in front of 111.5 million people (including Dean’s boss), Dean announced that she was leaving an 18-year career in machine engineering to pursue her lifelong dream of working with puppets. Those six magical words that set her free: ‘Hi Ted, I quit. Ciao baby.

When you’re faced with the urge to quit, sometimes it’s more prudent to just jump in. During a tech event in 2016, BookMyShow cofounder Ashish Hemrajani recounted how he mistakenly texted his boss his resignation while on a backpacking trip through South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana in 1999. “I was on my youth hostel bed and I sent the most expensive message worth `186 to my boss, and said I was quitting,” he recalled. According to Hemrajani, he had spent the better part of the day at a wine tasting and it didn’t quite register what he had done until the next day.

13,2018-10-03,Hindalco,"KOLKATA: A strong air of optimism rules the outlook for metals sector as a whole led by solid demand environment, favourable pricing scenario, strong cash flow generation and focus on deleveraging to improve the balance sheet, according to Centrum Research.

The brokerage hosted an exclusive investor conference titled ‘The Metal Medley’ on the metals sector in Mumbai recently, which brought together some 16 companies covering all sub-sectors like ferrous, non-ferrous, pipes, refractories, graphite electrodes and other ancillaries.

Listing out the highlights of the meet, Centrum said in a report that large cap ferrous names sounded optimistic on demand and signalled strong focus on capacity creation. While investors were concerned that deleveraging would be taking a backseat with renewed focus of the companies in undertaking capex for both organic and inorganic expansions, companies sounded confident of balancing the cash flows and also expected the current cycle to sustain in medium term. Pipe companies were confident about sustenance of strong order inflow and robust earnings which is expected to result in strong cash flows. This will be utilised for either deleveraging or expansion of product basket, the report added. Ferrous consumables like electrodes and refractories indicated robust volumes and strong earnings growth driven by strong underlying demand and solid entry barriers in their businesses, while strong midcap ferrous companies were in the midst of finalising their expansion plans as they boast of strong balance sheets and are running at optimum utilisations, it added.

Sharing its recommendation, the Centrum report said: “In largecaps, we remain positive on Tata Steel and Hindalco in ferrous and non-ferrous pack respectively. We like Coal India in the large cap mining space. Among midcaps, we like Vesuvius India and IFGL and are positive on select ferrous midcap stocks like Tata Metaliks and Kirloskar Ferrous due to their strong business model and growth prospects.”"

17,2018-10-04,Hindalco,"Brisk selling in the domestic equity market since the beginning of September has not spared even a single sector, as all BSE sectoral indices have plunged up to 24 per cent between August 31 and October 4.

Starting with the underperformers, the BSE Realty index has tanked the most at 23.85 per cent. It was followed by Auto (down 17 per cent), Bankex (down 13 per cent), FMCG (down 12 per cent), Capital Goods (down 10 per cent) and Power (down 10 per cent).

BSE benchmark Sensex has slipped 9 per cent so far.

The automobile industry witnessed divergent trends in September; while the commercial vehicles and two-wheelers segments registered robust volume growth, four-wheeler volume was flat.

“For the four-wheeler segment, demand was impacted by slightly negative consumer sentiment and postponement of demand to the festive season,” Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report. Shares of Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have slipped up to 20 per cent in the recent market correction.

Financial stocks came under pressure after IL&FS group surprised the Street with a series of defaults. Selling of NBFC debt by mutual funds exaggerated the selloff. 

“The market has been seeing a sharp selloff on account of depreciation in rupee and higher crude prices. This negative sentiment was further reinforced by the fear of liquidity crisis to support credit growth following the IL&FS scare. We believe that the long-term story of markets remains intact,” said Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research at YES Securities.

A falling rupee aided information technology stocks during the same period. The BSE IT index lost 2.63 per cent during August 31 and October 4. The Metal index has dipped 2 per cent, while Healthcare, TECk and Oil & Gas indices have declined 8 per cent, 4 per cent, and 3.80 per cent, respectively, since August 31.

Losses of metal stocks capped downside followed strong base metal prices on London Metal Exchange. 

“The fall in the market should be treated as an opportunity to accumulate fundamentally strong companies where valuations have corrected to attractive levels,” said Shankar.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch sees some more pain the market. The global financial sevices firm’s year-end target for BSE Sensex at 32,000 implies another 11 per cent plunge from Wednesday’s close. That would put the gauge 2.5 per cent away from a bear market – a 20 per cent slide from its August 28 record. 

With a fall of over 60 per cent, Infibeam Avenues and Rolta India emerged as top losers in the BSE sectoral indices. 8K Miles Software (down 47 per cent), Indiabull Real Estate (down 41 per cent, Kwality (down 40 per cent) and YES Bank (down 38 per cent) have been other top wealth destroyers.

18,2018-10-05,Hindalco,"Nifty 50 companies are likely to report 11.4 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit for the September 2018 quarter. At 7.4 per cent, profit growth in the previous quarter had fallen below 10 per cent after three consecutive quarters of double digit growth. Revenue is expected to grow by 11.6 per cent in the September quarter, which would be the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Growth in revenue and profit in the year-ago quarter was 11.6 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.

Improving trend in the financials of top companies may offer some solace to investors amid a sharp drop in benchmark indices over the past few weeks. S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have lost over 7 per cent in a month. The current market turmoil is likely to result in mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio of companies, especially banks and finance companies. Its extent is difficult to measure at the aggregate level but may cause some pressure on the bottomlines.

Select companies in the automobiles, banking and finance, consumer goods, mining, and IT sectors are likely to support overall growth of the sample. The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by 18.8 per cent in the September quarter, faster than 15.2 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin is likely to expand by 60 basis points to 21.6 per cent.




SECTOR TREND

AUTOMOBILES
Two-wheeler companies are likely to drive earnings growth of the sector for the September quarter due to sustained volume growth despite many disruptions. The floods in Kerala and new rules of registration in Bengal did impact the volume growth. The volumes of Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto grew 6 per cent and 26 per cent, while that of Maruti Suzuki fell by 1.5 per cent during the quarter. The operating margins may shrink by 50-100 basis points due to higher input prices.


BANKING, FINANCE
Banks with higher exposure to corporate loans such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank may show deceleration in new bad loan recognition for the September quarter. Other banks with greater retail exposure such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank are likely to report sustained momentum in advances. Rising interest costs may put pressure on margins. In addition, mark-to-market losses on investments may widen due to a sharp fall in the stock market.


CAPITAL GOODS
A sustained order flow from the government should support the growth of capital goods companies. Project execution is picking up as most of the slow moving orders are out of the system. The order inflows momentum of Larsen & Toubro shows that it will be able to meet its order inflow and revenue growth guidance.


CEMENT
The September quarter is again expected to be driven by volume growth rather than price increase.

Cement volumes of the top five players by capacity Ultratech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to increase by 10-25 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter. Their revenue is likely to grow by 8-15 per cent while net profit may drop due to higher pet coke prices.


FMCG PREVIEW
A gradual recovery in rural demand may support the performance of FMCG companies. However, a below normal monsoon remains a concern. Companies are likely to raise product prices to pass on the higher input costs.


IT
A sharp depreciation of 4.3 per cent sequentially and 8.1 per cent annually in the average rate of the rupee against the dollar and momentum in projects on the digital platform will be the key growth drivers for the sector in the September quarter. TCS and HCL Technologies are expected to fare better while Wipro may continue to face pressure on the topline.


PHARMA PREVIEW
The September quarter performance of pharma companies is likely to indicate the bottoming out of price erosion in the US generics market. In the absence of any major launch in the US, companies are likely to report lack-lustre performance. There has also been rationalisation in the R&D expenses. The management commentary on the business prospects in the US market would be crucial.


METALS & MINING
Base metal companies such as Hindalco and Vedanta are likely to see a subdued quarter due to flat product prices year-on-year. LME aluminium prices were 2-3 per cent higher while LME zinc prices were down 10 per cent . A weak rupee would partially offset these negatives. JSW Steel and Tata Steel are likely to report decent quarters due to firm steel prices and weak rupee advantage.


POWER
Although monsoon is seasonally the weakest quarter for the sector, power companies are likely to report good growth. Power generation may grow by 6 per cent year-on-year. Higher merchant tariffs will help. It may turn out to be a decent quarter for a sector which has remained weak for the last several years.


TELECOM
The competitive pressure will continue to eat into profits and profitability of the telecom operators. Which means the commentary may not be much different for the second quarter compared with the past several quarters."

YES Bank has named former IRDA chief TS Vijayan and former SBI chief OP Bhatt as external members in the search committee. The five-member panel will also consist of board members Brahm Dutt, Lt Gen (Retd) Mukesh Sabharwal and SC Kalia, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

NBFCs cracked; DHFL at 52-week low Shares of a select non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) plummeted after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its policy meet on Friday said it may strengthen guidelines for such entities to avoid risks. Extending the losing streak into a fourth consecutive session, shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) plunged 25 per cent, touching its fresh 52-week low of Rs 205 on BSE today.

28,2018-10-09,Hindalco,"Indian aluminium stocks, including Hindalco, NALCO and Vedanta, plummeted on Monday after Alunorte, the world’s largest alumina refinery, secured the Brazilian government’s approval to begin operations.

With the Brazilian facility now open, the market believes that alumina supplies from South America would take away the advantage India’s backward-integrated aluminium producers enjoyed in the weak aluminium price environment.

Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro, which owns the 6 million tonne (MT) refinery Alunorte in Brazil, will now be allowed to operate 3 MT. Since its closure earlier this year, alumina prices have jumped 75 per cent, despite the sharp correction in global aluminium rates. Prices of the finished metal are down 6 per cent in the year to date, and 16 per cent from their peak.

Despite this, Indian players such as Hindalco, NALCO and Vedanta saw no meaningful impact in their margins from the rise in alumina price. While the rupee correction partially offset the weakness in aluminium rates, rising global alumina prices gave them a competitive edge.

These companies are either fully or partially backward integrated. In fact, NALCO produces more alumina than it consumes for its own metal output. Roughly 2 tonne of alumina goes into producing 1 tonne of aluminium. Hindalco, with 3 MT alumina refining capacity and 1.3 million aluminium capacity, was fully integrated. Vedanta, with around 1.6 MT alumina capacity and 1.3 MT aluminium production, was net short of alumina. NALCO was net long, by contrast.

The recent development will lead to a correction in global alumina prices and NALCO being net long alumina is likely to be the most hit. Hindalco, which uses alumina for captive consumption, will lose the advantage to other aluminium producers and may have to compromise on margins if metal prices fall. Vedanta will be the least affected. Also, for Vedanta, zinc and oil are larger earnings contributors, with aluminium accounting for only 17 per cent of EBIDTA.

On Monday, NALCO, Hindalco and Vedanta stocks corrected 6.4 per cent, 7.7 per cent and 10.8 per cent. The sharp fall in Vedanta was further intensified by high open interest in the stock on the long side."
29,2018-10-09,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: A small pullback in the benchmark equity indices in Monday’s trade following three days of battering raised hopes of a possible recovery, but technical charts suggested it might just be a dead-cat bounce. 

Analysts said any bounce at this stage may be shallow and traders must exercise caution. 

But all is not that gloomy.

There are a handful stocks that look strong on the charts, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The technical indicator signalled upward crossover, which is a bullish signal, for at least 15 stocks, hinting at possible upsides for these stocks.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Among the stocks that signalled such bullishness are Titan Company, Talwalkars Better Value Fitness, Bhansali Engineering Polymers, Aster DM Healthcare and Gujarat Pipavav Port.

Others included Viceroy Hotels, Tijaria Polypipes, Morarjee Textiles, Take Solutions and Gokul Agro Resources.



The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Among the stocks that witnessed this bearishness were metals majors Vedanta and Hindalco Industries, natural gas transmission company Gujarat State Petronet, maker of defence products Astra Microwave and AC generator TD Power Systems.

Others included Cyient, Vikas Ecotech, Indian Terrain and Kilitch Drugs.



That said, the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation ratio.

Market veterans say the MACD alone may not be good enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

On Nifty50, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan, said the impulse structure looks incomplete on the way down on the daily chart. Thus, any bounce is likely to be a shallow one. 

The Nifty50 is on the verge of seeing a bounce from the lows, but the sustainability of the upmove is doubtful, said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. 

Shetti said the 10,500-550 zone is going to be a strong overhead resistance for the index. The Nifty50 has completed an impulse on the hourly chart.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in, meanwhile, said the intraday recovery appeared to be on the strength of a few largecap stocks, which attracted value buying at lower levels. 

“Going forward, pullbacks shall remain vulnerable to unexpected selling pressure, as multiple hurdles are placed on the way to the 11,000 mark. In case this pullback materialises, the first hurdle shall be at 10,547 level,” Mohammad said. 


Understanding MACD 
 A close look at the stock chart Titan Company shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show an downward momentum and vice versa.

On Monday, the stock rose 2.7 per cent to close at Rs 813.45 on NSE."

  Soul
“I would recommend that everyone read the 'Bhagavad Gita;, or at least parts of it. It teaches you about life, but in a very open-ended way. It doesn’t tell you things but encourages you question them yourself. I was inspired to take up meditation after reading it, which is now something I try to practice as often as possible — though not as much as I should. Meditation creates serenity and calm that helps me deal with life’s ups and downs. It helps me switch off recharge. It also boosts creativity. It encourages me to look at projects (and sometimes myself) more objectively and tap into deeper thoughts and emotions.”

“Even a bit of exercise can encourage your body to release moodenhancing chemicals like endorphins, which improve your self-esteem and reduce anxiety. Getting out in nature is great for mental health — surfing or even just taking the dog out for a walk are some of the things I enjoy doing. I find taking an hour to focus during stressful or challenging times, is a great way to clear your head.”

“I know that if I take care of my body, it will take care of me. My voice is the first thing to go when I am feeling run-down, which is not good when I am spending hours singing in the studio. I mix up my fitness routine to keep it fun. Sometimes I’ll do weights and cardio in the gym, but I prefer classes like Pilates or kickboxing. I love yoga too. When I am back home in Mumbai, I’ll always set aside some time in the week to play football with my friends. I’ve finally found places to play in London and LA too, which has been great considering all the travelling I have been doing with my music this year. I try to exercise five times a week for about an hour, but I’m not always successful because I am on the road. People shouldn’t beat themselves up if they miss a day. Exercise should make you feel better about yourself, not worse.”

47,2018-10-22,Hindalco,"This is a movement that is gaining momentum, but is still under the radar. It has caused ripples in the boardrooms and in the annual shareholder meetings but companies in India are yet to get a handle on it.

The dissent brewing in a section of institutional shareholders can no longer be ignored. In recent months, they have been voting according to a pattern against resolutions seeking approval for the appointment of venerable names who are synonymous with the companies they lead.

To be sure, they are yet to draw first blood or scalp anyone.

The AGM season for corporate India saw existing foreign portfolio investors take their shareholder rights more seriously as they dissented against key proposals floated by some of the largest Indian legacy companies.

Aditya Birla Group chief Kumar Mangalam Birla’s reappointment as director was dissented by institutional investors in two companies of the $44 billion conglomerate.

Cement major UltraTech informed the Bombay Stock Exchange on October 5 that 38 per cent of its institutional investors had voted against the reappointment of Kumar Mangalam Birla as director at its AGM held on July 18. Then, aluminium major Hindalco’s notification to the exchange on October 12 that 18 per cent of its institutional investors had voted against his reappointment exacerbated the worries, even though the final tally at both companies was in favour of Birla. Hindalco’s AGM was held on September 21.

These institutional investors did not spare the Tata Group either. In July, 67 per cent of institutional investors were enough to turn down a special proposal floated by Tata Sponge Iron to continue its relatedparty transactions with parent company Tata Steel — a move that put the company’s survival into jeopardy. The company had to stomach the embarrassment before it decided to assuage misgivings of shareholders and go for the second round of voting, when the proposal was passed with near-100 per cent voting.

This was around the same time that the reappointment and remuneration of Tata Steel executive director and chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee was given a thumbs down by 16 per cent of the company’s institutional investors. However, the proposal was approved.

The Aditya Birla Group as well as Tata Steel refused to comment.

According to proxy advisory firms, Birla’s reappointment was questioned because he sits on the boards of nine companies when Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations limit the number at seven listed companies. Multi-boarding, as it is informally called, restricts a director’s capability to devote equal time and energy to each board that he sits on. Attendance is another factor.

Annual reports of the companies for 2017-18 show Birla attended four out of five board meetings held at Hindalco and four out of six at UltraTech last year.

While this score may not appear startling when looked at in isolation, foreign fund houses, guided especially by foreign proxy advisory firms like Glass Lewis and ISS Governance, expect an almost 100 per cent compliance rate on such parameters. In Birla’s case, however, the jury is divided.

“Institutional investors, mostly foreign ones, are mistaken if they are judging his reappointment on this basis. In our view, these are all his group companies that need his presence. The buck stops at him,” said Amit Tandon, founder at Institutional Investor Advisory Services.

Another expert said the nature of companies does not matter and in the West, such resolutions command a 100 per cent favourable voting. Fund houses like California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), which manages the largest public pension fund in the US, are known for writing letters to companies to let them know that they are under their strict watch.

Both Hindalco and UltraTech have a high percentage (27 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively) of shareholding with foreign investors. Europacific Growth Fund and Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, each with more than a 1 per cent stake in UltraTech, hold significant sway over the company.

“The recent events at the group’s AGMs are reflective of the increasing corporate democracy in the country and it is expected to evolve,” said a person close to the Aditya Birla Group. “The group has acknowledged the trend and will now consciously engage with proxy advisory firms in India and abroad to understand their point of view,” he said.

“We had observed last year as a tipping point for shareholder activism and it will only grow,” Shriram Subramanian, founder at proxy advisory firm InGovern, told ET.

In 2017, 10 per cent of resolutions tabled in AGMs of top 100 companies had a significant percentage of dissenting votes, which is quite high compared with any of the previous years, according to a report by the firm. Directorial appointments and their remuneration were the most scrutinised proposals by investors last year. This is only expected to grow.

“Companies need to enhance their sophistication in understanding shareholder behaviour. The age-old mode of doing analyst and investor meets does not seem to work anymore,” Subramanian said.

Earlier this year, shareholder behaviour had rattled the market when HDFC’s Deepak Parekh, 74, saw 23 per cent of total shareholders dissent his reappointment as non-executive director of the company on attaining the age of 75 next year, even though the final math tilted the scales in his favour.

More recently, Neeraj Kanwar’s reappointment as managing director of Apollo Tyres was turned down at the company’s AGM on August 1 over the high compensation he was drawing. The company is now in the process of engaging with shareholders before they call for another round of voting. “The board will now seek shareholder guidance and independent counsel on a compensation level commensurate with the position. Once this process is complete, it will re-nominate Neeraj Kanwar to be re-appointed as managing director, effective May 28, 2019,” the company said in a statement issued on October 3."

This proposal is to set up the unit in the premises of existing aluminium smelter plant of Hindalco at Lapanga in Sambalpur district. The land requirement will be 300 acres for the downstream unit.

The project has been recommended to High Level Clearance Authority headed by CM Naveen Patnaik. Four other investment proposals have also been cleared by the authority. 

Employment potential of Hindalco project is 550 people."
57,2018-10-25,Hindalco,"Aditya Birla group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla Thursday said the conglomerate is looking at a capital investment of USD 5 billion over the next three years across its businesses both in the home market and abroad. 

He said the group has already spent about USD 3.5 billion in the past two years across various businesses. 

""Our capex plans over the next three years is about USD 5 billion across our businesses both in the country as well as in the US. Aleris, which Novelis is acquiring, is also another aluminium rolled product player, will attract around USD 3 billion of this projected capex,"" Birla told The Economist India summit. 

The Birlas in July announced that it would snap up the US-based aluminium player Aleris for around USD 2.58 billion. 

The rest of the capex will go into the cement, financial services, chemicals and the fibre businesses both overseas and in the country, he told a panel discussion. 

The group is looking at growth across all areas of its businesses but most of it will come from financial services, cement, metals, garment and retail verticals, he said. 

When asked the riskiest decision the group has taken so far, Birla said it was the USD 10 billion acquisition of Novelis by Hindalco in 2008. 

""In 2008, we acquired Novelis. Hindalco is into primary aluminium, and so we wanted to go downstream, which is closer to the customer and also it insulates you from cyclicality of commodity. 

""I think this USD 10-billion acquisition by far was one of the riskiest things that we have done. We put a lot at stake and it was actually larger than Hindalco. But all worked out well for us,"" he said. 

Sounding bullish about the domestic economy he said, ""as per our house view, we are looking at a GDP growth of 7.3 -7.5 per cent in FY19."" 

Though he said the fundamentals of the economy are strong, he listed the continuing rupee fall and the spike in crude oil prices as problem areas. 

Calling for free trade, he said any sort of protectionism creates uncertainty and impacts growth and investments. 

""We would like to believe that this current round of tariff wars is something that will pass. I am given to understand that it has already impacted global growth by 0.2 per cent, and if it continues for the next couple of months it will impact growth globally by 0.5 per cent,"" he said. 

He also sounded cautious on government imposing import duty on certain items to safeguard domestic market, saying it has to be done on a case by case basis. 

""You can't have a one-for-all-kind of a solution. Each commodity has its own issues and you have got to look at whether there is dumping or whether it requires non-fiscal trade barriers. So, it is a very commodity by commodity situation,"" Birla said. 

Birla, who is on board of many prestigious education institutions, said private sector participation in the sector is still required. 

""There is a lot to be done in secondary and higher education space, as well as in the vocational training area. From a business point of view, some of these are very attractive business opportunities as well,"" he said."

If you’ve been following Biocon MD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw on Twitter, you’d know that Bengaluru traffic is one of her pet peeves. But if you thought regular tweets about traffic snarls were completely justified, she has news for you — Boston is worse. 

Recently, India’s richest self-made woman entrepreneur tweeted to complain about the nightmarish gridlock she experienced during her trip to the city. “Boston has the worst traffic gridlock I have ever seen. Worse still, Boston traffic police are nowhere to be seen — crazy. Bangalore — all is forgiven!” she posted.

70,2018-10-30,Hindalco,"In the current market, where select large-sized and mid-sized companies are doing well, a multi-cap scheme which invests after careful consideration of financial performance, management bandwidth, corporate governance and return ratios should serve as a good investment option. One such scheme is Mirae Asset India Equity scheme.

The scheme is one of the most distinguished performers in almost time frames with respect to its benchmark index and its peers. One of the key reasons for this is the stock-selection process of the fund house. The scheme’s fund managers, Neelesh Surana and Harshad Borawake, have avoided any call which is momentum or short-term in nature. The fund managers have been keenly following the scheme’s and the fund house’s philosophy of investing in companies which generate high cash flows, have pricing power in their sectors and a relatively lighter balance sheet.

In the past three- and five-year periods, the scheme has given 13.9% and 21.9% returns, while its benchmark, S&P BSE200 TRI, has given 12.8% and 16.7% returns during the same periods.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers have constructed a portfolio which includes well-placed themes across sectors. Right from insurance, mutual funds, pharmaceuticals, consumer durables to retail, auto and media. This provides diversity to the scheme’s portfolio as these companies have a dominant market share, proven performance record and high visibility of stable earnings due to revenue-enhancing triggers. A few prominent companies in the scheme’s portfolio include Maruti Suzuki, HDFC Asset Management Company, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, and Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail.

The scheme is a multi-cap fund with a bias for large-cap stocks which fall under growth theme. These stocks are bought at reasonable prices. The portfolio is well diversified with no sector, stock, theme or style being disproportionate. Neelesh Surana believes that alpha is generated through the right stock selection, not by sector rotation. He lays emphasis on margin of safety in his stock picks and remains fully invested at all times."

0,2018-11-16,Hindalco,"Strides Shasun, Aditya Birla Fashion and Kotak Bank are the three stocks to bet on next week, says Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in. Open interest data which transpired last week still suggests that there has been more long built up on the Bank Nifty futures, says Bothra. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Metals are going up, PSU banks are going up, FMCG as a sector is not doing that well. Are these the classical signs of a risk-on trade?Kunal Bothra: Yes, these are classical signs of risk-on trade and add to that the consistent move in those largecap names which have been doing extremely well. The tendency of the short-term trader to try and latch on to stocks which are running on high beta and probably playing for a contrarian trade, is not playing this time around. It is more of the continuation we have seen in the last few months of this market rally in stocks like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank to a larger extent, Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank as well. 

These stocks have been doing extremely well. All the other sectors have been playing a helping hand but not many of them have recovered or converted their short term rallies into trends. That is what separates the men from the boys in this rally and that is going to be the likely texture for the markets going forward as well. 

Just one important observation, the open interest data which transpired last week still suggests that there has been more long built up on the Bank Nifty futures and that is why I am highlighting many of these private sector banks because if they continue to move up higher from where they left off on Friday, then there is a higher chance of Bank Nifty leading the breakout in Nifty for next week.


What do you make of what is happening in the telecom pack now? Bharti at the end of the week was among the top gainers in Nifty?Absolutely and it is one of the best moves for the Bharti Airtel stock in the last so many weeks and months. It used to have more of a staggered continuation up move but what transpired on Friday was nothing more than exceptional because the stock opened slightly lower. It tested the mark of Rs 360 which was more or less a closing base support for Bharti Airtel.

I believe that the remarkable turnaround in the first half of the session itself and stock closing at the highest point of the day indicates that this stock is ready to move up higher even from current levels. The volumes moved up significantly higher for Bharti Airtel and so that is an added positive. 

The other point is that it is now closer to the psychological mark of Rs 400 as well, which has been acting as a hurdle for the stock price. When a largecap stock like Bharti Airtel consolidates at the upper end of the resistances and goes through a time-based correction or more volatility, in between it is a sign that the stock is reading for a big breakout on the upside. 

A continuation move above Rs 400 for Bharti Airtel would be taken as a breakout move for the stock and post that, I would expect price trends to continue. What you have seen in the last one year, even a target of Rs 440-460 will not be ruled out provided the stock sustains that breakout of Rs 400.


Another interesting space has been what is happening with the metal pack. Some of the steel companies are moving. Vedanta has been moving. What is your sense on largecap metal names?It has been topsy-turvy for these stocks when you look at it on a collective fashion because on the one hand, midcap stocks like Jindal Steel have done exceptionally well. In the last month or one-and-a-half month, it has rallied 50-55% but the other stocks have not failed to show signs of momentum. 

Hindalco was one of the stocks which also showed potential but post results, the stock has fallen back below that Rs 200 mark which was a strong psychological support. Vedanta on the other hand has been a laggard. The stock had shown signs of potential earlier but it keeps on failing time and again ad makes new swing lows. Those are the two stocks which I particularly believe would continue to be a drag on the overall metal index. 

Tata Steel on the other hand keeps giving that periodic bouts of rally. In terms of a strategy, if you can get Tata Steel may be 4-5% from its recent swing highs, that will be a good entry point for playing the stock with a risk reward of 1:2. It has to be more stock specific and not a holistic view on the metal stocks.


Any picks for our viewers?Absolutely. There are three buy calls and all three of them are varied in terms of strategy. The first is a buy on Strides Shasun. That stock looks extremely strong on the short term charts. The indicators have gotten into an extremely oversold territory. So, the chance of a strong bounce over the next one week could not be ruled out. I would suggest a buy with a target of Rs 395 and stop loss at Rs 364. 

Second is Aditya Birla Fashion. It is more of a breakout candidate. The stock was consolidating since last so many weeks, trading above the 200-day moving average. The volumes and the indicators have now pepped up higher for Aditya Birla Fashion. That could lead to a strong breakout over the next one week. That is also a buy with Rs 230 approximately as a positional target and a stop loss of Rs 200. 

The third would be from the largecap space. It is a buy on Kotak Bank. Many of these banking stocks, even Kotak Bank, I believe now be heading towards consolidation breakout more of a continuation breakout on the daily and the hourly charts so buy with a target of Rs 1680 and stop loss at Rs 1580."

6,2018-11-19,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: AV Birla group flaship Hindalco Industries is betting big on the packaging and transport containers segment, a top company official said on Tuesday.

The move is due to the low per capita use of aluminium in the country which is at 2.6 kg now and being the largest producer of the metal, it gives an added advantage to the AV Birla flagship.

The domestic packaging industry is a USD 35 billion and is growing at around 25 percent annually.

""Per capita intake of aluminium is just 2.6 kg now, while in China it is 30 kg. So we see huge opportunity in both packaging, cans and transport industry and we are looking to expand in these areas going forward. We expect to hold 40-45 percent of the downstream market,"" managing director Satish Pai said.

In the transportation business, the company will be contract manufacturing aluminium containers for bulker carriers and trailers which will help the goods transport industry bring down cost as the light weight aluminum containers can carry more payload.

It can be noted that almost all goods containers are built of steel now which increases the tonnage of the truck.

As part of entering the packaging business, Hindalco recently partnered with the Jute Corporation to make recyclable packaging material to reduce single-use plastic.

And as a first step, the company has launched the country's first aluminium foil-laminated jute bags for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the trust that manages the Tirumala Temple in Andhra.

""Going forward, we aspire to make aluminium the 'smart metal of choice' by showcasing it as a supermaterial, with innate properties of strength, light weight, anti-corrosion and 100 percent recyclability,"" Pai said, adding they will soon roll this out to other temples and to other industries as well as a smart and sustainable packaging option.

At its aluminium foil manufacturing plant in Nagpur, the jute cloth is laminated with food-grade aluminium foils, and sent to artisans in Telangana for fabricating the bags in different sizes, which are available at an affordable price.

There is a strong response to the aluminium-foil jute bags and already 60,000 bags have been sold in the past six months alone."

The financial distress at Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture has dragged down the wealth of Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose group is the second-largest investor in the teetering wireless carrier.

The tycoon, who joined forces with the British operator last year, has lost about a third of his fortune since the end of 2017 as mounting losses and debt decimated the equity of the troubled Vodafone Idea Ltd. In addition, shares of his flagship firms that produce chemicals, metals and cement have also tumbled amid a demand slump, eroding his wealth.

The net worth of Birla has shrunk to about $6 billion from $9.1 billion two years ago, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A majority of his fortune is derived from his ownership of Aditya Birla Group, a conglomerate that controls his main holdings.

Birla is the latest mogul to burn his fingers in India’s cutthroat phone-services market since Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. entered the fray in 2016 and drove two rivals to bankruptcy. Formed by the merger of Vodafone’s local unit and Birla’s cellular operator, Vodafone Idea last week reported the worst loss in the nation’s corporate history, while the British partner flagged the risk of a collapse.


Bloomberg
Aditya Birla Group has a stake in Hindalco Industries Ltd., the world’s largest aluminum rolling company, and owns a part of Grasim Industries Ltd., which controls India’s biggest cement maker.

For the Aditya Birla Group, the hit on the telecommunications business couldn’t have come at a worse time. Cooling global growth amid a trade war between the U.S. and China, as well as an economic slowdown at home has curbed demand for industrial raw materials the group produces.

Vodafone Idea’s woes deepened last month after India’s top court sided with the government’s demand for $4 billion in fee-arrears from prior years. Already burdened by $14 billion of debt, the order came as a blow to its finances weakened by a brutal war with Jio. Ambani’s operator this year became the country’s No. 1 carrier with 380 million users by offering free calls and cheap data.

Shares of Vodafone Idea have plunged 90% since end-2017, shrinking its market value to $2.7 billion.

“Vodafone and Idea have been going through a complex merger and, at the same time, trying to keep their heads above water in the battle with Reliance Jio,” said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, a professor of business strategy at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. “The Supreme Court judgment came at the most inopportune time.”

Hindalco, which makes aluminum and copper, reported a 33% drop in profit for the latest quarter as the prices of both the metals slid in the three months through September. Shares of Hindalco have tumbled 31% since end-2017, cutting its market value to $5.9 billion. The S&P BSE Sensex has gained 19% in the same period.

The slowdown in India’s $2.7 trillion economy has cooled demand for commodities such as cement to chemicals and textiles manufactured by Grasim. Its stock has dropped 33% since end-2017.

Vodafone Idea’s troubles have also weighed on Grasim, which owns about 12% of the carrier.

This week brought some signs of relief to Vodafone Idea shareholders. Its shares have more than doubled in the four days through Nov. 20 as the three rivals -- including Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd. -- signaled an end to the price war. Bharti reported a record quarterly loss last week as well.

On Wednesday, the government deferred airwave payments for two years, providing some relief for the industry roiled by high license fees and spectrum costs. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said she wants all companies to flourish and none to fail.

“The tariff hikes are positive,” Jefferies analysts led by Piyush Nahar said in a note this week. Despite the positive move, relief from the government remains crucial, especially for Vodafone Idea, they wrote."
7,2018-11-22,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Hindalco might fit into the investment criteria of investors focused on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing, said Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE).

The brokerage has assigned a fair value of Rs 240 to the Hindalco stock, which fell 1.2 per cent to close at Rs 188.60 on Thursday.

“ESG-focused investors may want to make an exception for Hindalco from their negative stance of investing in metal & mining companies in general as Hindalco is primarily a downstream aluminum company,” said KIE analysts in a client note.

“We assume aluminium will have an important role to play in sustainable development (given its easy recyclability versus plastics, especially single-use plastics) in two large industries — automobiles (light-weight EVs and components) and beverages (recyclable cans).”

Kotak said Hindalco is hardly a typical commodity company with the bulk of its profits coming from the downstream converter business (automobile parts and beverage cans).

“The contribution of the downstream business could rise to 81 per cent by FY2021 on acquisition of Aleris (another downstream converter company) although it may have to shed parts of Aleris’ automotive components businesses to meet regulatory requirements,” the analysts said."

Nifty kickstarted the week on a positive note, as it witnessed a sharp rally of more than 150 points in Monday’s trade. The bulls were aggressive from early trade and continued to pull the benchmark indices higher as the day progressed. It witnessed sustained buying interest till the end of session and formed a Bullish Marubozu candle on the daily scale.

Nifty witnessed a breakout after the consolidation of last 16 trading sessions from Bullish Pennant pattern on the daily chart, indicating resumption in bullish momentum in the coming days. After the consolidation phase of last three weeks, the index managed to close above its immediate hurdle at 12,035 level, and was on the verge of making new all-time high.

It has to continue to hold above psychologically important 12,000 mark to be able to extend its move towards 12,103 level and then see a fresh rally towards 12,250 while on the downside support exists at 11,920 and then 11,850 levels.

Meaningful Put writing was seen at 12,000 and then 11,950 levels, while Call unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. Options data suggested a shift in trading range between 11,900 and 12,200 levels.

India VIX moved up 0.89 per cent to 15 mark. Now, VIX needs to hold below 15 mark to surpass the recent highs and extend the fresh high territory.

Bank Nifty witnessed sustained buying interest throughout the session and headed towards the 31,600 mark. It engulfed the price movement of last three sessions and formed a big green body candle on daily chart. It has been forming higher highs and lows for last seven weeks and supports are shifting higher gradually.

Now it has to continue to hold above 31,200 level to head towards its lifetime high of 31,783 and then begin a fresh rally towards the 32,000-32,250 zone. On the downside, major support exists in the 31,000-30,800 zone.

15,2018-11-25,Hindalco,"Mumbai: NSE’s 50-share Nifty rose 0.2 per cent last week, as it took cues from global markets, which remained choppy on developments related to the US-China trade deal.

Telecom stocks stole the show, jumping on hope of government relief, but there was some weakness towards the close of the week as the package offered lagged expectations.

Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said Nifty50, Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices are clearly forming a corrective pattern along with majority sectoral indices, which are also moving sideways. “Trading in such a phase can cause whipsaw losses,” he said.

But brokerages continued to see stock-specific opportunities. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 12 money-making ideas that analysts said should make money over the next few weeks.


Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking


Lupin | Buy| Target price Rs 820| Stop loss Rs 750

Lupin has formed a reversal pattern on the daily chart and is now on the verge of a breakout from its five-month-long consolidation phase. Indications are in favour of a steady rise from here on. Further, the existence of major support zone of long-term moving averages i.e. 200 EMA on daily chart, is adding to the positivity.


PVR| Buy| Target price Rs 1,920| Stop loss Rs 1,700

After making a record high, PVR retraced marginally of late and currently hovers in a range while holding firmly above the support zone of the 100 EMA on the daily chart. Considering its chart pattern and overall trend, the analyst expects a strong surge ahead.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


Apollo Tyres | Buy| Target price Rs 183| Stop loss Rs 161

This counter appears to be have a strong support around the Rs 162 mark, as it bounced back after testing the said support level at least on two occasions in the past. Even in the last session, the stock registered an intraday low of Rs 162 and recoiled from the same. Hence, sustaining above Rs 162 level, the stock can easily head towards its logical target of Rs 183. In between some resistance can be expected around Rs 171, but once that hurdle is cleared, the momentum shall get strengthened further with a target of Rs 183.


Tata Steel | Buy| Target price Rs 447 | Stop loss Rs 383

A strong recovery in the last session after testing its 50-day moving average suggests this counter might have completed its correction at an intraday low of Rs 383 hit in last session. In that scenario, it should resume its uptrend which appears to be in place from the low of Rs 320 hit last October. For this up-trend, the ideal target shall be a test of the 200-day moving average, whose value is placed around Rs 447. In between, there can be some hiccups around Rs 421 mark, but with the momentum strengthening, that should be cleared. Positional traders are advised to adopt two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on dips in the Rs 395 – 387 zone, analysts said.


Exide | Buy| Target price Rs 207 | Stop los Rs 186

For the past two weeks, this counter appears to be consolidating in a narrow range between Rs 194 and Rs 186 levels, with a positive bias and it appears to be on the verge of a breakout. This counter made a strong comeback in last session on relatively much higher volumes. On such a breakout, it can head to test its recent swing high of Rs 208.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher


Hindalco | Buy| Target price Rs 208 |Stop loss Rs 182

This stock has taken base at the ascending trend-line support near Rs 187 level, and with the RSI also indicating a trend reversal to imply strength, it shows the potential to rise further with a positive bias in the coming days.


Godrej Properties | Buy| Target price Rs 970| Stop loss Rs 845 
This stock has given a decent correction recently from the peak of Rs 1,025 to bottom out near Rs 844 level and has moved past the significant 200DMA to imply strength and has improved the bias. With the RSI recovering strongly from the oversold zone has indicated a trend reversal and signaled a buy.


Jay Thakkar, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research and AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers


Max Financial Services| Buy | Target price Rs 512 | Stop loss Rs 486

This stock has provided a breakout from the symmetrical triangular pattern and since then it has been trending higher towards its next swing resistance. The stock is trading well in an upward sloping parallel channel, the probability of it inching towards Rs 536 is quite high.


Power Finance Corporation| Buy| Target price Rs 127 | Stop loss Rs 115

This stock has completed a wave B correction and since then it has been trading higher with a clear buy crossover in its momentum indicator MACD. The stock seems to have completed Wave 4 correction on the daily charts and Wave 5 up seems to have started.

Sun Pharma | Buy | Target price Rs 475 | Stop loss Rs 441

This stock has provided a breakout from the falling channel with a buy crossover in its momentum indicator MACD. The momentum indicator has provided this buy crossover with a positive divergence, hence the probability of an upside is high. Also, the Nifty Pharma Index has provided a breakout from the inverse head and shoulders which is quite positive for the entire sector.


Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Technical Research, Kotak Securities


LIC Housing | Buy | Target price Rs 440 | Stop loss Rs 410

It is in a strong uptrend. It was at Rs 353 level in the month of October and from there all the way it rallied to Rs 453 level without any meaningful correction. Since the last two weeks, the stock is correcting and on Friday, it closed higher, which shows the correction is completed.


Raymond | Buy | Target price Rs 740 | Stop loss Rs 670

This stock saw a strong up-move from Rs 540 to Rs 829 in a short span of time. In the last two weeks, the stock has erased almost 50 per cent gains which is positive for short term traders as it offers buying opportunity with a decent risk-reward ratio. It has formed the Doji star formation on a daily chart, which is an indication of pause to the current sell-off."

18,2018-11-27,Hindalco,"The fact that Nifty’s 1360-point rally since September 19 has been led by a small basket of stocks is very well known. Reliance Industries, the HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have emerged as the drivers of this big Nifty gain since the announcement of the corporate tax cuts by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in September.

But there are indications that the basket is getting broader. A new set of stocks look set to join the rally and drive the benchmark index even higher if one goes by the increase in open interest positions. The open interest in Hindalco has seen a 63 per cent spike in the current series while that of Bharti Airtel, SBI and Infosys’ have risen by more than 55 per cent, data from exchanges show.



ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are the other two stocks that have seen massive build-up in long position with 130 per cent and 65 per cent increase in open interest, respectively.

The open interest of star performers like RIL and HDFC Bank remained same for the last few days.

“Each family member has their own wealth but it’s managed by a single chief investment officer (CIO). He sits down at the beginning of the year with each member, understands what the person’s risk return profile is and draws up a plan accordingly. For example, my risk return profile will be very different from my father’s or that of my children,” Patni said. This is a very different approach from the time when his grandfather “would decide for everyone”.

35,2018-12-13,Hindalco,"Largecaps like L&T, Eicher Motors, Axis Bank & Hindalco and midcaps including Indiabull Housing, MGL, CG 
  
  
  Power and Ashok Leyland are doing well, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Can the momentum continue for the markets?
In a lighter note, let’s say 
Balle-Balle and let us hope 
Balle-Balle become triple. It has left all the bears on the side. There was a double whammy of state elections loss for the ruling BJP-led NDA government and a change of guard at the RBI. But there appears to be a Santa rally as we come closer to Christmas! 

Most of the event calendar appears to be over except for a Fed rate hike. But even the Fed sounds dovish. I would expect the global rally going into the new year and as I said, this time the Santa rally is coming closer to Christmas. 

The other notable change is the change of guard at the RBI with the new Governor sounding extremely positive on infusing cash. The IPP numbers, the bond yields, in the inflation data, all tell us that the market performer for this month should be midcaps -- particularly some of the NBFCs, banks and interest rate sensitives. 


Where are the opportunities where one could still invest and make money in this market?
There are two points. One, do not try and time the market. We are in a huge bull market, particularly in the Indian context. Retail flows have been the backbone of this market and they continue to be outperformers. Retail investor is not showing his back to the door. He is more positive on declines which is evident from the data on SIPs on a monthly basis. 

Secondly, do not look for the next three months because there will be an election in the next four months which may add to the volatility. Look at the next three years -- base effect of earnings, macros on the positive in the shape of oil, bond yields and a very positive momentum from the incoming government. 

Thirdly, India’s price-earning multiple will remain elevated because of the local flows which have been the biggest change of guard in the last two years of financialization of saving. 

Four-five good names in the largecap space would include a) L&T, which we think can be an outperformer on the back expansion in capital goods sector; b) Eicher Motor, where again the brand value and the resumption of positive data on interest rates easing for autos would be a big point; c) Axis Bank, where banking structure is leading from the front; and d) a metal play like Hindalco. The risk reward is extremely favourable in Hindalco. Globally, Novelis is outperforming and metal prices both copper and alumina are headed higher.

Coming to midcaps, Indiabull Housing is a beta play, given that most of the weakness on the recent change of events and the NBFC lending is over. We would look at CG Power which is very positive as they are divesting some of their Belgian and European assets. 

We would again be very positive on Dabur given that we think in the FMCG basket. Resumption of consumption spending would be very positive and among gas utilities, MGL has underperformed but is set now to outperform, at least in the near three months. 


Which is at the top of your list of midcaps this morning?
Indiabull Housing, MGL, CG Power and Ashok Leyland. The risk reward is extremely favourable and you have seen a quarter of hiatus because of the slowdown in NBFCs and the cost of funding. That is going to ease now. The businesses are doing well one should not look at the next three months. If one can look slightly longer term, then India becomes one of the best emerging market destinations.

The other double positive would be that a Santa rally is coming now much closer to Christmas. I am definitely seeing midcap outperformance and these stocks would be outperformers. As a disclosure we have had a buy on these stocks so you could take it that with a pinch of salt. 


How would you look at Reliance Industries in the wake of the Jio story and what they are doing with regards to restructuring some of the telecom related assets into separate companies? 
Not only eliance, I think pricing is coming back and Jio would definitely benefit. A disclosure. we have a buy on Bharti under Rs 285-290. We think the present trend of politics or the elections will unleash the largest consumption of data on social media and that means all the incumbents should be laughing their way to the bank given that pricing is back. Pricing is going to come back in this quarter and the volumes will both benefit. So for Jio and Bharti that would be win-win. 

For Reliance itself, given that some of the other businesses particularly are looking to divest shale gas which is getting a higher multiple, they are stabilising on their petchem and their GRMs which should be regular run businesses. Reliance will continue to be an outperformer in the large energy pack and all declines should be used to buy."

40,2018-12-17,Hindalco,"Our understanding is autos are going to lead from the front. The metals pack is also showing a lot of promise, Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities, told ETNow.

Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Are you advocating buy through the close out of 2018?

Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been bullish on the market and proved correct and we are now closer to 11,000 rather than 10,000. All that pessimism is over. For the Indian market, the lesson of 2018 is buy the fear and sell the greed. There is still a lot of fear around and people are waiting for corrections. They have been caught napping if they have been tracking the other asset classes or the other indices where China is in a bear market and the US is having problem of its own. 

India becomes a sweet spot on the back that oil is in a bear market. We have got bond yields, rupee and most of the uncertainties on governance on the RBI over with. The next 3-4 months can be pleasantly surprising because we think earnings are going to be a catalyst, along with flows because we have again seen foreigners turn to buy. Locally, we have had the backbone of this market being the retail investor and the SIP. Put your money where your mouth is. I still think midcaps can outperform in the next few months and that is what we are advocating to buy, select midcaps in most sectors where outperformance is on the cards. 


ET Now: When it comes to Tata Motors, has the view now changed, with recent news coming in that they are looking at downsizing in order to turn profitable and getting in some serious cost control measures. Do you sense that Street would give this stock perhaps a rechance?


Sanjiv Bhasin: Like you said, most of the pessimism of autos may be in the price and if you are looking for elections and beyond, then relatively Tata Motors can outperform. The other caveat being if the pound in which they have an unhedged position starts to stabilise, you could see some mark to market return. But we still think autos are going to lead from the front. If I could select three names, it would be Bajaj Auto, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland is my dark horse because we think this month onwards before the budget they will see much of their inventory getting cleared and we think that the 15-year norm will change which will help them gain market share in MCV and LCV segments.


ET Now: Suppose from 10,000, there are a few sectors which have really done well and there are a few sectors which have not yet performed. Any churning you would recommend to portfolio holders or mutual fund managers where you feel that this sector has run up substantially, you do not see further upside from current levels which does not mean that you are negative on that space but there is more attractive sector now which has not done so far so good.


Sanjiv Bhasin: IT should be given an avoid unless you want to be in fully priced stocks where we do not think earnings will be a catalyst. But yes, if I could stick my neck out, I am very bullish on the metals pack. We think the pessimism is overdone, protectionism in US will see again 2019 being a very good year for results. Locally we have seen steel prices harden. The basket of JSW, Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco is looking excellent. 

PSU banks are going to report very good numbers starting from State Bank, Can Bank, Indian Bank. Corporate banks are already leading from the front like Axis and ICICI and a Federal Bank if you can put the midcap basket. Autos I just suggested four names. I am very bullish on the gas utilities. MGL, IGL, GAIL all are looking excellent on the charts and so a whole host of stocks. As for power stocks, the CERC new guideline will be very very positive for some of the PSUs. I would be sticking my money on CG Power to be dark horse for 2019.


ET Now: Are you more bullish on the power space?


Sanjiv Bhasin: We have had our top picks and we have made money in that. If you recall, we were very bullish on the power financiers before the merger talk came. PFC and REC gave almost a 30 per cent return. We still think that today’s review petition is very very positive for the likes of NTPC and Power Grid. The only caveat here is that there is a government to manage its own balance sheet is seeing merger of some stocks to raise necessary cash.

In this power space, you can pick up some of the power producers or you can see some of the utilities. So Calcutta Electric looks very good to us. Reliance Infra has sold its arm to Adani Power so that could be another good play to be with, but our outperformer here would be a small company called CG Power which we think is selling some of the over leveraged assets in Europe and where return on equity could sharply improve in 2019."

46,2018-12-20,Hindalco,"Siddhartha Khemka, VP, Head of Research (Retail), Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOSL), shares his views on the corporate bank and metal space and also has a few stock recommendations to dispense. If you are looking to revamp your portfolio, then this might help. Take a look at the edited excerpts from his interview with ET Now: 

ET Now: Just about everyone is now suddenly bullish on corporate banks, like they were with the NBFCs. Now there is merit in buying corporate banks but do you think the trade is getting very crowded in short term?

Siddhartha Khemka: A lot of guys on the Street are positive on the corporate banks and rightly so because the asset quality is now really bottoming out. Also, the numbers of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, as well as SBI, show that the slippages have now come off. 

From here on, the credit cost should come down which will pave the way for the earnings recovery over the next two-three years.

But in the interim, some of the stocks like ICICI, Axis, and SBI has moved and it is likely that this upmove could be on account of the interest in the sector.

But it is difficult to say whether the consensus would play or an issue like NBFC could come. 

Nonetheless, we remain positive on this space for quite some time and the next two-three years could be in favour of corporate banks. 

The call right now is not to exit NBFCs completely, but the preferred bet here would be on the corporate banks.


ET Now: Do you think now is the time to increase risks? And if this is the case, then which stocks are you betting on?

Siddhartha Khemka: Yes, it is the time to increase risk on portfolios on the sectoral front. Capital goods is a sector where we would like to increase weightage going into 2019. 

We generally see the order book drying up just before the elections. However, this time a lot of companies are sitting on a pretty good order book and the execution has picked up which is helping the P&L growth this year. 

Once we are over with the election, order book should start flowing up because of the bunching up of orders which would have not been placed just before the elections. This would then drive the sector. 

We are seeing a recovery in the private capex cycle and this should improve going into 2019. 

The preferred stocks especially in the capital goods sector are L&T, Cummins and Therma.


ET Now: Do you think metals as a theme it is still finding favour? What is your take on the largecap trio - Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco - given the momentum there has been very strong over the last two years?Siddhartha Khemka: Metals is a cyclical sector and we are well into the cycle since the last two to three years now. I am guessing that we are somewhere closer to the peak of the cycle. How long will the cycle last is very difficult to say. Right now the quarterly numbers that are coming for the metal pack have been very robust. 

In the second quarter, the overall metal pack witnessed a profit growth of 70% on YoY basis. So, that could keep these stocks attractive and at higher levels. 

However, somewhere in 2019, we could see some pressure coming back as the sector is a bit cautious at these levels. 

One may not add to the portfolio in metal space and adopt a cautious, wait and watch kind of a view and maybe look to book profits at higher levels."

47,2018-12-21,Hindalco,"The weakness in metals stocks on news that the US would lift sanctions on Russian aluminium producer United Company Rusal, is unlikely to last for too long as the development was largely priced in, said analysts. The Nifty Metal index fell 1 per cent to 3177.90, ending as one of the worst performing sectors on Thursday.

London aluminium prices fell to a 16-month low on Thursday following the news of US intending to remove the sanctions on the company, which is owned by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. The US treasury notified the Congress of its intent to terminate the sanctions after divestment by Deripaska.

National Aluminium Company’s shares fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 61.85 and Vedanta fell 2 per cent to Rs 202.65. Hindalco Industries’ shares declined 1.5 per cent to Rs 223.65. These three were the worst hit in the metal index.

“This development was already in the price. What we are seeing in the stocks is a sentimental impact. There may be near term pressure, but I don’t expect a long-term impact,” said Sanjay Jain, senior vice-president, Motilal Oswal.

Edelweiss Securities views the potential annulment of sanctions as a non-event. “We view the potential annulment of sanctions a non-event considering: 

1) Rusal’s Q3CY18 Al sales jumped 34 per cent QoQ (quarter-onquarter) upon extension of its general licenses; 

2) tepid LME Al price reaction, implying the market had already factored in the removal of sanctions; 

3) formidable cost-push in Al is likely to cushion prices; and

4) low inventory at LME and SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange),” said Edelweiss.

Hindalco Industries is a preferred pick among aluminium producers for analysts thanks to its steady earnings. “Hindalco is our top pick in metals space as it has strong India business and strong overseas business with Novelis,” said Jain of Motilal Oswal.

Edelweiss, too, has a buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 307.

Bloomberg data showed that 26 of the 29 analysts tracking Hindalco have a buy rating on the stock with consensus target price at Rs 310.7."

52,2018-12-24,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks fell in sync with their Asian peers on Monday, with both Sensex & Nifty shedding nearly 1 per cent as they extended their losing streak to the third consecutive session. 

Pessimism in US markets has extended to the Indian market now, analysts said. “Domestically, things are looking fine, but there is a slight uneasiness in global markets, which is influencing stocks back home,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICIdirect. 

""Even though the US President has said the Fed chief will not be fired, the market is slightly uneasy as to what will happen if Fed hikes rates again at its next meet,” he said. 

Stocks are witnessing heavy selling ahead of December F&O expiry; softness in crude oil price is proving to be the only saving grace as it has helped hold up the rupee up.

Speaking to ETPanache at an event earlier in the year, the Bharat Forge ED had shared that he’d been “travelling too much this year” on account of work. Though December showed no signs of slowing down, the plus was that he’d at least be in town. As for his new year plans, it’s all about family. “My brother-in-law (wife Deeksha’s brother) turns 50, so I’ll be with him,” Kalyani said when asked about his plan to bring in 2019.

The couple did not divulge further details about the celebrations being planned. But in the past, for both Kalyani and his wife’s big 4-0, intimate parties were hosted at their residence in Pune.

0,2019-01-01,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: The earnings outlook for local aluminium producers, including Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco, now hinges on the increase in the import duty on the metal as global prices are at a 20-month low.

Current LME aluminium prices are at $1,850 per tonne, much lower than what analysts had estimated. Earnings estimates were largely made with $1,940 a tonne as the price benchmark. The recent fall in metal prices could lead to a sharp earnings downgrade unless there is an increase in import duty.

Union minister Suresh Prabhu recently said that there is a proposal from the industry to raise the duty on imports and the commerce ministry is in favour of it. Around 1.4 million tonnes (MT) of aluminium, or 40 per cent of total domestic demand, was imported in 2017.

The local aluminium industry, which has been seeking protection against rising imports, has proposed an increase in levies on scrap and primary aluminium from 2.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, to 10 per cent.

A likely increase in import duties may offer some support, but the outlook will continue to remain weak, given the falling aluminium prices globally. The steep fall in aluminium prices shows the weakness in demand, especially from the slowing global automotive sales. From the peak in April, aluminium prices have fallen 28 per cent.

Average global cost of aluminium production is estimated around $1,750 to $1,800 per tonne, given the elevated alumina and coal costs. Indian players such as Hindalco and Nalco are fully backward integrated and hence may not get into losses if aluminium has to fall further.



Vedanta, not being fully integrated, will be more affected. For Vedanta, in the latest quarter, aluminium contributed 17 per cent to total earnings, and zinc 50 per cent, while oil largely made up the rest. The decline in oil prices would also affect the total earnings.

At average LME aluminium price of $2,087 a tonne in the September quarter, Vedanta’s operating margin was 10 per cent, Hindalco’s 19 per cent and Nalco’s 27 per cent. Nalco, a net alumina long player, benefitted from higher alumina prices. Despite the sharp correction in the commodity prices, shares of these companies have largely remained firm."

8,2019-01-02,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Shares of five metals and mining companies such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco plunged up to 3 per cent in Wednesday’s trade after global brokerages CLSA downgraded the stocks to ‘sell’, citing weak Chinese demand.

Deteriorating Chinese demand outlook will weigh on commodity prices, the brokerage said, while slashing FY20-21 earnings estimates for the companies anywhere between 9 per cent to 38 per cent. This, it said, priced in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.

Following the development, shares of Tata Steel fell 2.40 per cent to Rs 503.20. CLSA cut the target price for this steelmaker to Rs 460 from Rs 855 earlier.

JSW Steel was down 2.62 per cent at Rs 295.60, while Hindalco was trading 2.89 per cent down at Rs 216.35.

CLSA downgraded JSW Steel to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’ and cut price the target price for the stock to Rs 260 from Rs 375. Likewise, Hindalco’s rating was lowered to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’. The target for the stock is reduced to Rs 210 from Rs 255 earlier.

Data released earlier in the day showed that the China’s official manufacturing indicator -- Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – contracted to 49.7 in December. This is against a reading of 50.2 in November. This was the first contraction in manufacturing activity, as suggested by a below 50 reading, for the index since May 2017.

The foreign brokerage, meanwhile, maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on both on Vedanta and Coal India, but revised targets for the former to Rs 250 (Rs 300 earlier) and latter to Rs 310 (Rs 360 earlier).

Shares of Vedanta were trading 2.52 per cent down at Rs 197.05 at around 9.40 am (IST), while those of Coal India were down 0.29 per cent at Rs 240.40.

He recently shared with ETPanache how he streamlined his dietary intake in 2018. “Approximately 50-60 per cent of my food [intake] is now plant-based. It took me six months to get there. I don’t have dairy, gluten or sodas [aerated drinks],” he said.

 Mittal also discovered the benefits of intermittent fasting. He has been practising it for more than four-five months. It’s basically fasting between previous night’s dinner to next day’s lunch, skipping a meal (breakfast) in between. “It’s incredible how effective this is. The body doesn’t need as much food as one thinks,” he said. He does, however, allow himself an occasional cheat day (one every two weeks or so). But he prefers to utilise them when he is travelling. “Pizza and chocolate chip cookies are my go-to. But it’s tough to get really good chocolate cookies that are gluten free in India. Cheat days are best when I’m travelling,” he said."
14,2019-01-03,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Foreign brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded shares of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco Industries saying that deteriorating Chinese demand outlook is likely to continue to weigh on commodity prices. The brokerage has cut earnings per share estimates for the FY20-FY21 period by 9-38 per cent to factor in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.


“We expect large cuts to street estimates ahead,” said CLSA.

Shares of Tata Steel ended down 4 per cent at Rs 493.85 on Wednesday while JSW Steel and Hindalco ended down 5 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.

CLSA downgraded Tata Steel to sell from buy and cut target price to Rs 460 from Rs 855. JSW Steel was downgraded to underperform from sell by CLSA and target price was lowered to Rs 260 from Rs 375. The brokerage has downgraded Hindalco to underperform from sell and trimmed target price to Rs 210 from Rs 255.

CLSA has maintained buy rating on Vedanta and Coal India. However, target price for Vedanta has been cut to Rs 250 from Rs 300 while target price for Coal India has been reduced to Rs 310 from Rs 360 by CLSA.

2018 was a tough year for commodities despite decent global growth led by concerns on Chinese demand, escalating trade wars and benign winter cuts in China, said CLSA.

The brokerage said the calendar year 2019 is likely to offer little respite because of the deteriorating Chinese demand outlook.

“...India’s steel market is on the cusp of multi-year tightening due to insufficient capacity additions and we expect imports to rise sharply in coming years. However, the deterioration in global steel industry outlook is weighing down on Indian steel prices, weakening the earnings outlook of the steel companies,” said CLSA.

The brokerage is relatively more positive on Coal India and Vedanta.

The brokerage cut FY20-FY21 EPS estimates for Vedanta by 22-23 per cent on lower oil prices and stronger rupee but added that the company has decent volume growth, better earnings trajectory and an attractive 8 per cent dividend yield, it said.

CLSA sees Coal India as a defensive play amid the global headwinds in the resources sector.

While production growth for Coal India has been patchy but demand outlook for coal in India remains healthy, said CLSA."

18,2019-01-04,Hindalco,"The Nifty 50 companies are expected to report moderation in topline growth for the third-quarter of FY19 on account of slowing momentum in some sectors and a stronger growth base in the previous year’s corresponding quarter. The growth may be faster in the fourth-quarter as the benefit of lower raw material costs to manufacturing companies is expected to reflect fully by then.

According to ETIG estimates, the aggregate revenue is likely to grow at an eight-quarter low of 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter compared with 13 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter.

Net profit will grow by 6.7 per cent, making it a third consecutive quarter of single-digit growth. Automobiles, cement, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and telecom companies may report subdued numbers, whereas private sector banks, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and information technology (IT) companies may show improvement.



“In the December 2018 quarter, we will see the impact of lower industrial metal prices. Crude prices also have fallen. This will help consumers of commodities and crude oil -based fuel and raw materials. The rupee depreciated by 9 per cent, which will affect importers and borrowers of foreign capital,” said Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities. Except tin, other metal prices have fallen by 14-26 per cent while the crude price has dropped by 24 per cent from the year-ago quarter.

The operating margin is expected to be marginally lower by 30 basis points (bps; 100 bps = 1 percentage point) to 20.5 per cent year-on-year.

Analysts believe that growth may resume in FY 20 as stability gradually sets in the banking sector thereby improving credit availability in the system. The street expects 18-28 per cent growth in the Nifty 50 earnings per share. “This will be facilitated largely by the turnaround in corporate banks’ profitability. However, performance of the other key sectors of oil and gas, and metals could depend on global growth conditions and domestic policies.”


Sector Trends

AUTOMOBILESSales volumes of the majority of listed auto companies either fell or grew in single-digits barring Bajaj Auto. Average discount level remained elevated amid dismal festive demand and mounting dealer inventory. This is likely to put further pressure on margins of auto companies.


BANKINGProvisioning requirement is expected to reduce as the rate of new bad loans reported by banks gradually abates. A lower yield on longterm government bonds should result in higher treasury income. These factors may support profit growth.


CAPITAL GOODSA sustained order flow from the government will support topline growth in the December quarter. Execution is picking up as companies have reduced the proportion of slow moving orders over the past few quarters.

The commentary by Larsen & Toubro, the country’s largest infrastructure company, will be keenly watched since the number of order wins that the company reported to the stock exchanges during the quarter was lower than expected.


CEMENTAll-India average cement price fell by nearly 2 per cent to Rs 308 per 50kg bag year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter. Intense competition has kept players away from raising prices even though demand has improved marginally across regions. Realisations therefore may remain under pressure despite lower raw material prices. Large-sized companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cement, Dalmia Bharat and Shree Cement are likely to post 10-15 per cent volume growth, but their revenue growth will be capped at 3-9 per cent.


FMCG PREVIEWFactors including the extent of festive demand and the effect of lower GST rates will be crucial for the FMCG sector. Rural demand, which has been a key growth driver for the past few quarters, may show signs of moderation. Flaring crude oil prices in the previous quarter will have a lag effect on the sector’s margins in the form of higher input costs. A drop in GST rates may offer some respite.


IT
A weaker rupee against the dollar will boost realisations of the IT exporters though the benefit will be marginally offset by unfavourable movement in other major currencies. The dollar-denominated growth may remain at 2-3 per cent quarter-on-quarter given a seasonally weak quarter.


METALSPrices of most commodities declined in the December quarter. Steel price declined nearly 15 per cent, a negative for players such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel. A drop in the aluminium price will affect Hindalco and Vedanta. Vedanta, which has an oil exploration division, would also be impacted due to the falling crude prices.


PHARMAPharma companies may report subdued performance given the headwinds in the US and the domestic markets. A deceleration in price erosion in the US generics market may offer some relief to pharma exporters. Investors would be keen on seeking clarification from Sun Pharma on corporate governance front."

The Nifty50 index opened flattish and drifted towards 10,730 level in the early part of the session on Tuesday, but it witnessed buying interest in the second half and headed towards the 10,820 mark. It remained volatile and declines got bought into as the index managed to hold above its 50-day EMA on the daily scale. Now it has to hold above the 10,750-10,777 zone to witness an upward move towards 10,850 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside support exists at 10,650 and then 10,600 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,000, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,200. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,700 followed by 10,400 where marginal Call unwinding was seen at immediate strikes. The options band signalled a broader trading range between 10,650 and 11,000 levels.

Bank Nifty witnessed buying interest in morning dips and headed towards the 27,550 mark with its highest daily close in last four months. It formed a bullish candle on the daily scale and has been outperforming Nifty.

66,2019-01-17,Hindalco,"It's important that Chinese aluminium exports come down for prices to look up, S K Roongta, Non-executive Chairman, BALCO, told ETNow. Hindalco is best placed in terms of cost today because it's fully integrated, he said. Edited excerpts: 


Aluminium prices have taken a knock slipping briefly even below $1,775 per tonne and now to add to the woes, you have Alunorte which also seems to be very close to getting its embargo lifted entirely. Do you think prices will continue to stay sub-$1,900?

There are a few factors which are driving aluminium prices down and there is a concern on the global aluminium consumption growth, primarily in China where the growth is certainly declining. That coupled with increase in the aluminium inventory in LME is really driving the aluminium prices down. But prices have come down to almost two-year lows and at this rate, many smelters across the globe will start losing money. 

In fact, some of them will incur operational losses. If these price levels persist for some time long, then surely we can see the closure of smelter capacities across the world, including in China, where many smelters will be making losses at these prices and that can rebalance the market. 

Other factor which has led to this situation is that expected winter cuts in Chinese production did not come up to the expected levels and they have been much lesser than what was anticipated. As for the Brazil refinery, it is believed that the state has given the clearance but I suppose they have to obtain the clearance from the court and let us see what happens. 

But that is positive for those which are not integrated producers. If the alumina prices come down, then obviously the cost pressure on some of the standalone smelters will reduce. 


What is the current aluminium and alumina demand and supply situation and if Alunorte does come in with full-fledged operations, how will this really tilt the scales?

If you look at alumina globally, demand is in the region of about 65 million tonnes and more than 50 per cent of the production is accounted for by China. China is the biggest driver of aluminium consumption as well. Similar is the case for other commodities like steel, zinc and the like. 

The refinery output going up in Brazil will only make more alumina available for the smelters and does not impact as such the overall demand prospects. Demand will depend on what happens to the global economy and how things work out with regard to US-China trade tensions. China will continue to be the major driver of aluminium demand across the globe. 

Second, China in 2018 exported almost a million tonne more of aluminium in spite of 10 per cent duty by the US. That almost amounts to 3-4 per cent of consumption other than Chinese market across the globe, which is significant. Ultimately for prices to look up, it is important that Chinese exports come down and China enforces significant cuts in their capacities.


China’s trade data have pointed towards weakness. Whether it is sustained or not, what stands out and what has been an outlier is that aluminium exports have jumped 20 per cent despite US tariffs. Where is such strong demand coming from for Chinese products?

No, it is not a question of demand, you know. After all, it can replace the domestic demand in those countries. Obviously, imports into India have also grown. We have seen 20 per cent growth in import of scrap as well as the primary aluminium in first nine months of the current financial year and so it has gone to the EU and other consuming countries. 

All of it need not be driven by growth in those markets. It can also replace the domestic production and that is what probably impacts the prices. But one factor is to be seen, as I said earlier. There is sufficient cost pressure on the smelters across the world at these prices, which are not really sustainable in the long run. Sub-1,800 prices are not sustainable.

Let us talk about the Indian producers. What is the average smelting cost currently? We understand it is hovering around $2,000 per tonne?

Yes, Indian producers' prices vary from producer to producer. We have Hindalco which is fully integrated producer right from bauxite up to the smelting capacity. Vedanta is partly integrated, they have some alumina capacity but not sufficient to take care of their entire smelting capacities. They have to import alumina. 

Nalco is an integrated producer, but if they go by the transfer pricing of alumina to their smelter, then their costs are also high. 

Probably, Hindalco is best placed in terms of cost today because they are fully integrated followed by Nalco and Vedanta."

RAJESH PALVIYAHEAD – TECHNICAL & DERIVATIVES, AXIS SECURITIES

Where are We? During the corrective action in the recent past, the Nifty has managed to hold its last 10-12 weeks of up-sloping trendline support of 10,650 on weekly chart, which indicates the trend is likely to remain positive in near/short term. But we may witness volatility to be the new normal in the near/short term on account of the quarterly earnings outcome as well as global cues.


What is in Store? The chart pattern suggests that if Nifty crosses and sustains above 10,950 levels, it would witness buying which would lead the index towards 11,100-11,200 levels. Nifty is trading above 20,50 and 100 day SMA’s which are important short-term moving average, indicating positive bias in the near to short term. The chart pattern suggests that unless the Nifty breaks below 10,700-10,560 support, the market is likely to continue its bullishness and can scale up further higher towards 11,000-11,100. Any weekly close below 10,560 would initiate fresh profit booking, which could drag the index towards 10,500-10,350 levels in the short term.


What should Investors Do? On the daily chart, Nifty is in process to form symmetrical triangular pattern. A breakout above 10,950 would confirm the pattern. Weekly and daily strength indicators are in positive territory and quoting above their reference line which supports bullish sentiment ahead in near term. Nifty is expected to trade in range of 10,650-11,000 in the forthcoming weeks with mixed bias. We advise to buy stocks if the Nifty corrects in the near/short term to 10,700-10,650 which is a strong support zone. IT, oil & gas, FMCG and private banks sectors are expected to show strength in coming weeks.


NAGARAJ SHETTI

TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, HDFC SECURITIES

Where are We? After showing an upside breakout of triangle pattern at 10,850 levels last week, the Nifty was not able to continue with follow-through upmove, in the last three sessions. This is raising doubt over the bullish pattern implication of triangle upside breakout. 10,850 has been acting as a key overhead hurdle for the Nifty since late November 2018. Having failed to generate upside momentum above this 10,850 levels, in past Nifty eventually slipped into a decline. Hence, one needs to be cautious here till 10,985 is taken out.

What is in Store? After showing a small range movement in the previous week, Nifty broke out of triangle last week and closed the week higher by 1.04%, as per the weekly timeframe. A long bull candle has been formed last week with long lower shadow.

Technically, this pattern is indicating positive bias. But the underlying trend remains choppy below the resistance band of 10925-10985. The crucial overhead resistance of 10,950 (as per the concept of change in polarity) is still intact, as per weekly timeframe chart and Nifty is continuously making failed attempts to move above this area over the last many weeks. Hence, any failure to move or sustain above this area over the next 1-2 weeks could have a sharp negative impact on the market for the near term.


What should Investors Do? The underlying trend of Nifty is range bound. A decisive/sustainable move above 10,985 levels could open up more upside for the market ahead till 11,200. Weakness at higher levels or a slide below the key lower support of 10,850 is likely to bring bears back into action. The inherent pattern of longer term charts are all indicating limited upside potential for the Nifty for near term. Sectorally, IT & Energy sectors are looking positive and Pharma, Metal, PSU Banking are looking negative for the near term.


ROHIT SINGRETECHNICAL ANALYST, BONANZA PORTFOLIO


Where are We? Nifty closed the week at 10,907 with gains of 111 points on the weekly basis and formed Hammer Candle pattern on the weekly chart, which indicates that dips are being bought. Overall structure looks positive if index manged to hold above 10,777 zone which is strong support for the index. On the higher side, the immediate hurdle is 11,000 mark. 

What is in Store? The Nifty managed to closed the week on a positive note. Technically speaking, the index has given a symmetrical triangle breakout on the daily chart and closed above the same, suggesting bulls are taking charge. On the options front, the highest OI concentration is at 11,000 CE on higher side making it strong resistance. If the index manages to close above the said level, we may see good technical move along with short covering in the index which can push index towards 11200-11300 zone.

What should Investors Do? We may see acceleration in the ongoing optimism once the Nifty manages to surpass above 11,000. The current chart structure looks positive and investors can use buy-ondip strategy in the markets. Also, we suggest keeping more of sector and stock-specific approach while investing. Among sectors we are positive on IT, metals and auto as the risk-reward remains favourable from current levels. Some of the technical picks where investors can catch dips for 15-20% return in short term with keeping stop at levels below 5-7% from the current close include Reliance, M&M, Wipro, Hexaware, Hindalco and Sobha."

73,2019-01-22,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Losses in metal, bank and auto heavyweights amid weak global cues made domestic equity benchmarks snap five-session winning streak on Tuesday.

The market traded in the negative zone throughout the day, as gloom in global markets extended to the domestic bourses.

Emerging stocks and currencies slid, as fears of slowing global growth spooked investors and made them move towards safe haven assets.

Optimism stemming from third quarter earnings faded and market reacted to the global sentiment due to the absence of fresh decisive triggers back home.

We walk you through the highlights of Tuesday's session:

Who dragged my SensexHDFC twins, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Larsen & Toubro emerged as the top drag on Sensex. However, the pack of losers was led by Vedanta, down 3.50 per cent. It was followed by Tata Steel (down 3.13 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (down 3.08 per cent), HCl Tech (down 2.18 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 2 per cent).


Metals meltThe BSE Metal pack suffered a loss of 2.31 per cent, emerging as the top sectoral loser, on fall in shares of Jindal Steel (down 4.53 per cent), Vedanta (down 3.50 per cent), Tata Steel (down 3.13 per cent), Hindustan Zinc (down 2.76 per cent), JSW Steel (down 2.46 per cent), SAIL (down 2.23 per cent) and Hindalco (down 1.88 per cent). As per Reuters, base metals prices dropped across global markets with benchmark London copper extending a sharp drop from the previous session, after economic growth in top metals consumer China slowed to its weakest in 28 years.


Sun shines againNotching up gains for a second straight day, India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharma closed 4.95 per cent up at Rs 418.05 after the company clarified that it neither gave any loan nor guarantees to Suraksha Realty.


A dull Q3 showAsian Paints on Tuesday posted 14.60 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit at Rs 635.60 crore for the quarter ended December 31. Consolidated revenue of the company increased 24 per cent to Rs 5,293.99 crore in Q3FY19 over Rs 4,267.49 crore in Q3FY18. But the numbers failed to excite the market as the stock closed the day with a loss of 0.99 per cent at Rs 1,406.55 on the BSE.


In fast laneShares of TVS Motor closed 2.94 per cent up at Rs 553.85 after it reported a 15.57 per cent increase in standalone net profit at Rs 178.39 crore for the third quarter. Revenue from operations was at Rs 4,663.98 crore, up 26.09 per cent against Rs 3,698.67 crore on a yearly basis.


A volatile rideAfter surging almost 20 per cent in early trade, shares of Prabhat Dairy nosedived and closed the session with a loss of 14.29 per cent at Rs 79.75 on the BSE. The stock came off even as its Rs 1,700-crore stake sale deal was much bigger in value than the company’s total market capitalisation of around Rs 900 crore.


Ashok Leyland declinesShares of Ashok Leyland closed 2.92 per cent down at Rs 88 after global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Sell’ rating on the stock and also cut the target price to Rs 75 (Rs 85 earlier). India’s truck industry is currently in the fifth year of an up-cycle where historical upturns in the last four decades have lasted four years on average, said CLSA. The foreign brokerage expects competition to intensify in a downturn given Ashok’s improved ability to fight against Tata and the latter’s high focus on regaining its lost market share. 


Kotak firms up post Q3 nosShares of Kotak Mahindra Bank closed 1.92 per cent higher at Rs 1,291.60 as leading brokerages maintained their bullish stance on Kotak Mahindra Bank after the lender posted a 23 per cent rise in profit at Rs 1,291 crore for December quarter on higher net interest income.


Shining brightShares of Havells India jumped 4.95 per cent to Rs 711.40 even as the company reported a nominal rise of 0.67 per cent in standalone profit at Rs 195.67 crore. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 194.36 crore during the October-December quarter of the previous fiscal. Total income during the quarter under review stood at Rs 2,551.4 crore as against Rs 1,993.53 crore in the year-ago period.

70,2019-01-22,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Stocks in India may have gone up for five consecutive days, but dwindling market breadth remains a sticking point.

This was evident on Monday as Nifty50 heavyweight Reliance Industries led from the front. What was missing was broad based participation, which has made the market a bit cautious. 

That in a way suggests 97 stocks on the NSE could see correction in coming days, according to momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The technical indicator has signalled a downward crossover -- a sign of bearish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at possible downside. 

Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend. The list includes banking stocks such as South Indian Bank, Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and IDFC First Bank.

Adlabs Entertainment, GMR Infra, Reliance Power, Reliance Capital, DLF, Reliance Infrastructure and UPL too look vulnerable on technical charts. Torrent Power, Tata Global Beverages, Natco Pharma, MCX, EID Parry, Supreme Infra and Inox Wind PNC Infratech are a few other scrips that may see weakness in days ahead.









MACD -- the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages -- is known for indicating trend reversals in traded securities or indices. 

A nine-day exponential moving average called the signal line is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When MACD goes above the signal line, it throws up a bullish sign, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice-versa.

Meanwhile, 24 stocks showed bullish crossover on the daily charts. These include SPARC, Hindalco Industries, HDFC, Omaxe, Trent, Thirumalai Chemicals, Mahindra Logistics and TTK Prestige.





The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio. Traders should use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend, say analysts.

As far as the Nifty is concerned, only a few stocks such as Reliance Industries, Infosys, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank is driving the index.
“The broader market indices are diverging from the benchmark index for the last few sessions. Once the last leg of the pullback gets over, the Nifty is also likely to follow suit and can see lower levels,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan said.

Daily strength indicator RSI and momentum indicator Stochastic both are in a bullish mode, which supports the upside bias.

Short-term Nifty traders are advised to put their stop loss level below 10,880 on a closing basis, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 A close look at the stock chart of Union Bank of India reveals that every time the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show a downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 1.97 per cent lower at Rs 84.60."

Midcaps and smallcaps indices closed 0.28 per cent and 0.16 per cent down, respectively.


Here are Wednesday's market highlights.

Rs 1.10 lakh crore gone in two days!The two-day fall in market wiped off over Rs 1.10 lakh crore wealth as the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms plunged to Rs 1,42,04,842.87 crore on Wednesday from Rs 1,43,15,583.11 crore on Monday. On Wednesday alone, the market's loss read nearly Rs 74,199 crore. 


ITC plunges post Q3 numbersShares of ITC closed the day 4.16 per cent down at Rs 277.70 on the BSE after it reported a 3.85 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in standalone profit at Rs 3,209.07 crore for the December quarter. Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) increased 11.23 per cent YoY to Rs 4,326 crore against Rs 3,889 crore in the same period last year. At first glance, Street appeared dissatisfied with the numbers as the stock tanked after earnings were announced.


Sun shines in a gloomy market Bucking the trend, shares of Sun Pharma closed 3.04 per cent higher at Rs 430.75, extending gains to the third consecutive session. The company’s management issued an investor update on Tuesday, listing the measures it has taken to address the alleged infringements of corporate governance norms. It attempted to allay the concerns of the market by clarifying its stand on switching the ownership of the domestic formulations distribution business from Aditya Medisales to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun, unwinding of loan transactions worth Rs 2,238 crore, and changing the auditors at the subsidiary companies. 


Technicals signal more upside for WiproShares of IT firm Wipro closed at Rs 351.20, up 1.37 per cent, on the BSE. In the intraday trade, the scrip touched near 19-year high level of Rs 355.45. According to Reuters, the stock broke above resistance at Rs 348.22, the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci projection level of the uptrend from June 6, 2018, low to September 24, 2018 high (wave 1). The breakout suggests the stock may rise up to the next resistance at Rs 360.56 - the 76.4 per cent projection level - in a couple of days. 


ICICI Pru touches 52-week lowShares of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company plunged to their 52-week low of Rs 302, before settling 11.13 per cent down at Rs 305.70. The stock suffered losses a day after it reported a 34 per cent decline in its standalone net profit at Rs 296.77 crore in October-December. The board has approved an interim dividend of Rs 1.60 per equity share for the first half of 2018-19. 


YES Bank jumps 3%Shares of private lender YES Bank climbed 2.71 per cent to Rs 197.30 after the bank partnered with Maharashtra to onboard PDS shops onto the electronic PDS initiative through which they can become agents of the bank. Moreover, it will come out with its earnings numbers for the December quarter on Thursday. There are expectations that the bank may report higher slippages and loan provisions for its exposure to the IL&FS group. However, net interest margins may remain stable for the quarter ended December 31. 


Den Network, Hathway Cable rise The Competition Commission of India (CCI) gave a go-ahead to Reliance Industries to acquire majority stakes in two of the country’s largest cable operators DEN Networks and Hathway Cable & Datacom. Shares of Hathway Cable & Datacom (up 3.09 per cent) and Den Network (up 1.79 per cent) logged decent gains today.


Bank of Maharashtra makes a pointPublic lender Bank of Maharashtra reported a loss of Rs 3,764.26 crore for the December quarter due to Rs 4,421 crore provisions and contingencies it made during the period. However, the bank said its non-performing loan provision coverage ratio now stands at 81.08 per cent against 58.71 per cent as of March 31, 2018. Percentage of NPA eased to 5.91 per cent in Q3 FY19 over 10.61 per cent in Q2 FY19. The stock closed at Rs 14.44, up 1.48 per cent on the BSE.


Top drag on SensexIn terms of index contribution, ITC (down 4.16 per cent), HDFC Bank (down 1.26 per cent), Infosys (down 1.73 per cent), HDFC (down 1.26 per cent) and Reliance Industries (down 0.73 per cent) emerged as the top five drag on the Sensex. On the other hand, Sun Pharma (up 3.04 per cent), YES Bank (up 2.71 per cent), Tata Steel (up 1.53 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (up 0.90 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 0.75 per cent), Vedanta (up 0.73 per cent) and HCL Tech (up 0.57 per cent) withstood the selling in the index.


The sectoral pictureBSE FMCG (down 1.38 per cent), Power (down 1.24 per cent) and Consumer Durables (down 1.16 per cent) finished the day as the top three losers among sectoral indices. Only two indices - BSE Healthcare (up 0.44 per cent) and BSE Metal (up 0.63 per cent) - could manage to close the day with gains. 


109 stocks signal fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 109 counters, including ITC, ICICI Pru, TVS Motor, Trident, DCB Bank, Jindal Stainless and Cadila Healthcare, on the BSE. On the other hand, 51 stocks, including Hathway Cable, Adani Power, Radico Khaitan, Hindalco and Granules India, showed bullish crossovers on the BSE. 


178 stocks hit 52-week lowsAs many as 178 stocks, including Advanced Enzyme Technologies, BASF India, Coal India, IL&FS Transportation Networks, Mahindra & Mahindra, Oil India and Shankara Building Products, hit 52-week lows on the BSE. On the other hand, Info Edge (India), Wipro, Kilitch Drugs (India), Prabhat Telecoms (India) and Refex Industries were among the 45 stocks that touched their 52-week highs on the BSE."

81,2019-01-29,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Market breadth is depleting, and the benchmark indices are making lower highs and lower lows, suggesting that supports are shifting lower in the runup to the Union Budget.

As weakness grows, more and more stocks are looking weak on the technical charts.

As such, 80 stocks on NSE appear to be readying for a correction in the coming days, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The list includes at least seven Nifty stocks.

The technical indicator has signalled a downward crossover, meaning bearishness, on these counters. This, coupled with the fact that many of the counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adds credibility to the emerging trend.

Vedanta, Sun Pharma, Hindalco Industries, Cipla, Bajaj Finance, Titan Company and BPCL are among the Nifty50 stocks that witnessed downward crossover of late, signalling weakness on the charts. 

Other stocks in this list included Indraprastha Gas, Hexaware Technologies, Rolta India, Infibeam Avenues, NIIT, Punj Lloyd and Amara Raja Batteries.



“Last two days have not been good for our market, as there was a pause to the recent optimism. Index-wise, no major damage has been done, but if we look at some of the individual stocks, they have certainly taken a brutal knock,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, eight stocks showed bearish crossovers on the daily charts, sending out bullish signals. They included NMDC, Voltas, Uttam Galva Steels, Thyrocare Technologies, Raj Television Network and Johnson Controls.



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, the daily Bollinger Bands have started an expansion after a phase of contraction, thus assisting the price action on the way down. “The internal structure i.e. the hourly chart, showed a fall is developing as an Impulse structure, which is a typical characteristic of a deeper fall,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan.

Chavan says if Nifty50 stays below 10,675 level for some time, it would see selling pressure and test sub-10,600 levels.


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Vedanta shows whenever the MACD line breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show a downward momentum and vice versa.

On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.08 per cent lower at Rs 191.30."

83,2019-01-30,Hindalco,"Kolkata: India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has said domestic aluminium prices are expected to remain stable, despite a likely decline in demand while zinc prices may taper off because of an increase in global supply.

The agency also expects copper prices to stabilise after the price correction during the second half of FY18, as part of its FY20 Sector Outlook for Base Metals. The report added that ratings of sector companies are likely to remain stable during FY20.

The domestic base metal industry is largely dominated by players like Hindalco Limited, Vedanta Limited and National Aluminium Company, among others. Major issuers are likely to post healthy profit margins, on the back of a steady volume ramp-up and cost deflation countered by lower average realisations, the report pointed out.

In aluminium sector, prices are likely to remain steady in FY20 as China’s supply discipline may continue in 2019 while its demand growth weakness could continue to reduce oversupply and support prices, the report said. 

In case of copper, Chinese government's waste import restrictions has led to lower copper scrap imports and hence an increase in China’s refined copper imports. Resolution of industrial union disputes at the Escondida copper mine in Chile is also likely to bring in a correction in prices. 

The report predicted that an increase in global zinc supplies shall result in a slight tapering of London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, while government spending on infrastructure and construction projects is likely to drive domestic demand. With healthy EBITDA, lower working capital requirements and improving free cash flow accruals, the net leverage of the major issuers would remain steady, despite consistent capex outflows, Ind-Ra said."

1,2019-02-04,Hindalco,"The Indian stock market has remained almost flat over the past year and several sectors have been under severe stress. For instance, the ET Teleservices Index, which tracks the telecom sector, fell 45% over the past year. Realty, metals, infra, auto and textile sectors too have substantially underperformed. As sectoral turnarounds are led by the stronger players within the industry, picking the best performers from the underperforming industries can be a smart strategy, say experts.In fact, some fund houses have launched ‘special situations’ funds to execute this strategy. Others have employed their ‘value’ funds to make the most of the existing situation. These funds are bullish on strong performers from the struggling sectors because the stock market tends to significantly pull down even the good stocks from a poorly performing sector. With the market prices of good stocks falling well below their intrinsic values, value funds lap them up. “Good stocks that are down only because of sectoral woes and are quoting well below their intrinsic values are automatically picked up by our valuation model and we have included many of them in our Union Value Discovery Fund,” says G. Pradeep Kumar, CEO, Union Mutual Fund.Investors too can consider buying good stocks from the troubled sectors as they promise high returns. However, they need to be careful because these high returns also come with high risk: the expected industrywide turnaround may get delayed and the slide in the counter may continue for a longer period. This is high risk–high return strategy is suitable only for long-term investors willing to hold the stock for at least five years.To start with, you should avoid sectors that are unlikely to turn around in the near term. For instance, the telecom sector. Despite a significant fall, its problems are not going to end any time soon. “Teleservices sector continues to face problems and it may take another 2-3 years before it finally turns around,” says Phani Shekhar, Fund Manager, PMS, Karvy Capital. Amar Ambani, President and Head Of Research, Yes Securities concurs: “Investors should note that Jio is reporting profits despite the cut-throat competition, which means that Jio will continue with its aggressive pricing (which will bleed other players). So, it is better to avoid teleservices stocks.”Also, while the PE ratio works when picking stocks from the well-performing sectors, it can be misleading in case of stocks from the troubled sectors and investors shouldn’t entirely rely on it. For instance, despite a 57% fall in the stock price over the past year, the PE of Tata Motors has risen to 110 because of a bigger fall in earnings. Similarly, Hindalco is quoting at a PE of 30, which is quite high for a commodities firm. “The commodities sector is best valued on the basis of assets and not earnings. As the earnings will be subdued during a bad phase, the PE will rise instead of falling,” says Ambani.To save you the effort, we have filtered five promising companies from sectors that are currently underperforming. However, invest in these stocks only if you can take high risk and are willing to stay invested for the long term.Textiles: Arvind LimitedPotential upside: 59%    P/E 6.94   PBV 0.72   Div yield(%) 2.73   Current Price (Rs) 88   1-year target price (Rs)140 Analysts Recommendations   Buy Hold Sell   13 2 1 Due to the ongoing trade war and the global slowdown, the Indian textiles industry has been under pressure. Arvind, one of the largest denim manufacturers globally, has also remained under pressure due to uncertainties regarding its demerger. However, there is clarity on the demerger front now and the recent demerger has made Arvind a pure textiles company, manufacturing only denim, fabrics and garments. 

“Post demerger, the company’s niche business model comprises mature businesses like denim and high-growth segments like garments. This potent mix translates into high growth opportunities and stable cash flows,” says a recent Edelweiss report. Investors’ complaint that the management was focusing on other segments (brands and retail), overshadowing the company’s textile business has also been addressed. This demerger will free resources for Arvind and they will be employed for faster growth. Since the company’s capex is expected to be around Rs 1,500 crore during the next three years, its annualised revenue growth is expected to be around 12% between 2018-19 and 2021-22, from around 6% now.Metals: Hindalco IndustriesPotential upside: 50%    P/E 30.42   PBV 0.91   Div yield(%) 0.6   Current Price (Rs) 200   1-yr target price (Rs) 300 Analysts RecommendationsBuyHoldSell2703Things are likely to deteriorate further for the metals sector. “Since the full impact of the Chinese slowdown is yet to be reflected in the global metal prices, global commodity prices will remain under pressure even if the Chinese growth doesn’t fall any further,” says Phani Shekhar, Fund Manager, PMS, Karvy Capital. China has not cut its production by as much as was expected, putting further pressure on the domestic metals sector, which was expecting to gain from the demand crunch due to the Chinese production cut.

“While several aluminium producers have started making losses at the operational level, situation is still manageable for other segments like zinc, copper, etc.,” says Tarang Bhanushali, Senior VP, Yes Securities. Aluminium prices have fallen significantly because of increased Russian production. In this scenario, given its low production cost, Nalco can be a good bet (it was featured last week as our ‘Pick of the Week’). Hindalco is another counter investors can consider from this space. “Hindalco is well-placed now due to its backward integration in the domestic market and higher realisation from its US subsidiary due to value-added products,” says Bhanushali.Auto: Tata MotorsPotential upside: 47%P/E110.22PBV2.46Div yield(%)0Current Price (Rs)1721-yr target price (Rs)253Analysts RecommendationsBuyHoldSell27113Despite a decent show in the domestic market, the global economic slowdown has started affecting sales of luxury vehicles. Not surprisingly, Tata Motors, one of the global auto majors has been going through a rough patch. While volumes of its Jaguar brand were down 16% year-on-year in December 2018, Land Rover volumes fell 18%, amid weak demand from China. However, JLR sales were up in other key markets— North America, the EU and the UK. Efforts to regain market by launching new products— the new compact Range Rover Evoque is expected in 2019—are likely to boost demand in the coming years. 

JLR is also trying to reduce the impact of Brexit—which has made the British pound extremely volatile—by setting up a new facility in Slovakia. A significant cut in its price during the past year—down 57%—is another reason why experts want to bet on this counter now.Infrastructure: Bharat Electronics LimitedPotential upside: 41%P/E12.04PBV2.50Div yield(%)2.51Current Price (Rs)801-yr target price (Rs)112Analysts RecommendationsBuyHoldSell2012Most capital goods and infra firms including Bharat Electronics have been punished by the market. However, Bharat Electronics is doing well on the business front because it caters to a relatively better placed sub-segment—defence. Pick up in the electronic voting machine-related orders, due to the upcoming Parliament and Assembly elections, is another reason for its good performance. Its medium term outlook is bright: it received orders worth Rs 10,000 crore in the second quarter of 2018-19, taking its order book to Rs 49,000 crore—around four years of revenue. 

To gain from the Make in India initiative and cut operating costs further, the company is focusing on indiginisation. “We remain positive on growth of Bharat Electronics given its strong order book and its constant indegnisation efforts,” says a Religare report.Realty: Oberoi RealtyPotential Upside: 23%    P/E 20.35   PBV 3.67   Div yield(%) 0.42   Current Price (Rs) 450   1-yr taregt price (Rs) 552 Analysts RecommendationsBuyHoldSell2210The real estate sector has been facing multiple headwinds—implementation of the GST, Rera, etc.—for the past few years. The recent NBFC liquidity crisis, triggered by the default by IL&FS, is its newest worry. However, these sector-wide problems have benefitted the stronger realty players and this has already started getting reflected in the stock prices of the stronger realty companies: the best stock from this sector, Godrej Properties, is now quoting at a PE of 76 now. 

The next strong player from the sector, Oberoi Realty, however, is still trading at reasonable valuations—PE stands at 20.35. Recently, Oberoi Realty raised Rs 1,200 crore via qualified institutional placement. These funds will help it secure bargain deals—new land acquisitions— and thereby build its market share further.Stock prices and index values have been normalised to a base of 100.

3,2019-02-05,Hindalco,"Consistent earning growth will be there in consumption as we saw in case of Hindustan Unilever and Dabur 
  
  
  results in Q3, Yogesh Mehta, VP, retail research, Motilal Oswal Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Are these good levels for Bharti where one could bottom fish or should one completely avoid this stock?
It seems Bharti’s earning cycle which was on a downward spiral, has been stopped for now. Today, Moody’s downgrade has given some disappointment but at around Rs 280-300 level, it is a very limited risk on the investors’ side because the price war is almost on the verge of completion and they have already laid out new strategies. 

We believe that the earning cycle will remain flattish for them and will not be in a downward spiral. From investment perspective, the downside seems to be very limited. Unless and until, we see something drastically surprising or shocking due to any external reason, it seems that everything is priced in at this point in time. 


We have been tracking all the news on DHFL, RCom stocks. We have seen the kind of collateral damage across group counters there. What it is going to do to the banking space? How big a concern should there be?
Overall, the asset quality has deteriorated for public sector banks over last two years but on private sector banks, nothing seems to be like that and the growth path is still visible. In some banks, it is 20% and in few banks it is 23-24%. 

There are some NBFCs with strong parentage and track record. They will be able to raise funds from the market and will be able to successfully pass on the higher cost of funding to the end customers. They will have some better days from here on. But there are also a few companies which would not be able to deliver and face competition. It will be mixed effect for the overall scenario right now in NBFCs.


What is your take in the larger insurance space? What is the kind of potential you see on the broader space going forward?
 For insurance companies, the penetration level is really very low in India. So, there is immense opportunity for this company to prosper from here. Average new premium collection is in 18-22% range and it is a healthy ratio. Though price to embedded value is 2.5 times to 3-3.5 times, that is on the stretch side. 

On any further correction in insurance companies -- be it in health insurance, personal insurance or any other insurance -- there is immense opportunity for long-term investment with 3-5 years’ perspective. Any correction or moderation into the price to embedded value would be a good opportunity for all these companies like HDFC Life or be it ICICI or SBI Life or PNB. All these companies will have strong future. 


Are you advising your clients to go bottom fishing in auto and metal space?
We are avoiding the metal space right now because of too many linkages on the global front. That is the external factor we need to watch out for. So we are not advising bottom fishing in either domestic or import-oriented companies. 

But in the auto space, there are many names like Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge or Motherson Sumi, which have suffered very heavily. The price to earning multiple and the valuations comfort are now significantly higher and in terms of passenger vehicles like Maruti and all, the PE has moderated.

We believe that the December numbers were one of the shockers but January month again at 1,51,000, it is back to the track. It can be sustained further with the new launches lined up in second half of CY19 and then FY20. We believe that at 20 times FY20 PE multiple, Maruti is reasonably priced right now. On 8% to 10% correction, one can gradually pick up these stocks.

It is difficult to take a call on metals. Post the correction, there is still global headwinds and lack of demand pickup at home. Yet Hindalco can be picked up at current levels.


As an investor, do you have the conviction to go out and buy Tata Motors which has been so beaten down?
In last two and a half years, Tata Motors has not given rise to any conviction. But looking at replacement value, it comes at around Rs 140 to Rs 145 per share as a replacement. If anybody buys at this level, there are hardly any downside risks. Maybe waiting period would be uncertain, but the downside risk will be very limited because the entire enterprise value is at around Rs 140 to Rs 145 per share. 

Virtually they are at very limited risk. With the new launches, if they get successful responses from the users and clients, then we can see some good ramp-up there. But again JLR performance has suffered due to global growth slowdown. Even if domestic scenario recovers, the international scenario is darkened by impending UK Brexit. Also US and China slowdown is still a hangover. It is better to avoid such investment into the portfolios.


Does it give you conviction as an investor to go out and buy the Tata Motors which has been just so beaten down?
So far in last two and a half years it has never given any conviction but looking at replacement value, the enterprise value, the whole replacement cost comes at around Rs 140 to Rs 145 per share as a replacement. So if anybody buys at this level, there are hardly any downside risk, maybe waiting period would be uncertain but downside risk will be very limited because the entire enterprise value is at around Rs 140 to Rs 145 per share. So virtually they are at very limited risk. And new launches on the domestic front which was due to Nano, it was in a bad shape and deep into the red with the new launches if they get successful responses from the user and the clients, then we can see some good ramp up there but again JLR which is a parent company, the performance since global growth slowdown and all other scary situation may arise, so that point in time we believe that again if domestic scenario will recover but then international scenario on the UK Brexit or that is far away now but US and China slowdown is still a hangover. So would say that better to avoid such investment into the portfolios.


What is your outlook on FMCG?
Consumption valuation is never attractive. Consumption stocks are always 35 and more than 35 times PE multiple. However, the higher ROE and ROCEs are always supporting factors. The volume growth in all these companies like Hindustan Unilever or Dabur over or last four quarters, were always on the higher single digit or early double digit. That gives strong confidence on the growth path. 

Second, the recent budget gave sops for farmers, lower middle class and poor classes. The money in hand does not mean they will go buy oil and shampoos and soaps, but at least that will grow the business on the higher side. That will give confidence that growth is picking up and valuations are not at on a discomfort level. 

We believe consistent earning growth will be there as we saw in case of Hindustan Unilever and Dabur results in Q3. We believe that trajectory will continue for the consumption story in India.


What is your take on HUL?
HUL is one of our preferred picks in largecap consumption. We believe that the management has adopted three-four key strategies to drive their performances over next one-two-three years and those all are on new product launches, more focus on natural variants and of course, greater penetration in different segments. 

That gives strong confidence in HUL post Q3 numbers."

Globally, shares and bonds saw a renewed surge in risk appetite on Tuesday, as investors showed optimism about US-China trade talks and cheered Washington's deal to avoid another government shutdown, Reuters reported. 

Local investors kept their powder dry, awaiting IIP and retail inflation prints due later in the day. Moreover, they avoided fresh bets on Indian equities in the runup to general elections, while muted third quarter earnings have failed to boost the risk appetite.

""Hindalco (including Novelis) delivered a very robust quarterly performance across all its businesses despite the challenging environment and rising inputs cost. It remained focussed on deleveraging, operational excellence, customer centricity and resource securitisation to deliver long term shareholder value. However, rising aluminium and copper imports in India continue to impact the domestic market,"" the management said.

""Given its integrated business model with the focus on customer centricity and downstream strategy, Hindalco is well poised to cater to the entire spectrum of market requirements. Novelis' diverse global footprint and product portfolio and emphasis on recycling, positions it well to navigate near-term global economic uncertainties and growth in demand,"" it added."
9,2019-02-12,Hindalco,"The market base has shrunk to very few stocks in terms of outperformance. One needs to practice pick-and- 
  
  
  choose strategy going forward, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Eicher management is saying that they foresee weaker sales in foreseeable future. Could we see a significant derating in the stock or would you say that the negatives are already known and well in the price?
Our target price for Eicher Motors is now Rs 19,500. For this year, we estimate that the volume growth will be close to 3%, next year the number would be around 8.5% and then a 6.5% growth, which is likely. 

Though from a revenue perspective, part of the downside has been built in, we feel the margins are likely to be under further pressure because from April 2020, there will be the BS-VI implementation which will further lead to an increase in pricing. 

Already, there has been some price increase because of ABS and some of the other things. Despite 650cc doing pretty well, the risk reward has still not become favourable for investors in Eicher Motors. We continue to have a reduced rating on the stock. 


Hindalco realisations could potentially aide the overall top line growth but high input costs could be a bit of a drag. How have you read into Tata Steel and other numbers from the metal space so far? What is the expectation if any from Hindalco?
In case of the overall metal sector, Tata Steel will probably do well going forward because it is more integrated and now we have seen that the last 20 days has seen iron ore prices being hiked by more than 20%. For that reason, relative to others steel sector stocks, Tata Steel will do well. 

Coming back to Hindalco, the focus is going to be how Utkal utilisation rate improves over the next two years. In terms of Novelis, the kind of spread that they were making on the inventory, that benefit is likely to dip going forward. 

Right now, from a risk-reward perspective, I would wait for a 10% fall in the stock and then look at adding positions in the sector. Valuation wise, the stock looks cheap but because China is slowing down, there continues to be some issues with regard to future outlook in terms of growth for Hindalco. 


SUUTI is looking at divesting the 3% stake in Axis Bank. It has come in at a premium to the current market price?
That is a brilliant move done by the government at the right time. Axis Bank has been one of the top performing stocks over the last six months, it has been our number one favourite in the banking space even relative to ICICI Bank.

It has done very well for us and we feel that going forward from a fiscal perspective, it is a very good move by the government. For a lot of foreign institutional investors, from a liquidity perspective, it is a good time to buy large chunks of this particular stock because for the next two years, this company in terms of how they manage business is going to transform with the new management coming in. Though there may be some very short-term pressure on the stock because of such a large asset sale, but from the next two years perspective it continues to be one of our top picks. 


DLF is talking about zero debt in the residential business and a 15% CAGR in rentals over the next four to five years. How do you see the story playing up for the real estate space as a whole? 
Some of the larger players should do well going forward. The the smallcaps and the midcaps have not done well and the government took a lot of steps in the last budget with regard to unsold inventory and a couple of other measures. The sector might do better, especially the bigger companies. 

With rental business going up, passive income is a critical thing for anyone to earn and from that perspective, most of these companies should do well. In case of Godrej, in Pune, they have cracked a big deal for five to six projects with one of the large land-owners. 

Those kind of deals are clearly something which the market is looking at. I would say stick to quality like Oberoi, Godrej and DLF who have slightly higher risk taking capability. Over the next two years, make a decent amount of money in these companies as the leverage will be lower going forward. 


What is your take on pharmaceuticals in the light of the two observations with regards to the Goa facility of Lupin and Sun Pharma’s earnings today?
We have been negative on Lupin for the last couple of quarters and continue to be so because we believe the US generic market will continue to face pressure and the additional warning letter clearly tells us that going forward things will continue to remain tough. 

The Sun Pharma stock has come down and we have been quite bearish on the company for the last three quarters. After results, corporate governance issue will also be critical. If they deliver decent numbers, then the stock obviously has become cheap but because of corporate governance issues, it is out of favour with a lot of the large investor base. 

In terms of the US market where they are getting into more of complex generics that kind of investment would lead to significantly lower margins in the initial phase of investment over the next two years. A rebound in earnings will be a bit difficult for Sun Pharma at least for a couple of quarters. 


Indian equities seem to have lost steam vis-à-vis the other markets. We have yielded a negative 2% return in dollar terms as well. With some of the heavyweights like Maruti, ICICI Bank, L&T, HDFC Bank pulling down the index, is that likely to continue?
Around six months back, India was the only outperforming market among emerging markets. Now other markets have also done in line with India over the last six to seven months. Coming back to the Indian market, the smallcap index is down close to around 25% odd. That means a lot of peoples’ portfolios have got battered. However, FIIs will come back once the earnings growth bounces back. 

In terms of stocks I like Reliance, ICICI, stocks that can pull up the index to some extent in addition to HDFC. On the metal side, there is still concern of the Chinese slowdown. Overall, we feel one could see more upmoves on the broader market side than on the index. A large part of the rally has only happened because of a couple of stocks going up and now going forward, as we come close to the election time, we are seeing a lot of people postponing decision-making in terms of investing. By May, they want a clarity on who forms the government and then get into the market. 

We have been telling our clients to look at good stocks available at cheaper price. These may not be part of their allocation but one can consider adding up to positions in the market. 

From a sectoral perspective, metals is down more than 28%, auto is down by around 25%. It has become a market which base has shrunk to very few stocks in terms of outperformance. One needs to practice pick-and-choose strategy going forward. 


Are there any house recommendations, anything within the mid or the small cap universe where you have a buy on at the current levels?
Apollo Tyre is one of the stocks that we really like. There was some amount of margin contraction in the last quarter because of inventory levels being higher from the previous quarter. Going forward, the replacement market will continue to do pretty well and we see an upside in the company from the ramp up that we are seeing in the European plant. The stock is trading at around 10x which in the current market scenario is quite attractive. That is one of our favoured stocks from the midcap space. 


What exactly is the outlook in the overall IT space? Is there potential in some of the select midcap IT stocks?
Yes. The digital growth for most of the IT companies continues to be quite robust, above 20% so as long as the core business still continues to grow at 5-6%. We see the bumpup in growth from digital. IT sector should do well going forward as well. 

From a contra perspective, we are quite bullish on Mindtree. Going forward, some of the issues with relation to some investors are trying to sell their stake. It will get sorted over the next one to two months. In terms of growth, they will have industry beating growth of around 18-19% going forward and from that perspective, we are quite bullish on that particular stock. Even something like Mphasis and even L&T Infotech look quite interesting. IT, especially midcap IT stocks, look quite good to us. 

Among largecaps, it would be Infosys as well as Tech Mahindra which we would recommend investors to look at considering the risk reward at this particular point of time."

Markets at a glance


Gainers & losers
Among Sensex stocks, 22 lost while eight closed in the green. Hero MotoCorp led the losers' bloc, tanking 2.63 per cent. It was followed by HDFC, SBI, ICICI Bank, Infosys and HCL Tech. Each of these scrips declined over 1 per cent each.

Sun Pharma (up 2 per cent), however, led the Sensex gainers' pack, followed by Coal India (up 1.92 per cent). Both of these stocks are set to report their third-quarter numbers today.


Midcap and smallcap watch
BSE Midcap declined 0.06 per cent, but performed better than the benchmark. BSE Smallcap tanked as much as 0.43 per cent. 


Sectoral play
Among 19 sectoral indices on the BSE, only four ended higher today. Metal pack was the top performing sector with gains of 1.65 per cent amid hopes of a possible trade deal between the US and China. Barring Hindalco and NALCO, all other constituents of the BSE Metal index settled higher. Healthcare, Energy and Basic Materials were other indices that rose today.

Factors at play
Caution ahead of key macro data
Key macroeconomic numbers, IIP for December and consumer inflation print for January, are scheduled to be released later today, which are being keenly tracked by investors. According to a Reuters poll, economists predicted consumer price inflation (CPI) to have accelerated to 2.48 per cent in January, from 2.19 per cent in December. 

Mixed bag of earnings
The stock market is reeling under the effects of mixed bag results from the companies for the December quarter that is nearing its end. ""On an overall basis, while the margins may have been under strain, the consumption story seems to be intact and that has come out in the results in companies across sectors, be it FMCG or other sectors. One pocket of concern is the auto sector because of the restricted flow of credit and high fuel prices. It has also translated into their quarterly performance and if this persists, one will have to be a little guarded about this sector,"" said Sanjay Sinha, Founder, Citrus Advisors.


Expert-take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 
Lack of positive triggers is impacting sentiment of domestic equity market. India is underperforming in spite of improvement in the global market and appreciation in INR. Inflows have reduced this month due to muted Q3 results and outcome of general election. Expectation is that market momentum will reverse as economy stabilizes post-election and borrowing cost reduces.

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking
Investors took a cautious approach ahead of the industrial production (IIP) data for December and inflation numbers for January to be released in the post market hours. This data will dictate the market tomorrow."
12,2019-02-12,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Hindalco on Tuesday reported 47 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 713 crore for the quarter ended December 2018. 

The consolidated figures include standalone figures of Hindalco as well as Utkal Alumina.

The stock closed 0.38 per cent down at Rs 198.60 after the announcement of Q3 results while the BSE Sensex closed 241.41 points, or 0.66 per cent down, at 36,153.62.

Below are top five takeaways from Hindalco Industries December quarter financial results.

Net debt: Hindalco standalone in addition to Utkal Alumina net debt to Ebitda (on TTM basis) improved to 2.36 times as on December 31 from 2.67 times as on March 31 last year. “Under its continuous deleveraging focus, the company prepaid another Rs 1,575 crore in October 2018,” Hindalco said in a release.

Ebitda: Total Ebitda of Hindalco Standalone plus Utkal Alumina increased to Rs 1,926 crore during the quarter under review against Rs 1,861 crore in the same quarter last year.

Update on Novelis: Novelis reported a strong quarterly performance on the back of increased asset optimisation, better product mix and favourable market conditions. Revenues grew 3 per cent to $3 billion, driven by higher average aluminium prices, higher shipments and a favourable product mix. The total shipments of flat rolled products (FRP) was up 1 per cent to 800 Kt in Q3 FY19. It reported adjusted Ebitda of $322 million, up 6 per cent from $305 million in Q3 FY18.

Various regulatory approvals for the Aleris acquisition are in progress, which is expected to close in Q2 FY20.

Revenue: The company’s revenue (Hindalco Standalone plus Utkal Alumina) increased 8.09 per cent YoY to Rs 11,938 crore in October-December over Rs 11,044 crore in Q3 FY18.

Board meetings"
17,2019-02-13,Hindalco,"Even though the realisations did not help us much, our earnings held up because our cost of productions were under control, Satish Pai, MD, Hindalco, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

Hindalco Q3 profit jumps 47% YoY to Rs 713 crore. What led to this rise?
The average realisation this quarter, especially for aluminium was about a $100 less than the previous quarter. So, our earnings held up because our cost of productions were under control. Even though the realisations did not help us much, good operations and cost control were primarily responsible for this quarter’s income.

Aluminium prices have remained around $1,900 per ton for quite some time. Could that impact realisations going ahead?

Yes, in January and half of February, the average has been around $1,850. Commodities have been affected by the uncertainty around the US-China trade war, concerns over the Chinese economy and fears of demand slowdown.

Until we get clarity on the state of the Chinese economy, the commodities would remain at this level.

Last time you had said that also that you were planning to really the dependence on LME. How is that going at this point of time?
Today 65% of our EBIDTA is Novelis and copper is not dependent on LME. It is the Hindalco India aluminium business that is dependent on LME. I think going forward, our plan is that the downstream business in India will also go from 300 KT to 600 KT and hopefully to about a million tons. We want that in a five-year time period, the amount of revenue and income dependent on LME goes down to about 20%.


 Input cost pressures have been high. How will that impact margins in the quarters coming?
 The good news for Q3 was that our cost of production was flat with Q2. That really it helped even though coal availability was tight, spot auctions coal prices being high. Our cost of production held largely due to efficient production in the plants. Our guidance for Q4 is that it is either going to be flat with Q3 or hopefully slightly down. We are already seeing signs that some of the input prices could be helping us.


Is the dumping of aluminium a matter of worry?What has happened in the nine months of this year to date is that imports have gone up 21%. Out of that, scrap has gone up 19% and the other products have gone up 24%. We are actually seeing that finished goods are coming in from China and ASEAN countries in a huge way and the scrap is coming in from the US in a huge way. 

Because of the US-China trade war, the Indian market is the best available market. It is growing. Aluminium demand grew by 11% and copper demand by 15%. India seems to be a target for most people to come and dump their products now. We are seeing the import surge because 21% year-on-year is a huge growth.


Given the situation in China, are you very confident of expansion there? We expect the slowdown in China to get resolved because China is the world’s second largest economy and whenever the economy starts to show signs of slowing, the government steps in with a lot of stimulus to get the economy going again and we think that this year also will be no different."
18,2019-02-13,Hindalco,"As many as three Nifty companies including Sun Pharmaceutical, Coal India and Hindalco announced their financial results on Tuesday for the quarter ended December 2018. 

While drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries posted nearly four-fold jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs 1,241.85 crore in Q3FY19, for state-owned Coal India on the other hand, the consolidated net profit increased 50 per cent to Rs 4,566.81 crore.

Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley is ‘Underweight’ on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 470. Generic business is stabilising for Sun Pharma and it should generate low-teens growth, says Morgan Stanley. 

However, Citi and CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 540 and Rs 560 per share, respectively.

CLSA believes that Sun’s current valuations are looking attractive at present levels and specialty pipeline execution will be the key focus area. Shares of the company were trading 2.30 per cent higher at Rs 446.80 at around 10 am (IST) on Wednesday, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 123 points, or 0.34 per cent, at 36,276 at around the same time.

Jeferries retained ‘Buy’ on Coal India with a target price of Rs 309. The brokerage firm gave a buy call on Coal India citing cheap valuations. It also believes that the recent volume trends are looking weak but should improve going forward. 

Coal India’s total income during the quarter under review jumped to Rs 26,209.13 crore from Rs 22,820.88 crore in the year-ago period.

Total expenses came at Rs 19,181.06 crore in Q3FY19 as against 18,172.78 crore in the corresponding period previous fiscal.

Production during the quarter stood at 155.97 million tonnes as against 152.73 MT.

Sameer Kalra, Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing said, “Q3FY19 results have surprised on the upside contributed by successful e-auctions resulting in margin expansion to 27 per cent from 20 per cent. This was accompanied with higher volume pick up resulting in 15 per cent sales growth. With price below IPO price and good dividend yield it is positive view for the stock in short term.” Shares of Coal India were trading 0.20 per cent down at Rs 222.50.

Aditya Birla Group company Hindalco reported 47 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 713 crore for the quarter ended December 2018. The consolidated figures include standalone figures of Hindalco as well as Utkal Alumina. 

However, it reported a 34.38 per cent fall in standalone net profit to Rs 247.46 crore for the December 2018 quarter due to increased cost of materials consumed. The company further said that “cost of materials consumed” were at Rs 7,812 crore, higher from Rs 6,884 crore in October-December 2017.

While maintaining a ‘Buy’ call on Hindalco, Motilal Oswal Finanial Services said, “We raise our FY19 and FY20 EPS estimates by 3 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, to factor in higher other income and hedging gains. Despite upgrade to earnings, we cut our target price to Rs 302 (from Rs 338) due to reducing EV/EBITDA valuation multiple from 6.5x to 6x, given the general de-rating of metal stocks and accounting for the Rs 650 crore outgo on the rights issue of Idea.”"
19,2019-02-13,Hindalco,"Hindalco is scouting for copper mines abroad for backward integration of its copper business with concentrates, said its managing director Satish Pai. “We won’t run them, but we may take an equity interest, and based on that equity interest we will get our share of production,” Pai told ET.

The company, a subsidiary of Aditya Birla Group, has 10-year term import contracts for copper concentrates that fulfil 80-90% of its requirement, but these are more expensive. It plans to acquire stake in a mine as part of the next phase of expansion of its copper business. Copper concentrates are raw material used for copper smelting, and captive sources for the material will help the company reduce dependence on the international market.

The company had two copper mines in Australia that were run by a subsidiary called Aditya Birla Minerals, but these were sold off two years ago.For its next phase of copper expansion, Hindalco may choose US or Canada as its preferred destination. “We prefer the more developed places because it’s easier to manage – that will be US, Canada,” said Pai.

Other countries where copper is found are Peru, Chile, Australia, Indonesia and Africa. Pai said the company, via its parent’s in-house mining arm, Essel Mining, is also looking at lithium possibilities in India since lithium is one of the most common alloys used with aluminium."
15,2019-02-13,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Alumina sales boosted the December-quarter net profit expansion at Hindalco Industries, although declining global prices of non-ferrous metals in 2019 and a softening trend in alumina might cap immediate gains at the Aditya Birla Group metals company.

Alumina contributed 43 per cent to the EBIDTA at Hindalco Industries along with Utkal Alumina as net profit for the standalone domestic business climbed 47 per cent to Rs 713 crore. EBIDTA rose 3.5 per cent at Rs 1,926 crore in a quarter marked by rising input costs, mainly for coal and furnace oil. Net revenue stood at Rs 11,938 crore, an increase of 8 per cent.

Cost efficiencies helped counterbalance the impact of input cost inflation.

“The cost of production for the business was flat compared with Q2, in spite of the LME going down by almost $100... which allowed us to maintain profitability,” Satish Pai, managing director at Hindalco, told ET.

Hindalco sources raw material from Utkal and hence the rise in alumina prices does not impact Hindalco’s overall performance. While EBIDTA from aluminium was down 46 per cent, the alumina business more than trebled.

Earnings could be tepid in the immediate future. Alumina prices, which averaged $450 per tonne, are down to an average of $384, similar to levels seen a year ago. Average aluminium prices for the December quarter were at

$1,968 per tonne and are now trading at $1,874 per tonne. Average copper prices in the year are $6,021 per tonne against $6,172 in the December quarter.

The company prepaid loans worth Rs 1,575 crore in October last year, and the net debt now stands at Rs 17,000 crore, with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.36. Interest expense was lower by 12 per cent at Rs 477 crore, mainly due to re-pricing of longterm project loans and loan repayments, a company statement said.

The acquisition of Aleris by US subsidiary Novelis will close in July, post which the company will start integration with Aleris.

Pai said that even with the “domestic demand story” looking positive due to improving demand for copper and aluminium, the local industry faces challenges in the shape of rising scrap imports from the US and finished metal shipments from China. Total aluminium imports rose 20 per cent.

Another worry for the company is the availability of coal. “The supply has been tight, with power demand rising, which is why coal prices haven’t come down,” Pai said.

Novelis, the US-based aluminium converter and a Hindalco subsidiary, reported a steady quarter with a 3 per cent jump in revenues and 6 per cent jump in EBIDTA, thanks to better product mix and higher shipments. EBIDTA for the quarter was $322 million, or about Rs 2,250 crore.

On Tuesday, Hindalco’s stock closed marginally lower at Rs 198.4. It is already down 10 per cent since the beginning of the year, reflecting the fall in the commodity prices."

Domestic stocks tanked on Friday amid fresh concerns over global economic slowdown after China's producer prices data for January showed a downward trend for the seventh successive month and the US retail sales recorded its biggest drop since 2009. 

Weakness in the rupee following a surge in global crude oil prices further dampened the mood. 

Uninspiring December quarter earnings, anxiety over political uncertainty in the run-up to the general elections and scepticism around the health of NBFCs and PSU banks have made investors stay away from the market. Every rise in the market is meeting with a fresh spell of profit booking. 

After falling some 365 points earlier in the day, Sensex pared much of the losses on support from shares of NTPC (up 4.13 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 1.47 per cent) and Larsen & Toubro (up 1.31 per cent) and closed the day 67 points, or 0.19 per cent, down at 35,808. 

Nifty finished 22 points, or 0.20 per cent, lower at 10,724. Midcaps and smallcaps suffered more, as their sectoral indices on BSE fell up to 1.18 per cent. 


Let's take a look at the highlights of Friday's session: 

Jet Airways settles 3% higher
Shares of Jet Airways (India) ended the day 2.99 per cent higher at Rs 232 on BSE after the company's board on Thursday approved a bank-led resolution plan (BLRP), entailing conversion of lenders’ debt into equity. Separately, a report said the company was planning to raise about Rs 6,000 crore from a government fund and through a rights issue. 


GMR Infra posts loss, but stock up
GMR Infrastructure reported Rs 561.04 crore loss in December quarter earnings against Rs 578.40 crore loss posted for the same quarter in FY18. The company attributed the loss to subdued show by its energy and highway verticals and lower credit ratings for some of its borrowings. Shares of the company closed 0.68 per cent higher at Rs 14.85. 


ONGC gains on Q3 earnings
Shares of ONGC climbed 2.27 per cent to end the session at Rs 135.10 after the company posted 64.77 per cent year-on-year rise in December quarter profit at Rs 8,262 crore in post-market hours on Thursday. Revenue of the company increased by 20.43 per cent YoY to Rs 27,694.09 crore in Q3FY19. 


Dr Reddy's pares losses
After plunging 30 per cent on NSE, shares of Dr Reddy's Laboratories pared much losses to close 4.17 per cent down at Rs 2,555.95. On the BSE, the stock closed 4.21 per cent down at Rs 2,556.90. Global brokerage Jefferies has retained an ‘underperform’ rating on the stock while cutting the target price to Rs 2,180 from Rs 2,667.25. A Reuters report said the company was issued Form 483 by USFDA on February 8, which notifies a company's management of objectionable conditions. 


Alembic Pharma climbs 1% 
Shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals settled with a gain of 1.09 per cent at Rs 541 apiece after it received approval from the US health regulator, USFDA, for Moxifloxacin Ophthalmic Solution, used for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible strains of certain organisms. 


Sugar stocks get sweeter
A day after the government hiked the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar by Rs 2 per kg to Rs 31 to help millers clear farmers' dues, some sugar stocks climbed. Piccadilly Sugar and Allied Industries rose 10 per cent, Dhampure Speciality Sugars gained 4.93 per cent, Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals 4.72 per cent, Parvati Sweetners and Power 4.65 per cent and Gayatri Sugars 4.59 per cent. 


Metals, healthcare stocks bleed
BSE Metal and Healthcare indices lost 2.32 per cent and 2.27 per cent, respectively, finishing as the top losers among the sectoral indices. On the other hand, BSE Utilities index jumped 2.63 per cent to emerge as top gainer among the sectoral indices, followed by BSE Power Index (up 2.17 per cent).

26,2019-02-16,Hindalco,"The pain was written all over the stock market's face as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty tumbled 2 per cent each during the past five sessions. 

While the BSE barometer took a beating of 738 points to settle at 35,809 for the week to February 15, its NSE counterpart lost 219 points to hit 10,724. The pessimism ran so high that the indices could not even manage a single positive close during the entire week. In fact, the Sensex had to put up with its longest losing streak in a year.

No major breakthrough in US-China trade dispute, mixed corporate earnings as well as a sharp selloff in select heavyweights dealt a blow to risk appetite. Sentiment turned fragile ahead of national elections due by May. 

“Serious attack against Indian security forces too weighed on investor sentiment on Friday. Expect volatility to increase further with investors turning cautious. Global developments like Brexit and US-China trade war and also Lok Sabha elections which is due in a few months will decide the trend of the market. In such a scenario, investors should focus on quality stocks and use price corrections to add fundamentally strong stocks,” said Hemang Jani, Head-Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

We will get you a snapshot of top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week. 


Yes Bank: Yes Bank shot up over 25 per cent this week, becoming the top gainer on the Nifty. The private lender gained traction after the Risk Assessment Report for FY18 observed nil divergences in the bank’s asset classification and provisioning from the RBI norms. However, the RBI has pulled up the private bank and warned of regulatory action for making public its observation, which it said was confidential. 


Jet Airways: Shares of Jet Airways came alive and climbed 2.99 per cent on Friday after its board approved a bank-led provisional resolution plan (BLPRP) that will pave the way for conversion of the airline’s debt into equity, making lenders the largest shareholders in the company. The scrip gained 3.20 per cent to Rs 232.60 for the week ended February 15.


CG Power: Shares of CG Power and Industrial Solutions on Wednesday declined over 32 per cent after the company said its consolidated net loss has widened to Rs 150.18 crore for the December quarter. However, the stock pared some losses and settled the week with a loss of 16.80 per cent at Rs 29.30.


A sweet dose: Sugar stocks hogged all the limelight on Friday after the government hiked the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar by Rs 2 per kg to Rs 31 to help millers clear farmers’ dues. A few sugar stocks made merry. Piccadilly Sugar and Allied Industries rose 10 per cent, Dhampure Speciality Sugars 4.93 per cent, Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals 4.72 per cent, Parvati Sweetners and Power 4.65 per cent and Gayatri Sugars 4.59 per cent. 

“The increase in MSP of sugar is positive for mills and expects the hike to improve the operating profit margins of sugar mills by around 6 per cent from the current levels and also aid them in clearing cane dues to farmers,” Icra said.


Top gainers and losers: Gujarat Narmada Valley (down 21.30) stood as a top loser in the BSE 500 pack.

27,2019-02-16,Hindalco,"Analyst Kunal Bothra says the case for a bounce could be far higher next week. He tells you which are on his buy list. He spoke to ETNow.

Edited excerpts:


ETNow: What is the sense you get when you look at the markets? We closed on a weak note.

Kunal Bothra: Last week was a bit of a drubbing which we saw not in the Nifty as such but more on midcap stocks. But the week ahead is going to be two-paced. One, we are likely to tap into that strong support zone both in terms of psychological and technical and derivatives data, that is 10,500-10,600. If we try and enter that zone, it is going to be a very strong support zone which we test and the way we would like to enter could be more in terms of oversold nature of indicators. 

Looking at both the contexts of what transpired last week and then what is likely in store in terms of the strong support zone, I believe the case for a bounce could be far higher next week. If the indices tap into that strong support zone say first half of next week, a strong buy or a contrarian view could emerge on the indices and I would look at least 250-300 points of rally on the index post that.


ET Now: What is your view on Hindalco, I mean 10 per cent down this week?
Kunal Bothra: A major part of that fall last week was on the back of some selling both in terms of volume and open interest or fresh open interests building up, but when I look at the chart structure on the monthly and the weekly time scale, Rs 180 now is a very strong support for the stock. 

But the weakness in metal stocks still continues overall. If that Rs 180 support now gets breached for Hindalco, you are talking of a sharper increase in momentum on the downside. What you have seen is more of a gradual selloff. If that Rs 180 support breaks, you could see a more aggressive selloff in Hindalco which might take the stock even to levels of Rs 160-165 quite swiftly.


ET Now: What are your stock picks?
Kunal Bothra: Two stocks. One is from the large cap space and that is a buy on Reliance Industries. I believe that the stock is heading towards a short-term bottom and a retest of the previous swing high. So, that is a buy, Rs 1,320 as a target on Reliance Industries and stop loss at Rs 1,200. 

REC and PFC have been doing extremely well even in a market which has become very volatile. RFC is now on the verge of a breakout on the upside, a consolidation breakout and that I believe should be extremely positive for the stock price. That is also a buy, Rs 128 as the target and stop loss at Rs 118.


ET Now: What is your view on Yes Bank, after days it has given a 20% upmove, Rs 40 upmove in a week?

Kunal Bothra: Thursday move was extremely strong and positive for the stock price. On Friday, you did not see a follow through of price move but the volumes on Friday were also pretty much on the higher side. Net-net, the deliver volumes for both Thursday and Friday were on the extremely high side for Yes Bank and I think that itself indicates that there is a renewed change of trend which is happening for the stock price, which should probably be reflected in the stock price in the next two to three months. 

For Yes Bank, the woes have been slightly over and you should see the stock scaling higher. Rs 250-260 could be a near term target range, given the timeframe of 2-3 months."
31,2019-02-18,Hindalco,"Some of the gold finance companies which had fallen off the cliff after DeMo, have come back up quite sharply 
  
  
  since last year. Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

While the NBFC crisis is not at its peak, it continues to be a big overhang. What are you witnessing in terms of flows in the banking space?
It has been a slow month in the office for fund managers. Overall, the flow from domestic investors have slowed down a tad. It is still at around Rs 5,000 crore, but that is lower than what has been printing over the last year or so. The fund managers have moved to larger corporate banks. HDFC continues, ICICI and Axis are some of the largest buyers for this month and that is a trend that we have been seeing. Money flow towards ICICI and Axis has been increasing. That is one broad-based trend that we expect to continue for some time. 


The real pain has been felt in the broader end of the market. What is the data with respect to some of the top midcaps that have been sold?
For midcaps, it has been a little bit of a mixed bag. Some of the gold finance companies which had fallen off the cliff after DeMo, have come back up quite sharply since last year. We saw some profit booking in Manappuram, the likes of Muthoot. HEG is an interesting play where we have seen a very sharp drop off in the price, almost 50-55% that is another play. Manager have probably made 10x money in that, but seen a sharp drop in price and so they have taken some money off the table. These would be some of the larger plays on the midcap side where we have seen some selling.


What about autos? Do they continue to see outflows or are people buying in at declines?
That is actually an interesting trend that we are spotting. Maruti continues to see some outflows. It is not large but there have been some selling. The auto ancillaries, especially the likes of some of the tyre companies or of Exide have been seeing some buying and that is something that we have been seeing over the last few months. But we are seeing some flows on Maruti, Eicher counters.


What about the top midcap and smallcap holdings?
We have seen buying into the likes of Persistent or Hexaware on the midcap side. The other thing that is heartening to see is some like Indian Hotels or Jubilant continue to see some buying. That would be the broader trend in terms of the consumer spending that is playing out on the midcap side.


How does pharma stand right now?
Pharma is very flat. I was looking at the names. Probably the likes of Natco got some buying but otherwise there has been some selling in Cadila, Lupin. It is not very large selling but that is the counter where we saw some exciting action last year. Now, it has just fallen off the radar for most managers.



What else? The ADAG Group is very active on the back of high volumes. There are other news flow driven stocks like a Jet Airways, Bank. What has been your observation because they have been so sensitive to the news flow on a daily basis?
That is actually a good point that you bring up. When you look at some of the sells that have happened, the likes of Reliance Infra, Apollo Hospitals, two names that were there because of the pledged share news that has been coming out, have also seen some selling. There has been some selling in YES Bank, but if I look at the previous month’s trend, just some money is being taken off the table. It is not really a trend that I would draw from that.


I do not spot metals at all on the buy or the sell list?
Metals is something that is kind of out of fashion right now. So, probably marginal buying in Hindalco but otherwise it is pretty flattish."

28,2019-02-18,Hindalco,"Gautam Singhania recently shared with students the complexities of running a family business, and why it’s important to divest a few responsibilities. 

Gautam Hari Singhania, chairman of Raymond Ltd, was one of the keynote speakers at IIT Bombay earlier this year. Speaking to young students, he discussed the complexities of running a family business and the challenges he faced in taking Raymond to the next level, including putting his professional life ahead of his personal one.

“Raymond, like many family run businesses, had adopted the family first approach. However, since 2015, we have changed our approach to business first,” he said.

Dwelling on the on-going spat with his father Vijaypat Singhania, he reiterated that the bone of contention was a duplex flat in the renovated JK House, which could not be given to his father as shareholders had rejected a resolution. “Despite being the largest shareholder, I abstained from voting though I would have also voted against the resolution. I have suffered on the family front for doing what is right for the business,” he said.

Singhania also pointed out that if family businesses don’t adapt and bring in the distinction of ownership and management, then they run the risk of being obsolete. “It is in the best interest of the family to ensure that the management delivers and enhances the value of the family’s holdings,” he said.

Hands-off
Having stepped down as chairman from some of the group companies, Singhania said that giving up responsibility of day-to-day management of multiple businesses was crucial. 

“I look at my present responsibilities in three distinct areas — communicate, motivate and simplify,” he said. 

“Communicating with the management and helping them communicate with other stakeholders on what we are doing. Motivating our senior management, our employees and associates to help realise our objectives. Simplifying the complex issues that are emerging as business challenges in the current global scenario and planning for them with responses is the third area.”

Sharing his experience of being hands off, Singhania said that he was informed about the appointment of an independent director on the board of a group company over an email. This kind of approach, he said, helps professionals feel a sense of ownership. And it has its benefits. “I am busier than ever before, as I have more time to plan on what needs to be done and meet more people who matter, rather than be busy with operational matters.”"

34,2019-02-20,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty jumped higher in opening deals on Wednesday, mirroring the upbeat sentiment of other major Asian peers. 

Asian stocks advanced to 4.5 month highs on Wednesday as investors bet that Chinese and US trade negotiators would be able to secure a deal to de-escalate their year-long tariff war, Reuters reported. 

A new round of talks between the two countries, to find an amicable solution to the trade-related issues, started on Tuesday. Some higher level sessions are scheduled later this week, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visiting Washington on Thursday and Friday.

Now, investors await minutes from the US Fed for clues on its balance sheet reduction policy and the course of future interest rates.

Around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was 255 points, or 0.72 per cent, up at 35,607, while Nifty was 72 points, or 0.68 per cent, up at 10,676. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.62 per cent and 0.54 per cent up, respectively, at that time.

Barring Hero MotoCorp, HCl Technologies, Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra, all other components of the Sensex index were in the green.

Vedanta was leading the pack of Sensex gainers, rising 3 per cent. ONGC, Tata Steel, YES Bank, Bajaj Finance and Bharti Airtel were also among the top gainers. 

All sectoral indices were in the green on BSE, with metal, oil & gas and energy rising over 1 per cent. Gains in shares of Vedanta, Tata Steel, Hindalco and JSW Steel lifted metal pack.

35,2019-02-20,Hindalco,"Holding high cash balances and booking profit in slowing sectors like auto have helped Axis Mutual Fund’s equity schemes turn the table toppers in the past one year.

At a time when most mutual fund scheme returns are negative, as stocks corrected sharply, equity schemes of Axis Mutual Fund have given positive returns, outperforming their benchmarks and peers.

Over the last one year, as per data from mutual fund tracking firm Value Research, Axis Bluechip Fund with assets of ₹4,000 crore returned 9.07%, when the large-cap category lost 1.07%. For Axis Multicap Fund with assets of ₹3,000 crore, the net asset value gained 9.7% even as the category recorded a 5.61% loss. Axis Midcap Fund with assets of ₹1,800 crore returned 4%, vis-à-vis a 12.32% fall in the segment.

Increasing the cash in its key equity mutual fund schemes, instead of deploying that, has been one of the reasons for the funds’ stellar performance, financial planners said. “At a time when the markets fell and other schemes lost out due to the fall, Axis managed to outperform its peers,” said S Shankar, a certified financial planner at Credo Capital.

Over the past one year, Axis Bluechip has increased cash in its portfolio to 19.2% from 9.8% and Axis Midcap to 18.1% from 5%. For Axis Multicap, this has reduced to 18.6% from 20%.

“We have reduced exposure to sectors which have slowed down over the last one year. The market is narrow and we are actively looking for opportunities to deploy cash,” said Shreyash Devalkar, fund manager, Axis Mutual Fund. Due to the good performance, its schemes are believed to be getting higher inflows compared with rivals. This is adding to the cash levels. Anticipating a slowdown in the auto sector, the fund manager exited stocks like Motherson Sumi, Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland and MRF.

It also sold shares in commodity players like Hindalco and Tata Steel. Among other stocks it exited are HDFC AMC, Page Industries and Jubilant FoodWorks, where valuations were high.

Devalkar added stocks like ICICI Bank, Bata, Wipro, Nestle, Infosys and TCS in the past few months.

“The fund manager sticks to quality stocks. Since these have become expensive, he prefers to hold cash in the portfolio,” said Shankar, the financial planner.

However, many wealth managers do not like holding cash in their portfolios, as they believe it is difficult to time the market and if it goes wrong, they could end up underperforming or delivering volatile performance. “A fund manager should be fully invested. Asset allocation or holding cash in the overall portfolio is best decided by the investor and his adviser,” said Amol Joshi, founder of investment services provider Plan Rupee.

  markets and corporate affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now. LIC Housing, L&T Finance and Havells, Bharti & Bharat Forge are the five marquee names that can outperform in 2019, says Bhasin. Edited excerpts:


What is your strategy when it comes to the banking pack at the moment?
There is extreme pessimism and despondency at a time when globally markets are looking the best they have looked in a year and Indian markets are down a little bit on geopolitics. I am extremely positive on the market and I could name four bank stocks -- ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank First, SBI and Federal Bank. In these four names there is a lot of steam on the upside. PSU banks have clearly outperformed on back of recapitalisation. Bond yields are lower and the pessimism is overdone. Assets are going to improve and net interest incomes are going to rise. 


Given the volatility we have seen recently, would you still stick to some of the safer larger plays?
I have been in the market for 30 years and I have not seen this type of pessimism on midcaps. We are missing the woods for the trees. Look at the positives of NCLT, IBC. We are seeing errant promoters who are coming back to bid for their assets -- whether it is Ruias or Jaypee or Anil Ambani. It is telling us that with backs to the wall, banks are going to be in an extremely sweet spot.

Midcaps are going to double in the next one year if not triple. There is a lot of valuation comfort. There is dismal ownership and macros are changing for the better. So, I would be more bullish on the midcaps with a six-month view. 

In the medium ,term there are places to hide but we want to make money on an alpha. We think that there is a lot of room on the upside on a lot of midcaps. In select largecaps, ACC, Asian Paints, Reliance,UltraTech are the marquee names where you could be making money in the short run. The real picture is in the broader market which in the next year can even double. 


Consumption that seems to have been another theme that has been talked about a lot recently. Are there particular plays that you are focusing on?
I will give you four ideas. One would be Bharti Tele on the back of th fact that this election will be seeing the maximum amount of social media we have ever seen historically. Second would be Bharat Forge.


One sector where midcaps have more presence in one year’s timeframe but probably would revive in two years timeframe? Stocks that would substantially reward investors?
It is difficult to give specific ideas but the broader market is extremely positive. Look at insurance, a stock like ICCI Pru is giving enough comfort. Look at metals. I would say select largecaps are extremely attractive even at this price. Tata Steel, JSW, Hindalco are just to name a few. 

In constructionm whether it is Nagarjuna Construction or an NBCC or a Sadbhav Engineering, a lot of ideas are there and in auto, there are Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motor.

We just heard the management of Ashok Leyland talking of 25% growth next year. They are realigned to the BS-VI norms; there are a large number of defence orders on the truck side; there are 200 airports where buses will be supplied and in all biggest gainer will be Ashok Leyland. 

There are enough ideas, but one has to be a brave heart and and build a portfolio when the screen is red. If you do, you may be laughing your way to the bank by this Diwali and definitely by March 2020. 


Why do you like Bharti?
This election is going to see the maximum amount of data usage. Social media is at the highest ever in our historic battle and pricing power is coming back. It will be a two-way battle between Jio and Bharti. Bharti is going to definitely see a lot of revenue on both sides. They are in the process of selling some of their assets. They are in the process of realising the monetisation of their Africa business. The sum of parts, if you can ignore the rhetoric, is Bharti look good for at least 20% upside. 

The other stock which I mentioned was Bharat Forge, also I would like to mention that in this NBFC fiasco, LIC Housing is looking extremely good after the last two quarterly results and it becomes a very good proxy where the management and the pedigree of the promoter will stand out in this carnage which has taken place. 

LIC Housing, L&T Finance and Havells in the consumer electricals would be five marquee names which I think can outperform for 2019. 


What should one stay away from? 
It is a good point but that has been the best place to hide even though expensive have become more expensive and that would definitely be some of the largecap consumer names -- the Levers, the Nestles, the Asian Paints. However we have had a buy on them much lower and we still think they should be part of your portfolio but we do not want to hide. We want to be brave enough and buy the broader market; metals, autos where there is extreme pessimism which I think on the consumption side can lead from the front. 

We also think in the auto space Eicher Motors will stand out given that Siddarth Lal is now enlarging his encompass in India and beyond. Closer to Rs 20,000 is again a very good opportunity to get into Eicher Motors. There are a whole lot of stocks and sectors which can outperform. You have to be just a little brave hearted because that is where you are going to make a lot of money in the next one year."

4,2019-03-06,Hindalco,"If exuberance is a little bit ahead of you, you might start to short even today or maybe tomorrow some of the auto names and two-wheelers, rather than buying into them at this point of time, said Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Financial Services, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts:


There were enough naysayers who said that do not buy the market, election is round the corner, go for a holiday and come back only after the elections. What happens now for those who have gone on holiday? Are they missing on something?
No, I do not think they are missing on anything. These hope rallies do come out of nowhere and this is a rally which nobody had predicted. It has come out of nowhere in terms of purchase but it is always a part of a market which kind of bottoms out. There are not enough sellers left in the system. All the weak sellers on the weak hands have been out of the market. 

These hope rallies happen all the time. More surprisingly, it has come in the backdrop of the lowest GDP growth rate, farm income being negative and America saying that GSP preferences are gone and you still have a hope rally. It is not the first time that we have seen hope rally. It is not the last we are going to see it. All in all, we should enjoy it, giving an excellent opportunity to investors who are stuck for liquidity more than price in the small and the midcap sector to rebalance their portfolios. 

I am not saying let us not enjoy the rally but this is not something you want to buy into at this point of time. If exuberance is a little bit ahead of you, you might start to short even today or maybe tomorrow some of the auto names and two-wheelers, etc, rather than buying into them at this point of time.


You are sounding slightly bearish to me. When you say go short, that means you are not sceptic, you are bearish.
Of course! The auto story has got two components – the economy and the competition. It is an absolutely humongous competition. There is the discounting. So, it is not about volume, it is not about sentiment. It is about what is going to be the profitability of these companies as the discounts come in and eat up the bottom line. You can hope for best and there is a lot of hope for some of the smaller stocks which could have been beaten down. 

Some of the very good dividend paying stocks like you saw recovery in NALCO, etc, where it went down to Rs 42 or Rs 44 and the dividend declaration was Rs 4.5. You really were talking out dividend yields of 7% to 8% and did the same Rs 4.5 last year in February. Commodity stocks, of course, get re-rated because dividend outflows are going to be huge at this point of time. 

Some have been running in a band. Yes Bank which has recovered. Axis Bank is now on the path of consolidation. When you look at the story from a larger stand point and say this gives me an opportunity to rebalance my portfolio, this does not give me an opportunity to start splurging in terms of fresh investments. I would still say time for fresh investment is far away. We do not need to over commit in this market rally. We should use it to our advantage. It happens both ways. Exuberance happens and pessimism happens. Maybe we will be reaching exuberance very soon compared to the fundamentals of the companies and the profitability more than just the demand. 


How would you deploy this opportunity of a recovery in the market and across market caps? How would you rebalance the portfolio? What would be on which side of the scale?
Scale is very simple. It keeps taking your portfolio up in terms of size of the companies you are invested in. There is economic logic to say that if the economy is slowing to 6-6.5% or thereabouts or maybe 6.2% in this quarter and remains at about 6.5% next quarter after that, the burden of that will fall on the lowest part of the segment of the economy which are the smallest companies. 

It is a given that as the market gives you opportunity, you take your portfolio up to bigger set of companies. There has been a re-rating of sugar-related companies which has seen a substantial re-rating, thanks to government incentives, But let us see how long it runs because the rally has been fast and furious and you come back. You tend to exit some of the commodity stocks at this point of time. In sugar, you should definitely take profits off the table at this point of time. 

We do not know how the new allocation will pan out in the market and post the election fever, what kind of subsidies will again come back to the sugar industry. Right now, they are the darlings of the market because of the vote bank that they have along with them but what happens once the elections are well on the way? Will they actually get the disbursement? So, you should definitely get out of commodity. You definitely get out of the very small companies. You definitely get out small auto ancillaries. You do not want to be there. You definitely get out of small infrastructure stocks. You do not want to be there again. 

It is about making a portfolio more shock-proof and less volatile in terms of performance, in terms of stock market and in terms of liquidity. Go to more liquid stocks. Use this chance of liquidity to exit illiquid stocks. Long back, you could not sell 5,000 shares of most companies in a day. Today if you can, use it to your advantage. There is liquidity, use it. 


What is the outlook when it comes to the broader end of the market? The small cap index is mirroring 2008-2009. The small cap index declined 72% between January 2008 and February 2009. Do you believe risk aversion to a certain extent is fading and that we will see this sort of continuation in mid and smallcaps?
Of course not. That is why I said do not get fooled by hope rally because the issues of the smallcaps are very different. There are issues of corporate governance. You are seeing larger companies scrambling for corporate governance, i.e. Sun Pharma, Zee. Can you imagine what is happening below the line into the smaller companies where you hardly have any kind of supervision of analysts and all kind of stuff? 

It is not just about fundamentals. It is also about corporate governance. It is about promoter linkages. I am not painting all with the same brush and saying they are all bad but then it is very hard to pick and choose. Who knows which one will fall by the wayside next time? Where the intercompany loans are? What is the promoter doing? 

In a background, where you do not need to take those chances, this market is brilliant because it gives you a chance to make money at the top end with less risk, more certainty and less volatility. If you are trading that off to do something very risky in an unknown environment, the returns should be commensurate to that. 

Also, that segment cannot be a big part of your portfolio. Maybe you want to play around with 10% of your portfolio but you still need to judge yourself as to what you do with 80% of your money and not with the last 20% which you can speculate with. I would still say 20% will not drive your portfolio but will drive your anxieties.


Anything that you would buy afresh?
I am always a buyer of private banks. I always buy consumer stocks also because they are the greatest things this country has for a long time to come. These two segments are a very boring kind of a market but you really want to keep buying into this segment. We have started buying commercial vehicles. Commodities are still on the radar, We are still buying commodities because we believe most commodity companies are dirt cheap. You do not get value as we discussed just now 8%, 9% yields on dividend alone year on year now. 

We are already 65-70% invested in the market. I doubt I will put 30% more in this market. But I will not buy very smallcap companies.. I will certainly look at some of the rerated companies like DCM Shriram. The chemical companies are producing astounding results, paper companies are producing decent results. They are not the darlings of the market but one can get a 20% yield top-up over a year on the portfolios. Nothing much has changed in terms of markets.


What are your top three holding minus HDFC Bank?
Number one after HDFC Bank is Yes Bank, then Axis Bank and thirdly ICICI Bank. It is very small and I would not even count it.


How much of your portfolio currently is in small and midcap stocks?
A very small part of the portfolio is in defence-related stocks that we bought into very early and paying the price for it to be honest. Like rest of the country, we were not smart enough to understand that defence contracts will not flow through so easily. So, we bought into a slew of defence-related smallcap companies which has not been a very wide decision.


You mentioned that you like companies which have a strong dividend yield. That guess logic is applicable for a Coal India, Nalco, HPCL, NTPC. Dividend yield in Coal India is 9-10%, NTPC is 5-6%, HPCL, BPCL is 4-5%. Is that a bait enough? Is that a strong enough reason why one should buy into some of these stocks?
The answer is yes and not only because they are high dividend paying but because they carry no debt on the balance sheet. They have no debt price to book ratio or are closer to 1-1.5 which is like ridiculous absolutely. There is a peculiar situation in the market why these companies are valued at what they are but it is good enough. To me 8%, 7% dividend yield and on top of that a company which has a book value of less than 1 leads to natural resource, a kind of a monopoly because you cannot get another aluminium company apart from Hindalco and Nalco to come into this country. May be Vedanta may come around a little bit. Vedanta is a monopoly situation where price to book is one or closer to one, no debt on the balance sheet and a government which will ensure the fact that large part of the cash earnings is used for dividends and not frittered away. 

I am so glad that these companies are giving dividend and not behaving like ITC which for the last seven years have frittered away humongous amount of cash flows into paperboard, hotels and consumer companies which have given no returns to anybody.

I love this company which give me back the money. I can redeploy it and you keep making your money, keeping digging the ground for producing alumina and giving me the cash.

The way the company’s balance sheet is positioned and the possibilities of future cash flow distribution to shareholders makes it a wonderful place to be, instead of putting money in fixed deposits, If you bought Nalco at Rs 60, after it went to Rs 45, yes you are facing a capital gain issue but then you added these stocks because you saw a dividend of Rs 4.50 last February. That will not be changing this February because of the government’s fiscal position. So when we were in a position at 45,we knew that 4.5 is coming our way. So, your net cost of acquisition is now Rs 40 on a company like Nalco, at 0.8 times book value. I don’t know, whatever arithmetic one uses, it is a wise investment.


 I admiring the courage. I am also accepting that you got to be safe and conservative. That is my limited point.
 I keep saying that if you want excitement, go to the casino! This is not a place to go to for your hard-earned money! Let us put it to work to the best of our ability. There will be good years and bad years. Let us be honest about it. But as investors and people on the TV we have to make honest effort to tell our people that there is a concept called risk weighted return that you must look at. Sure some stocks may have done 40%, but the kind of risk you may have taken to do it could be a wipe-out risk at this point of time. You need to understand where your risk mentality is and deal with it. 

In a market like this, one of the things which happen is as price market goes up, you will find a lot more selling coming in. A lot of people are waiting for threshold levels to be reached before they liquidate the stocks. That puts a level to the midcap markets because lots more supply is going to hit as the prices come up. You will see more supply coming in midcaps in terms of investors getting out and mutual funds in the midcap category being redeemed."

During a recent global business summit, Hinduja confessed to taking quick, on-the-spot business decisions, most notably during his morning walks.

“Many of my decisions are taken in St James’s Park while walking. Any businessman comes with any proposal, I tell him to come for a walk and I give him a coffee,” said the London-based billionaire, who lives in a sprawling six-storeyed Carlton House terrace mansion close to Buckinghham palace, overlooking the park. “I walk exactly at 7.45 till 8.45 (am) and from 8.45 to 8.55 (am), there is a coffee free of cost.”

Gopichand is not the only Hinduja brother to enjoy the benefits of St James’s Park. During an interview with a newspaper, the eldest brother Srichand (SP) mentioned how a daily dawn walk feeding squirrels’ peanuts had helped him master financial prudence. “They take one and save two,” he explained.

49,2019-03-28,Hindalco,"Ignoring the compounders and investing in the index as a whole does not look promising to Saurabh Mukherjea, a Dalal Street veteran.

In an interview with ETNow, the founder of Marcellus Investment Managers said the benchmark indices also comprise weak companies. 

He said there are at least a dozen companies which consistently compounded wealth year after year during last 5-15 years. “It is foolish to ignore them and try to pick a company with low PE multiples on hopes that it will rally tomorrow morning,” he said. 

Sharing his insights on various sectors, Mukherjea said consumption will continue to roar in India, whereas an export-driven recovery in the pharma sector should be around the corner. 

“Probably, we are halfway through in the auto slowdown, both in cars and trucks. I believe the demand situation is still very healthy in small-ticket consumption, be it FMCG, apparel, restaurant and quick service restaurants,” he said.

In the real estate space, Mukherjea finds commercial real estate a very viable asset class as there is a shortage of high-quality office space in the big cities. 

The BSE Realty index advanced 13.50 per cent in last six months with Godrej Properties rallying the most at 41 per cent. Among others, shares of Oberoi Realty, Sobha, Suntek Realty and Phoenix Mills and DLF have gained between 10 per cent and 25 per cent during September 27, 2018 and March 27, 2019. On the other hand, Mahindra Lifespace Developers and Indiabulls Real Estate declined 19 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.

“Well-run commercial real estate plays can generate 8-10 per cent yields. This space is worth looking at. However, I am not sure on the residential realty for the next four-five years,” he said. 

Mukherjea, known for popularising Coffee-Can investing in India, is bullish on frontline private sector banks, as he thinks non-banking finance companies would give up more market shares to the banks in next 12 months. Nifty Bank closed above the 30,000 mark for the first time ever on Wednesday.

The slowdown in global economies is not a good sign for the metals sector, says Mukherjea. He said the western world, including the US and Europe, recently signalled a slowdown in economic growth. 

Barring NMDC and JSPL, none of the stocks in the BSE Metals index have delivered positive returns so far this year. The BSE Metal index dipped 5 per cent on a year-to-date basis, while the 30-share Sensex advanced 5 per cent in the same period.

Shares of Nalco, Vedanta, SAIL and Hindalco have slipped up to 18 per cent between January and March.

“A slowdown in economic growth in the world’s big economic blocks is not good news for metal prices. However, how deep is the China slowdown is still a mystery to me,” he said.

Mukherjea said the domestic equity market has followed global equity markets with a distance in March. Sensex has advanced over 11 per cent in March so far.

“Till February end, we did not participate in that rally. In that aspect, we are following the global equity rally,” he said."
50,2019-03-29,Hindalco,"The words innovation and disruption are synonymous with technological advancements. And the words ‘tech’ and ‘techie’ conjure certain images in our minds. But that shouldn’t be the case, according to Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani.

Speaking at an All India Management Association event recently, Nilekani said, “We think that innovation is about 23-year-olds wearing hoodies doing things. But the innovation in India is happening by everyone at all levels.” He recalled a lecture he had given on fintech in Bengaluru in 2015. “I asked all the techies if the incumbent banks will win or challengers like them will.... They [the techies] were convinced that incumbent banks won’t be able to adapt,” Nilekani said.

Incidentally, one of the evening’s winners was Aditya Puri of HDFC Bank, an organisation that qualifies as an incumbent bank here. He said that the techies were unaware that Puri had visited the Silicon Valley and was studying all that was happening technology-wise in the space. The import of Nilekani’s message: innovation can happen “in the public sector, in the private sector, whether you are young or old. It really doesn’t matter. It is the mindset of bringing new ideas into play”.

1,2019-04-01,Hindalco,"In a big relief to the Indian markets, MSCI has deferred its decision to exclude the shares being offered through Global and American Depository Receipts (GDRs, ADRs) while calculating foreign ownership limits (FOL), the measures that could have led over $1 billion outflow of overseas funds from India. Hectic negotiations between Indian government officials and MSCI have led the global index provider to postpone its decision, according to people in the know.

This is the second such decisions in three months where the global index provider differed its decision that could have impacted foreign flows to India. Earlier this year, MSCI deferred action against India for limiting investor access. The global index provider had earlier planned to cap India’s weight in the MSCI-EM index after local exchanges suggested curbs on data sharing with the Singapore bourse.

“Both pressure tactic and positive approach by the Indian government officials prompted MSCI to defer those negative actions against Indian stocks,” said a person aware of the development.

After several fund managers and domestic investors’ demanded that the government should take corrective measures immediately to address the situation, officials led by Sanjeev Sanyal, principal economic advisor to the Prime Minister, held a series of discussions on the ideal MSCI weights that represent India’s economic performance and prospects.

The Indian government is said to have expressed concerns about the relative disparity in the weightages of India and other countries with positive approach to open up more free floats shares to foreign investors. Currently, China has a 32.12 per cent weight, while India’s weight is at 8.45 per cent. S Korea has 13.69 per cent, while Taiwan and Brazil have 11.16 per cent and 7.62 per cent, respectively.

“To avoid a potential reverse turnover following any such enhancements or other initiatives to increase investable market capitalisation of Indian equity market for international institutional investors, MSCI will temporarily maintain the current treatment and not reduce the weight of the impacted index constituents,” MSCI said in a statement on Friday.

MSCI will closely monitor the developments related to accessibility of DRs, as well as other enhancements related to FOL in India and will re-assess the situation prior to November 2019, it said.

While determining the weight of a company, MSCI considers both domestic shares and depository receipts for calculating the foreign inclusion factor (FIF), which determines the total proportion of shares of a company that offshore investors can buy from the exchanges.

MSCI wanted to exclude depository receipts, which would reduce the proportion of free-float shares available for foreign investors, thereby slashing the weight of the company. Stocks such as L&T, ITC, M&M, Dr Reddy’s, Gail and Hindalco could have seen the steepest selling in case of any change in methodology. For instance, Tata Motors’ free float would have shrunk to 51.8 per cent from 63 per cent if its shares in the form of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) were excluded for calculating foreign inclusion factor.

However, the biggest worry for Indian markets today is the global index provider’s decision to quadruple the weights of Chinese mainland shares in the MSCI benchmark in three steps. It will increase the inclusion factor of Chinese large-cap stocks to 20 per cent from the current 5 per cent, with increments of 5 per cent each in May, August and November.

On completion, the weight of Chinese mainland stocks in the MSCI Emerging Market Index will jump to 3.3 per cent from roughly 0.7 per cent at present. India’s weight will come down by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, resulting in an investment outflow of nearly $2 billion, as funds that invest according to the weights of the index components adjust their holdings."
0,2019-04-01,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: Ahead of Vodafone Idea’s $3.6 billion rights issue, Kumar Mangalam Birla is reorganising unlisted group companies to raise funds, said people with knowledge of the matter. 

SKI Carbon Black Mauritius Ltd (Birla Carbon) is set to buy a controlling interest in Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd for $450 million. Both are promoter companies of the Aditya Birla Group chairman. Birla owns 100% of Kiran Investments, which owns these entities.

Carbon Black is said to be in talks with banks to raise short-term debt of $300 million and $150 million. It has also sought a relaxation in loan covenants from 3.5 times debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) to 4.1-4.2 times, said the people cited above.





BIRLA CARBON RAISED DEBT FOR TELECOM VENTURE DURING MERGER
Axis Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi are believed to be funding the acquisition. An independent valuation will determine the controlling interest that will get transferred.

An Aditya Birla Group spokesperson declined to comment.

As co-promoter, Birla and the group companies are to contribute Rs 7,250 crore to the rights issue. Vodafone Group intends to pitch in with Rs 11,000 crore.

The funds from SKI Carbon will be up-streamed to Kiran Investments, one of the apex promoter entities of Idea. Aditya Birla Group owns 26.54% of Vodafone Idea, held through Grasim, Hindalco and Birla TMT Holdings, among others.

The rights issue is expected to provide the company with ammunition for about two years in the highly competitive sector, analysts said. Vodafone Idea’s debt was Rs 1.24 lakh crore at the end of December. Finance costs were about Rs 7,750 crore each in the past four quarters and losses in that period added up to Rs 10,700 crore. And, coming up is the 5G spectrum auction.

“Bankers are increasingly getting wary of funding Idea’s losses. As a promoter too, his flexibility is getting crimped,” said an executive with one of the lenders to the group. “Earlier, Birla relied heavily on Essel Mining, another private company, as his key money spinner. But following the mining ban and regulatory crackdowns, Essel has lost much of its earlier sheen.”

The worry is that group financials are being stretched to support telecom, experts said. Birla Carbon still has some headroom left but the use of proceeds will create an overhang as it already has on Grasim and Hindalco, they said.

According to Fitch Ratings, the positive outlook of the company’s credit ratings is on the expectation that Birla Carbon’s leverage will improve over the next few years, after increasing in the financial year ended March 2019 due to a large payout to shareholders and other entities.

SKI Carbon Black raised about $500 million in debt during the Idea-Vodafone merger. With this round, it will nearly touch a $1 billion.

Its revenue has fluctuated historically along with carbon black prices, which move in tandem with the underlying feedstock—carbon black oil. Ebitda has declined since 2012 on the back of global oversupply. In FY16, it fell 40% because of an increase in supply from Chinese producers with low-cost carbon black products, which led to a drop in global operating utilisation levels to 75-80%.


PRIVATE JEWELS
The Aditya Birla Group had previously explored the idea of merging Essel with Hindalco for additional financial support after the 2007 Novelis acquisition, according to those with knowledge of the matter. Hindalco eventually made a success of the purchase, generating $350-400 million of free cashflows every year and went on to acquire Aleris for $2.58 billion in July 2018 to become the leading value-added aluminium maker globally.

Incorporated in 1978, Swiss Singapore is a leading bulk commodity trader dealing in various metals and minerals (coal, oil, sulphur, caustic soda), agro commodities (pulses, beans) and fertilisers across the world for group entities as well as third parties.

SKI Carbon Black is one of the world’s top three producers of carbon black with an 11% market share by value, behind Cabot Corp that commands a 21% share. The top three companies account for 40% of the estimated $15 billion global carbon black market. The rest of the market is fragmented, with many small companies competing at the regional level.

Birla is betting on the telecom sector normalising soon, which makes the success of the rights issue crucial. Idea will have nearly Rs 20,000 crore in debt maturing before FY21.

“Completion of Vodafone Idea’s announced deleveraging initiatives—rights issue and potential asset divestments of tower and fibre network—would help the company address potential funding shortfalls in the near to medium term, all else equal,” said Manish Adhukia and Manish Mubayi of Goldman Sachs.

“However, our analysis suggests leverage (net-debt-to-Ebitda) by FY21E is likely to remain at >7x, given its elevated capex/interest payments and resulting negative free cash flows (FCF); we forecast FCF for Vodafone Idea to stay negative at least until FY23E.”

Vodafone India merged with Idea Cellular on August 31 last year, making Vodafone Idea the country’s biggest phone company. It has a subscriber base of about 387 million and a revenue market share of 36%."

IPO WATCH
Metropolis IPO: The diagnostics company has raised Rs 530 crore on Tuesday by allotting 60.24 lakh shares to 26 anchor investors at 880 per share. The 1,200-crore offer, which will run from April 3 to 5, consists of about 15.3 million shares.


Analyst calls• Emkay has reiterated its buy rating on Navin Fluorine International with a target price ₹922. After the commencement of cGMP-3 plant, NFIL’s overall CRAMs capacity will be doubled. Given that it is a high-margin segment, the pick-up in cGMP-3 should provide a significant boost to profits and return ratios, according to the brokerage. 

• Sharekhan has maintained its buy rating on Petronet LNG with a target price of Rs 270. We remain confident on earnings visibility along with healthy return on equity of about 21%, said the brokerage. At the current market price, the stock is trading at 14.9 times its FY20 estimated EPS and 13.3 times its FY21E EPS.

• CLSA has maintained a buy rating on Marico with Rs 465 target price citing positive commentary at a time of slowdown worries. Marico’s pre-quarter commentary is a positive one. In addition, we are positive on the stock as there is higher confidence on margin expansion in FY20 at a time when this is uncertain for most of its peers, said the brokerage.

15,2019-04-05,Hindalco,"The sprint maybe over but the marathon is here till the end of the year and 13,500 on the Nifty and midcap outperformance 
  
  
  is very much on the cards, said Sanjiv Bhasin,Executive VP, Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

What are you telling your clients to do now, take chips off the table or ride the momentum?
We have had the fastest sprint I have seen in the last one and a half years and 10,500 is 11,700! But the new highs are seeing only pessimism. I think we have at least another 500 points on the upside, 12,000 to 12,200 and aside from that, the little bit of momentum that we have lost on the midcaps should again see a resurgence. By the end of April, I am sure 12,000 will be tested. We are asking our clients to stay put because the sprint maybe over but the marathon is here till the end of the year where 13,500 on the Nifty and midcap outperformance is very much on the cards.


Highlight some of the fresh names which you would recommend buying?
Some of our recent picks or one-year picks have been outperformers. We were one of the few who were sticking our neck out at Rs 75 on PFC and Rs 100 on REC. They have given a stellar 50% return. GMR at Rs 15 was one our dark horses. That has been a huge outperformer and so is the case with IDFC First. We are staying put with those. 

We think some of the autos are giving you a very good entry point. We are extremely bullish on Ashok Leyland. Eicher Motors, TVS Motor and Maruti was closer to that 6,700. All these are excellent plays. Metals have had a dream run in the last month but that is just the starting point. JSW, Hindalco would be included there and our regular top picks, Reliance, ITC, ACC, Axis Bank and Asian Paints continue to be the top heavyweights which we are overweight on. 


We are tracking Titan this morning. There was a huge bump up on SRF yesterday on account of the plant closure being revoked. What is your take on these stocks?
Three things: Titan has been a huge outperformer. It is telling you that the consumption part, particularly discretionary, is seeing huge amount of uptick and that will now flow into autos as we get into elections. Already you have seen SUV sales touch all-time highs in the shape of Toyota and Mahindra. 

Titan continues to be one of the darlings of the market and even though the stock is expensive, the management guidance is extremely positive. 

On aviation, one is more heavyweight on IndiGo. But at Rs 15, we thought that the best play on the aviation sector on airport side is GMR. Now, it is in the process of demerging the power and real estate from the airport business which is turning out to be huge cash multiplier. I continue to be overweight on GMR. I think you could get a target of 30 maybe in the next one year. The airport business itself will suffice. 


What is your view on SRF?
SRF, Atul and Aarti have been our top picks in the speciality chemicals and we think SRF is giving a brilliant opportunity as an one-off buying opportunity. We still think that China is under pressure because of the environment reasons and SRF margins have been maintained at the highs and even Rs 2,700 could be on the cards in the next three to four months.


What is your take on IT?
They are fully priced. All earnings are priced in and I do not see that much of growth. Globally there has been a hiccup and the best of IT may be played out. They have been over owned by both foreign and the domestic side and given the rupee’s strength, I would expect some sort of selling. If you wanted to play the rupee weakness, we would rather play it through the pharma route. 

A disclosure, HCL Tech and MindTree are two contrarian plays where we have initiated buys -- Rs 925 on HCL Tech which has been a handsome outperformer and Rs 825 on MindTree. We continue to own both those and recommend those to be bought on declines."
18,2019-04-08,Hindalco,"Earnings growth is expected to shrink for steel companies due to falling prices amid US- China trade concerns with signs of a slowdown in China adding to the weakness. Base metal companies too are likely to see a similar trend in March 2019 earnings, according to a leading brokerage house. 

“Earnings growth is expected to decline on the back of lower spreads with aggregate PAT expected to be lower by 34% year on year,” Motilal Oswal said in its latest Metals Sector March 2019 Results Preview. Average EBITDA is expected to decrease by around 14% turning negative after eleven quarters of y-o-y increase, the report added. Metals companies under its coverage include Hindalco, Hindustan Zinc, Jindal Steel & Power, JSW Steel, Nalco, NMDC, SAIL, Tata Steel and Vedanta mong others.

In particular, the brokerage said it expected JSW Steel’s realisations to drop 10% q-o-q due to lower realisations. SAIL’s EBITDA is expected to decline by around 2% q-o-q to Rs 25.2 billion. JSPL’s EBITDA is likely to increase by around !5 q-o-q to Rs 21 billion on higher volumes and improved subsidiary performance while Tata Steel’s EBITDA is also likely to grow by 1% q-o-q to Rs 68.1 billion led by higher steel volumes and offset by lower realisations.

For mining major NMDC, EBITDA is tipped to go down by 17% q-o-q to Rs 19 billion on lower prices. Among base metals, a 2% q-o-q appreciation in USD -Rupee is likely to have a negative impact, the report said. Vedanta’s EBITDA is likely to drop by 2% q-o-q to Rs 55.5 billion, while Hindalco and Nalco’s EBITDA will be impacted by lower prices on the benchmark London Metal Exchange (LME), it added.

Average flat steel prices were down 9% q-o-q to Rs 41,660 per tonne while average long products prices remained unchanged at Rs 37,500 per tonne. Since start of Feb’19, flat prices have recovered by Rs 2000/ tonne, the report said. While domestic steel demand growth was at 5% in Jan-Feb 2019 according to JPC estimates, the reports said sale volumes are expected to recover q-o-q basis, as Q3 witnessed deferment of purchases due to price volatility and on companies looking to reduce their excess inventory. Price of base metals, barring aluminium, were higher on a q-o-q basis while zinc prices increase by 3% to $2694/ tonne and lead was up 4% to 2039/ tonne. While copper was up 1% to 6202/ tonne. Alumina prices declined by 12% to $ 387/ tonne due to increasing supply from China, upcoming facilities at Emirates Global and lifting of sanctions a Rusal. Aluminium prices went down by around %% to $ 1949/ tonne."
17,2019-04-08,Hindalco,"Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in has a buy call on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 227.

The current market price of Hindalco Industries is Rs 216.80.

Time period given by the analyst is two weeks when Hindalco Industries price can reach the defined target. 

Mazhar Mohammad recommended keeping a stop loss at Rs 208.

""This counter made a strong come back after two days of correction, with a bullish engulfing formation. Recent price behaviour with intermittent strong moves is suggesting strength building into this counter. Though near-term hurdle is placed around 219, as momentum is firming up, we expect this counter to clear the said hurdle and head towards Rs 228 levels. Hence, positional traders should buy into this counter with a stop below 208 on the closing basis and look for a target of 227,"" said Mohammad."

29,2019-04-10,Hindalco,"By Chandan Taparia
Nifty50 failed to surpass the 11,680 mark and gradually fell towards the 11,57 0 level in the latter part of Wednesday’s session. It formed an Inside Bar, or a Harami pattern, on the daily scale which indicated a tug of war between the bulls and the bears to make or break the 11,550 level.

The index has been consolidating between 11,550 and 11,750 levels for last nine sessions. Now if it fails to hold above 11,550, a short-term profit booking decline could take it towards the immediate support in the 11,520-11,500 zone, while key hurdles are placed at 11,666 and 11,680 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was placed at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 level. There was Call writing at 12,000 followed by 11,800 levels while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. The option band signified a lower trading range between 11,500 and 11,760 levels.

India VIX moved up sharply by 4.19 per cent to 21.13 level. A sudden spike in VIX indicates limited upside with volatile swing in the market.

Bank Nifty is facing a hurdle near the 30,200 level from past few sessions and slipped towards 29,750 level. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale amid supply pressure at higher levels. Now it has to cross and hold above 30,250 level to witness a upward move towards 30,500, while on the downside, a major support is seen at 29,700 level and below that it could open up fresh downsides towards 29,500 and 29,250 levels.

31,2019-04-11,Hindalco,"Edelweiss Securities has a buy call on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 267.

The current market price of Hindalco Industries is Rs 210.15.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Hindalco Industries price can reach the defined target.


Views of the brokerage on the company-

Cause for concern- Spillage in red mud cake storage: Hindalco has reported one contract workman is missing and four persons have sustained minor injuries, which have been treated. Despite no reported fatalities or material environmental impact arising from the spillage in the red mud (bauxite residue) storage area, we view the incident as a dent on the company’s ESG track record. We understand that the incident bears no semblance to the incident at Norsk Hydro either in scale or severity; however, operations at the Muri alumina refinery are likely to stay suspended until the situation is assessed and investigations conclude.


Financial impact unlikely but regulatory issues might follow: We do not expect operations at the Mahan (360ktpa) and Hirakud (170ktpa) smelters to be affected since they have sufficient alumina inventory to keep running for almost two months. Should the need arise, alumina can be imported (though logistics cost would escalate). Hence, the financial impact (if any) is likely to be minimal. However, additional regulatory compliance may be imposed post-investigation.


Outlook and valuation: We view the spillage as having minimal financial impact, but denting Hindalco’s impressive ESG track record. That said, the incident might overhang the stock performance in the near term. Maintain ‘BUY’ on Hindalco with a target price of Rs 267, implying an exit multiple of 6.3x September- 2020 EBITDA."

46,2019-04-24,Hindalco,"Dalal Street is testing the patience of stock investors. A spike in crude oil prices and a falling rupee have increased their worries amid uncertainty over election outcome and the ongoing earnings season.

Through the past week, Brent crude prices inched higher to come near the highs of Calendar 2019 after the US announced that all Iran sanction waivers would end in May. This put pressure on oil importers to stop buying oil from Tehran.

The rupee also lost muscles and weakened to the lowest level in more than a month on Monday.

The depressed rupee and boiling oil have added another layer of uncertainty for stock investors.

On Tuesday, the rupee recovered from the day's lows point to close higher by 5 paise at 69.62 against the dollar on some dollar selling by banks and exporters.

Oil prices inched lower on Wednesday on signs that global markets remain adequately supplied despite a jump to 2019 highs this week. Brent futures slipped 27 cents to $74.24 a barrel while WTI futures fell 28 cents to $66.02 a barrel.

But analysts say the local currency may remain under pressure, as crude oil prices are likely to remain at elevated levels in the near term.

Some analysts advised investors to tweak their portfolios to include sectors and stocks that may gain from these adversity for rupee and oil.

“In case of a falling rupee, investors should focus on sectors that earn major revenue from exports such as IT and pharmaceuticals. We believe the best bet would be IT, as pharma companies are currently grappling with pricing pressure in overseas markets and US FDA concerns,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Broking.

The BSE IT and Healthcare indices have risen 2.69 per cent and 0.89 per cent, respectively, in the past one month till April 22. On the other hand, BSE Sensex has advanced 1.26 per cent during the same period.

“Given the rise in crude oil prices, investors can also take sector and stock-specific bets,” said Manglik.

ETMarkets.com also collated a list of companies which garner more than 75 per cent of their revenues from exports. Besides IT and pharma companies, the list also includes players such as Tata Motors, Om Metals, Motherson Sumi, Sharda Cropchem, Allcargo Logistics, Hindalco Industries, Tokyo Plast, Kridhan Infra, Tata Coffee, Pearl Global, Zenith Exports, Camlin Fine Sciences and Aro Granite Industries, among others.

Ajay Bodke, CEO, PMS, Prabhudas Lilladher, said, “Companies that earn their revenues in dollars and whose costs are in rupee terms are the natural beneficiaries. All the exporters benefit from a falling rupee. IT and pharma would be major beneficiaries. When the rupee falls, exports become more competitive and imports become expensive. Global cyclicals like metal companies will also benefit, because the landed cost of steel would go up in rupee terms, thus raising the entry barrier. Auto ancillary companies would be the other major beneficiary of a weakening rupee.” 

Bodke, though, expects the rupee to stablilise in the near term, while he does not see crude oil price going back to its previous high of $86 per barrel.

Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing, said White House has issued a statement confirming the curbs. “Opec will help make up for the gap left by Iran going to zero. But Brent will still be going up quickly towards our target of $80-85 a barrel,” he said. 

Bhavik Patel, Senior Technical Analyst of Commodities at Tradebulls Securities, said with Brent hovering above $70 level, it will be just a matter of time before rising current account deficit will create pressure on the rupee. “We may not see any sudden depreciation. Expect the rupee to take the stairs, instead of an elevator, on its way up,” he said.

Considering the likely rise in crude oil prices, some analysts recommended options in key FMCG stocks, which have better pricing power to pass on the hike in input costs to end users without taking a major hit on profitability. 

Kotak Institutional Equities maintained ‘buy’ ratings on GAIL and ONGC. The brokerage said both would be beneficiaries of elevated crude prices and can act as a good hedge against any spike in crude oil prices."

Analyst calls
• IIFL has maintained reduce rating on Kansai Nerolac Paints with a target price of ₹410. Continued strength in decorative and powder coatings segments is likely to offset weakness in auto coatings and support FY20 growth, the brokerage said. 

• Anand Rathi has upgraded DFM Foods to buy and revised target price higher to ₹361. DFM’s growth momentum will persist, bolstered by its three focus areas: innovative marketing, distribution expansion and introducing products, said Anand Rathi.. The brokerage said it is optimistic on the company with the new products gaining traction and boosting overall growth and profitability. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Vedanta and revised target price to ₹135 from ₹170. The 14-34% rally in zinc and oil prices is benefiting Vedanta as these form 80% of its EBITDA, said CLSA. On the flip side, the slow volume ramp-up in zinc and oil as well as increased costs in Hindustan Zinc are concerns, it added. CLSA believes that concerns of related party transactions and the future use of cash will overshadow earnings outlook. 

• CIMB Securities has maintained add rating on Escorts with a target price of ₹938. The brokerage believes Escorts will continue to outperform in terms of tractor volumes and market share gain. After the recent stock price correction of 17% in April, the stock is looking attractive at 9 times FY21 price-to-earnings considering compounded growth of 14% in earnings per share over FY20-FY21. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Jyothy Laboratories and revised fair value to ₹200 from ₹210. Jyothy Lab's fourth quarter earnings print was weak on all fronts with subdued topline growth and sharp margin decline, off a high base, it said. The company's growth guidance appears ambitious in the backdrop of the current business momentum and demand slowdown suggested by larger players, it added.

Board meetings (FULL LIST)
 

Analyst calls
 • Jefferies has maintained buy rating on Nestle India with a target price of ₹12000. Jefferies continues to like Nestle's focus on volume led growth and diversification of the portfolio. Launch of 40 new products in the last 2-3 years and entry into new categories such as dips, breakfast cereals (scalable), premium chocolates, RTD formats, coffee machine etc. will help sustain growth momentum, it said. 

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on Equitas Holdings and revised target price to ₹158 from ₹160. The brokerage believes that Equitas’ offerings, on the assets side as well as its branch positioning and pricing on the deposits side, position it well to grow loans at about 33% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) through FY21. Slightly higher credit costs and lower NIMs drive marginal earnings cut, it said. RoEs should cross 10% in FY20 and 13% by FY21, driven by improving leverage, said HSBC. 

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Just Dial and revised target price to ₹680 from ₹605. Over the last few quarters, Just Dial has shown good recovery in revenue growth, led by volume growth, said Morgan Stanley. The firm expects current momentum to continue, based on operating metrics such as addition to ""feet on street"" headcount, sustained traffic growth, and healthy increase in deferred revenues. 

• Credit Suisse has initiated coverage on PI Industries with an outperform rating and target price of ₹1,300. PI can deliver a 20% plus EPS CAGR over the next few years, said Credit Suisse. Given its unique business model, high probability of non-linear growth in coming years and option value from acquisition or branching out into other chemical segments like pharma, this premium multiple will sustain, it said. 

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Union Bank of India and cut target price to ₹96 from ₹105. Union Bank may see earnings normalize from FY21 onwards, said CLSA. With the recent capital infusion, CET I is now 8% and Tier I CAR is 9.5%, but this has diluted BVPS, it added. The brokerage has cut its target price because of this but retained buy rating given reasonable valuation and better CASA franchise.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
28,2019-05-16,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a positive start on Thursday amid firm global cues. Market breadth was in favour of buyers. However, steadily rising crude oil prices and selling by foreign institutional investors capped gains.

Asian shares steadied in early trade on news that the US was planning to delay tariffs on auto imports, providing much-needed relief to markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Australian and South Korean indices were little changed.

Oil prices rose for the third straight day, as the risk of conflict in West Asia stoked fears of supply disruptions, negating an unexpected rise in US inventories. Amid all this, Brent crude futures touched the $72 mark.

India’s trade deficit widened to a five-month high in April as rising crude prices raised import costs and gold imports swelled. 

FIIs have suddenly turned sellers in equities in seven out of last 10 sessions. They offloaded shares worth Rs 1,142.44 crore on Wednesday, NSE data showed. 



At 9:30 am, Sensex traded 24 points, or 0.06 per cent, higher at 37,139 while NSE’s Nifty was up 6 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 11,163. In the 50-pack, 30 stocks advanced, while 20 declined.

Among Sensex stocks, Tata Motors was the biggest gainer, up around 1.07 per cent. Other gainers were Vedanta, Infosys, Bajaj Finance, Powergrid and Tata Steel.

Kotak Bank was the biggest loser, falling over 1 per cent. L&T, Coal India, M&M, HDFC and ITC joined Kotak on the list of losers.


Off the main board, IndiGo shares kept buzzing after reports of serious differences between the two founder-promoters, threatening to affect the airline’s functioning. Clauses in the shareholders’ agreement and differences between the two founders over strategies and ambitions are said to be the bone of contention. IndiGo shares slipped nearly 3 per cent.

The market would watch Hindalco Industries, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Blue Dart, Chambal Fertilisers, DB Corp, JSW Energy, JK Tyre and Shree Renuka Sugars, companies that are scheduled to release quarterly earnings during the day.

The broader market moved in step with the benchmark. BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices traded in line with the overall market mood, gaining 0.16 per cent and 0.13 per cent respectively.

On the sectoral map, barring Capital Goods, Oil & Gas and Realty, other indices gained. BSE Auto was the biggest gainer, up 0.55 per cent."
29,2019-05-16,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Investors would keep an eye on foreign exchange rate impact at Novelis and aluminium margins when Hindalco Industries reports March quarter earnings later on Thursday.

On a standalone basis, Edelweiss Securities expects the firm to report a 19.7 per cent YoY drop in profit at Rs 315 crore, while standalone revenue of the firm is projected to rise 11.7 per cent YoY to Rs 11,515 crore

“Ebitda wil be impacted by lower LME aluminium prices (down 14 per cent YoY), resulting in a 22 per cent YoY drop in aluminium division Ebitda. Copper division's Ebitda is also expected to decline 10 per cent YoY mainly on lower realisations from byproducts,” it said.

Emkay Global said Hindalco’s sensitivity to price change is substantial and any movement on either side flows through Ebitda. It has built in a 5 per cent sequential de-growth in Ebitda, owing to weak metal prices. This brokerage expects a 48.6 per cent YoY drop in profit at Rs 193.80 crore on largely flat sales growth. 

Motilal Oswal Secrueities sees profit at Rs 404.10 crore, Including Utkal operations, and sales at Rs 11,938 crore. The brokerage pegged consolidated profit (including Novelis operations) at Rs 1,139.80 crore. 

“We expect Novelis to report adjusted Ebitda of $319 million, down 1 per cent QoQ. Adjusted Ebitda per tonne is estimated at $388. Volumes are expected to increase 3 per cent QoQ to 821 kt,” the brokerage said."
30,2019-05-16,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Hindalco Industries on Thursday reported a 17.9 per cent year-on-year drop in profit at Rs 506 crore for March quarter compared with Rs 616 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. This included numbers from Utkal operations. 

This was against Rs 377 crore net estimated by analysts in an ET Now poll.

Revenue from operations rose to Rs 12,455 crore from Rs 11,687 crore YoY. Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected sales at Rs 11,506 crore.

Ebitda for the quarter fell 4 per cent YoY to Rs 1,733 crore on lower realisations and stronger rupee.

Excluding Utkal operations, Hindalco’s profit fell 37 per cent to Rs 236 crore from Rs 377 crore on a yearly basis. Standalone revenue rose 6 per cent to Rs 12,373 crore from Rs 11,687 crore.


Agencies
“In India, our increased focus on downstream is already showing encouraging results with record aluminium value added product volumes this year. In copper too, the share of value added products (copper rods) has risen, helping the business maintain profitability despite lower volumes. Going forward, we expect the impetus provided by India’s growth to boost demand for aluminium. Rising imports of aluminium and copper, however, pose a threat and we look forward to suitable steps to provide a level playing field,” said Satish Pai, Managing Director, Hindalco Industries.

Revenue from copper segment jumped to Rs 6,503 crore in Q4FY19 against Rs 6,176 crore in the same period last year, aided by higher copper prices. Ebitda for the quarter stood at Rs 315 crore (Rs 329 crore in Q4 FY18), lower by 4 per cent on account of lower Tc/Rc (treatment charge/ refining charge) and volumes."
31,2019-05-16,Hindalco,"Hindalco Industries (Plus Utkal) on Thursday reported 17.85 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in profit at Rs 506 crore for the quarter ended March 2019. The firm had posted a profit of Rs 616 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

Analysts in an ET NOW had projected a profit of Rs 377 crore.

Revenue of the company jumped to Rs 12,455 crore against Rs 11,687 crore in the year-ago period. Total Ebitda, however, declined 4 per cent to Rs 1,733 crore from Rs 1,807 crore.

Shares of the company traded 1.86 per cent up at Rs 194.40 after the announcement of quarterly numbers. 


Here are key takeaways from Hindalco's fourth quarter earnings:

Margins: The figure declined to 10.80 per cent in Q4FY19 over 13.90 per cent in Q4FY18.


Aluminium business: Domestic aluminium business (Hindalco plus Utkal) reported revenue of Rs 23,775 crore in FY19 over Rs 21,090 crore a year ago, on the back of stronger realisations and supportive macros. Ebitda at Rs 5,202 crore in FY19 grew 9 per cent compared to Rs 4,790 crore in FY18. 

“This growth was driven by supporting macros, stable plant operations and improved efficiencies, offset by higher input costs in FY19. The company achieved record production of aluminium at 1,295 Kt, with Alumina (including Utkal) at 2,893 Kt in FY19. Production of aluminium value added products (VAPs), excluding wire rods, grew 5 per cent to reach an all-time high of 321 Kt,” the company said.

In Q4 FY19, the aluminium business recorded an 8 per cent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 5,953 crore (Rs 5,513 crore in Q4 FY18). Ebitda for Q4 came at Rs 1,043 crore (Rs 1,265 crore in Q4 FY18), down 18 per cent due to lower LME and currency impact.


Copper: Revenue from the segment jumped to Rs 6,503 crore against Rs 6,176 crore in the same period last year, aided by higher copper prices. Ebitda for the quarter stood at Rs 315 crore (Rs 329 crore in Q4 FY18), lower by 4 per cent on account of lower Tc/Rc (treatment charge/ refining charge) and volumes.

a) Automotive expansion projects for Novelis in US and China are expected to be commissioned in FY21.
b) Expansion projects for additional rolling and recycling capacity in Novelis Brazil, are likely to be commissioned in FY21.

g) Hindalco’s aluminium foil for lithium-ion batteries has qualified ISRO standards. ARCI (International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials) has approved Hindalco’s aluminium foil for electric vehicle batteries.


Management speak: “In India, our increased focus on downstream is already showing encouraging results with record aluminium value added product volumes this year. In copper too, the share of value added products (copper rods) has risen, helping the business maintain profitability despite lower volumes.

32,2019-05-16,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Healthy buying across sectors, led by banks, financials, IT and energy, helped equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty close with gains on Thursday. 

The market remained on a bumpy track for most part of the session, as sentiments remained sombre amid weak global cues. Speculations on the election outcome kept market jittery.

43,2019-05-17,Hindalco,"Over the next three to five years, you will see us steadily increasing our downstream capacities as well as going into higher value-added products, said Satish Pai, MD, Hindalco, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


What affected Hindalco in FY19?
In FY19, the biggest story for us was the big rise in input cost of coal, of the carbon products as well as furnace oil and caustic soda. All these had a big impact in FY19. I am happy to say that in Q4, by February-March, we saw prices easing. For example, Q3 to Q4, our cost of production was flat but from March onwards, we are guiding that in Q1 the cost of production will be 3% lower. We are seeing some of the input costs falling, which would be beneficial going forward.


There was margin compression, but it was not as bad. Would you say that the LME management on Hindalco’s part played a role in capping the margin compression?
What benefits Hindalco in these times when LME goes down is twofold; one, we have a diversified business model because 25% of the aluminium we sell as downstream value-added products benefits us in times of lower LME because you get an additional EBITDA per ton from that. 

We have a chemical business where we sell speciality alumina and hydrates which also benefits us. Third, 38% of our metal was hedged. All these three factors helped in reducing the impact of LME going down.


For Hindalco, a majority of its capex is done. In FY19, there was around 1295 KT of aluminium production. What is the utilisation level right now? What will you do for For FY20?
We are done with the upstream expansion and that was where Aditya, Mahan and Utkal, which involved nearly $5 billion (Rs 30,000 crore) of investment. We are starting on a new growth phase which has got two legs to it; one is downstream and involves aluminium and copper. We are today selling about 300 KT of the 1.295 million aluminium as value added. We want to double that to 600. We are selling today 245 KT of the 400 KT of copper as value added, we want to convert that to nearly 380, so nearly 90% is value added. So that is one leg of the investment.

The second is, now the alumina market is very attractive. We did a brownfield expansion of Utkal which is going to be completed and we may even expand further because we think that is a lucrative market. Our next phase of growth is already on the works and that is downstream and alumina.


Doubling the downstream capacity of aluminium. When will that come on stream?
From FY18 to FY19, we already increased 5%. This is the downstream expansion which is going to be modular. Over the next three to five years, you will see us steadily increasing our downstream capacities as well as going into higher value-added products. We are going to try to do both. Our goal is to get an additional $150 per ton of EBITDA 600 KT on top of the metal EBITDA that you get. 


The Novelis results have been flying high. Would you say Novelis is already doing what you are trying to do in Hindalco, that it has more focus on downstream and that is giving it a leg up?
Novelis was a downstream company that we acquired and what Novelis has done very well is that it moved from just can and lower in specialities. They were the market leaders getting into auto sheet. Novelis has benefited because now it has a portfolio of very high-end FRP of can and auto, which drives the $418 EBITDA per ton. 

As full owners of Novelis, we want to benefit from its technology and expertise in the downstream business model into India. In India, we have started with very low- end products over the last few years. We have been using Novelis’ expertise and getting our people trained. We are building another Novelis in India.


Currently, LME aluminium prices are at around $1,860. It has been quite a drop from $2,400-2,500 that it was trading at earlier. Do you think this is going to continue going forward?
The economies that matter for us from a consumption point of view are the US and China. The US economy has grown at the fastest rate of 3.2%. Last quarter, unemployment was at an all-time low. So, the US economy is very strong and a large part of Novelis’s EBITDA is coming from the US. The Brazil economy is doing very well which is very strong for us. The only worry we have actually is China. 

China produces 50% of the aluminium and consumes 50% of the aluminium. If the Chinese economy slows down, then you are going to have the impact of a lower demand which will then bring prices down. Also, the Chinese will try to import more and that is why for us the big risk we talk about it is the Chinese economy."
33,2019-05-17,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Hindalco Industries will be spending Rs 2,600 crore capex this year focused on accelerating expansion at Utkal Alumina as well as enhancing downstream facilities as part of its 5-year strategy of doubling valueadded production, said company MD Satish Pai.

""We are embarking on the next growth phase,"" Pai told ET in an interaction held to discuss the company’s Q4 earnings of for last fiscal year.

India’s largest downstream player in the primary metals space, Hindalco has a target of taking the downstream (value-added) volumes from the current 302 KT to 600 KT in the next five years and eventually to one million tonne, Pai said, adding that the company has spent Rs 1,000 crore in the last two years towards this capex.

It is also adding 500 KT in Utkal alumina refinery and this will be commissioned by FY21. Expansion of value-added business includes a greenfield extrusion plant in Gujarat as well as doubling the existing rolling capacities in its facilities in Hirakud and Aditya. Out of the capex, the company will also spend Rs 600 crore towards environment and sustainability.

The company reported its Q4 earnings on Thursday for FY19. Net profit reported a 17.86 per cent decline for Hindalco (including Utkal), at Rs 506 crore as price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) kept falling amid a weakened currency as compared with last year with input costs going up. Ebitda was down 4.1 per cent at Rs 1,733 crore. Net sales showed an improvement of 6.6 per cent at Rs 12,455 crore.

Aluminium price has come down from more than $2,000/tonne last year to around $1,850 per tonne. Pai, however, said this is the lowest that the price will go and if the trade war between the United States and China gets resolved, aluminium prices will only head upwards.

“Right now, the aluminium business is experiencing the worstcase scenario and has now tested the bottom,"" Pai added.

The company’s current net debt stands at Rs 15,000 crore with a strong net debt to Ebitda ratio of 2.2x. It reduced interest cost by 15 per cent last year through prepayment and repricing of long-term loans.

Regarding the completion of the acquisition of Aleris by its US subsidiary Novelis, Pai said he was confident that the deal will be closed by the second quarter of this fiscal year even as the European Commission continues to investigate the impact of the acquisition on supply of automotive body sheets in European markets like Belgium, Germany, Italy and the UK."

5,2019-06-04,Hindalco,"ET Intelligence Group: Latest earnings of the top metals companies show that earnings cycle for the sector has peaked out in 2019. In the March quarter, top seven metal companies reported a decline in earnings after consecutive strong seven quarters, primarily due to metal prices coming off. Going forward, earnings could come under further pressure given the weak global demand and overhang of global trade war.

Out of top eight metal companies which include JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Hindalco, Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, SAIL, Tata Steel (after adjusting for Bhushan Steel) and Jindal Stainless witnessed 8 per cent to 28 per cent earnings(EBIDTA) decline. Lower earnings and high debt of most metal companies could put these companies under severe pressure. Some of the companies including SAIL and Jindal Steel already have debt to EBIDTA of near 5 times. Considering this, any bounce back in their stock prices could be a good opportunity to exit.

The earnings of Indian metal companies are primarily linked to steel, aluminium and zinc prices. Despite the sharp bounce back from the lows of 2018, steel prices are still 15 per cent down from the peak of previous year. Analysts expect the steel prices to remain under pressure owing to cheap imports in India after trade restrictions in the US. This is negative for Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL and Jindal Steel & Power. While the recent acquisitions of Bhushan group’s assets have risen the debt of Tata Steel and JSW Steel and hurt their profitability in the coming quarters besides rising leverage. Other steel companies Jindal Steel and SAIL are already heavily leveraged. LME Aluminium prices are at two-year lows (near 30 per cent down from a year ago levels). This is negative for Hindalco and Vedanta. While the debt does not appear high for these companies on the consolidated levels, the groups remain heavily leveraged as cash from one subsidiary to other leads to heavy tax leakages thus impacting debt paying abilities.

With the recent developments, analysts have turned negative and this could result in earnings downgrades.

“Domestic steel demand remains muted in May 2019, due to slower demand growth in auto and demand postponement in infra. Declining import offers amidst slow demand kept domestic prices under pressure. Domestic producers will try to increase prices in June to offset part of hike in iron ore prices, but it would be difficult for the market to absorb the hike,” said Ashish Kejriwal with IDFC securities in a recent note.

Amix Dixit, lead metals analysts with Edelweiss Securities, too, has a similar view and is concerned about the profitability of metal companies. “We expect profitability to come under further pressure as steel/aluminium prices have eroded further and global demand is placid,” he said."
4,2019-06-04,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: Moody's on Monday downgraded SKI Carbon Black's (Mauritius) corporate family rating (CFR) to Ba3 from Ba2 for its “aggressive financial policy, as seen by its just concluded debt-financed acquisition of another Birla group company.”

SKI Carbon Black formerly Birla Carbon, is a private company of Aditya Birla Group chairman, Kumar Mangalam Birla and is seen as a major source of cash for him to bankroll several of his group initiatives, especially telecom.

Ahead of the $3.6 billion Vodafone Idea $3.6 rights issue, Birla reorganised his unlisted group companies to raise funds that were ploughed back to finance his share of the rights issue as a co-promoter of the telecom joint venture. SKI Carbon Black Mauritius (Birla Carbon) bought 100% of Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises, also a private trading company of Birla, for $450 million.

As the co-promoter, Birla and the group companies had to contribute Rs 7,250 crore to the rights issue while Vodafone Group had to pitch in with Rs 11,000 crore. Birla’s ownership of these two companies are held via wholly owned intermediate company called Kiran Investments. The funds from SKI Carbon were up-streamed to Kiran Investments, one of the apex promoter entities of Idea. Aditya Birla Group owns 26.54% of Vodafone Idea, held through Grasim, Hindalco and Birla TMT Holdings, among others.

“The rating downgrade reflects the weakening in Birla Carbon's credit profile, due to its aggressive financial policy, as seen by its just concluded debt-financed acquisition of a trading company,"" says Kaustubh Chaubal, senior credit officer at Moody’s.

""While the acquisition improves Birla Carbon's scale, the synergies between the two companies will prove modest, and the trading business' operations are inherently volatile, with wafer thin profitability… The acquisition may add increased business risks associated with the thinly profitable trading operations,"" adds Chaubal.

SKI Carbon Black has also upstreamed $600 million in the form of loans to its shareholders over the last 12 months, notes Moody’s. ET in its edition dated April 1st was the first to report about this internal reorganisation of the private companies of KM Birla and the acquisition.

With its operations across 23 countries, Swiss Singapore caters to a diverse customer base, dealing in commodities in energy, mining and agricultural products. Moody's however expects Birla Carbon to benefit from the long standing trade relations of Swiss Singapore with carbon black feedstock suppliers.

According to the ratings agency, Birla Carbon's leverage — as measured by debt/EBITDA and adjusted for Moody's standard adjustments for the trading operations' readily marketable inventories — increased to 3.5x from 2.7x at 31 March 2019; contradicting its earlier expectation that the company would continue to deleverage. Such deleveraging was a key underlying factor for the company's previous Ba2 CFR"

7,2019-06-10,Hindalco,"Hindalco Industries’ consolidated net profit fell 10% in 2018-19, but analysts are becoming bullish on it because of its improving operational performance. For instance, the company’s consolidated revenue rose 13% in 2018-19 due to the improved performance of its subsidiaries.

The expected improvement in the aluminium industry is another reason for analysts’ bullishness on Hindalco. Subdued global aluminium prices— 23% fall over the past year— have hurt aluminium manufacturers such as Hindalco. 

However, analysts don’t expect global aluminium and alumina prices to fall any further because the Chinese authorities have suspended alumina production at three big refineries. These make up around 5% of global alumina supply and the production cut should support prices.

Pro-active hedging tactics should also help Hindalco report better performance in 2019-20. For example, around 15% of its expected production is hedged at around $2,200 (Rs 1.53 lakh) per tonne, significantly higher than the current global aluminium prices of around $1,765 (Rs 1.23 lakh) per tonne. More importantly, around 30% of its dollar exposure is hedged close to Rs 75, significantly higher than the current value of Rs 69.40.

Though 65% of Hindalco’s consolidated revenue comes from value-added products, it is usually treated as a proxy for aluminium prices and valued as a core aluminium manufacturer. Even Hindalco’s 35% core aluminium production business deserves better valuation because the company is one of the cheapest aluminium producers in the world.

Value-added products contribute more than core production to the company’s copper operations as well. With improvement in its copper cathode production, its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin should improve further. This means that Hindalco offers a clear risk-reward advantage for long-term investors.

However, potential investors should be ready for short-term pressure in this counter. Though Novelis, Hindalco’s Atlanta-based subsidiary, reported steady performance in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, it may remain under pressure in 2019-20 because of the global slowdown in the auto sector, especially in key markets like China. 

Despite pricing pressures and capex, Novelis has generated free cash flow (FCF) of around $400 million (Rs 1,389 crore) during 2018-19. However, FCF may turn negative in 2019-20 due to higher investments and meaningful FCF addition is expected only from 2020-21.

9,2019-06-11,Hindalco,"Top domestic fund houses took note of the political stability post-election results and lapped up shares in many perceptibly contrarian bets in May, hoping for a recovery in the battered sectors such as telecom, power, pharma and metals.

Select auto ancillary and bank stocks also attracted institutional money during month. 

Total assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry stood at Rs 25.43 lakh crore at the end of May, up from Rs 25.27 lakh crore in April end. 

“As the new government came in with a thumping majority, this along with other positive factors such as low inflation, reasonable balance of payments and good forex reserve will continue to increase inflows,” said NS Venkatesh, Chief Executive Officer at Amfi.

The same optimism is visible also in the way top fund houses bought and sold shares all through the past month.


HDFC Mutual Fund India’s largest money manager held Rs 1.51 lakh crore in equities, with maximum allocations to financials, utilities and industries. 

The fund house added 3 crore shares of government-owned capital goods firm BHEL in a clear bet on public sector capex. Its other top picks included Federal Bank (1 crore shares), Bank of Baroda (94 lakh), DCB Bank (86 lakh) and Power Finance Corporation (70 lakh) – a play on banking revival.

The fund house also added over 10 lakh shares of BPCL, Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Karur Vysya Bank, Hindalco, Lupin and Adani Power. 

Meanwhile, it sold over 1 crore shares each in public sector firms NPTC, SBI and PowerGrid and between 40-90 lakh shares of Orient Cement, HSIL, Petronet LNG, Ambuja Cement, NBCC and ICICI Bank.

The fund house completely exited Havells, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank and Vodafone Idea.


ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund With equity assets in excess of Rs 1.32 lakh crore as of May 31, the fund house wagered on a potential telecom revival, buying 6.12 crore shares of Vodafone Idea and 3.90 crore of Bharti Airtel.

The two telecom operators introduced a ‘minimum recharge’ regimes last month, weeding out low-paying users and increasing average revenue per users (Arpu) in early signs of return of pricing power.

The fund house also bought shares of NTPC (1.52 crore), Motherson Sumi (1.36 crore), Hindalco (87 lakh), HDFC Life (68 lakh), Union Bank (61 lakh), Neyveli Lignite (46 lakh) and Infosys (44 lakh).

CIO S Naren told ETMarkets.com last month said he is positive on power, metals, auto ancillaries and telecom. 

He said there is an opportunity to own healthy power franchises, which are pricing in the worries of the sector more than adequately. In the auto ancillary space, valuations have corrected amid concerns over global growth, trade wars and change in emission norms.

He said telecom as the sector is at the bottom of the cycle, while valuations in the metals space look reasonable owing to uncertainties around US-China trade wars and slowdown in China. From a counter-cyclical viewpoint, the sector seems to be at the start of an upward move after a long period of poor returns, he said.


SBI Funds Management The fund house had about Rs 1.62 lakh crore invested in about 318 stocks. It also gambled on telecom, buying over 1 crore shares each in Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The find house’s other top picks of May included Motherson Sumi (88.77 lakh shares), SBI (78 lakh), Bank of Baroda (78 lakh), ICICI Bank (47.99 lakh) and Tata Power (43 lakh).

“We are a bit more value-centric but a lot of the stuff are bottoms-up.

We think in the next two-three years, earnings will normalise.

32,2019-06-24,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Extending the losses into the second session in a row, headline indices Sensex and Nifty ended in the red on Monday, tracking weak global sentiments. 

Global markets were lacklustre amid escalating tension between the US and Iran and feeble hopes of a trade truce between the US and China. Back home, a spike in crude oil price, a weakening rupee and pre-Budget jitters turned investors risk averse. 

""Concerns over liquidity crunch and weak monsoon are weighing on investor sentiment. Investors are nervous ahead of the Budget and avoiding fresh bets,” said Rajnath Yadav, Research Analyst at Fundamental Research Desk, Choice Broking.

Sensex settled 72 points, or 0.18 per cent, lower at 39,122, while Nifty slipped 24 points, or 0.21 per cent, to end at 11,699. 


Here is a breakdown of the key actions from Monday's session:


OMC stocks under pressureShares of most oil marketing companies (OMCs) suffered losses in the wake of a continuous rise in global crude oil prices amid rising tensions between Iran and the US. BSE Oil & Gas index emerged top sectoral loser with eight out of a total of 10 components closing in the red. IGL (down 4.43 per cent), ONGC (down 3.48 per cent), RIL (down 1.29 per cent) and HPCL (down 1.20 per cent) all slipped for the day. 


Yes Bank climbs 2%Yes Bank ended the day as top gainer in the Sensex pack amid reports that bank's promoter Rana Kapoor’s family is planning to sell a stake in their six-year-old mortgage finance company. The stock settled 2.19 per cent higher at Rs 111.95.


Lupin climbs on CS upgradeShares of Lupin logged gained 2.75 per cent to close at Rs 732 after global brokerage Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to ‘outperform’ from ‘underperform’ rating, raising the target price to Rs 860 from Rs 800. The brokerage said concerns over margin contraction have played out and the firm can be close to debt free by FY23 with margin expansion. 


Suzlon shares surge 9%Shares of Suzlon Energy surged 9.45 per cent to Rs 4.98 after reports that the company has told its lenders that Canadian investor Brookfield is keen to acquire a majority stake in it, which would help the cash-strapped renewable energy company settle its loans if the lenders were to give a waiver. However, in a BSE filing, the company has denied any such development.


Jet shares extend gainsShares of Jet Airways closed 1 per cent higher at Rs 73.20, extending gains into the third consecutive session, as the insolvency resolution professional put the grounded airline’s resolution process on fast track.


Emami shares tank 8%Shares of Emami suffered a loss of 7.59 per cent to settle at Rs 267.30 after promoters sold about 10 per cent shares of the company on Monday morning through block deals to raise about Rs 1,230 crore to pare debt, according to sources. Emami’s shares have been under pressure for the last 8 consecutive sessions. In the last eight days, the stock has come off 21 per cent.

33,2019-06-25,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: The domestic stock market looked directionless on Tuesday, but at least 38 NSE-listed stocks are high on momentum.

They looked strong on the technical charts, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, even as the broader market showed no signs of a rebound.

The momentum indicator signalled a bullish crossover, hinting at possible upsides.

Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend. The list included Suzlon Energy, Hindalco, NTPC, Sun Pharma, NCC, Escorts, Petronet LNG, Marksans Pharma and Igarashi Motors. TBZ, Spencer’s Retail, Oberoi Realty, Hathway Cable and L&T Technology Services have also sent out bullish signals on the technical charts, data showed

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 16 stocks on NSE are signalling a bearish trend going forward. They included Aurobindo Pharma, Tech Mahindra, Mahanagar Gas, UCO Bank, SRF and Finolex Industries.

The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

Analysts believe Nifty needs to breach the 11,625-11,850 range to show any decisive trend. On Tuesday, the NSE barometer hit a low of 11,651. Nifty movement in last two sessions was limited inside a long bullish candle, whose range lies in the 11,843-635 band, registered on June 20.

Unless the low of 11,625 is decisively breached on the downside, weak movement of the last two sessions can still be read as a consolidation move in nature, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

“Nevertheless, a decisive close below 11,625 can set the tone for a fresh breakdown, which may then drag the indices into the euphoric gap zone between 11,591 and 11,426 levels while the market may show strength on the upside only on a close above 11,843 level. As the market appears to be directionless, traders should remain neutral for time being,” Mohammad said.

Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of Hindalco shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.05 per cent lower at Rs 198.10 on NSE."

38,2019-06-26,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Finnish clean energy company Fortum has signed its first commercial project with aluminium and copper major Hindalco with an aim to reduce the latter's nitrogen oxide emission at its aluminium smelter in Mahan.

The project that is expected to get completed by mid February 2020, will enable the Aditya Birla Group company to comply with the strict restrictions on the emission of the hazardous gas that is a large cause of air pollution, and bring it down to 290 mg/Nm3 from its current levels. 

In a press release, Fortum said that it has ""patented technology for bringing about reduction of NOx to the statutory limits by using only primary combustion modification on the boiler with minimal capital expenses and no operating expenses"". 

The government, among other things, has defined new NOx emission levels for thermal power plants in India to be achieved by 2022. However, hundreds of coal-fired boilers in the country still need to be modified, to comply with the new emission regulation, Sanjay Agarwal, managing director at Fortum India said. 

""The implementation of advanced NOx reduction technology at the primary source of emissions i.e. at the boiler combustion will not only reduce emissions, but also enhance plant performance through optimization of the boiler operations. Moreover, with lower operating and maintenance costs compared to any other secondary NOx reduction methods, the overall life-cycle costs are kept at minimum,"" Juha Suomi area director, Asia, Fortum eNext said."
37,2019-06-26,Hindalco,"HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh, which has the second largest bauxite reserves in India, has decided to scrap permission given to a staterun company to mine the raw material for aluminium production in the tribal areas of Eastern Ghats.

AP is estimated to have 600 million tonnes, or nearly 22%, of India’s bauxite reserves, second only to neighbouring Odisha that has more than 2,000 million tonnes. The Eastern Ghats is considered as one of the world’s biggest bauxite reserves.

Companies like Nalco and Hindalco mine bauxite in Odisha, while Andhra doesn’t tap the mineral.

Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday announced the withdrawal of an order, issued by the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government in November 2015, allowing bauxite mining by AP Mineral Development Corporation in 1,212 hectares in Visakhapatnam district.

Naidu’s government had annulled bauxite supply agreements with Jindal South West Aluminium and the Indo-UAE joint venture of Anrak Aluminium, signed when YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the father of Jagan Mohan Reddy, was the chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh.

The bauxite reserves in AP fall under the reserved forest and notified tribal areas, which for over a decade witnessed violent protests by the locals against illegal mining, aiding left extremists to spread their activities.

Naxals, who have been backing the movements by the locals against bauxite mining in the Eastern Ghats, had killed a few leaders of the then ruling TDP, including its MLA from Araku, Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma last September. Following the resistance from the locals and violence by the Maoists, the Naidu government had kept in abeyance its orders permitting APMDC to mine bauxite.

Announcing the decision against bauxite mining at a two-day conference of district collectors and top police officials in Vijayawada on Tuesday, chief minister Reddy said: “There is no point in bauxite mining when the local tribals are opposing it. The state government is not going to lose much by giving up on bauxite mining. Peace is more important and we should see that locals don’t turn Maoists.”"

7,2019-07-05,Hindalco,"Escalation of the European Union antitrust regulators' concerns regarding Novelis' acquisition of Aleris and a potential deal-breaker could be a strategic loss for parent company Hindalco that wants to manufacture more value added aluminium products, however, from an overall cash flow perspective, the company's stock may not be highly impacted. 

To be sure, Novelis has said that even though it has received the European Commission's Statement of Objections, it is a standard step in the EC's second phase of the review process and does not ""pre-judge"" the final outcome of the process. 

Novelis had acquired Aleris last year in a move that gave Hindalco's US subsidiary an opportunity to increase its share of premium value added offerings in the auto sector as well as marked its entry into the sophisticated aerospace industry. 

""A potential deal-breaker will prove to be a strategic loss for Hindalco that wants to be at the forefront of any technological development of aluminium for use in the emerging electric vehicle space, however, taking a consolidated view, it will be credit positive for the company that will no longer have to service Aleris' $1.8 billion worth debt,"" said an analyst tracking the company. 

He also said that over the next three years, Aleris does not bring in a very high incremental Ebitda to the consolidated Ebitda earnings of Hindalco and Novelis. For the year 2018, Hindalco and Novelis together posted an Ebitda of Rs 15,025 crore or more than $2 billion. Aleris on the other hand posted an Ebitda of only $276 million. Even an expected Ebitda of $360 million by Aleris as expected by the management after its investments start earning cash will not prove to be a big loss to Hindalco's consolidated earnings if the deal falls through. 

""We have received the European Commission’s Statement of Objections, which is a standard step in the European Commission’s Phase II antitrust review process and does not pre-judge the final outcome of the process,"" Novelis said in a statement. ""We remain committed to working constructively with the Commission to conclude its investigation and to closing the transaction in a timely manner,"" it said."

Union Budget 2019 disappointed the Street as the government did not give any respite on the long-term capital gains tax on equities and equity-oriented mutual funds, while a big surcharge tax on the high-income group and a step toward raising public shareholding limit to 35 per cent from 25 per cent seem to have made investors jitterey.

""The big surcharge tax on the high-income group and possible liquidity squeezing of the secondary market due to disinvestment and increased public shareholding dragged the market down,"" said Amar Ambani, President, YES Securities.

12,2019-07-09,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: The sharp fall on Dalal Street in last two sessions has made the bears get an upper hand. Tuesday’s session also began weak, making analysts to surmise that Nifty50 may have made its short-term top around the 12,100 level. 

That said, there are at least 17 stocks on NSE, which look strong on the technical charts, as suggested by the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides from here on. These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included YES Bank, which gained 5.67 per cent on Monday and a further 2.5 per cent on Tuesday even in a weak market setup.

Dhanlaxmi Bank, PNB Gilts, BF Utilities, Sonata Software, Aegis Logistics, Cholamandalam Finance and Music Broadcast are some of the other stocks that look strong on the MACD charts. Others include Alkem Laboratories, Hatsun Agro, BF Investment and Future Supply Chain. 





The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed there are 181 stocks, which are showing a bearish trend. They included Bajaj Finance Axis Bank, Hindalco Industries, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, SAIL, NTPC, Power Grid, Cipla, Ambuja Cements, OBC, LIC Housing, Siemens and Indiabulls Realty. 











“The recent correction was so severe in some of the marquee names that it was extremely intimidating,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

“The stock-specific mayhem has started again and this time, rank outperformers are also not spared. Hence, traders are likely to adopt a cautious approach and should ideally avoid trading aggressively for a while,” Chavan said.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, the important opening upside gap of May 20 is all set to be filled soon at 11,426. This gap is expected to offer support to the index and one may expect a minor upside bounce near 11,400-11,425 levels in the next few sessions.

“Nifty50 has seen a double top breakdown below 11,625 on the daily chart. It could trigger more panic. A strong support for the index is seen in the 11,500-11,426 range and the immediate strong hurdle is in the 11,620-11,690 zone,"" said Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Dhanlaxmi Bank shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line on this country, the stock has shown upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded at Rs 16.15 on NSE, up 0.96 per cent.

19,2019-07-15,Hindalco,"Investing in profitable companies is a common strategy. How about investing in companies that have consistently increased their share of profits relative to their industry? These companies enjoy industry leadership and have strong pricing power. Moreover, they benefit from rising revenues and cost optimisation and are in a position to create barriers for new entrants. These are generally large, established companies that have adequate cash reserves which help them tide over different phases of the economic or business cycles.

We looked at the annual consolidated operating profit or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), including other income, for companies with market-cap greater than Rs 500 crore. We used operating profit instead of net profit because the former removes the effect of non-cash charges and varying capital structures and, therefore, provides a more accurate picture of the company’s competitive strengths.

We calculated the aggregate consolidated operating profits of the various industries for the past five years, starting from 2014-15, and then calculated the operating profit share of the respective companies. Companies with the highest share of operating profit in 2018-19, compared to the preceding four financial years were filtered out. Then, we selected companies with consistently increasing profit share over the past five years. Only 20 companies passed these filters. The average point-to-point returns of these companies over the past two, three and five years has been 42.97%, 118.55%, and 327.1% respectively. Comparatively, BSE500 Index has delivered 16.1%, 39.1%, and 55.4% respectively during the same time periods.

These 20 companies have witnessed strong institutional interest from both domestic mutual funds as well as foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Between the fourth quarter of 2015-16 and the fourth quarter of 2018-19, domestic mutual funds and FPIs increased their average stake in these companies from 5.26% to 7.63%, and from 11.26% to 14.27%, respectively.


Rising profit share, promising upside potential

Additionally, $60-70/barrel (Rs 4,104-4,788/barrel) oil price in a weak rupee environment is broadly positive for ONGC’s stock price, as it allows investors to price-in a steady earnings outlook without the risk of the subsidy burden.


3. Hindalco Industries
This producer of aluminum and copper has a presence in 11 overseas countries. According to a report by investment bank JM Financial, significant cost cuts in its Indian operations, benefits of scale, offsetting the increase in power/carbon costs by increasing coal security is likely to create an upward earnings trajectory.

28,2019-07-22,Hindalco,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 32.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

CLSA has retained its buy rating on ACC and raised target price to Rs 2050 from Rs 2000. ACC’s unit Ebitda expanded to an eight-year high at Rs 1,086/tonne during the second quarter of calendar year 2019, which was much better than forecasts, said CLSA. Costs were a tad higher but completely overshadowed by the realisation surprise, the most critical parameter in cement P&L, said CLSA. Cement pricing, a key stock driver, needs to be monitored, the brokerage said. Shares of ACC ended down 1.5 per cent at Rs 1543.55 on Friday.


IIFL has a buy rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 258. While the supply/demand balance and exchange inventories remain favourable for an LME price uptick, appreciation in the Indian rupee remains an issue for Hindalco, said IIFL. There has been limited improvement in costs so far, as the linkage coal supply increase has been sluggish, said IIFL. The Aleris acquisition remains a key trigger, the brokerage said. Shares of Hindalco Industries ended down 2.2 per cent at Rs 196.15 on Friday.

Ambit Capital has maintained sell rating on DB Corp with a target price of Rs 167. The brokerage expects advertising to remain soft given the multiple macro headwinds. Moderation in newsprint prices will partly salvage the situation but the brokerage said it remains cautious given another headwind in terms of possible import duty on newsprint. Imminent slowdown in economy could have an impact on the revenue growth in the print segment at least, said Ambit. Shares of DB Corp ended down 5.7 per cent at Rs 165.85 on Friday.

PhillipCapital has maintained buy rating on Dabur India and revised target price to Rs 485 from Rs 430. The brokerage said Dabur’s diversified portfolio makes it fool-proof from any economic, regulatory and seasonality risks that other peers might have to tackle. Management under the guidance of Mohit Malhotra is taking steps in the right direction to drive growth in long term, it said. Reduction in competitive intensity from Patanjali further should support the cause, said PhillipCapital. Shares of Dabur India ended down 1.9 per cent at Rs 421 on Friday. 

Investec Securities has downgraded Larsen & Toubro Infotech to hold from buy and lowered target price to Rs 1645 from Rs 1850. Larsen & Toubro Infotech reported a weak performance in first quarter FY20 growing by 0.8 per cent sequentially in US dollar terms and 0.4 per cent organically, said Investec. With expectations of continued weakness in second quarter of FY20 on revenue growth and potentially flattish margins due to compensation increases, the brokerage has cut estimates by 7.5 per cent/9.4 per cent in FY20/FY21."

31,2019-07-24,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty fell for a fifth consecutive session on Wednesday as investors continued their selling spree in Indian equities in the absence of any decisive trigger while concerns over weakening economy and higher tax surcharge seem to have refused to fade away.

""Investors turned sellers on concerns that the economy is moving through a slowdown phase. IMF lowered GDP growth forecast by 30 bps for 2019 based on weak domestic demand outlook, which fuelled a selloff in a market where sentiment is already hurt due to tax concerns,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Mixed quarterly results, outflow of foreign funds and weakening rupee will keep weighing on investor sentiment, he added.

Sensex fell 135 points, or 0.36 per cent, to finish at 37,847.65, with only six stocks up and 24 in the red.

Nifty ended the day at 11,271.30, down 60 points or 0.53 per cent. Among the 50 stocks in the index, 12 settled with gains while 38 suffered losses.

19,2019-08-08,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Aluminum major Hindalco is likely to report see subdued standalone performance on the back of lower aluminum prices, and lower volumes and planned shutdowns in its copper production.

The key issues to watch for in the earnings would be production costs for aluminum segment, and impact of copper plant shutdown.

Aluminum LME may be down by around $69 per tonnes to $1,792 QoQ, driving the decline in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization).

Brokerage Motilal Oswal expects Hindalco’s June quarter profit to decline sharply by 76 per cent to 175.8 crore from 734 crore in the same quarter a year ago. 

It expects Hindalco’s standalone Ebitda to decline 20 per cent to Rs 1,090 crore on lower LME aluminum, lower hedge volumes and planned copper shutdowns. 

Aluminum EBITDA is expected to decline 22 per cent to Rs 810 crore and copper is likely to decrease 11 per cent to Rs 280 crore, Motilal Oswal analysts said.

They added that aluminum volumes will decrease 1 per cent qoq to 320 kilo tonnes and copper will decrease 15 per cent to 85 kilo tonnes.

Edelweiss expects Hindalco’s (standalone) Ebitda to make a low since Q3FY16 owing to reversal in LME Al prices.
Edelweiss expects Hindalco to post a 93.3 per cent decline in profit from a year ago and 88.2 per cent decline from the preceding quarter. 

Edelweiss said that Hindalco’s Ebitda is likely to be impacted by lower LME Al prices and will be down 21 per cent yoy which would drag the Al divison's Ebitda 53 per cent. The copper division's Ebitda is also expected to tank 30 per cent yoy due to maintenance costs and lower realisation on by-products.

Phillipcapital believes Hindalco will see marginally lower volumes and realisations, and its performance will be marginally poor. It expects the company’s net profit to see a 68. 2 per cent decline on a YoY basis and a 44.3 per cent decline on a QoQ basis.

It expects the company’s Ebitda to decline 33.3 per cent on a YoY basis, and 2 per cent lower on a QoQ basis."

26,2019-08-09,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Hindalco Industries reported a 28 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in consolidated profit at Rs 1,063 crore for the June quarter. In comparison, it had posted a profit of Rs 1,475 crore in the same quarter last year.

Revenue dropped 4 per cent to Rs 29,972 crore from Rs 31,078 crore posted in the corresponding quarter last year.


Here are key takeaways:


Novelis
Novelis delivered strong operational and financial quarterly performance. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11 per cent to touch a record high of $372 million in Q1 FY20, driven by higher shipments coupled with favourable price and product mix, partially offset by less favourable recycling benefits due to lower aluminium prices.


Hindalco including Utkal Alumina
Stable operations of the Indian Aluminium Business helped achieve Alumina (including Utkal) and Aluminium metal production of 686 Kt and 326 Kt in respectively, in Q1 FY20. Reported revenue of Rs. 5,472 crore in the June quarter was lower by 3 per cent due to lower realisations.


CopperThe Copper Business recorded its highest quarterly Value Added Product (VAP) production at 66 Kt in Q1 FY20, up 2 per cent YoY. The overall production volumes (copper cathodes) were at 76 Kt in Q1 FY20, lower compared to the prior year, due to planned maintenance shutdown. The total copper metal sales remained steady at 82 Kt in Q1 FY20 vis-à-vis Q1 FY19.


Aleris acquisitionAll Regulatory approvals for the Aleris acquisition continue to progress and are expected to close in Q3 FY20.


Brownfield capacity expansionUtkal Alumina’s brownfield capacity expansion of 500 Kt is on track and is expected to be operational by mid FY21."
28,2019-08-13,Hindalco,"The next quarter will be better than this quarter because the big impact of Muri will not be there. I think we will see better results in Q2, says Satish Pai, MD, Hindalco. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Aluminium prices have been coming down as has copper prices. Is that why you have shut down your Muri copper plant?There has been a 21% drop in aluminium prices year on year. In case of copper, it was just a planned maintenance shutdown. So, it had nothing to do with the price of copper per se. For us, the downside has been the aluminium LME. 


The world over some of the global aluminium majors as well like Alcoa etc, are either cutting growth forecast or are saying that the deficit would not be as large as we estimated it to be earlier which is obviously not good news again for aluminium. Do you think that LME aluminium prices could perhaps go lower from here or are we at a bottom?The deficit is around roughly a million tonnes, largely coming from outside China. Now the reason why that deficit could get less is because if demand would get less. But why is demand going down? Demand is going down because the trade wars are having an impact on the economic growth. Chinese demand is down, European demand is down. The answer lies on whether the trade wars or the tariff war that is going on will get resolved. 

The scenario for me is if they get resolved, then economic growth and demand will pick up because in case of aluminium, if you look at Novelis, we shipped 8% more. So, can demand be because of replacement? On auto, we shipped 4% more. There is quite healthy demand in electric vehicles and high-end SUVs. 

At the specific end sectors we are not seeing a big demand going down where we play. We would like to see whether the economic sentiment improves and the overall price of aluminium is going up. That can only happen if the trade issues get resolved and the economic growth in China and the rest of the world pick up again.


 Sentiment is not improving. With US terming China currency manipulator, some people are saying that we do not see an end to the trade war until the next presidential elections, which means there is no trigger as such for the sentiment of aluminium prices. What is your expectation and if aluminium stays where it is it would that mean more trouble for Hindalco?No, if aluminium prices stay at the current $1,700-1,800 levels, then we are running at a 16% EBITDA level. We have the healthiest balance sheet among all the metal companies. We have a net debt to EBITDA of 2.69. We can weather this storm very well and we have Novelis which is doing extremely well and is not dependent on LME. 

If things continue to be bad, then compared to our competition, we will outperform. It is anyone’s guess whether it will get resolved now or before the next election and we can all have our say. But is the company fundamentally prepared for dealing with the tough times? I think that is where Hindalco is differentiated because we have Novelis and the India business of aluminium and our cost of production is in the lowest quartile, our net debt to EBITDA is one of the lowest. So our balance sheet has the strength to go through these tough times.


Let us talk about the India business. Imports are grabbing a decent share of the domestic demand...Much more than decent.


Firstly on the demand front, what are you anticipating and also how much of a trouble is imports for you then?The good news has been that the Indian aluminium and copper demand has been quite strong this quarter. Aluminium demand grew by 7% and copper grew by 9% and so there is no problem on the demand side. The percentage of imports still continue to be 59% and that is really the cause of concern. For us, there are two sides to that import story; one is value-added products coming in from ASEAN and China and on the other hand, you have a lot of scrap coming in from the US.


It is very surprising that we are still importing so much scrap?The scrap availability has gone up so much that scrap prices have dropped a lot. For many people, that is a very big positive arbitrage to bring in scrap and use at as substitution for metal. I think imports continue to be a concern and which is why the current ongoing negotiations of RCEP are very critical for the metals industry.


For your own production in aluminium, there was that Muri refinery shutdown. But Utkal Steel did better over there. If you could comment on the volume front?What happened is that we lost. Muri does about 330 KT and we lost about 70 KT odd this quarter from Muri. But Utkal did about 30 KT more and then we imported the rest and that is how we managed. Now the good news is that we have finished cleaning up the red mud spill, we have done most of the preparatory work and we have applied for a restart which we hope will happen by September. So the worst is over for the Muri shutdown.


If I give your P&L a quick glance, there has been a sharp rise in the power and fuel costs. It is quite substantial. That is the only line item which is seeing a big jump on an year-on-year basis? Are you seeing that as a concern? Also, when you say power and fuel are you talking about coal and iron ore?It is mostly coal. Compared to Q1 of last year, this year coal prices are higher but the positive thing is that on quarter-on-quarter it has come down. Our cost of production quarter-on-quarter has been down 3% and in the second half of this year, I will get another 3-5% down because generally input costs are coming down now.


What happens when it comes to margins? It is a commodity company and so it is difficult to do a bit of crystal ball gazing but if LME aluminium prices are where they are and if the cost of production has come down 3% from the previous quarter, can we expect some improvement in margins in the next quarter?The next quarter will be better than this quarter because the big impact of Muri will not be there. I think we will see better results in Q2."

30,2019-08-14,Hindalco,"Asset under management of the mutual fund industry inched higher to Rs 24.53 lakh crore in July despite a harsh selloff in the domestic equity market, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed. Total AUM stood at Rs 24.25 lakh crore in June. 

Investors’ mutual fund portfolios suffered a dent after the Union Budget 2019 slapped a surcharge in the high income-tax bracket that hit foreign portfolio investors (FPI). In response, FPIs, who had poured in around Rs 80,000 crore during February-June, offloaded stocks worth more than Rs 12,000 crore in July itself.

Even the bluest of blue chips like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank cracked up to 8 per cent during the month. The BSE Sensex dipped around 5 per cent, while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 8 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Money managers of top fund houses used this crisis as an opportunity to lap up low hanging fruits.


Here’s a look at what top five asset managers bought and sold during the month:

HDFC Mutual Fund
The country’s largest money manager held Rs 1.43 lakh crore in equities, with maximum exposure to financials, power and industrial stocks.

SBI Mutual Fund The fund house had about Rs 1.57 lakh crore invested in about 306 stocks. It bought more than 1 crore shares each in Power Grid, ICICI Bank, DLF, ITC, NTPC and Torrent Power.

On the other hand, it sold 2.31 crore share of Vodafone Idea, 98 lakh of Tata Power, 64 lakh of UPL, 45 lakh of Hindalco and 42 lakh shares of InterGlobe Aviation.


Reliance Nippon Life AMCAffle (India), Arti Surfactants, Credit Access Grameen, Dhampur Sugar and Greenpanel Industries were among the new entrants in the portfolio of this fund house last month. However, it exited stocks like Bharat Financial Inclusion, HT Media, JK Lakshmi Cement, Max India, Precision Camshafts and Tata Elxsi.

31,2019-08-16,Hindalco,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 42.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Emkay Global has upgraded Century Plyboards to buy from hold but cut target price to Rs 167 from Rs 193. Century Plyboards’ June quarter result was ahead of estimates, said Emkay. The brokerage expects profits to grow at a CAGR of 14 per cent over FY19-21. Concerns of lower margins in its Plywood segment are factored in as the stock has corrected by 23 per cent after fourth quarter result, said Emkay. The stock ended down 1.7 per cent at Rs 132 on Wednesday.


Nomura has retained buy rating on AIA Engineering and increased target price to Rs 1,970 from Rs 1,965. While guidance has been cut owing to an incident at a major Brazilian miner, the brokerage continues to be positive on the stock as AIA is favourably placed for long-term volume growth relative to peers, despite near-term Brazil headwinds, said Nomura. Successful trial of mill liner product in Africa adds to volume visibility, said Nomura. The stock ended up 3.1 per cent at Rs 1,700.60 on Wednesday.

Phillip Capital has maintained sell rating on ITD Cementation India and cut target price to Rs 60 from Rs 90. The brokerage said it has always viewed ITD as an inconsistent performer, with very few instances of two successive quarters in its history, where it hadn’t disappointed either on revenue or margins front. The descoping of Bangalore metro and low share of marine orders means ITD Cementation will not report more than 10 per cent margins — a significant departure from its earlier guidance, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.85 per cent at Rs 71.6 on Wednesday.

CLSA has maintained sell rating on Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and cut target price to Rs 350 from Rs 500. The consensus is underestimating the margin pressure from the muted revenue growth and high R&D spend, said CLSA. The brokerage expects weak revenue growth along with a high R&D spend phase to keep margin subdued. CLSA has cut FY20-FY21 EPS estimate by 15-18 per cent. The stock ended down 7.9 per cent at Rs 383.90 on Wednesday.

HSBC has maintained buy rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 270. The rising contribution from Novelis, potential merger with Aleris and expectation of recovery in aluminium prices makes Hindalco a compelling investment case, said HSBC. The company is currently trading at a multi-year low forward EV/EBITDA of 5 times providing further downside protection, said HSBC. The stock ended up 2.5 per cent at Rs 80.70 on Wednesday."

48,2019-08-31,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: Hindalco’s wholly-owned US subsidiary Novelis has offered remedial measures to allay concerns of the European Union’s antitrust watchdogs over its $2.6 billion acquisition of Aleris, another US-based aluminium products major that it acquired last year, Satish Pai, managing director at Hindalco said.

Pai’s statement comes a day after news agency Reuters reported that Novelis has agreed to sell Aleris’ plant in Duffel, Belgium and that this move may help it secure the EU’s approval for closing the sale that has already been delayed beyond the guided timeline.

Answering a shareholder’s query that referred to the same report, Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Aditya Birla Group, however, said that it has received no official communication regarding the clearance.

“We’ll get clearance from the European Union hopefully in the near future and then the terms of the clearance and what we have offered (remedial measures) will become clear,” Pai told reporters on the sidelines of Hindalco's AGM on Friday.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch has a deadline up till October 7 to decide on its investigation into the deal. Pai also said that owing to volatility in global aluminium prices benchmarked by the London Metal Exchange that took a major hit, falling by as much as 21% in the first quarter of the current fiscal, Hindalco has cut back its capex from Rs 2,600 crore guided earlier to Rs 2,000 crore."

3,2019-09-05,Hindalco,"WASHINGTON: The US Department of Justice on Wednesday said it has filed a lawsuit against Novelis, a major aluminium company fully owned by India's Aditya Birla Group, seeking to stop it from acquiring rival player Aleris over concern that the acquisition would create a monopoly in aluminium industry.

A defiant Novelis asserted that it will challenge the lawsuit and is going ahead with its proposed acquisition of Aleris Corporation.

Atlanta-headquarters Novelis is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hindalco Industries Ltd of the Aditya Birla Group. Aleris is based in Cleveland, Ohio.

The Department of Justice said in a statement that it has filed a civil antitrust lawsuit seeking to block the proposed transaction in order to preserve competition in the North American market for rolled aluminum sheet for automotive applications, commonly referred to as aluminum auto body sheet.

However, Novelis president and CEO Steve Fisher said, ""Our merger with Aleris threatens no one, and to the contrary will strengthen our ability to compete against steel, meet growing customer demand for aluminum, achieve our recycling goals, and bolster our sustainability platform worldwide,""

The DOJ lawsuit is based on the contention that the only relevant competition among automotive body sheet providers is that among aluminum manufacturers such as Novelis and Aleris, the Aditya Birla group company said.

It ignores competition from steel automotive body sheet, even though steel automotive body sheet is currently used in nearly 90 percent of the market, it asserted.

""The day-to-day reality of the automotive body sheet market is aluminum automotive body sheet striving to take share from steel, and the steel automotive body sheet companies fighting back,"" Fisher said.

""We are disappointed that the DOJ has missed this, but also confident that in the next phase of this process the full scope of the competition we face will be recognized appropriately,"" Fisher said.

In its lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohion, the Antitrust Division of Department of Justice alleges the transaction would combine two of only four North American producers of aluminum auto body sheet.

Automakers rely on Novelis and Aleris to produce aluminum parts for automobiles to make cars lighter, more fuel-efficient, safer and more durable, the lawsuit said. The Antitrust Division has agreed Novelis to refer the matter to binding arbitration should certain conditions be triggered.

""Automakers increasingly need aluminum auto body sheet to satisfy American consumers' demand for larger vehicles that are lighter and more fuel-efficient. The loss of a competing supplier of aluminum auto body sheet ultimately would harm American car buyers,"" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.

""This arbitration would allow the Antitrust Division to resolve the dispositive issue of market definition in this case efficiently and effectively, saving taxpayer resources. Alternative dispute resolution is an important tool that the Antitrust Division can and will use, in appropriate circumstances, to maximize its enforcement resources to protect American consumers,"" he said.

In its lawsuit, DOJ says that Aleris is an aggressive competitor whose expansion into the North American market had an immediate impact on pricing in North America.

If this deal were allowed to proceed, Novelis would lock up 60 percent of projected total domestic capacity and the vast majority of uncommitted capacity, enabling the company to raise prices, reduce innovation and provide less favorable terms of service to the detriment of automakers and ultimately American consumers, it said.

Novelis's acquisition of Aleris would eliminate a rival it described as ""poised for transformational growth"", it said.

In a statement, Novelis said that to prevail in its lawsuit, the DOJ will need to prove that there is a distinct ""relevant market"" for aluminum automotive body sheet, which means that steel automotive body sheet does not significantly constrain the price and quality of aluminum automotive body sheet.

The DOJ does not deny that steel automotive body sheet usually competes with aluminum automotive body sheet, but instead contends that the constraint from steel is absent from some procurements (where an automotive manufacturer has supposedly already decided between steel and aluminum), it said.

Novelis believes that by focusing on just a small slice of steel-aluminum competition and ignoring the broader competitive process, the DOJ's theory contravenes well-established principles of market definition.

The DOJ also disregards the extraordinary bargaining power of the automotive manufacturers and their ability to generate bid processes that will ensure competitive pricing for automotive body sheet, Novelis alleged.

According to Novelis, due to the agreement reached with the DOJ on a timetable and process for resolving this dispute, it is confident that the DOJ suit is not an impediment to closing the transaction by the January 21, 2020, outside date under the merger agreement, even if a remedy is required to address the DOJ's competitive concerns.

The company is confident that the transaction will ultimately receive all necessary regulatory approvals in the US and in other relevant jurisdictions, said the Novelis statement."
4,2019-09-05,Hindalco,"BHUBANESWAR: A high-level committee of secretaries has recommended amending a section of mining laws that led to a fine of about Rs 19,000 crore levied on Odisha’s iron ore miners to spare a similar burden on state-owned companies and other miners elsewhere.

The committee — chaired by Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar and consisting of the cabinet secretary and secretaries of mines, steel, coal, revenue and finance — has concluded that if the reasoning applied to penalise mines in Odisha was applied to others, it would lead to “huge financial burdens on mining companies, including PSUs and would adversely impact their economic viability”.

If executed, the proposal could save Coal India alone a contingent liability of nearly Rs 53,331 core, the panel said in its report. ET has seen a copy of the report.

In August 2017, the Supreme Court had ruled that a mining operation conducted in violation of environment and pollution laws would also count as illegal and unlawful mining.

Under Section 21 (5) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act 1957, states are empowered to recover the entire value of illegally mined mineral or metal irrespective of the royalty, tax and duty paid. Since that ruling, the Naveen Patnaik-led Odisha government has collected more than Rs 15,000 crore in penalties for environment violations from various miners and initiated coercive action against those that haven’t paid.

The committee’s recommendation is also in contradiction to the stand taken by the Narendra Modi government during the course of hearings. In an affidavit dated January 20, 2017, it had made a submission before the Supreme Court that “all forms of mining without lawful authority, including that in breach of the limits imposed by the EC, carried out within the lease area would also invite penalties” under the MMDR Act.

The dilemma now is holding public sector undertakings and mines in other states to the same standards.

The committee, in its report, makes the same argument Odisha’s iron ore mines had made to the top court: that violations in the nature of mining in excess of environmental caps or without forest clearances not be punished by provisions dealing with illegal mining under the MMDR Act.
 It pointed out that the judgement had led to raising of huge demand on leaseholders in Odisha and Jharkhand. Other state may also impose similar penalties. “The fact does remain that compliance above judicial pronouncement is likely to create huge financial burden on mining companies including PSUs and will adversely impact their economic viability,” the report said. 

 Industry insiders said that in case the Act is amended then miners already penalised should also get the benefit.

“Why should Odisha’s iron ore miners alone have to be fined for exceeding the environment clearances?” said B Prabhakaran, owner of Thriveni Earthmovers that is the mining contractor to some of the largest iron mines in the country. “If such an amendment is under consideration, then Odisha's iron ore sector should be judged by the same yardstick, at par with other minerals, other states and irrespective of the organisation,” he told ET. “Captive mines had other resources, large firms could raise funds, it is the small private miner who suffered from this interpretation of the law, and is struggling to comply,” he added. 

Odisha’s mines director Deepak Mohanty, however, said any amendment will have to be perspective and won’t affect their demands. “I can’t comment on how other states chose to act; we have scrupulously followed the SC’s orders, adopting legal procedures even against government agencies,” he told ET.

Odisha and Jharkhand have slapped demand notices on Coal India subsidiaries since the landmark ruling in 2017. While Odisha demanded Rs 20,169 crore from Mahanadi Coalfield, since reduced to Rs 10,289 crore, Jharkhand asked for Rs 33,714 crore from Central Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal.

Jharkhand has also sent claims totalling Rs 3,273 crore to iron ore miners, including around Rs 1400 crore from state-owned Steel Authority of India. Its mines, unlike those in Odisha, have continued to operate with part, or no payment, under orders from the High Court of Jharkhand.

Hearing a petition from Hindalco against a demand of Rs 103 crore on excess mining of bauxite, for example, the HC weighed in on the fact that “the lessee was among the country’s largest aluminium producers and wasn’t being accused of illegal mining”.

Similarly, Coal India’s subsidiaries have received relief from the central mines ministry’s revisional authority (RA). Odisha’s demands from bauxite mines, to, have been stayed by RA.

 “We have written to the RA to vacate the stay and for speedy disposal of the matter,” said Aboobacker Siddique P, mines secretary of Jharkhand. “Some iron ore miners have paid 30%, some 15% and are operating under HC orders, asking us to issue transport challans.”

Against total demand of Rs 39,399 crore, Jharkhand only received Rs 615 crore until now. Meanwhile, the Telangana and Goa governments have argued the 2 August 2017 order is only applicable to mines in Odisha.


Amendment Sought in MMDR Act
Section 21(5) of the MMDR Act says: Whenever a person raises without any lawful authority any mineral from any land, the state government may recover from such person the mineral so raised or where any such minerals have already been disposed of the price thereof and may also recover from such a person rent, royalty, or tax, as the case may be, for the period during which the land was occupied by such a person without any lawful authority.

The high-level committee has suggested replacing “without any lawful authority” with “in contravention of the provisions of this Act and rules made thereunder”. This would help revise penalties for violation of rules related to environment, pollution and other issues."

5,2019-09-06,Hindalco,"BHUBANESWAR: A high-level committee of secretaries has recommended amending a section of mining laws that led to a fine of about Rs 19,000 crore levied on Odisha's iron ore miners to spare a similar burden on state-owned companies and other miners elsewhere. 

 The committee - chaired by Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar and consisting of the cabinet secretary and secretaries of mines, steel, coal, revenue and finance - has concluded that if the reasoning applied to penalise mines in Odisha was applied to others, it would lead to ""huge financial burdens on mining companies, including PSUs and would adversely impact their economic viability"". 

If executed, the proposal could save Coal India alone a contingent liability of nearly Rs 53,331 core, the panel said in its report. ET has seen a copy of the report. 

 In August 2017, the Supreme Court had ruled that a mining operation conducted in violation of environment and pollution laws would also count as illegal and unlawful mining. 

 Under Section 21 (5) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act 1957, states are empowered to recover the entire value of illegally mined mineral or metal irrespective of the royalty, tax and duty paid. Since that ruling, the Naveen Patnaik-led Odisha government has collected more than Rs 15,000 crore in penalties for environment violations from various miners and initiated coercive action against those that haven't paid. 

 The committee's recommendation is also in contradiction to the stand taken by the Narendra Modi government during the course of hearings. In an affidavit dated January 20, 2017, it had made a submission before the Supreme Court that ""all forms of mining without lawful authority, including that in breach of the limits imposed by the EC, carried out within the lease area would also invite penalties"" under the MMDR Act. 

The dilemma now is holding public sector undertakings and mines in other states to the same standards.

The committee, in its report, makes the same argument Odisha's iron ore mines had made to the top court: that violations in the nature of mining in excess of environmental caps or without forest clearances not be punished by provisions dealing with illegal mining under the MMDR Act.

It said the judgement had led to raising of huge demand on leaseholders in Odisha and Jharkhand. Other state may also impose similar penalties.

""The fact does remain that compliance above judicial pronouncement is likely to create huge financial burden on mining companies including PSUs and will adversely impact their economic viability,"" the report said. 


CALL FOR ROLLBACK
Industry insiders said that in case the Act is amended then miners already penalised should also get the benefit.

""Why should Odisha's iron ore miners alone have to be fined for exceeding the environment clearances?"" said B Prabhakaran, owner of Thriveni Earthmovers that is the mining contractor to some of the largest iron mines in the country. ""If such an amendment is under consideration, then Odisha's iron ore sector should be judged by the same yardstick, at par with other minerals, other states and irrespective of the organisation,"" he told ET. ""Captive mines had other resources, large firms could raise funds, it is the small private miner who suffered from this interpretation of the law, and is struggling to comply,"" he added. 

Odisha's mines director Deepak Mohanty, however, said any amendment will have to be perspective and won't affect their demands. ""I can't comment on how other states chose to act; we have scrupulously followed the SC's orders, adopting legal procedures even against government agencies,"" he told ET.

Odisha and Jharkhand have slapped demand notices on Coal India subsidiaries since the landmark ruling in 2017. While Odisha demanded Rs 20,169 crore from Mahanadi Coalfield, since reduced to Rs 10,289 crore, Jharkhand asked for Rs 33,714 crore from Central Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal.

Jharkhand has also sent claims totalling Rs 3,273 crore to iron ore miners, including around Rs 1400 crore from state-owned Steel Authority of India. Its mines, unlike those in Odisha, have continued to operate with part, or no payment, under orders from the High Court of Jharkhand.

Hearing a petition from Hindalco against a demand of Rs 103 crore on excess mining of bauxite, for example, the HC weighed in on the fact that ""the lessee was among the country's largest aluminium producers and wasn't being accused of illegal mining"".

Similarly, Coal India's subsidiaries have received relief from the central mines ministry's revisional authority (RA). Odisha's demands from bauxite mines, to, have been stayed by RA.

""We have written to the RA to vacate the stay and for speedy disposal of the matter,"" said Aboobacker Siddique P, mines secretary of Jharkhand. ""Some iron ore miners have paid 30%, some 15% and are operating under HC orders, asking us to issue transport challans.""

Against total demand of Rs 39,399 crore, Jharkhand only received Rs 615 crore until now. Telangana and Goa governments believe the 2 August 2017 order is only applicable to mines in Odisha. 


Amendment Sought in MMDR Act
Section 21(5) of the MMDR Act says: Whenever a person raises without any lawful authority any mineral from any land, the state government may recover from such person the mineral so raised or where any such minerals have already been disposed of the price thereof and may also recover from such a person rent, royalty, or tax, as the case may be, for the period during which the land was occupied by such a person without any lawful authority.

The high-level committee has suggested replacing “without any lawful authority” with “in contravention of the provisions of this Act and rules made thereunder”. This would help revise penalties for violation of rules related to environment, pollution and other issues."

8,2019-09-06,Hindalco,"Emkay Global has given a ‘buy’ recommendation on Hindalco Industries with a price target of Rs 244.


The US Department of Justice (DoJ) highlighted in its press release that the proposed acquisition will ""eliminate a new and disruptive rival supplying aluminum sheets for next generation automobiles.""


The DoJ cited in its release that the proposed acquisition will reduce the number of auto body sheet producers from four to two. With thae proposed acquisition, Novelis will lock down 60% of the existing domestic auto body sheet capacity and vast majority of the expansion in this segment.


The DoJ and Novelis have agreed to refer the matter to a binding arbitration, given the differences in calculating the market size, among other things. While Novelis takes a broader view of the auto body sheet market which includes steel auto body sheets as well, the DoJ has taken a narrow view of it, limiting the market only to aluminum auto body sheets.


“If this acquisition is blocked, we believe it would be negative for Hindalco given that aerospace and auto body sheets are the two biggest attractions of Aleris. With the premium valuations at which the deal (Novelis' acquisition of Aleris) has been agreed upon, we believe the retention of the auto body sheet business is essential for the deal to be value-accretive for Hindalco,” the brokerage said.


Novelis had agreed to acquire Aleris for a total EV of USD2.58bn (USD775mn in cash and balance being assumption of debt). Autos (22%) and Aerospace (4%) constitute a quarter of the total shipments for Aleris, which has a capacity of c.1mt. In Q2CY19, Aleris shipped 231.8kt of metal, in which the aerospace business grew 20% and the auto body sheet business grew 56%, driven largely by the US business. It reported EBITDA of USD108mn for the quarter, of which North America contributed USD76.5mn."

Where we are: The holiday curtailed week goneby saw Nifty largely trading rangebound on back of mixed news of weak GDP numbers and positive US-China tariff talks. Nifty ended the week at 10,946.


What is in store: Expect rangebound trade to continue with some form of short-term bottom in place for Nifty around 10,800-10,850. On levels, 10,990-11,090 immediate target zone. Close above 11,120 levels may see Nifty heading towards 11,220-11,300 zone. Further, advance-decline ratio has been healthy in past few trading sessions indicating improving market breadth and some form of intermediate bottoming can be seen amongst select midcap counters.


What could traders do: The current downturn offers a good opportunity for investors to accumulate quality scrips at low level and bolster the portfolio from long term point of view. Stock-specific frontline banking counters like IndusInd, SBI offer a good entry point at current levels and can be accumulated from short-to-medium term point of view for higher targets of 1,450 and 320-340, respectively. Further, two-wheeler stocks like Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp showing intermediate bottoming signs and expect to head towards 18,500 and 2,990 levels, respectively, in the short-to-medium term. Among the metal counters, Tata Steel, Hindalco arelooking good for short-to-medium term targets of 390 and 210 levels, respectively."

13,2019-09-11,Hindalco,"Outperformance in small and midcaps likely to last for a few more sessions, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The smallcaps were on the move today. Do you expect sustained buying there?Last week and so far this week has been positive for midcap and smallcap stocks. Investors seem to be agreeable to buy at slightly higher levels as well. What we are seeing is definitely follow-through buying and stocks which have been beaten down completely in auto, banks, commodities seem to be outperforming at this point of time. All signals suggest that this kind of outperformance may last for a few more trading sessions. 

But more importantly, it seems at this point of time all the bad news has got discounted and we certainly have a bottom in place. Now, whether it is the ultimate bottom from where the market does turn, only time will tell. But at least this phase of the bear market seems to be over and depending on how the next few trading sessions are, that will determine the course of this particular phase of the bear market whether it is turning around to be a bull market or we are going to find and trade at lower and lower bottoms. We are at a critical juncture is what I see the stock markets at this point of time and we will have an earnings season over the next six weeks or so. It will be a very important earning season especially from management commentary point of view.


How you are looking at the overall metals basket? Could you pick out some of the largecaps within metals?Although traditionally we have not been very positive on commodities, these companies have seen a huge slide and right now, there is a lot of pressure because of domestic as well as global slowdown on account of trade war. 

But these are cyclicals and deep cyclicals and at some point of time, commodity prices will stabilise and start to move up. It could be 12 months, 24 months down the line. Maybe stock prices will start moving up even before that. But as and when we will turn around in these commodity prices, you can expect a fabulous rally in whole lot of commodities stocks as well. 

Over a three-year period, if they do have another upcycle from these levels, a lot of the commodity stocks can easily go up by 70% to 100% or so. These are not levels to sell off the commodity stocks like metals and maybe at corrections, if you are underweight in metals in a particular portfolio, you could look at selectively buying into some of the largecap metal companies and our preference would be for steel companies like Tata Steel or JSW and maybe Hindalco in aluminium, rather than a NALCO, where there is the possibility of M&A activity which may be earnings accretive over a longer period.


What about real estate? Do you see any reason to buy in at the bottom?Yes absolutely and especially cement companies which are focussed on the economy segment. Companies like Kolte Patil, Prestige Estates and to an extent even Godrej Properties could certainly do well, going forward. These companies have reported good earnings. You could include DLF also which is not exactly into economy segment but then there are certain special situations over there. One can have an exposure to real estate sector through these three-four companies.

Right positioning in terms of price and area and focussing on sales rather than developing a land bank, clearly has paid off for these companies and their balance sheets are in great shape, which we think will outperform going forward.


What is your view on the IT space?IT had served well for investors in the bear market and whatever little allocation investors had they had some at least capital protection as far as IT is concerned. Lot of the IT companies are more like utility companies. They will give any way from 8% to 10% type of top line, bottom line growth rate and that is fine in a bear market. But as and when the bull market starts to pick up, you will find IT companies start underperforming.

Then there is this entire fear within the IT space about overall global slowdown and that may certainly impact IT companies. It has not so far and whatever commentary has come through from the software companies, managements has been positive. But we have seen in the past that whenever the US economy goes for a soft landing, IT companies get affected and within that also, major sectors like manufacturing, retail as well as banking and financial services are under more stress than some of the other segments.

 I would be a bit cautious in software at this point of time. If I am convinced that the markets in fact are turning and we are going to get into higher tops, higher bottoms and the worst is over, then I would certainly think in terms of getting underweight into IT and overweight into some of the cyclicals.


How you are looking at cement as a pocket? Is the overall dynamics improving?Yes absolutely and there is a good deal of price discipline within the cement companies and although volume growth was certainly lacking in the last quarter, but that was more than made up by the kind of increase in operating profit margins that the sector as a whole witnessed and we are quite positive on cement. It is a cyclical industry, should benefit from higher government spending, increased infrastructure spending and there is adequate capacity within the sector to grow and take advantage of any increase demand which may take place.

I would prefer companies which are the largest in the space. Something like UltraTech Cement which will also benefit from merger of Century’s cement units as they start getting integrated. Alsom Shree Cement which has been one of the most successful cement companies in terms of low capital cost of setting up new cement plants and targeting the right market. Between these two companies, one should get decent returns as far as exposure to cement sector is concerned."

14,2019-09-12,Hindalco,"KOLKATA: Successful bidders of the current round of coal block auctions can use extracted coal at any of their plants including those at subsidiaries, provided the end-use plant is similar to the one specified during the auction. Earlier, operators were tied to the plant specified during the auction.

The Centre, however, has rejected prospective bidders’ request of selling coal to Coal India at notified prices for the non-regulated sector, which is almost 20% higher than notified. They asked for a higher price as this round of auction was for the non-regulated sector — for which Coal India charges higher.

Initially, the Centre had said that sale to Coal India will be at a discount of 15% on the notified price for sectors other than power utilities. Subsequently, they clarified that such a sale will be at a discount of 15% over the notified price for the power sector as well, offering Coal India over 20% margin for selling this coal in the open market. A block operator can sell up to 50% of their produce to Coal India in a year.

Utilisation of coal at any other plant by the bidder would, however, be subject to the ministry’s scrutiny and prior approval from the Centre. “The block operator needs to inform the government at least 30 working days before it starts to divert coal to any other plants,” a senior executive from a prospective company said.

Under the current round of auction, the government has offered to auction 27 blocks under three tranches — 8th, 9th and 10th — and successful bidders can sell 25% of the produce in the open market.



Three dozen companies, including Reliance Cement, UltraTech Cement, Balco, Ambuja Cements, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, Birla Corporation, ACC Cement and Vedanta are prospective bidders for the current round.

Out of the 27 blocks on offer, 20 mines are estimated to hold an extractable reserve of 1 billion tonnes. According to mining plans, these blocks can produce a total of 36 million tonnes a year, of which 9 million can be sold in the open market.

Financial biddings are to be held between October 10 and November 8. Final allotments are likely to happen by November 11."

Nifty50 opened positive and headed towards the 11,080 mark in Thursday’s trade but failed to hold the gains and drifted towards 10,965 mark. It negated the formation of higher lows of last four sessions and formed an Outside Bar. It recently witnessed a 330-point recovery from 10,750 level to 11,080 level in six sessions but needs to surpass multiple hurdles at 11,111 and 11,141 levels to witness a bullish momentum. Else, the index may again get stuck in a broader trading range.

Now, the index has to cross and hold above the 11,000-11,050 zone to witness an upward move towards 11,111 and then 11,141 levels while a failure to move above it can cause it to drift below 10,950 and take it to the 10,880-10,850 zone.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,800 followed by 11,000 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 and 11,500 levels. There was Call and Put writing at all immediate strike prices which suggests limited upside as well as downside for the market. Options data suggested a trading range between 10,800 and 11,200 levels.

17,2019-09-14,Hindalco,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the green, following firm global cues amid mixed macroeconomic data. The 30-share Sensex gained 403 points, or 1.09 per cent, for the week to end at 37,385 while 50-share Nifty added 129.70 points, or 1.18 per cent, to end at 11,075.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that created buzz on Dalal Street through the week.


YES Bank creates ripples
YES Bank advanced over 13 per cent for the week amid stake sale rumours in the market. The first report stated that digital payments major Paytm was in talks to buy a stake in the private sector lender from co-founder Rana Kapoor. A Reuters report quoting the bank’s Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill, however, said the bank was close to securing a deal to sell a minority stake to a global technology company to help boost its capital. However, YES Bank in a BSE filing called the Reuters report speculative.



Nifty top gainers: BPCL, Tata Motors, SBI
BPCL (up 8 per cent), Tata Motors (up 7 per cent), SBI (up 6 per cent) and Hindalco (up 6 per cent) were among other top gainers in Nifty index for the week.


Nifty top losers: Zee, HCL Tech, Wipro
With a drop of 2.93 per cent, Zee Entertainment emerged as top loser in the 50-share pack. It was followed by HCL Technologies (2.93 per cent), Wipro (down 2.60 per cent) and Tata Consultancy Services (down 2.56 per cent).
Most of the Information Technology (IT) stocks came under pressure as rupee strengthened against the dollar during the week. A firm rupee adversely affects operating profit margins of IT firms as the sector derives a major share of revenue from exports. Besides, Azim Premji, founder of Wipro, and his other group entities sold about 22.46 crore shares worth over Rs 7,300 crore during the Wipro buyback offer that closed last month. Wipro had bought back 32.3 crore equity shares at Rs 325 a share.


Stocks that rallied up to 57%
As many as 49 stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. They included ITDC (up 57 per cent), Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (32 per cent), Wockhardt (32 per cent), MMTC (27 per cent) and Meghmani Organics (21 per cent). Coffee Day Enterprises, Shankara Building Products, Deepak Fertilisers and Hindustan Copper also advanced over 15 per cent.


Scrips that cracked
Just four counters on the BSE500 plunged in double digits during the week. Somany Ceramics retreated nearly 27 per cent, followed by Eveready Industries (down 18 per cent), Hathway Cable (down 12 per cent) and Indian Energy Exchange (down 11.54 per cent).


Stocks @fresh all-time highsAs many as 13 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs during the week.

18,2019-09-15,Hindalco,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the green, following firm global cues amid mixed macroeconomic data. The 30-share Sensex gained 403 points, or 1.09 per cent, for the week to end at 37,385 while 50-share Nifty added 129.70 points, or 1.18 per cent, to end at 11,075.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that created buzz on Dalal Street through the week.


YES Bank creates ripples
YES Bank advanced over 13 per cent for the week amid stake sale rumours in the market. The first report stated that digital payments major Paytm was in talks to buy a stake in the private sector lender from co-founder Rana Kapoor. A Reuters report quoting the bank’s Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill, however, said the bank was close to securing a deal to sell a minority stake to a global technology company to help boost its capital. However, YES Bank in a BSE filing called the Reuters report speculative.


Nifty top gainers: BPCL, Tata Motors, SBI
BPCL (up 8 per cent), Tata Motors (up 7 per cent), SBI (up 6 per cent) and Hindalco (up 6 per cent) were among other top gainers in Nifty index for the week.


Nifty top losers: Zee, HCL Tech, Wipro

Most of the Information Technology (IT) stocks came under pressure as rupee strengthened against the dollar during the week. A firm rupee adversely affects operating profit margins of IT firms as the sector derives a major share of revenue from exports. Besides, Azim Premji, founder of Wipro, and his other group entities sold about 22.46 crore shares worth over Rs 7,300 crore during the Wipro buyback offer that closed last month. Wipro had bought back 32.3 crore equity shares at Rs 325 a share.

22,2019-09-17,Hindalco,"Homegrown aluminium and copper maker Hindalco has entered the 2019 edition of the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) with the score placing the Aditya Birla Group's metal flagship among the world's top three aluminium companies. 

DJSI is the global standard for measuring and advancing corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Hindalco, a new addition this year, is one of the 98 companies in the Emerging Markets Index and one of the twelve Indian companies this year to make it to the list. 

""This achievement demonstrates how well sustainability has become entrenched in Hindalco,"" said Satish Pai, MD at HIndalco. 

""The 3 key pillars of our performance have been Resilience in a low LME environment, given our focus on resource security and a diversified, balanced product mix; reliability through focus on manufacturing excellence, supplier risk assessment & mitigation and customer centricity; and responsibility with our focus on environment sustainability, safety and people initiatives.'

""More importantly, this assessment has given us a scorecard to identify areas that require attention and work to improve these. The DJSI scoring makes us even more committed to deliver more value going forward,"" Pai said. 

Extracting aluminium from its oxide requires the usage of an electrolytic process that consumes huge amounts of energy. However, it can be recycled infinitely and recycling of aluminium uses 95% less energy than producing the primary metal. 

As part of its efforts to step up its use of sustainable manufacturing practices, the company has commissioned a 30 MW captive solar plant in Odisha and a 4 MW captive hydel power plant in Maharashtra. 

It has also developed the country's first lightweight aluminium bulker that has the potential to save 13,000 litres of fuel annually. It recently also launched a recyclable packaging material aimed at substituting use of plastic."

33,2019-09-26,Hindalco,"The intention of the government to create a $5-trillion economy is very much on the cards and for that, they are ready to start this process of strategic disinvestment, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


A couple of days back we were talking about how the government will not just sell PSUs now, they will also ensure that they get better valuation for them. We have seen how Hindustan Zinc has been a successful divestment in the last several years. If they sell the remaining 30% as well, they can get Rs 25,000-26,000 crore. Do you think this is a good model and should this be replicated in other PSUs as well?It is a most powerful reform. The government intention is clear now. It wants to sell the jewels in the crown. I was part of a deal in 1999, when at Rs 9 per share, I bought stocks from UTI India Fund -- an overseas fund. Nine lakh shares went to Mr Anil Agarwal as the net seller. I used to trade in Bombay for institutions. That time, the stock after bonus and spilt was up 6.5 thousand times! So you can imagine what price appreciation the government has seen by holding stake so I think it is a win-win situation. The government is definitely going to see premiums on a lot of the holdings which they have and for the parent, for Anil Agarwal, the times are excellent. He is already two-three times bid for the stake and this will help alleviate the fiscal balance and get out of stocks where they have made excellent returns. 

For both sides, it is a win-win situation which is again the case in strategic disinvestment in BPCL, selling the SUUTI stake. I was also in the selloff with ITC. That stock is up eight times from the price when it went into SUUTI. So you can imagine what returns these stocks have given in the last 18-20 years.


How are you analysing the metal and mining pack or it is a commodity pack among the PSUs? Mr Modi recently met lot of energy companies in Houston and the buzz is big chunks of Coal India could also be up for grabs. Together with Hindustan Zinc, would there be takers from the strategic global metal and mining space or even the current ones like Vedanta? Definitely there are enough people who are going to buy that. Let us not look at only one year when auto and infra sectors have underperformed and hence the metal and mining space globally has been weak. 

We are talking of trade resolutions between China and US happening next week or beyond and that will set the cat amongst the pigeons. This is the best time to invest in commodities and globally there is a lot of money on the sideline which can be used to buy assets. 

Now India specific assets will definitely be lapped up very aggressively. A disclosure, I also own Hindustan Copper which is a small company that has not done much but it has the third largest copper mine. Copper if you know there is a treatment and refining charge which is there by Hindalco and the likes but the real copper is in Hindustan Copper and I think the government is also in the process of selling it lock, stock and barrel. So a lot of unlocking can take place in the next three to six months.

The intention of the government to create a $5-trillion economy is very much on the cards and for that, they are ready to start this process of strategic disinvestment. That will be cheered globally and I feel a re-rating of India is imminent."

0,2019-10-03,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity markets opened with losses in Thursday's session as September factory growth remained subdued amid more negative news coming from the Indian banking sector. The US announcing tariffs on select European goods did not help either.

Growth in India's manufacturing sector remained weak in September and forward looking indicators in a private business survey suggest the country's wobbly economy is unlikely to start recovering anytime soon, a Reuters report said.

Sensex was down 200 points trading above 38,100 whereas NSE barometer Nifty was down 56 points trading just above 11,300. Both indices were dragged by banking and metal names.

Some negative developments affected the banks. Adding another leaf in PMC Bank saga, in an FIR, officials said the bank used more than 21,000 fictitious accounts to hide loans it made.

On the global front, US markets registering sharpest one-day decline in nearly six weeks on Wednesday also dented the sentiments on Dalal Street. US employment and manufacturing data suggested that the US-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the US economy.

The United States on Wednesday said it would enact 10 per cent tariff on European-made Airbus planes and 25 per cent duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies.

The announcement came after the World Trade Organization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on USD 7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in the long-running case, a move that could ignite a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war."

New Delhi: State-run Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is developing batteries based on indigenous metals to forestall dependence on lithium imports once electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy projects take off in a big way. IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh told ET that the metal-air batteries will produce energy by oxidising metals such as iron, zinc and aluminium. 

These batteries cannot be recharged but motorists can replace plates to power them almost instantly, making it much more convenient for users and eliminating the need for charging infrastructure, he said. “A customer is not concerned how we make petrol if he can buy it wherever he wants. 

Similarly, if he goes to a station and we replace the metal plates, he is not bothered because the whole thing happens within three minutes,” Singh said. The metal-air batteries have other advantages. “These batteries have high energy density. So,if a normal lithium-ion battery can travel the vehicle up to 300 km, these can take it to 500 km,” said Singh. 

However, the cost effectiveness of this alternative will depend on the scale of operation.

Even though this technology eliminates the need of a charging infrastructure, it requires a whole business model to support refurbishment infrastructure. Themetal oxide can be reduced to a metal again, making the process recyclable. 

“Rest of the battery including the air cathodes remain intact and there is no need to change them for at least eight years and after that the air cathode can be completed recycled,” said SSV Ramakumar, director-R&D at IOC. The Central Pollution Control Board, in a compliance report in 2016, acknowledged that India’s Batteries (Management and Handling) Rules 2001, under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, do not cover recycling of Li-ion batteries. 

In case of metal batteries, both the production and recycling can be localised, which settles the concerns of import
costs and environment-friendliness. “If we are looking at future EVs on a countrywide scale, the biggest thing is dependence on import of raw material. So from oil import, we shift to lithium import dependence,” said Singh. 

Data from the US Geological Survey shows that Australia, Argentina, China and Chile together account for 99% of lithium reserves in the world. These countries together produce 81,200 metric tonnes of lithium, which is 95% of the world’s production.

India’s requirement of lithium is expected to be 350,000 tonnes per year, according to automobile industry estimates. Although the government had in past tried to acquire mineral assets abroad, the efforts never yielded results. IOC plans to set up a 1GW plant for manufacturing metal-air batteries and is in talks with Hindalco to source aluminium for the purpose."
17,2019-10-14,Hindalco,"PE multiple is widely used to identify overvalued and undervalued stocks. It combines a company’s stock price and its net earnings and determines the amount an investor is willing to pay for every rupee of the net profit earned by the company (or expected to earn in future). 

A stock with low PE multiple is considered undervalued whereas one with high PE is considered overvalued. However, current market conditions are making it difficult to derive meaningful inferences from the standard PE ratio. This is because one of the significant reasons for the recent volatility is poor corporate earnings.

The poor performance of the corporate sector is largely due to macroeconomic issues like the NBFC crisis, declining consumption and capital expenditures, falling exports and trade wars. Although the government and RBI have provided significant impetus like corporate tax cuts, removal of FPI surcharge and reduction of interest rates, the benefits will be visible only over a period of time.

Market participants have off-loaded the majority of stocks and over 76% of listed companies have delivered negative returns in the past year. The reduction in stock prices have led to considerable reduction in PE multiples. However, poor earnings growth in the past and insignificant future earnings expectations do not indicate that low PE stocks are quality stocks. Decline in PE multiples often provides good entry points for investors, but it is critical that future growth expectations are included while trusting such low valuations.

A high PE is justifiable for a stock that is expected to report strong earnings growth in future compared to a low PE stock that is expected to report slow growth. Fundamentally, a high-growth company is a better pick. The ability to grow faster attracts investors, which eventually results in greater shareholder wealth creation.

To account for such distortions in the PE ratio, price to earnings growth (PEG) ratio is used, which is calculated by dividing a stock’s PE by its projected EPS growth. Stocks with PEG ratios of less than 1 are considered undervalued, whereas those with ratios of more than 1 are considered overvalued. A PEG ratio of 1 implies the stock is fairly valued.

We looked for stocks available at attractive valuations in terms of PEG ratios and included companies covered by Bloomberg. The 12-month and 24-month blended forward PEG ratios for such companies were extracted. The 12-month and 24-month ratios are based on estimated EPS growth for the next 1 and 2 years. Only those stocks with 1 and 2 year forward PEG ratios that have a value of less than one and positive are included. In addition, estimated free cash flows (FCF) for the future 1 year period were extracted and the companies ranked in the descending order of such estimated FCFs.

We will look at seven companies covered by at least 10 Bloomberg analysts and with 1-year forward price potential greater than 10%.



Indian Oil Corporation
This government-owned oil company with Maharatna status is engaged in refining, pipeline transportation and marketing of petroleum products. Its businesses also include exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and petrochemicals.

Hindalco Industries
The company is engaged in the production of aluminum and copper and has a footprint in 11 countries outside India.

Hindalco’s leverage levels have improved with net debt/EBITDA at 2.6 times in 2018-19 compared to 3 times in 2017-18. The future earnings visibility will be supported by aluminium spot prices that are likely to stabilize at current levels with low level of inventories and limited signifi cant capacity additions.



Tata Steel
This diversified steel player has integrated operations ranging from mining to manufacturing and marketing of finished steel products. According to a report by ICICI Direct, the company’s focus on increasing domestic steel capacity will make it a key beneficiary of the government’s decision to reduce the corporate tax rate from 34% to 25.17%.

Tata Steel’s Indian operations’ key assets enjoy cost competitive position globally which aids its overall EBITDA margins. Going forward, the company plans to increase its share of domestic capacity to 71% by 2025. The brokerage house believes that the second half of 2019-20 will augur well for the company due to the steps taken by the government to spur investment and likely pick-up in the economic activity.



Motherson Sumi
The company manufactures automotive wiring harnesses, mirrors for passenger cars and supplies plastic components and modules to the automotive industry. Analysts are bullish on the stock due to the management’s efforts to reduce losses at its greenfi eld facilities through increased productivity and manpower cost rationalisation. 



PEG ratio: 0.98
ROE (%): 15.9

Expectations of a gradual recovery in the European auto market from early next year, diversifi cation in the new product line like camera-focused mirrors and strong order book will keep the company’s fundamentals healthy in future. Moreover, Motherson’s integrated product development facilities, wider product range, ability to offer products at competitive prices and strong customer relationships are other growth catalysts.


Biocon
The biopharmaceutical company is engaged in discovering, developing and producing biologics in chronic therapies such as diabetes, oncology and immunology. According a report by JP Morgan, the company is well-positioned in the emerging biosimilar markets supported by its R&D capabilities, deep pipeline and strong management team.

ROE (%): 15.8
Current price (Rs): 229

With success in biologic development, Biocon has entered into partnership with global companies like Mylan and Sandoz and attained approvals in large markets. The research house believes the growth momentum in the core business is likely to remain strong and an earnings infl ection will be visible over the next two years, aided by the recent launches, approvals in the US/EU and double-digit growth in emerging markets.



Varun Beverages
This beverage industry player is a franchisee of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages sold under the trademarks owned by PepsiCo. According to a report by Karvy Stock Broking, robust volume growth aided by highly underpenetrated territory and innovation of new products that are less seasonal in nature are the significant growth levers for the company. 



PEG ratio: 0.93
ROE (%): 17.9
Current price (Rs): 612
1-year target (Rs): 767
Upside potential: 25.4




Buy: 10

The return ratios are likely remain healthy due to the absence of any major capital expansion in the near future and better capacity utilization for next few years will enhance the return on capital employed. The brokerage believes the company is likely to gain synergy from the acquisition of 20% equity stake in Lunarmech Technologies and expect revenue growth of 31% with healthy demand for carbonated beverages.



Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail
This is a fashion conglomerate with a strong network of 2,714 brand stores across 750 cities in the country. Retail expansion, brand investments and product innovation has helped the company to report good margin performance across segments. Analysts expect robust profi tability due to the aggressive costsaving measures and strong balance sheet.

33,2019-10-19,Hindalco,"Kolkata: Hindalco is likely to see a 48% year-on-year decline in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the quarter to September owing to the twin impact of lower volumes and a fall in aluminium and copper prices on the benchmark London Metal Exchange (LME), said an ICICI Securities research report on the company. 

Hindalco’s (standalone with Utkal Alumina), EBITDA is set to decrease to around Rs 905.3 crore in July-September from Rs 1,737 crore a year ago, according to the report.

In its quarterly preview of Hindalco’s standalone results ICICI Securities said the company could see “a 15% quarter on quarter decrease in EBITDA due to a marginal decrease in copper EBITDA and a 22% decrease in aluminium EBITDA”. 

It estimated EBITDA during July-September to be around Rs 609.1 crore on standalone basis against Rs 717.4 crore in the year-ago period. LME prices decreased sequentially for both aluminium and copper, and so did volumes, it said."
34,2019-10-21,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: India became a net importer of copper for the first time in 18 years in 2018-19 as the closure of Vedanta’s copper smelter in Tuticorin wiped out more than 46% of the country’s production of the base metal, said a research report. As a result, imports of refined copper shot up to touch Rs 14,000 crore last year, according to experts.

This has dealt a heavy blow to downstream copper products makers such as copper wire makers and motor manufacturers, for whom raw material cost makes for a lion’s share of their total cost of production.

“Valuable foreign exchange is going out of the country and our cost of production has increased by about 1%, but even a 1% increase amounts to a lot in downstream manufacturing since more than 90% of our cost is incurred on raw materials,” said Shyam Sundar Rathi, chairman of Vidya Wires — a local manufacturer of copper wires.

Rathi said even with a slight slowdown in demand for the metal in the past 3-4 months, there is still a shortfall of supply.

A research report by Care Ratings said domestic production of refined copper grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% between 2013-14 and 2017-18. But with the closure of Sterlite’s 400,000-tonne copper plant in Tuticorin, output fell by 46% during the year 2018-19 as Sterlite accounted for 40% of the country’s copper smelting capacity.

During the year, production of the other two manufacturers — Hindalco and Hindustan Copper — also fell due to planned shutdowns by the companies. Until last year, with a total capacity of around 800,000 tonnes shared primarily between Hindalco and Vedanta, the country was a net exporter of the metal that is used the most in the electrical industry, followed by building and construction and transport industries.

To be sure, since Sterlite’s plant shutdown, the country’s import of copper ore or concentrate has also come down by an equal measure — by about 45% last year. Domestic manufacturers import copper ore and refine it into copper cathode. Meanwhile, Vedanta has put Sterlite Copper’s expansion plans on hold. Pankaj Kumar, CEO of Sterlite Copper, told ET that the expansion plans of the company have been stalled at the moment. It is also not looking at a different site for the plant as of now.

“All efforts right now are directed towards reviving the plant. We are educating the local community in Tuticorin about the plant and they are coming to realise the detrimental impact of the closure on employment and livelihood,” said Kumar. The Chennai HC is expected to take the matter up for hearing in the first week of December, he said."

36,2019-10-24,Hindalco,"We have started seeing a good amount of interest and traction building even in the midcaps and smallcaps, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Last one year has been full of twists and turns and peaks and turfs. Whatever could go wrong, has gone wrong, investor wealth has been massively destroyed. Should one go out and grab bargains this Diwali or is it time to conserve cash?Last couple of years have been quite tough but things finally seem to be falling in place for our markets, Over the next one year and even beyond that, we should be able to see a decent performance from the market and this time, after a spectacular performance from some of the largecap companies, we have started seeing a good amount of interest and traction building even in the midcaps and smallcaps. 

Once the earnings start reflecting in the numbers and overall global markets are supportive, the next 2-3 years should be extremely positive for our markets and we should be super bullish.


What could go wrong? Everybody is telling me buy good time, bargains are there. Why is nobody telling me about the risks which are there. Everybody is focussing on what can go right, rather than what potentially could go wrong?Globally, in a large part of the economies, Eurozone or some of the emerging markets, China are the black boxes where people do not have much of clarity what can come one particular day. Secondly, we have seen in last three years, earnings growth is taking a while to come back. If there is further delay in earnings growth beyond two or three quarters and the demand revival is delayed, then obviously there is going to be a question mark on the sustainability of the rally.


What do you make of yesterday’s extraordinary volatility in RBL?The volatility was caused by the Q2 numbers and the kind of guidance which the management gave about possible credit costs and the concentration of certain non-performing assets across certain entities. In the current environment, where you have already gone through a bit of grind coming from companies like DHFL, Yes Bank and Indiabulls, people have become extra circumspect on the asset quality side. 

There is a sense that the management is probably trying to say that there could be some more negative news over the next few quarters. People would stay away from such companies in the current environment and which is what we have seen. RBL Bank has come down from Rs 600 plus to almost Rs 250. We had a viewpoint on RBL Bank and we have put under the cautious view at this point of time till the clarity emerges on the asset quality front.


JSW numbers are really not encouraging and even in terms of the commentary coming in, it has been a bit of a tough time with regards to the industry and weak margins, expensive valuations, lower prices and lower demand. What is your outlook on JSW going forward?We had a buy call on JSW for a while but post the quarterly numbers, and the outlook from the management, we have decided to book out of JSW Steel. Both on the pricing front as well as on the volume front, things will take a while to be back on track. Overall given the debt and the environment we think that it makes more sense to get out of some of these steel companies. 


The cycle will turn. It is not going to be a permanent cycle. Some would argue that if you are buying metal stocks, you are pretty much buying a Tata Steel, Vedanta or Hindalco which are mostly below book. We have noticed that in the last 15-20 years, if you bought metal stocks when they were approaching half a book, you have always made money.The issue with buying some stocks purely on valuation parameters is that you do not know how long you will have to really wait out. Even if the economy revives, it will take a while for it to reflect in the capex cycle. Typically, only when you see a big revival in the capex cycle, do you see the commodity players doing well. 

At the moment, though the stocks have corrected, I honestly do not know how long it will take to reflect in the numbers. We should be looking at companies where there is earnings visibility over the next three or four quarters. From that perspective, we are staying away from the steel companies."

11,2019-11-05,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices have now advanced for seven straight sessions. Technical indicators are largely positive, even as oscillators are nearing the overbought zone.

Back-to-back positive closings for the indices are having a rub-off on the broader market, where at least 42 such stocks now look stronger on technical charts.

These stocks might be heading higher in the coming days, suggests technical indicator moving average convergence divergence or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. Strong trading volumes on many of these counters are lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Infosys, Tata Power, Max Financial, Karur Vysya Bank, Torrent Power, Varun Beverages and Shalimar Paints.

Bajaj Finserv, Rallis India, Cholamandalam Finance, Century Plyboards and Music Broadcast are among other stocks showing bullish crossovers on the MACD indicator.







The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed 33 stocks are signalling bearish trends. They included M&M, Hindustan Zinc, Berger Paints, Ashoka Buildcon, Amara Raja, Divi’s Labs, HDFC AMC and Kansai Nerolac Paints.





Analysts say the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty50, Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking sees no signs of any trend reversal yet. He expects to see the index taking out the 12,000 level soon.

“Traders are advised to avoid taking any contrarian bets and use intraday dips as buying opportunities. The immediate supports for Nifty are placed at 11,843 and 11,776 levels,” he said.

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said a High Wave pattern at the key overhead resistance indicates confusion. “The possibility of a downward correction can't be ruled out from the highs. A sustainable move below the 11,850 level may confirm a negative reversal pattern at the highs,” he said.

15,2019-11-07,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: India may impose anti-subsidy duty for a period of five years on copper wire rods from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam after concluding a probe that these imports have impacted domestic players.

The commerce ministry's investigating arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in September last year started a probe into an alleged subsidisation of exports of 'continuous cast copper wire rods' by these four countries.

Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Industries (Sterlite Copper) had filed an application on behalf of domestic industry before the DGTR alleging subsidisation of the products from these four nations, and requested the initiation of an anti-subsidy investigation.

The directorate has recommended ""imposition of definitive countervailing duty (or anti-subsidy duty) for a period of five years,"" it said.

The finance ministry takes the final call to impose these duties.

In the probe, the DGTR has concluded that the products have been exported to India from these countries at subsidised prices.

""The domestic industry has suffered material injury due to subsidisation of the product. The injury has been caused by the subsidised imports of the goods originating in or exported from these countries,"" it added.

The directorate has recommended duty in the range between 2.47 per cent and 10.27 per cent on the landed value of the product in India.

The petitioners had alleged that the producers/exporters of the goods in these countries have benefitted from the ""actionable subsidies"" provided at various levels by the governments of these countries.

The period of investigation was 2017-18 (12 months). It also covered the data of 2014-17.

Countervailing or anti-subsidy duty is a country-specific duty which is imposed to safeguard domestic industry against unfair trade subsidies provided by the local governments of the exporting nations."
14,2019-11-07,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: Hopes of de-escalation in US-China trade war pushed domestic indices back into black in Thursday’s trade after Sensex had slipped about 100 points around midday.

Analysts, however, said one must take every news regarding the trade war with a pinch of salt.

A Bloomberg report quoted a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman as suggesting that China and the US have agreed to proportionally roll back tariffs on each other’s goods in phases. 

Following the development, the BSE Sensex staged a smart rebound from an intraday low of 40,421. At 2 pm, the index was trading 104.45 points, or 0.26 per cent, higher at 40,574.

“Till the Phase 1 deal is signed, it’s 50:50,” said Sameer Kalra of Target Investing. 

Amit Khurana, head of equities at Dolat Capital said it’s a wait and watch for the market.

The Bloomberg report quoting China’s spokesman Gao Feng suggested that the quantum of tariff relief in the Phase I deal would depend on the content of the agreement. The report suggested that the two sides had constructive talks in the past two weeks.

The report came a day after Reuters reported quoting a senior official that a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a long-awaited interim trade deal could be delayed until December as discussions continue over terms and venue.

29,2019-11-13,Hindalco,"We have exported a lot of metal but we are feeling the impact of the slowdown in demand in India right now, says Satish Pai, MD, Hindalco. Excerpts from an interview with Mubina Kapasi of ETNOW.


How has the slowdown impacted Hindalco?Our international businesses have done very well but the Indian businesses of course have felt the impact of the slowdown that we have seen in demand in the country. As a result, in the second quarter we have seen that aluminium demand degrew 6% whereas in the first quarter it had grown by about 7%. That had quite an impact on our business. As a result, we have exported a lot of metal but it is fair to say that we are feeling the effects of the slowdown in demand in the country right now.


Is it unusual to have such a sharp fluctuations?Well it is unusual but you have to remember that the monsoon quarter is generally a slower quarter.


But this is year-on-year you are comparing?This is year-on-year anyway but it is fair to say that the contraction may be a little bit more than what I would have expected. I would have at least thought we would see a 2-3% demand growth but if you look at construction and infrastructure and even the auto sector, everywhere, the demand has been quite weak.


So how much of the total deliveries are to the auto sector?We are not very exposed to the auto sector. Our extrusions are heavily dependent but we sell about 328,000 tonnes a quarter. Less than 5% of that is to the auto sector. For us, the electrical sector takes 40%; overall transportation sector, which is commercial vehicles etc. takes another 10-15%, packaging takes about 20%, In all those sectors, the demand has been slowing down.


I remember in our previous conversation, imports featured heavily as a key complaint for not just the aluminium, but the steel industry also. Is that still a problem? It is still a problem see and on absolute level imports have gone down by 8% but as a percentage of the total consumption, they remain at 60% because the overall demand has come down in the country and as a percentage, imports are still taking 60% and scrap is still more than 50% of that import.


What do you make of this whole RCEP issue? As an Indian aluminium maker, I would assume you should be pretty pleased with the exclusion?We have been working with the government trying to highlight the fact that RCEP will include China and if adequate safeguards are not in place, then besides the ASEAN countries, we will have a lot of imports coming in from China. We are extremely happy that the government has taken cognisance of our fears. 

Overall, RCEP is an important trading body and I am sure that India will come under some pressure but I would urge that the government take into account the concerns of the Indian industry.


There was a shutdown at Muri. The issue was solved but it has still not resumed operations. Why is that?We are going through the regulatory approval processes because we had to do certain amount of clean up. We had to resolve the technical issues of why the breach happened and that has what has taken time. So we are hoping that in this quarter we will reopen Muri because as you said the issues are behind us. Until we restart the plants, I have quite a lot of fixed costs that is still hitting me. 


But even if you restart it by end November as per plan, it is not that from day one you will reach the kind of capacity utilisation of capacity as you were doing earlier?It will take at least a month.


So when you start off, how are you looking at it?It would not have that much effect because we have been keeping the plant warm stacked. We have not absolutely cold stacked it. We should be able to start up, but you are absolutely right. It will take us at least a month to ramp it up.


Overall what are your volumes for copper and aluminium looking like in Q2? How much of it was impacted because of Muri?The aluminium volumes were not impacted at all. We had sales of 328 KT at our full capacity. For copper, we were at about 82 KT. We could have been a bit higher but Dahej and that whole area of Bharuch had probably seen the most severe monsoon in the last 10 or 20 years. Our operations were impacted for nearly five to six days because of the heavy rains. That us why the copper volumes were a bit lower than what they could have been.


Your aluminium volumes are still about okay. What about the cost of production (COP) of bauxite in Utkal Alumina?So the COP for Q2 is same as Q1. I spite of it being a monsoon month when normally things get tight and as you know coal output has been quite tight in the country, our cost of production remained flat. In Q3, our guidance is flat to slightly down, once the monsoon is over.


We just have the coal block auctions going on. I do not think Hindalco has participated…We participated in the Jamkhani for a little bit.


And…We did not get it because the prices went quite high and we have quite a lot of linkage coal tied in. We had certain walk away lines and once they were crossed, we dropped out.


So what is it right now? It is minimal. How much is linkage?60% of Q2 was linkage. About 15% to 18% we got on e-auctions but in Q2 for the first time we imported about 8% because the international prices of coal came down whereas the domestic spot prices went up. 


Are you worried about the raw material availability in India?You can say that I am a bit worried about coal availability in general, going forward. The Indian demand for power is going to continue to grow and I would worry that we have enough coal going forward. The steps the government is taking to auction more mines and to open up for commercial mining are the right steps.


Talking about Novelis, it is heartening to see that the can sales are doing well, automotive fitting is doing well as well, despite whatever they say about the auto slowdown. How exactly are market forces playing out there because Novelis quarter after quarter, has not been that scary a scenario?Well, I guess, it has been what we expected. Novelis supplies to can and auto makers. On the can side, we are benefitting from the anti-plastic movement. Shipments have grown 10% year-on-year, but in general, can demand worldwide is going up. People are interested in the recyclability of cans. So, from a green and sustainability point of view, aluminium for packaging is going to be on the uptrend. That is a secular growth we are seeing in the can market which is good for Novelis. 

On the auto side, I have repeatedly said that whereas the smaller cars, sedans are going out, the electric vehicle and the bigger SUVs are not going down. Hence the auto demand for us, especially in North America and Europe, has been quite strong. We did see a little bit of slowdown in China as it is a big electric vehicle market. At least for aluminium in auto, we should not be seeing too much of a slowdown. In fact, we are predicting a 10% CAGR over the next five years.


Aleris too has done pretty well. Now there was that conditional approval granted from the European Commission on the sale of a certain asset. Where are we on that front?The sale of the asset which is Duffle in Belgium is far advanced. Within November, hopefully we can sign a binding agreement with a party to do that sale and hence get to European Commission approval.


So you have a buyer already?We have buyers that are looking at it.


But this is the only regulatory approval. You have got all the other approvals in place otherwise?That is the only one for the European Commission. In the US, we have signed a consent decree and we are going through the litigation process there. We are quite confident that we are going to do okay there.


For the last many months, aluminium prices have stayed below $2000. How are you seeing the entire demand supply situation? How do you see aluminium prices? Do you see it move up anytime?In the last couple of weeks, aluminium started to trend a little bit higher. Why did it start to go higher because there has been very encouraging noises coming out of the US-China dispute. When you look at the fundamentals of supply demand, inventories of aluminium are at all-time lows. The supply-demand is quite tight but people are worried about the demand side. China is a big part of that demand. The Chinese aluminium demand this year so far has grown by only 1% whereas normally it grows 5-6%. I think people are waiting to see if the Chinese economy picks up. The economy will pick up if they resolve the trade dispute with the US. A large part of it hinges on that trade disagreement being sorted out
.

You have taken certain price hikes in some of your products?Well as the price of aluminium has gone up, we have been hiking the prices in the last few weeks.


With respect to group holding, Hindalco has purchased a certain stake in Vodafone Idea. Is there any plan to infuse more money or sell off the stake?Hindalco had 2.6% historically and it would be fair to say at this stage we have no further plans from the Hindalco side for investment.


You are going to stay at that 2.6% or dilution as a company?Yes, we have no further plans at this stage."
28,2019-11-13,Hindalco,"By Andy Mukherjee
For Kumar Mangalam Birla’s textile-to-telecom empire, adversity is a 100-year-old companion. In 1919, when the Indian businessman’s great-grandfather wanted to start a jute mill, the dominant British firm, Andrew Yule & Co., bought all the surrounding Calcutta land. The Imperial Bank, the forerunner of today’s State Bank of India, initially refused Birla a loan.

The government of post-independence India stymied the Birla conglomerate with kindness. Soviet-style planning and state socialism protected the family’s legacy licensed firms by keeping competition out. But they inhibited growth. Birla’s father, Aditya Vikram, went to Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines because he wasn’t allowed to expand at home. “I for one fail to see where the concentration of economic power is: with the big business houses or with the government?” he wondered in 1979.

Fast forward 40 years, and the 52-year-old current chairman of the group would be justified to reprise his late father’s frustration. The liberalizing spirit of the 1990s Indian economy has lost much of its force. After dismantling the license raj, a system of strict government-controlled production, and encouraging capitalism, New Delhi is gripped once more by a feverish statism that’s making Birla’s shareholders nervous. The slide began before Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, and was one of the reasons why businesses backed his call for “minimum government, maximum governance.” But five years later, relations between private enterprise and the government have turned even testier.


Bloomberg
Take telecommunications, the main source of investors’ anxiety.

Ever since India opened up the state-run sector in the 1990s, the Aditya Birla Group has been an anchor investor. Partners and rivals like AT&T Inc., India’s Tata Group, and Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. came and went, but Birla remained. Currently, the group owns 26% of the country’s largest mobile operator by subscribers, Vodafone Idea Ltd., with the British partner controlling 45%. An Indian court last month directed this bruised survivor of a nasty price war to pay Rs 28,000 crore ($4 billion) in past government fees, interest and penalties. Overall, India wants to gouge its shriveled telecom industry of $13 billion. The fund-starved government expects operators to cough up more at 5G auctions next year. How long can the Birla boss hang in? With Vodafone Idea saddled with losses and $14 billion in net debt, should he even bother?

It’s doubtful whether partner Vodafone Group Plc will linger. This isn’t the first time it has been clobbered by unreasonable government demands. In 2012, India retrospectively changed its tax law to pursue a $2.2 billion withholding tax notice against the U.K. firm. Seven years later, that dispute is far from resolved, and the unit has now been slapped with a new bill.


Bloomberg
In its half-yearly earnings reported Tuesday in London, Vodafone fully wrote down the book value of its India operations, and warned that the unit could be headed for liquidation. Vodafone’s 42% stake in a separate cellular tower company in the country, once sold, will get used largely to pay off the loan it took to pump capital into the main telecom venture. After that, the U.K. firm will have a little over $1 billion left to support Vodafone Idea, according to India Ratings & Research, a unit of Fitch Ratings. However, the India business would be required to find $5.5 billion just for interest- and spectrum-related payments until March 2022.


Will Birla step into the breach?
Out of the Indian group’s 26% in Vodafone Idea, about 11.6% is held by Grasim Industries Ltd., and another 2.6% is owned by Hindalco Industries Ltd. Hindalco, among the world’s largest aluminum makers, is battling weak metals demand and a complicated takeover of the U.S.-based Aleris Corp. The bulk of the burden of a telecom rescue — should there be one — would fall on Grasim. It acts as a holding company for Birla’s cement and financial services businesses, apart from directly owning factories that churn out wood-based fiber and chemicals like caustic soda used in soap and detergent.

Mumbai-based Emkay Global Financial Services says that in the worst-case scenario, where the government doesn’t back down and Birla refuses to fold his telecom cards, a rescue mounted by by Grasim could cost it 187 rupees per share. If Birla refrains from throwing good money after bad, the value of everything else Grasim owns net of debt is 1,126 rupees a share, or 47% more than the current stock market price. Clearly, the overhang of the Vodafone uncertainty is playing on investor psyche. Once the U.S.-China trade war stops making global textile markets jittery, fiber prices will firm. Grasim, in investors’ view, is better off spending $2 billion on new capacities in fiber, chemicals and cement than wasting any more money trying to salvage the telecom. 

The Indian government should see the folly of effectively turning the telecom industry into a two-horse race between Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., controlled by Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian, and Bharti Airtel Ltd., which, too, is staggering under a mountain of debt. As IIFL Securities put it, bankruptcy of Vodafone Idea would hurt all stakeholders. Vodafone and Birla would lose control, the government would forgo $1.7 billion in annual spectrum revenue and banks would take losses on their $4 billion-plus exposure.


Bloomberg
Such an outcome would cast a serious doubt on the ability of private entrepreneurs to flourish, especially if they — like Birla or Amazon.com Inc. boss Jeff Bezos — happen to find themselves in competition with Ambani in a tightly regulated industry. Future investors will think twice. The rift between the government and business wasn’t Modi’s creation, but to allow the mistrust to turn into a chasm would be one of his administration’s gravest mistakes."

The tendency of the short-term trader to try and latch on to stocks which are running on high beta and probably playing for a contrarian trade, is not playing this time around. It is more of the continuation we have seen in the last few months of this market rally in stocks like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank to a larger extent, Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank as well. 

These stocks have been doing extremely well. All the other sectors have been playing a helping hand but not many of them have recovered or converted their short term rallies into trends. That is what separates the men from the boys in this rally and that is going to be the likely texture for the markets going forward as well. 

Just one important observation, the open interest data which transpired last week still suggests that there has been more long built up on the Bank Nifty futures and that is why I am highlighting many of these private sector banks because if they continue to move up higher from where they left off on Friday, then there is a higher chance of Bank Nifty leading the breakout in Nifty for next week.


What do you make of what is happening in the telecom pack now? Bharti at the end of the week was among the top gainers in Nifty?Absolutely and it is one of the best moves for the Bharti Airtel stock in the last so many weeks and months. It used to have more of a staggered continuation up move but what transpired on Friday was nothing more than exceptional because the stock opened slightly lower. It tested the mark of Rs 360 which was more or less a closing base support for Bharti Airtel.

I believe that the remarkable turnaround in the first half of the session itself and stock closing at the highest point of the day indicates that this stock is ready to move up higher even from current levels. The volumes moved up significantly higher for Bharti Airtel and so that is an added positive. 

The other point is that it is now closer to the psychological mark of Rs 400 as well, which has been acting as a hurdle for the stock price. When a largecap stock like Bharti Airtel consolidates at the upper end of the resistances and goes through a time-based correction or more volatility, in between it is a sign that the stock is reading for a big breakout on the upside. 

A continuation move above Rs 400 for Bharti Airtel would be taken as a breakout move for the stock and post that, I would expect price trends to continue. What you have seen in the last one year, even a target of Rs 440-460 will not be ruled out provided the stock sustains that breakout of Rs 400.


Another interesting space has been what is happening with the metal pack. Some of the steel companies are moving. Vedanta has been moving. What is your sense on largecap metal names?It has been topsy-turvy for these stocks when you look at it on a collective fashion because on the one hand, midcap stocks like Jindal Steel have done exceptionally well. In the last month or one-and-a-half month, it has rallied 50-55% but the other stocks have not failed to show signs of momentum. 

Hindalco was one of the stocks which also showed potential but post results, the stock has fallen back below that Rs 200 mark which was a strong psychological support. Vedanta on the other hand has been a laggard. The stock had shown signs of potential earlier but it keeps on failing time and again ad makes new swing lows. Those are the two stocks which I particularly believe would continue to be a drag on the overall metal index. 

Tata Steel on the other hand keeps giving that periodic bouts of rally. In terms of a strategy, if you can get Tata Steel may be 4-5% from its recent swing highs, that will be a good entry point for playing the stock with a risk reward of 1:2. It has to be more stock specific and not a holistic view on the metal stocks.


Any picks for our viewers?Absolutely. There are three buy calls and all three of them are varied in terms of strategy. The first is a buy on Strides Shasun. That stock looks extremely strong on the short term charts. The indicators have gotten into an extremely oversold territory. So, the chance of a strong bounce over the next one week could not be ruled out. I would suggest a buy with a target of Rs 395 and stop loss at Rs 364. 

Second is Aditya Birla Fashion. It is more of a breakout candidate. The stock was consolidating since last so many weeks, trading above the 200-day moving average. The volumes and the indicators have now pepped up higher for Aditya Birla Fashion. That could lead to a strong breakout over the next one week. That is also a buy with Rs 230 approximately as a positional target and a stop loss of Rs 200. 

The third would be from the largecap space. It is a buy on Kotak Bank. Many of these banking stocks, even Kotak Bank, I believe now be heading towards consolidation breakout more of a continuation breakout on the daily and the hourly charts so buy with a target of Rs 1680 and stop loss at Rs 1580."

39,2019-11-19,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: AV Birla group flaship Hindalco Industries is betting big on the packaging and transport containers segment, a top company official said on Tuesday.

The move is due to the low per capita use of aluminium in the country which is at 2.6 kg now and being the largest producer of the metal, it gives an added advantage to the AV Birla flagship.

The domestic packaging industry is a USD 35 billion and is growing at around 25 percent annually.

""Per capita intake of aluminium is just 2.6 kg now, while in China it is 30 kg. So we see huge opportunity in both packaging, cans and transport industry and we are looking to expand in these areas going forward. We expect to hold 40-45 percent of the downstream market,"" managing director Satish Pai said.

In the transportation business, the company will be contract manufacturing aluminium containers for bulker carriers and trailers which will help the goods transport industry bring down cost as the light weight aluminum containers can carry more payload.

It can be noted that almost all goods containers are built of steel now which increases the tonnage of the truck.

As part of entering the packaging business, Hindalco recently partnered with the Jute Corporation to make recyclable packaging material to reduce single-use plastic.

And as a first step, the company has launched the country's first aluminium foil-laminated jute bags for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the trust that manages the Tirumala Temple in Andhra.

""Going forward, we aspire to make aluminium the 'smart metal of choice' by showcasing it as a supermaterial, with innate properties of strength, light weight, anti-corrosion and 100 percent recyclability,"" Pai said, adding they will soon roll this out to other temples and to other industries as well as a smart and sustainable packaging option.

At its aluminium foil manufacturing plant in Nagpur, the jute cloth is laminated with food-grade aluminium foils, and sent to artisans in Telangana for fabricating the bags in different sizes, which are available at an affordable price.

There is a strong response to the aluminium-foil jute bags and already 60,000 bags have been sold in the past six months alone."

40,2019-11-22,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Hindalco might fit into the investment criteria of investors focused on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing, said Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE).

The brokerage has assigned a fair value of Rs 240 to the Hindalco stock, which fell 1.2 per cent to close at Rs 188.60 on Thursday.

“ESG-focused investors may want to make an exception for Hindalco from their negative stance of investing in metal & mining companies in general as Hindalco is primarily a downstream aluminum company,” said KIE analysts in a client note.

“We assume aluminium will have an important role to play in sustainable development (given its easy recyclability versus plastics, especially single-use plastics) in two large industries — automobiles (light-weight EVs and components) and beverages (recyclable cans).”

Kotak said Hindalco is hardly a typical commodity company with the bulk of its profits coming from the downstream converter business (automobile parts and beverage cans).

“The contribution of the downstream business could rise to 81 per cent by FY2021 on acquisition of Aleris (another downstream converter company) although it may have to shed parts of Aleris’ automotive components businesses to meet regulatory requirements,” the analysts said."
41,2019-11-22,Hindalco,"By PR Sanjai

The financial distress at Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture has dragged down the wealth of Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose group is the second-largest investor in the teetering wireless carrier.

The tycoon, who joined forces with the British operator last year, has lost about a third of his fortune since the end of 2017 as mounting losses and debt decimated the equity of the troubled Vodafone Idea Ltd. In addition, shares of his flagship firms that produce chemicals, metals and cement have also tumbled amid a demand slump, eroding his wealth.

The net worth of Birla has shrunk to about $6 billion from $9.1 billion two years ago, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A majority of his fortune is derived from his ownership of Aditya Birla Group, a conglomerate that controls his main holdings.

Birla is the latest mogul to burn his fingers in India’s cutthroat phone-services market since Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. entered the fray in 2016 and drove two rivals to bankruptcy. Formed by the merger of Vodafone’s local unit and Birla’s cellular operator, Vodafone Idea last week reported the worst loss in the nation’s corporate history, while the British partner flagged the risk of a collapse.


Bloomberg
Aditya Birla Group has a stake in Hindalco Industries Ltd., the world’s largest aluminum rolling company, and owns a part of Grasim Industries Ltd., which controls India’s biggest cement maker.

For the Aditya Birla Group, the hit on the telecommunications business couldn’t have come at a worse time. Cooling global growth amid a trade war between the U.S. and China, as well as an economic slowdown at home has curbed demand for industrial raw materials the group produces.

Vodafone Idea’s woes deepened last month after India’s top court sided with the government’s demand for $4 billion in fee-arrears from prior years. Already burdened by $14 billion of debt, the order came as a blow to its finances weakened by a brutal war with Jio. Ambani’s operator this year became the country’s No. 1 carrier with 380 million users by offering free calls and cheap data.

Shares of Vodafone Idea have plunged 90% since end-2017, shrinking its market value to $2.7 billion.

“Vodafone and Idea have been going through a complex merger and, at the same time, trying to keep their heads above water in the battle with Reliance Jio,” said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, a professor of business strategy at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. “The Supreme Court judgment came at the most inopportune time.”

Hindalco, which makes aluminum and copper, reported a 33% drop in profit for the latest quarter as the prices of both the metals slid in the three months through September. Shares of Hindalco have tumbled 31% since end-2017, cutting its market value to $5.9 billion. The S&P BSE Sensex has gained 19% in the same period.

The slowdown in India’s $2.7 trillion economy has cooled demand for commodities such as cement to chemicals and textiles manufactured by Grasim. Its stock has dropped 33% since end-2017.

Vodafone Idea’s troubles have also weighed on Grasim, which owns about 12% of the carrier.

This week brought some signs of relief to Vodafone Idea shareholders. Its shares have more than doubled in the four days through Nov. 20 as the three rivals -- including Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd. -- signaled an end to the price war. Bharti reported a record quarterly loss last week as well.

On Wednesday, the government deferred airwave payments for two years, providing some relief for the industry roiled by high license fees and spectrum costs. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said she wants all companies to flourish and none to fail.

“The tariff hikes are positive,” Jefferies analysts led by Piyush Nahar said in a note this week. Despite the positive move, relief from the government remains crucial, especially for Vodafone Idea, they wrote."

Telecom stocks stole the show, jumping on hope of government relief, but there was some weakness towards the close of the week as the package offered lagged expectations.

Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said Nifty50, Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices are clearly forming a corrective pattern along with majority sectoral indices, which are also moving sideways. “Trading in such a phase can cause whipsaw losses,” he said.

But brokerages continued to see stock-specific opportunities. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 12 money-making ideas that analysts said should make money over the next few weeks.


Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking


Lupin | Buy| Target price Rs 820| Stop loss Rs 750

Lupin has formed a reversal pattern on the daily chart and is now on the verge of a breakout from its five-month-long consolidation phase. Indications are in favour of a steady rise from here on. Further, the existence of major support zone of long-term moving averages i.e. 200 EMA on daily chart, is adding to the positivity.


PVR| Buy| Target price Rs 1,920| Stop loss Rs 1,700

After making a record high, PVR retraced marginally of late and currently hovers in a range while holding firmly above the support zone of the 100 EMA on the daily chart. Considering its chart pattern and overall trend, the analyst expects a strong surge ahead.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


Apollo Tyres | Buy| Target price Rs 183| Stop loss Rs 161

This counter appears to be have a strong support around the Rs 162 mark, as it bounced back after testing the said support level at least on two occasions in the past. Even in the last session, the stock registered an intraday low of Rs 162 and recoiled from the same. Hence, sustaining above Rs 162 level, the stock can easily head towards its logical target of Rs 183. In between some resistance can be expected around Rs 171, but once that hurdle is cleared, the momentum shall get strengthened further with a target of Rs 183.


Tata Steel | Buy| Target price Rs 447 | Stop loss Rs 383

A strong recovery in the last session after testing its 50-day moving average suggests this counter might have completed its correction at an intraday low of Rs 383 hit in last session. In that scenario, it should resume its uptrend which appears to be in place from the low of Rs 320 hit last October. For this up-trend, the ideal target shall be a test of the 200-day moving average, whose value is placed around Rs 447. In between, there can be some hiccups around Rs 421 mark, but with the momentum strengthening, that should be cleared. Positional traders are advised to adopt two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on dips in the Rs 395 – 387 zone, analysts said.


Exide | Buy| Target price Rs 207 | Stop los Rs 186

For the past two weeks, this counter appears to be consolidating in a narrow range between Rs 194 and Rs 186 levels, with a positive bias and it appears to be on the verge of a breakout. This counter made a strong comeback in last session on relatively much higher volumes. On such a breakout, it can head to test its recent swing high of Rs 208.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher


Hindalco | Buy| Target price Rs 208 |Stop loss Rs 182

This stock has taken base at the ascending trend-line support near Rs 187 level, and with the RSI also indicating a trend reversal to imply strength, it shows the potential to rise further with a positive bias in the coming days.

51,2019-11-27,Hindalco,"The fact that Nifty’s 1360-point rally since September 19 has been led by a small basket of stocks is very well known. Reliance Industries, the HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have emerged as the drivers of this big Nifty gain since the announcement of the corporate tax cuts by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in September.

But there are indications that the basket is getting broader. A new set of stocks look set to join the rally and drive the benchmark index even higher if one goes by the increase in open interest positions. The open interest in Hindalco has seen a 63 per cent spike in the current series while that of Bharti Airtel, SBI and Infosys’ have risen by more than 55 per cent, data from exchanges show.



ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are the other two stocks that have seen massive build-up in long position with 130 per cent and 65 per cent increase in open interest, respectively.

The open interest of star performers like RIL and HDFC Bank remained same for the last few days.

11,2019-12-09,Hindalco,"MUMBAI: The Aditya Birla Group will not be denied bank funds or be barred from bidding for insolvent companies if Vodafone Idea were to default and enter bankruptcy proceedings as there were no corporate or promoter guarantees issued by the conglomerate to the telecom firm, say bankers.

When a company faces insolvency proceedings, promoters are unable to raise funds for other businesses, and also they are not eligible to bid for any bankrupt business under Section 29A of the Bankruptcy Act. With effect from December 1, guarantors to any insolvent business too face bankruptcy proceedings.

Of Aditya Birla Group companies, Grasim Industries has the largest stake of 11.6%, followed by Hindalco Industries (2.6%) in the telecom firm, which is not generating enough money to meet its liabilities. Overall, the Birla Group has a 18.5% stake, while Vodafone Group holds 53.6% in the company.

Given Vodafone Idea’s shareholding pattern, an insolvency proceeding against the company would not bar most Aditya Birla Group companies from being a bidder for other companies under the insolvency process.

Last week, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said Vodafone Idea will have to shut shop in the absence of government relief after last month’s Supreme Court directive requiring the telecom giant to pay dues of Rs 40,000 crore in 90 days.




“It is true we will shut shop if we don’t get relief... because there is no company in the world that can pay that kind of fine in three months; it just doesn’t work like that,” Birla had said at an HT event. The chief of Vodafone’s UK parent, too, had voiced a similar feeling. Nick Read, Vodafone’s global CEO, had said that the joint venture may have to be liquidated, citing unsupportive legislation and excessive taxes. Vodafone Idea had reported the country’s highest loss of Rs 50,921 crore for the quarter ended September after the Supreme Court order. The company has a debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore.

Emkay Finance, in a research report last month, said that Grasim was under no obligation to bail out Vodafone. “According to our calculations, in the worst-case scenario, the impact (of Vodafone Idea) on Grasim’s stock price would be Rs 187 per share,” the report said.

According to a note by Edelweiss research, banks have approached Vodafone Idea for the payment of the outstanding debt due to covenant breach, but the company has declined it for now. There is no acceleration in the payment of bank debt yet. Since then, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have filed a review petition in the Supreme Court.

Lenders say that they have not yet taken a call on the action they will take should their guarantees on behalf of Vodafone to the government get invoked and they crystallise into debt. If lenders deny further funds, the likelihood of insolvency proceedings is high."

Asian shares scaled eight-month peaks on Friday as the double dose of relief slugged safe-haven sovereign bonds and the Japanese yen, and led markets to scale back the chance of more interest rates cuts around the world.

25,2019-12-14,Hindalco,"Mumbai: Metal stocks surged on Friday after US President Donald Trump approved a phase one trade deal with China. The BSE Metal index gained 2.3% with Vedanta, Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India advancing 2-4%.

The US President signed off on a phase-one trade deal with China, averting the December 15 introduction of a new wave of US tariffs on about $160-billion worth of consumer goods from China.

The tariff war between the two countries have affected the metal sector as it has depressed base metals prices and hurt business sentiments.

“The outlook for the sector has improved after the phase one trade deal,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL.

Pankaj Pandey, head of retail research at ICICIdirect, said domestic recovery is still tentative for metal companies.

“Metals are more of a trading bet because of valuations rather than a structural bet at this point,” said Pandey.

Sofat of IIFL views the metals space as a contra play because of cheaper valuations and is bullish on Tata Steel. The BSE Metal index has fallen 17% so far this year while the BSE Sensex is up nearly 14% so far this year.

JM Financial is also bullish on Tata Steel and views it as a preferred play in the ferrous space."
26,2019-12-14,Hindalco,"Hindalco, Ashok Leyland and EID Parry are the three stocks Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in, is choosing as his trading picks for next week. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What do you make of the momentum towards the end of the week?Intra week, there has been a very strong comeback for the Nifty. From those 11,800 marks, it has been a very ferocious comeback. For two or three days consecutively, the market stayed pretty well. What was more heartening was a variety of factors. First of all, the index came back above that 12,000 mark which I believe is a very strong psychological breakout for the indices. 

The second and the most important part was the market breadth improving and not just in terms of the advance decline ratio, but stocks which moved up higher, last week. Earlier, the rally started from the low beta or defensive stocks like the pharma, IT stocks and then in the second half of the week, we saw the metals and the PSU banking pack pick up quite a bit of a pace.

When you have such a strong sectoral mix and markets internals, you generally expect the momentum to carry forward. The only one catch over here for the index which I saw looking at the data on Friday post closing was that PCR or the put-call ratio is now at 1.4-1.42 levels. So, over Monday-Tuesday next week, if we see successive price up moves, then there is a high possibility that the put-call ratio may come into an overbought territory. That could call for a bit of short term correction.


What do you make of the metals pack this week? One of the star gainers was metals and was probably led by what is happening in the US?Absolutely. The metal stocks did fabulously well and many of these stocks were waiting for a breakout anyway. A case in point is Hindalco which closed at a multi-week high at those 205 plus levels, SAIL also has shown a lot of promise. Even SAIL is coming out of a bullish flag pennant kind of a combination and breakout on the weekly charts. 

There are some strong indicators on the monthly timeframe as well and many are metal stocks. Tata Steel also did pretty well. JSW Steel had a bit of an iffy run on Friday, but net-net, even this stock is looking quite strong and sturdy. Almost all the stocks from the metal pack did fabulously well for themselves last week and when you have risk-on mode coming back into the markets, these kind of sectors are trader favourites. Many of these metal stocks should see a continued up move, case in point Hindalco and SAIL particularly."

31,2019-12-16,Hindalco,"Boosted by its consumer-facing businesses like organised retail and telecom, Reliance Industries ended state-owned Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) 10-year reign as India's largest company, topping the Fortune India 500 list. With a revenue of Rs 5.81 lakh crore in 2018-19, the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate also became the first privately-held and the only other company to become India's largest corporation apart from IOC for the first time in 10 years, Fortune India said. 

 State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) was ranked third, same as in 2018. It was followed by State Bank of India, Tata Motors and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) -- all with no changes in their ranking between 2018 and 2019. 

 The list does not take into account subsidiaries of companies and so ONGC's ranking does not reflect those from its recently acquired Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) as well as ONGC Videsh Ltd. 

 Rajesh Exports climbed one position to be ranked 7th on the 2019 list and so did Tata Steel, Coal India, Tata Consultancy Services and Larsen & Toubro that were ranked 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th, respectively. 

 ICICI Bank rose two positions to be ranked 12th, followed by Hindalco Industries and HDFC Bank. 

 Vedanta Ltd slipped three positions to be ranked 18th on the 2019 list. 

 Fortune India said RIL posted a 41.5 per cent rise in its revenue in the financial year 2018-19, which was 8.4 per cent more than IOC, the second-largest company on the list. 

 RIL's 2018-19 revenue stood at Rs 5.81 lakh crore, while IOC posted a growth of 26.6 per cent in sales to Rs 5.36 lakh crore in the same year. RIL's profit for 2018-19 was also more than double that of IOC, at Rs 39,588 crore. 

 ""Over the past 10 years, the oil-to-retail conglomerate's profit has been an average three times higher than that of IOC. The highest it touched compared to IOC was up to 4.8 times, in FY15 when RIL's profit was Rs 23,566 crore and the public sector major's stood at Rs 4,912 crore,"" it said. 

 Overall, the revenue of the Fortune India 500 companies in the 2019 list grew 9.53 per cent, while profit rose 11.8 per cent. 

 A total of 57 companies dropped off the list for reasons including consolidation within the public sector banks, public sector undertakings, as well as the private sector. 

 This year, the total loss posted by the 500 companies also came down, with 65 companies posting a cumulative loss of Rs 1.67 lakh crore, compared to last year's Rs 2 lakh crore racked up by 79 companies, Fortune India said. 

 Public and private sector banks faced diverse fortunes in 2019. As many as 14 of 22 public sector banks reported cumulative losses of Rs 74,253 crore. In contrast, just two private sector banks posted losses (IDFC First Bank, at Rs 1,907.9 crore; and Lakshmi Vilas Bank, at Rs 894.1 crore). The total profit of 24 of private sector banks (including foreign banks and cooperative banks) was Rs 60,747 crore, a 6.16 per cent increase over 2017-18. 

 Fortune India said the oil and gas sector (with eight companies) accounted for 22.3 per cent of the total revenue of the 500 companies, followed by banking with 15.88 per cent of the total. 

 The banking sector, with 48 companies, is also the biggest contributor by way of the number of companies on the list. Oil and gas, however, has the highest share of profit in the 500, at 23.44 per cent."

Investment Rationale

The management clearly stated its intention not to infuse further capital in Idea, said HSBC. The management believes the issues marring the telecom sector are too big to be solved by further capital infusion, it said. Rising contribution from Novelis and potential merger with Aleris, which is not in the base case, make Hindalco a compelling investment case, HSBC said."

38,2019-12-19,Hindalco,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Emkay Global has a sell rating on 
Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) with a target price of Rs 2,580 after Prasco announced the authorised generic launch of Nuvaring. This is the second generic launch for the product within a week’s time, the brokerage said. The drug is one of the key expected launches for DRL in FY21, but launches by competitors earlier than the company could affect the product economics, it said. Shares of DRL ended up 1.6 per cent at Rs 2,873.75 on Wednesday.

• Morgan Stanley has an equalweight rating on 
Bank of Baroda with a target price of Rs 100 after the bank disclosed its divergence details on asset quality and provisioning for FY19. The remaining provisioning divergence at Rs 2,600 crore amounts to 2.7 per cent of FY20 book value (post tax basis) and around 55 per cent of FY20 PBT, said Morgan Stanley. The bank hasn’t provided details on the nature of this provisioning divergence, it said. Shares of Bank of Baroda ended down 3.3 per cent at Rs 98.9 on Wednesday.


• Anand Rathi has initiated coverage on
 Dixon Technologies (India) with a target price of Rs 5,822. Ideally placed to cater to mounting demand across multiple categories in the rapidly growing consumer durables sector, Dixon’s scale and size give it an edge, said Anand Rathi. The brokerage has modelled 24 per cent and 32 per cent CAGRs over FY20-22 in revenue and PAT, respectively, resulting in the RoCE expanding from 26 per cent in FY19 to around 36 per cent in FY21 and FY22. Shares of Dixon Technologies ended up 2 per cent at Rs 3,623.65 on Wednesday.

• Haitong Securities India has initiated coverage on 
Finolex Industries with a target price of Rs 700. Finolex enjoys a dominant position in India’s agri pipe market due to its competitive edge in backward integration (PVC resin), established brand image and strong distribution network in rural market, said Haitong. While Ebitda is projected to remain relatively stable over FY19-FY22, the quality of profit could improve on rising contribution from product business, it said. Shares of Finolex ended down 1.55 per cent at Rs 541.45 on Wednesday.

• HSBC has retained buy rating on 
Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 260. The management clearly stated its intention not to infuse further capital in Idea, said HSBC. The management believes the issues marring the telecom sector are too big to be solved by further capital infusion, it said. Rising contribution from Novelis and potential merger with Aleris, which is not in the base case, make Hindalco a compelling investment case, HSBC said. Shares of Hindalco Industries ended down 0.1 per cent at Rs 213.50 on Wednesday."

49,2019-12-25,Hindalco,"NEW DELHI: With overhang of disputes choking investments in the oil and gas sector, the government has constituted an expert committee for time-bound resolution of exploration and production disputes without having to resort to tardy judicial process. The 'Committee of External Eminent Persons/Experts' for dispute resolution will comprise former oil secretary G C Chaturvedi, Oil India Ltd former head Bikash C Bora and Hindalco Industries Ltd Managing Director Satish Pai, according to an official notification. 

 The panel will have a tenure of three years and the resolution will be attempted to be arrived at within 3 months. 

 India's oil and gas sector has been plagued by disputes from cost recovery to production targets, and companies as well as the government have resorted to lengthy and costly arbitration followed by judicial review -- a process that takes years to resolve differences. 

 The notification said the committee will arbitrate on a dispute between partners in a contract or with the government over commercial or production issues for oil and gas. 

 ""Any dispute or difference arising out of a contract relating to exploration blocks/ fields of India can be referred to the committee, if both parties to the contract agree in writing for conciliation or mediation and further agree to not invoke arbitration proceedings thereafter,"" it said. 

 Once a resolution has been referred to panel, the parties cannot resort to arbitration or court case to resolve it. 

 ""The committee shall exercise all powers and discharge all functions necessary for carrying out conciliation and mediation proceedings for resolution of the disputes between the parties as per the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and endeavour that the parties arrive at a settlement agreement within three months from the date of the first meeting of the committee,"" it said. 

 The members and the parties may, however, extend the time for arriving at a settlement agreement by mutual agreement. 

 ""The members of the committee shall at all times remain impartial to the parties during the course of the conciliation or mediation proceedings,"" the notification said. 

 The committee acting as conciliator or mediator will be allowed to take services of third-party or expert agency to aid and assist it in discharge of its functions as and when required. 

 Upon receipt of a request referring dispute for resolution, the committee shall conduct the conciliation or mediation proceedings. ""The proceedings shall be based on the principles of fairness, justice and good conscience,"" it said. 

 For procedural aspect, the committee will be guided by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the venue of the conciliation or mediation proceedings shall be New Delhi. 

 ""The parties will represent their case before the committee acting as conciliators or mediators only through their employees or executives. Advocates or consultants shall not participate in the conciliation proceedings, unless the committee on application filed by a party to the proceedings finds that some issue of legal nature or an issue requiring highly specialised knowledge is in dispute requiring clarification/interpretation by an Advocate or Consultant and takes a view that in absence of such assistance or participation the party's interests shall not be adequately represented in the conciliation or mediation proceedings,"" it said. 

 It shall be open to the parties to make any suggestions, proposal or alternative proposals for amicable settlement of dispute. 

 ""Parties shall not claim any interest on claims and counter-claims from date of notice for conciliation or mediation till execution of the settlement agreement, if so arrived at. 

 ""In case, parties are unable to arrive at a settlement, no interest shall be claimed in any further proceedings for the period from the date of notice till date of completion of the proceedings pending before the committee or date of the receipt of the final ‎ recommendations from the committee or date of execution of the settlement agreement whichever is later,"" it said. 

 The parties are required to keep conciliation or mediation proceedings confidential and the same cannot be relied upon them as evidence in any arbitration or court proceeding. 

 ""Pendency of arbitral or judicial proceedings shall not constitute any bar on commencement of conciliation or mediation proceedings before the committee, even if the conciliation or mediation proceedings are on the same subject matter/issue as the arbitral or judicial proceeding,"" it said. 

 It added that the parties shall not initiate or take any step to initiate any arbitral or judicial proceedings in respect of a dispute, which is a subject matter of the conciliation or mediation proceedings pending before the committee."

“In anticipation of better economic growth, we believe this is a good time to invest in cyclical sectors like metals, energy, capital goods, industrial and infrastructure. We are also positive on chemicals and export-oriented companies,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The BSE Metal index plunged the most at 15 per cent so far in 2019 amid the trade tensions between the US and China. It was followed by Auto (down 13 per cent), Capital Goods (down 9 per cent), Power (down 5 per cent), PSU (down 5 per cent) and Healthcare (down 4 per cent) indices.

“Auto OEMs and auto ancillaries are definite buys at current decade-low valuations. Retail should make a comeback in the coming year, primarily led by a likely attempt by the government to address demand-side issues by the Union Budget,” said Vinay Pandit, Head of Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh.

In the auto and auto ancillary space, Maharashtra Scooters and Bajaj Auto emerged chart toppers of 2019, delivering 39 per cent and 18 per cent returns, respectively. Varroc Engineering, Force Motors, Minda Corporation, M&M, Jamna Auto, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp and Ashok Leyland destroyed investors wealth, as they cracked 20-42 per cent during this period.



“Metals as a sector signalled an early trend reversal ahead. Globally, copper prices have confirmed an intermediate low and trend reversal in the Shanghai index provides an early signal on inter-market analysis. Hindalco and Tata Steel could see up to 15-20 per cent upside from current levels,” said Manav Chopra, CMT, Head of Equity Research at Indiabulls Ventures.

The 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 15 per cent between January 1 and December 20 this year, while the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 4 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.

Among other sectoral indices on BSE, Realty, Consumer Durables indices and Bankex advanced over 20 per cent each. Telecom, IT, TECk, Oil & Gas indices gained 8-13 per cent.

“We find private sector banks, pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors interesting. Private banks should benefit from lower cost of funds, better asset quality and consolidation in the industry,” said Vikaas Sachdeva, CEO, Emkay Investment Managers.

Sachdeva said domestic pharma companies have settled down after the GST-led inventory disruptions. “Also, we believe the USA generic price erosion seems to be settling down. Going forward, price erosion may not be as pronounced as we saw in the past,” he said.

In the pharma space, shares of Astrazeneca Pharma, Abbott India and Pfizer rallied 50-92 per cent between January 1 and December 20, 2019. Dishman Carbogen Amcis, Wockhardt, Glenmark Pharma slipped over 50 per cent each during the same period.

ICICI Bank (up 51 per cent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 35 per cent), AU Small Finance Bank (up 29 per cent) and HDFC Bank (up 22 per cent) were among the top gainers in the private banking space. However, YES Bank, RBL Bank, IDBI Bank and The Karnataka Bank cracked 36-80 per cent.

Sunil Jain, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang Securities, hopes to see a revival in real estate, auto and capital goods sectors. Shares of Prestige Estate Projects, Godrej Properties, Phoenix Mills, DLF and Sunteck Realty gained 20-58 per cent year to date in the real estate space. On the other hand, NBCC, Indiabulls Real Estate and Omaxe declined 25-40 per cent.

“Pharma sector valuations have corrected and the sector is now trading in line with Nifty. Pharma exports are likely to improve from current levels whereas the chemicals sector, especially specialty chemicals, is gaining traction as global majors are looking at domestic companies as additional or alternative to Chinese companies for sourcing,” said Srinivas Rao Ravuri, CIO-Equity, PGIM India Mutual Fund.

He is betting on pharma, chemicals and utilities for 2020.

Among chemicals stocks, Fine Organic Industries jumped 65 per cent during the year gone by. It was followed by Deepak Nitrite (up 61 per cent), Navin Fluorine (up 40 per cent) and Pidilite Industries (up 24 per cent). However, Himadri Chemicals, Nocil, SH Kelkar, Gujarat Alkalies and Jubilant Life slipped between 25-57 per cent.

Most analysts are bullish on private sector lenders. “We have been positive on private sector financials due to their relatively stronger credit growth and asset quality (than PSU counterparts). Also, banks will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

Suhas Harinarayanan, Head of Institutional Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities said, “Financials and pharma should do well.”

Ajit Mishra, VP for Research at Religare Broking, believes companies in the banking and NBFC segments have shown signs of improvement with regard to assets quality, declining NPA as well as slippages. In addition, measures taken by the government and RBI to lower interest rates, cut corporate tax, ease FDI norms, lower GST rates and recapitalise PSU banks are definitely positives for the sector.

“We would be selective in this sector and stick to large private banks owing to better asset quality, consistent financial performance and good market share gains,” Mishra said.

		}From Modi victory to YES Bank mess: Here's what drove Dalal Street in 2019 of 15NextPrevPlay SlideshowThe year that was25 Dec, 2019Calendar 2019 was full of major events that changed the direction of the market. The year witnessed a general election, the tussle between the RBI and the government, slowing economic growth and a massive corporate tax rate cut. Here's a lowdown of all the major happenings of this year: NextModi’s victory25 Dec, 2019General elections in May was perhaps the biggest event of 2019. Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party won the largest democratic election in the world to secure next five years at the Centre.

On May 20, the first session after the exit polls came out, Sensex jumped 3.75 per cent or 1,422 points, as they signalled a clear majority for the Narendra Modi-led Bhartiya Janta Party. However, on the result day, i.e. May 23, when the win was confirmed, Indian equity markets saw profit booking as Sensex shed 0.76 per cent. NextCorporate tax rate cut25 Dec, 2019Certainly among the most important events of the year was the corporate tax cut. On September 20, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced to reduce corporate tax rates to an effective 25.17 per cent resulting in the biggest point-wise jump for benchmark indices in 10 years. Sensex and Nifty rallied about 3,000 and 1,000 points, respectively, within two sessions.
 NextRBI windfall to govt25 Dec, 2019After a long tussle and resignation of an RBI governor over the issue, the Reserve Bank of India accepted the recommendations of the Bimal Jalan committee and agreed to transfer Rs 1.76 lakh crore for 2018-19 to the government from its reserves. This gave a major boost to the government's coffers that were already constrained.

Both parties were fighting over the level of reserves that RBI was supposed to keep for contingencies. NextGDP growth at over 6-yr low25 Dec, 2019India’s GDP growth rate for the September quarter plunged to 4.5 per cent, the lowest in over six years. All spheres of the economy are experiencing a slowdown. Thanks to the fall in demand, manufacturing activities have also perished. In fact, core factory output has been in negative territory for the last three months in a row. Next"
