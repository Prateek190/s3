68,2018-01-12,Reddy,"MUMBAI: The third-quarter earnings season is getting underway but the usual social media chatter about upcoming results is muted. This follows the markets regulator cracking down on WhatsApp groups over the accusation that inside information was exchanged among their members.

Such chat groups have been information-sharing hubs for brokers, analysts, traders, journalists and portfolio managers for years. Many have now shut while others have seen mass exits.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) recently seized laptops and mobile phones of 34 dealers and brokerage analysts to discover the source of earnings leaks before the numbers were sent to the bourses.

Some of the individuals belonged to the Market Chatter WhatsApp group, which is said to have posted results of companies well before they were released by the exchanges.

ET spoke to about a dozen market participants who have either been administrators or members of such WhatsApp groups. None of them wanted to be named.



In the past five years, such chat groups had become clearing houses for company-related information, both confirmed and unsubstantiated, they said. A sensitive item posted on one group could spread like wildfire as most analysts and traders were on multiple groups. Those remaining in such WhatsApp groups are now scrupulously refraining from posting any sensitive information.

“There is not much chatter these days and people have become cautious,” said the head of research at a leading Mumbai-based brokerage.

Brokers and analysts said they are no longer sure what may be regarded as sensitive information. A trader who was the administrator of a WhatsApp group said the trust factor was low.

“Earlier, people were happy when information that is posted on one group spread. Now, there is a big fear factor. Nobody trusts each other these days,” the person said.

Compliance Depts Waking up to Dangers

The investigation began after Reuters reported that earnings of some major Indian companies including Dr Reddy's were circulated in WhatsApp groups of traders before the results were officially declared. The leaks also pertained to Cipla, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Wipro, Bajaj Finance, Mahindra Holidays and Resorts and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals among others, Reuters had reported.

The regulatory scrutiny has led to compliance departments of financial services firms waking up to the dangers of information sharing on social media. At some of them, analysts and broking departments have been told to avoid any market-related discussions on WhatsApp.

“We have been unofficially told to remain safe and better to avoid such groups,” said an institutional sales trader with a mid-sized brokerage who shut a WhatsApp group recently. Some said the regulator should also be looking instead at insiders who leak the data in the first place and that the move had led to even legitimate information flows drying up.

“The concern should be on insider trading and not distribution of information. Sebi has cracked down on insider trading but side effect has resulted in stoppage of information circulation,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. “Information circulation with proper disclaimers attached must be allowed by Sebi.”

How the regulator deals with such leaks could change the nature of communications within the broking and analyst communities. Some experts questioned whether clamping down on informationsharing platforms such as WhatsApp would be effective. “The law remains the same — if you leak inside information you are liable. However, getting evidence is tough in the case of WhatsApp forwards,” said Sandeep Parekh, partner, Finsec Law Advisors.

JN Gupta, founder of Stakeholder Empowerment Services and former Sebi executive director, said that with the advent of social media and electronic systems, surveillance and apprehension of wrongdoers in the securities market had become more challenging."

83,2018-01-21,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Fireworks continued on Dalal Street last week, and the domestic equity market settled at yet another peak on Friday, logging gains for the seventh straight week.

The government’s decision to reduce additional borrowing by 60 per cent, coupled with speculation about 100 per cent FDI in private banks, better-than-expected results of India Inc and firm global cues helped the bulls smash one record after another through the week.

Here’s a look at the top events/factors that may influence market in the coming week:

Next set of Q3 earnings
Next batch of quarterly results will be unveiled in the coming week. Among prominent names, Asian Paints and Axis Bank will release their Q3 numbers on Monday, January 22, Indiabulls Housing Finance will report its results on Tuesday, January 23. Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Maruti Suzuki India on Thursday, January 25.


Countdown to Union Budget
Some jitters and nervousness may creep in as the countdown to the Union Budget begins. The Budget Session of Parliament is set to commence on January 29 and the Budget for 2018-2019 will be presented on February 1. President Ram Nath Kovind will address the joint sitting of the two Houses on January 29 and the Economic Survey will be tabled on the same day.


New kids on the block
Newgen Software and Amber Enterprises India are likely to list on bourses next week. Both the companies concluded their IPOs (initial public offerings) during the week gone by. While Newgen was overall subscribed 8.25 times, Amber issue saw 165.42 times subscription.


ONGC to buy govt stake in HPCL
In a major development, Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) agreed to acquire the government’s entire 51.11% stake in Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) for about Rs 37,000 crore in an all-cash deal that would close by the month end. The stocks are likely to react to it when trading resumes on Monday.


F&O expiry to add volatility
Trading could be volatile next week as traders roll over positions in the futures & options (F&O) segment from the near-month January series to February series. The January 2018 derivatives contract expires on Thursday, 25 January 2018.


Tech charts show rally to continue
The Nifty50 formed a strong bullish candle on the daily as well as weekly charts. The index managed to close above the upper Bollinger Bands on both daily and weekly charts. Bollinger Bands are a highly popular technical analysis technique developed by famous technical trader John Bollinger. This shows great possibility of the uptrend continuing, but the overbought nature of the lead indicators will require market participants to remain vigilant at higher levels, said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.


US govt shutdown
Markets across the globe, including India, may see some volatility on the shutdown of the US government. US President Donald Trump and the US Congress failed to meet a Friday midnight deadline to pass a short-term bill to extend federal funding, forcing some government facilities to shut down. In shutdowns, non-essential government employees are furloughed, or placed on temporary unpaid leave. Workers deemed essential, including those dealing with public safety and national security, keep working, said Reuters.


Global cues to watch
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision on Tuesday, January 23. The central bank is widely expected to keep the rates unchanged, however, the discussion could be interesting, given the shifting sands in central banking, say media reports. This apart, European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy statement and press conference is slated on Thursday, January 25."

129,2018-01-30,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: A day after hitting fresh record highs, the domestic benchmark indices took a breather on Tuesday, as Sensex and Nifty fell around 0.70 per cent, owing to sustained profit-booking across sectors on the back of global sell-off.

Profit booking along with a weak trend in other Asian markets following overnight losses on Wall Street dented market mood back home.

Investors remained cautious awaiting the outcome of the US Federal Reserve’s two-day policy review, which begins today.

The hopes and fears around the Union Budget, which is to be announced this Thursday also kept market on the tenterhooks.

“Shares witnessed selling pressure as investors took to booking profits after the recent rally. Additionally, caution ahead of the Budget and tepid global markets, further exacerbated the weakness in the market. All the sectoral indices on the NSE traded in the red, with IT and banking stocks, leading the pack of losers,” said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, Senior Fund Manager – Equities, BNP Paribas MF.

Shares of Reliance Communications hogged the limelight after the scrip zoomed on the back of the operator narrowing its loss by 95 per cent in the December quarter after it shut down its consumer business.

IT stocks figured among the top losers of the day. However, while all IT stocks plunged, shares of KPIT Technologies jumped 5 per cent on reports that CK Birla Group-owned Birlasoft and KPIT Technologies will merge together to create a $700 million company, which will then split into two publicly-traded companies, that will create two specialised IT players.

This is Swati verma and I will get you today's market wrap, complete with all cues and views from seasoned analysts and those who matter.

Market participants decided not to fall for any bait and wait for the Union Budget tomorrow for clarity. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will have to do a tough balancing act when it comes to fiscal deficit. Key equity indices turned lower.

Havells saw the maximum jump in open interest at 64.29 per cent. Arvind and Escorts came up next, in that order.

5,2018-02-01,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty closed steady on Thursday, but only after a big scare that saw the indices take a big plunge for a while and then come back. 

The fears had mostly to do with the government's decision to go in for long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on equities and retaining the STT.

The market's worst fears came true as soon as the Finance Minister announced the levy of LTCG in his Budget speech. Unnerved, the BSE Sensex dived as much as 400 points, but quickly got into shape as the finance secretary cleared the air subsequently. 

An (LTCG) tax of 10 per cent on stock market gains exceeding Rs 1 lakh kicks in while short-term capital gains tax stayed at 15 per cent.

Fiscal slippage was another factor that soured mood. 

The Nifty50 index settled 11 points down at 11,017, while Sensex declined 58 points to close at 35,907 on Thursday.The Finance Minister indicated that fiscal deficit was likely to slip to 3.5 per cent of GDP from his target of 3.2 per cent for the ongoing financial year and might be around 3.3 per cent of GDP, roughly around Rs 5.95 lakh crore, for the next financial year. 

The Union Budget for 2018-19 gave special emphasis to agriculture, healthcare, education and infrastructure. Out of total 50 stocks in the Nifty50 index, 27 closed the day in the green while 23 settled in the red.

Auto stocks remained among the top gainers of the day. Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra topped the Nifty chart after its January sales rose 32 per cent in volume over the same month last year.

Eicher Motors rose after it reported a 51 per cent growth in trucks and buses sales for January.

Shares of tyre major MRF spiked over 5 per cent after the company today reported an 18.1 per cent rise in its standalone net profit. 

Aviation majors InterGlobe Aviation, Jet Airways and SpiceJet hit it big after the Budget indicated that the government is planning to expand airport capacity by 5 times to handle 1 billion trips a year.

Barring FMCG, auto and metal, all sectoral indices settled in the red on the NSE on Thursday.

Pharma stocks suffered. Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin fell up to 4.22 per cent.

""Failed Impurities/Degradations specifications; out-of-specification results observed for Total Degradation Impurities during stability.""

The product was manufactured at the drug maker's Srikakulam plant in Andhra Pradesh.

The drug is being recalled under ""not yet classified"" category which, according to the FDA, means that a firm's action meets the definition of a recall, however, the FDA has not completed its assessment of the hazard posed by the recalled product(s) yet, and is considered a pending classification.

""Once FDA completes the hazard assessment, the Enforcement Report entry will be updated with the recall classification (Class I, II or III) indicating the hazard posed by the recalled product(s),"" said FDA.

Meanwhile, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals in a separate letter also initiated voluntary recall of 5,136 tunes of its Mometasone Furoate Cream, USP, 0.1 per cent 45gm from the US market due to violations of the CGMP (current good manufacturing practice) regulations set up by the USFDA.

75,2018-02-24,Reddy,"MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has directed HDFC Bank to conduct an internal probe into the leakage of financial results before their disclosure to stock exchanges. The capital markets regulator has asked the country’s largest bank by market value to take action against those responsible for the leak and strengthen its internal processes. Sebi is investigating the leak of the bank's earnings, which were doing the rounds on WhatsApp groups, operated by market traders, before the results were announced.

The regulator, in an order on Friday, asked HDFC Bank to investigate the role of persons with access to this information in the leaks. The probe will involve those preparing board notes and presentations. Also, people consolidating figures and dissemination of information relating to financial results in the public domain should be investigated, the regulator said.

Sebi has also sought an inquiry into the members of committees involved in generation of key figures including gross non-performing assets (GNPA). The regulator has directed the bank to complete its inquiry within a period of three months.

HDFC Bank is one of the 12 companies whose financial results were leaked on WhatsApp.

The regulator said its preliminary examination showed that the messages circulated in WhatsApp groups almost matched the quarterly financial results of HDFC Bank for June 2017, which were published subsequently.

Sebi said such resemblance of the information circulated in the WhatsApp groups with the actual financial results prime facie indicates that the results of HDFC Bank for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were in circulation prior to official announcement. Sebi's probe showed the gross non-performing assets figure that was published on the WhatsApp groups was 1.25%, while the actual results showed 1.24%. The profit after tax of ?3,900 crore, which was on the WhatsApp groups, almost matched the actual figure of ?3,893.84 crore. The results were available on the social media group on July 21, 2017, while the bank announced the results on July 24.

“The same could not have been possible without leakage of information from the persons, who were privy to the information relating to financials prior to its official announcement,"" said whole-time member Madhabi Puri Buch in the order.

Sebi said at this stage, the source and the origin of the leakage of unpublished price sensitive information cannot be ascertained.

“Such leakage is prima facie attributable to the inadequacy of the processes/controls and systems that HDFC Bank as a listed company had put in place,” the order said.

Last year in November, Reuters reported that financial results of some of the major Indian companies, including Dr Reddy's, were circulated in WhatsApp groups of traders just before the companies officially declared the results.

Other companies whose financial results were leaked include Cipla, Tata Steel, Wipro, Bajaj Finance, Mahindra Holidays and Resorts and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals. Last year in December, Sebi conducted a ‘search and seizure’ operation with the help of Mumbai police on 34 individuals who are dealers and research analysts with various leading broking firms."
76,2018-02-25,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Pharma major Dr Reddy's today said it has received the establishment inspection report (EIR) from the US Food and Drug Administration for its its formulations facility in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh.

The company, without mentioning the contents of the EIR, said the USFDA has maintained OAI (Official Action Indicated) status at its API manufacturing plant in Srikakulam.

The US drug regulator has asked the company for more details, it said.

""FDA has asked us for more details. We are providing those details and continuing to engage with FDA for resolution of pending issues,"" Dr Reddy's said in a regulatory filing.

An OAI status is equivalent to finding of objectionable conditions at the audit site and also an indicative of regulatory and/or administrative sanctions by FDA.

The USFDA issues an EIR to an establishment that is the subject of an FDA or FDA-contracted inspection when the agency decides to close the inspection.

In April 2017, the company had informed about completion of the audit at its API manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh and issuance of two observations by the US drug regulator.

Dr Reddy's had said that it was addressing those issues."

117,2018-02-28,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: 
After the exclusion of Aurobindo Pharma, it seems that the weightage of pharmaceutical sector in the Nifty50 could slide further this year.


A study by Centrum Broking on potential Nifty50 
exits suggested that three pharma names Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Lupin could be shown the door in the forthcoming index reviews.


Aurobindo
Pharma would cease to be a Nifty50 component from April 2.

""The removal of 
Aurobindo Pharma from Nifty reflects the ongoing pharma sector downturn resulting in only 4 pharma stocks Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and Lupin remaining in Nifty50, with aggregate weightage of mere 3.2 per cent,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, with Bajaj Finserv's entry, the NSE barometer will feature 11 stocks from BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector. This will take BFSI stocks weightage in the index to 33.7 per cent from 33.3 per cent at present, the brokerage said.

Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc, JSW Steel, Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Motherson Sumi are some of the stocks that have potential to be a part of Nifty50 going ahead.

Piramal Enterprises MRF, Shriram Transport Finance and Shree Cement are a few other potential Nifty50 stocks.

The 
index is a diversified 50-stock index, which accounts for 12 sectors of the economy. The index reconstruction after considering several criteria such as the free-float market caitalisation of the company, average impact cost during the last six months, trading frequency and so on.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects Hindustan Zinc to deliver healthy volumes going ahead to strong management focus, investment in drilling and human resources. ""We maintain a bullish zinc price outlook and expect LME to average at $3,800/t in FY19 and little lower at $3,200/t in FY20. Ebitda is expected to increase 45-50 per cent, driven by volume growth, cost reduction and favorable LME,"" the brokerage said.

Another brokerage JM Financial likes JSW Steel given its lowest conversion cost and premium realisation for its products against products of peers. ""We factor in Ebitda per tonne at Rs 8,500/8,700 for FY19E/20E, respectively. We roll forward to FY20 to arrive at our SOTP fair value of Rs 300 per share,"" the brokerage said

Changing the IBC Code
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code review panel called for sweeping changes in the law aimed at easing insolvency rules for small enterprises and providing relief to home buyers by treating them as financial creditors while deeming the amount raised from them for real estate projects as financial debt.The committee proposed that promoters of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) who are not wilful defaulters should be allowed to bid during the insolvency process. If adopted, that would vastly improve the prospects of such companies being acquired and revived, thus saving jobs, instead of going into liquidation.

9,2018-04-08,Reddy,"The troubled pharma sector is expected to report weak Q4FY18 numbers, with PAT likely to decline by 9 per cent (year-on-year) and appreciation in rupee may put pressure on realisations, industry analysts said.

""We estimate the pharma sector to report weak Q4FY18 numbers - while revenue is likely to grow at 3 per cent y-o-y, PAT is expected to decline 9 per cent y-o-y. We expect US revenue to dip 2 per cent y-o-y in constant currency (cc) - five consecutive quarters of decline - led by sustained pricing pressure due to customer consolidation and rise in competition,"" Edelweiss research analyst Deepak Malik told PTI here.

The rupee appreciation of 4 per cent y-o-y against the USD will put further pressure on realisations. However, this is likely to be partly offset by rupee depreciation against the Euro/Rand/Yen by 11 per cent, 6 per cent and 1 per cent y-o-y, Malik said.

We forecast domestic sales to grow 11 per cent y-o-y on a low base, he said.

While pricing controls keep the operating environment tough in the domestic market, pharma companies with strong brands in the OTC (over the counter) category are better placed to ride the slowdown.

Besides, earning growth also affected by waning new products approvals by USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration), which declined drastically during Q4FY18 to 109 from 249 in Q3FY18 due to additional documentation requirements for elemental impurities.

On the regulatory front, USFDA inspections of Cadila's Moraiya unit in Ahmedabad and Natco's Mekaguda unit were favourable, while Aurobindo's Hyderabad unit-IV, Cipla's Goa, Dr Reddy's Telangana and Sun Pharma's Halol units received observations, Malik added.

Indian pharmaceutical sector is estimated to account for 3.1 - 3.6 per cent of the global pharmaceutical industry in value terms and 10 per cent in volume terms. It is expected to grow to USD 100 billion by 2025. The market is expected to grow to USD 55 billion by 2020, thereby emerging as the sixth largest pharmaceutical market globally by absolute size.

Branded generics dominate the pharmaceuticals market, constituting nearly 80 per cent of the market share in terms of revenues.

The country's pharmaceutical exports stood at USD 16.8 billion in 2016-17 and are expected to grow by 30 per cent over the next three years to reach USD 20 billion by 2020, according to the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil)."

“Market gained momentum as yields slid after RBIs open market operation, while rupee weakened further due to higher oil prices.

17,2018-05-08,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: It was a one-sided show on Dalal Street on Monday, as the bulls completely outsmarted the bears amid firm global cues and heavy buying on select bluechip counters such as RIL, ICICI Bank and ITC.

The 30-share Sensex pack of BSE gained 293 points, or nearly 1 per cent, to settle at 35,208, while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) reclaimed the key 10,700 level to close the session at 10,715, up 97 points or 0.92 per cent.

However, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on as many as 57 stock counters on NSE.

MACD is a tool used to identify trend reversals.

Stocks that saw bearish crossovers included Dr Reddy's Labs, Wockhardt, NIIT Technologies, Tata Elxsi, Cadila Healthcare, and Apollo Hospitals. Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Among others, Den Networks, Jubilant Life Sciences, PNB Housing Finance, SPARC, HT Media, and Essel Propack have also witnessed bearish crossovers.



MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the 'signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD breaches below the signal line, it sends out a bearish signal, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward movement and vice versa.

However, MACD alone may not be sufficient to take an investment call. Traders should make use of other tools such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm such a trend.

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers on 35 counters on NSE, signalling potential upside for these stocks. They included Tata Steel, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, NCC, Adani Transmission and JK Paper, among others.



The Nifty50 on Monday formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. If the index breaks above 10,780, it could kick off a major rally, analysts said.

The index recouped losses seen in the previous two sessions. The fast retracement indicated bullish sentiment, says Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities, who believes any sustainable move above the key resistance at 10,730 will lift Nifty further towards 10,780 and 10,800 levels.


Understanding MACD


A close look at the Wockhardt chart shows that whenever the MACD strip has gone beyond the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

The stock closed 7.71 per cent lower at Rs 740.80 on Monday."

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here's a look at the key events that are likely to influence market in the coming week:

Next batch of Q4 earnings
Among notable names, Colgate-Palmolive (India), Just Dial and Mahanagar Gas are scheduled to announce their March quarter results on May 21, 2018. Andhra Bank, Bata India, Cipla, Dr Reddy's Labs, IOC and State Bank of India are expected to unveil their score cards on May 22, 2018.

Bank of Baroda, BEML, Cadila Healthcare, Engineers India, Hindustan Copper, NBCC, Sun Pharma and Tech Mahindra are slated to announce results on Friday.


BJP’s Karnataka debacle
Analysts say market may see a knee-jerk reaction to BJP’s Karnataka debacle when trading resumes on Monday. In a dramatic turn of events, BS Yeddyurappa, who took oath as the Chief Minister on Thursday, resigned on Saturday, after he failed to secure the magic number of 112 required to form the government. 

 G Chokkalingam, founder and CEO, Equinomics Research & Advisory said it was just a political setback and it may not have any major implication for the market.

 ""What matters to the market is whether the ruling government will come back to power in 2019. To that extent, BJP has already doubled its seats in Karnataka. The outcome will have only a knee-jerk reaction,"" Chokkalingam added.


Indostar Capital listing
NBFC Indostar Capital Finance, which recently concluded its initial public offer, will make stock market debut on Monday.

The Rs 1,844-crore IPO was subscribed 6.80 times during May 9-11. The price band of the offer was fixed at Rs 570–572 with a face value of Rs 10 per share. Indostar is mainly into offering structured term financing solutions to companies and loans to SME borrowers.


Crude prices
Oil prices posted their sixth straight weekly gain after touching $80 a barrel earlier this week. However, both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude slipped in Friday’s trade, paring weekly gains. 

 Global prices have been supported this week by concerns over US sanctions against Iran, shrinking stockpiles and production shortfalls in Venezuela, Bloomberg reported.

 “Oil prices are in overbought territory, which has prompted some profit taking,” Reuters reported quoting Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

 Spike in oil prices raises India's import bill as the country imports majority of its crude requirements. A weak rupee raises the cost of importing crude oil.

What do the tech charts say
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a robust bearish candle on the daily chart and made lower highs and lower lows for a third straight session. The index made a bearish engulfing formation on the weekly chart, suggesting the possibility of further downside. Analysts say the 50-day moving average around the 10,550 level should act as a major support for the index for now. 

“The market is expected to head lower and traders should not short but wait for lower levels to enter long positions,” said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO at SAMCO Securities.

""As long as it holds below 10,680, weakness could take Nifty towards its next support at 10,550, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,680 and 10,725 levels,"" said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.


Global cues
The minutes to the Federal Reserve’s May monetary policy meeting will be released on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve left its target range for the federal funds rate steady at 1.5-1.75 per cent during its May 2018 meeting, in line with market expectations.

 This apart, the next round of Brexit talks will take place in Brussels on Tuesday. The UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that Britain would leave the EU customs union after Brexit, but a source said London was considering a backstop plan that would apply the bloc’s external tariffs beyond December 2020, Reuters reported."

Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session -

SBI: State Bank of India is slated to release its quarterly results today and brokerages expect the numbers to come in on the weaker side on fresh slippages and higher provisioning. Brokering house Centrum Wealth in its earnings preview said the Rajnish Kumar-led bank is expected to report yet another quarter of loss for January-March. NII (net interest income) is expected to decline by 6 per cent year-on-year to Rs 19,770 crore.


Cipla, Dr Reddy's: Pharma majors Cipla and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories are slated to announce their financial results for the quarter ended March 2018 on Tuesday. Both these companies are expected to report double-digit rise in bottomline figures for the quarter.

Indian Oil Corp: Oil and gas major Indian Oil Corporation is slated to release its March quarter results on Tuesday. The state-owned firm is expected to post strong numbers for January-March period. 


Colgate: Foreign brokerage firm Nomura has downgraded the stock to 'Neutral' with a target price of Rs 1,299 saying Q4 numbers were quite disappointing. CLSA says 4 per cent volume growth for March quarter has been disappointing. It has maintained 'Sell' rating on the stock with target price of Rs 1,120. 


Future Lifestyle Fashions: CLSA has a ‘buy’ rating on Future Lifestyle Fashions with a target price of Rs 535. The firm expects a 23 per cent compounded growth in the company’s operating profit during the FY18-FY21 period, led by robust network additions, particularly in brand factory, and operating leverage benefits. The company’s balance sheet has been on an improving trajectory, said CLSA, adding that it expects return on capital employed to improve to 18 per cent by FY20. The stock ended down 3.83 per cent at Rs 420.50 on Monday.


Tata Chemicals: HSBC has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Tata Chemicals and revised target price to Rs 880 from Rs 812. The business transformation and value unlocking for the company is a work in progress, said the brokerage.

Ashok Leyland: Jefferies has maintained ‘hold’ rating on Ashok Leyland and revised target price to Rs 148 from Rs 133.

The firm expects the up-cycle to continue over FY19-FY20 and has raised its FY19-FY20 revenue estimates by 7-8 per cent to reflect higher base of FY18. However, the stock price already factors much of this, as it is trading at median multiple on likely peak earnings, it said. The stock ended down 9.50 per cent at Rs 134.30 on Monday.


Motilal Oswal: The brokerage firm on Monday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 147.85 crore for the January-March quarter, up 64 per cent from the same period a year ago.

Both companies have been called before the insolvency board on Tuesday to present the resolution proposal for the future of the bankrupt company, multiple sources close to the process told ET.


Reliance Communications: Reliance Communications and its subsidiaries filed pleas in the appellate tribunal to set aside the National Company Law Tribunal’s decision to start insolvency proceedings against them on a petition filed by network vendor Ericsson. The move comes as the Anil Ambani-controlled companies are in talks with Ericsson to settle a long-pending dispute over unpaid dues worth more than Rs 1,000 crore owed to the Swedish telecom equipment maker.


DLF: Realty major DLF's consolidated net profit rose by 66 per cent to Rs 247.73 crore in the fourth quarter of last fiscal despite lower sales. Its net profit stood at Rs 149.14 crore in the year-ago period, the company said in a regulatory filing.

However, it continued to form lower highs and lower lows for last five sessions and needs to negate the same to get short-term stability. Now, it has to hold above 10,550 level to witness a bounce towards 10,625 and then 10,650 levels while on the downside, the 10,480 and 10,440 levels are likely to act as key supports.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was intact at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,000 while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by 11,000.

This is Abhinav Kaul and here is today’s market wrap, plus sharp analyses from the voices who matter.

There was no looking back for the bulls today. They made a steady climb, looking forward to more positives from the Trump-Kim summit.

The path-breaking summit is a proof that both the US and North Korean leaders are willing to walk that extra mile, with ramifications for the rest.

After the talks, the US President said the process of denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula will start ""very soon"".

Global market saw promise, and so did Indian stocks. The Sensex sprinted and hit a high of 35,743. The close came at 35,693 -- an over 4-month high -- up 209 points.

As for the Nifty, the jump was 56 points at 10,843, but not before scaling 10,857.

The upside could have been more, but traders were cautious as they kept track of IIP and CPI inflation print.

In fact, there was a jump in May inflation at 4.87 per cent, as feared by analysts.

April industrial output grew by 4.9 per cent. The official numbers were out after market hours.

Dr Reddy's tank was full as it surged over 5 per cent. The stock was the winner of the 30-share Sensex pack.

SBI, IndusInd Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Hero MotoCorp and TCS ran up too.

The counters that buzzed were FMCG, pharma, IT, auto and financials.

Options data suggest supports are gradually shifting higher and the immediate trading range for next few sessions is likely to be between 10,750 and 10,950.

114,2018-06-16,Reddy,"Indian pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories said today that a US District Court has issued a temporary restraining order on the sale and commercialisation of its generic Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual film in the American market.

It is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence. Dr Reddy's said in a BSE filing that the company remains confident in its legal positions on this patent.

""The court order does not include a prohibition on commercial manufacturing of the product,"" it added.

The company said that following the launch of its generic Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual film in the US market, ""the US District Court for the District of New Jersey has received and reviewed an emergency application from the plaintiffs in the current patent litigation for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against Dr Reddy's"".

The Hyderabad-based firm added that pending a hearing and decision on the injunction application, the court has issued a temporary restraining order against the company for further sales and commercialisation of the product.

""The plaintiffs will be required to post a bond or other security totalling USD 18 million to satisfy any losses or damages incurred by Dr Reddy's during the period of the temporary restraining order,"" it added.

The court has scheduled an expedited hearing of the preliminary injunction for June 28, and a ruling is expected soon thereafter, it added.

The proceeding only involves one patent. The company ""remains confident in its legal positions on this patent and believes it will prevail on the issues raised with respect to the application for injunction,"" Dr Reddy's said.

The company had said yesterday that it has received final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and is launching Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual film, (2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg) -- a generic version of Indivior UK's Suboxone sublingual film in the US market."
115,2018-06-17,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: The global trade wars are back, and this time scarier than before. While the denuclearisation deal between the US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un lifted the market higher last week, the hefty tariffs announced by the former on China, is likely to sour investors' mood.

 Emerging markets remained unscathed after the US Federal Reserve's hawkish tone, and the bulls on Dalal Street showed a great resilience. Last week, the broader NSE index gained 0.46 per cent and BSE posted a weekly gain of 0.50 per cent.

Here are key developments investors might want to look at for the coming week:

Trade 
War Ahoy!
 US President Donald Trump announced late Friday that he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. And Beijing immediately vowed to responded, thus igniting fresh trade war concerns between the two biggest economies. India too joined, as the government decided to increase import tariffs on 30 items from the US amounting to $240 million in response against tariffs imposed by the latter on aluminium and steel imports in March.


Slippery Slope
 The much-talked about Opec meet will be held on June 22 and 23 to review their production agreement. Opec and other exporters including Russia appear poised to ease voluntary production limits, which have helped shrink a global oil glut since they went into effect in January 2017. However, many producers have tapped out and would prefer to hold back supply, which supports prices. Those nations include Venezuela, where output has cratered amid a prolonged economic crisis, and Iran, which is facing renewed US sanctions aimed at cutting off its oil exports, says a CNBC report.
 Opec meetings are closely watched because the producer group pumps about 40 per cent of the world's oil.


Sensex Rejig
 The BSE Sensex composition is all set for a reshuffle on Monday, where Vedanta will replace Dr Reddy's Labs. With Vedanta's inclusion, the weight of metals sector in the benchmark index will increase to 2.6 per cent. The existing metal player in the headline index Tata Steel carries 1.3 per cent weight. Vedanta, too, will have 1.3 per cent weight. On the flip side, the healthcare sector will hit an eight-year low as it stands to lose most in terms of weight (-70 bps to 1.7 per cent), with Dr Reddy's exit. Earlier, in December 2017, Cipla and Lupin were excluded from the benchmark. Now, Sun Pharma will be the only such stock in the benchmark index.


ECB Forum
 A three-day ECB forum on central banking will start on Monday in Sintra, Portugal. The ECB (European Central Bank) in its policy meet last week said it would end asset purchases by the end of the year, but also pledged to keep interest rates at current record lows at least through the summer of 2019. The more dovish-than-expected outlook for borrowing costs weighed on the euro and boosted the dollar. But Sintra speakers will still be listened to because any signs of a European growth setback could complicate the QE exit path, says Reuters in a report. The forum will see the likes of ECB chief Mario Draghi, Bank of Japan’s Kuroda and the US Federal Reserve’s Jerome Powell.


BoE Rate-Setting Meet
 The Bank of England (BoE) will decide on interest rate on Thursday. It is expected to maintain status quo this time. BoE voted by seven to two to keep the bank rate at 0.5 per cent on May 10, due to a sharp slowdown in GDP growth in the first quarter. This apart, Brazil, Mexico, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand and Hungary all have central bank meetings next week.


RITES IPO 
 State-owned RITES (Rail India Technical and Economic Services) is all set to launch its IPO on June 20. The price band of the offer has been set between Rs 180-185 per share with face value of Rs 10 each. At the upper price band of the offer, the company aims to raise Rs 466.2 crore. The three-day public offer will close on June 22, Friday. The IPO is part of the government's disinvestment programme. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced Indian Railways’ plans to list its subsidiaries after the merger of the railway budget with the Union budget.


Tech Charts
 The Nifty50 index on Friday slipped to near 10,750 level in the intraday trade before erasing the losses of entire day to settle in the black, suggesting that the bulls were not in a mood to give in easily.

 On the weekly timeframe chart, the Nifty formed a small-body positive candle with a minor upper shadow. This pattern indicated rangebound movement in the market, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.

 During the week, trading took place in a 138-point narrow range, leaving a dominant upper shadow. It should be a cause for concern, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

 ""Unless the index closes above 10,930, the bulls will not gain an upper hand. A breakout is needed for them to reach safe shores. A close below 10,755 shall re-establish the supremacy of the bears. Traders are advised to remain cautious,” Mohammad said."

120,2018-06-18,Reddy,"Saumen Chakraborty, President and Chief Financial Officer, Dr Reddy's,, tells ET Now, says in last nine years, there would have been a CAGR of 10%, plus and minus a few hundred basis points, for different players in the generic industry.Edited excerpts:


In the last nine years, how has the Indian pharma changed in the US markets?
We can divide the last nine years into 2 parts -- the first five years and the last four years. In these nine years, you would have noticed that the global pharma itself would have shrunk a bit but the generics industry in the first five years of these last nine years have grown very well. It was an exciting time. 

In the last four years, there have been quite a few headwinds. There has been consolidation of customers in the US leading to quite a bit of price erosion. For three consecutive years, the price erosion has been at mid to high teen level. That has put a lot of pressure in the generics industry. 

There have been stringent regulatory compliance norms and some of us have been trying to find out the best way to meet the requirements. There has been a lot of progress on this front. A currency crisis in the emerging markets relating to some problems specifically in countries like Russia and Venezuela, have caused some headwinds in the last four years. Overall, in the last nine years, there would have been a CAGR of 10% plus and minus few hundred basis points for different players in the generic industry.


India’s big pharma has invested a lot over the last nine years. Would they continue to invest to get into new areas over the next nine years as well?
Yes, because there are opportunities. In order to tap the opportunities, you need to invest both in R&D as well as in creating capacity. We have made significant investments going forward. The level of investment in capacity creation is going to settle down or stabilise, it is not going to increase. On an absolute level, I do not think there would be any reduction in R&D because you do that for ensuring growth for the future of the company.


How do you see the next nine years? Do you expect 10% CAGR to continue?
Difficult to speculate for next nine years. One hopes one can get there but it will all depend on the productivity of the R&D and your ability to execute well and meet the regulatory requirements if these three things are taken care of. That kind of growth opportunity could be possible.


US pricing pressure is it at its peak. What is the outlook on the pharma sector in the US markets?
It is very difficult to foresee further consolidation on that basis. With the number of approvals coming through, the market is getting divided into plain vanilla generics and complex generic spaces. There is too much competition in plain vanilla generics and there is not much scope for margin. But in the complex generic space, depending on specific molecules, there would be still opportunities to pursue. If we get approvals on time and execute on your launches quite well, there could be good profits on those specific molecules.


In the previous nine years, R&D was the main investment but do you think going ahead R&D investment and better opex as well as capex for plants will be the differentiator?
Yes, in our industry R&D is the main differentiator. Having said that, you can always supplement organic growth by a few inorganic opportunities. If we can get the right kind of opportunities, that could be more strategic and you can create some synergy. That also provides further growth impetus. R&D will however, continue to be the primary lever. So far as costs, leadership and others is concerned, there has be to continuous focus on that as well as adoption of right kind of technology to get those advantages.


 Lupin is of the view that automation is really the game changer in the sector. Would you agree?
Yes, automation definitely helps. If you really want to get the best quality, you require mistake proofing. That can be done by interlocking or the right kind of automation. It will help improve productivity. That definitely remains a game changer but beyond automation, there is a lot of advancement in artificial intelligence specifically on machine learning that can provide some invaluable insights.


Do you think emerging markets give a good opportunity for Indian pharma players to invest?
For us, US will continue to be the dominant player. We cannot wish it away that but after USA, emerging markets really are a playing field where one can expand. For us, fortunately, Russia, CIS, is the region where we have been for a long time and has established ourselves quite well. We have got good franchise with the doctors, with the distributors, with the local statutory authorities which helps.

In LatAm, in last two, three years, we opened countries such as Columbia, we have re-entered Brazil. If you have good molecules to bank on, then you can be successful in those markets. 

Another very attractive market in emerging markets is China and we have been present there for the last 18 years through a joint venture and we have made a good success of so far. 

China is a country which is going to grow. In terms of growth rate, China and India growth could be potentially even higher than what US provides. If you have presence in emerging markets, it is going to be quite helpful for individual players in the pharma industry.


What about the outlook on Indian pharma considering that there is an increasing awareness of Mediclaim, better hospitals, facilities etc as well? Do you expect pharma to grow into double-digit?
There would be more innovations, not necessarily in the product space but in catering to the patient needs with more personalised medicine and personal healthcare services .

With the evolution of big data space companies who can leverage that and establish better connect with far greater empathy with the patients. These companies will have a competitive edge over others. It would be quite interesting how the Indian market is going to evolve over the next few years."

The global brokerage firm believes the stocks outperformed on the back of improving fundamentals in the US, which include recent good approvals for select companies and early signs of monetisation of R&D initiatives taken over the last 3-4 years. 

Sun Pharma recently said the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its Halol drug plant, which had been under supply restrictions due to quality control failures.

The company will now be able to restart supplies to its largest market, the US, from the Halol facility in western India, which contributed around 15 per cent to the company's US revenue in 2015.

Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Sun Pharma have rallied more than 20 per cent in June so far. Other pharma majors including Cipla, Lupin, Cadila Healthcare, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and Aurobindo Pharma have jumped between 10 and 18 per cent in the same period.

“Stocks that are well positioned include Sun Pharma for its specialty pipeline in US, Torrent for its India positioning and Dr Reddy's as a high risk/high reward trade,” said CLSA.

During May 2015-2018, Nifty Pharma index plunged 35 per cent with stocks falling up to 45 per cent. Limited new product launches in the generics space, GST introduction and higher costs associated with regulatory compliance also affected the sector during the period.

Some analysts see pharma as a good contra play in the current environment. Siddhartha Khemka, VP, Head of Research, MOSL, told ET Now, “If someone is looking from a contra perspective, pharma fits in that place perfectly well. The only challenge here is when they would start performing. We have seen bouts of performance from news flows coming in. But it is very difficult for an analyst to predict as and when the sector would come out of the woods.”"
150,2018-06-25,Reddy,"CLSA is bullish on Sun Pharma, Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's Laboratories in the pharmaceutical space. 

The firm believes the recent rally in the sector is different as it is coming off on the back of improving fundamentals in the US, which include good approvals for select companies, enriched commentary on US pricing and progress on resolving regulatory issues. 

""Improving visibility in the US and normalisation in India along with ongoing cost control measures give us confidence that 21% YoY growth in adj profits for our coverage universe is achievable,"" said CLSA. 

The firm said stocks that are well positioned include Sun Pharma for its specialty pipeline in the US, Torrent for its India positioning and Dr Reddy’s as a high-risk, high-reward trade.

CLSA is positive on the outlook for Lupin, Cipla and Glenmark as well."

There was also a regulatory hiccup when the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) of Germany audited"" Dr Reddy's formulation unit 2 at Bachupally here, the company said in its latest annual report.

Prasad is also the CEO of the pharma company.

The companys management has accepted several challenging goals for FY2019 which include better plant management, an unwavering focus on institutionalising best-in-class manufacturing and quality practices, the report said.

Bringing about greater efficiency in Research and Development and product development, and driving hard to perform better in sales in the USA, Europe, India and the emerging markets were also among the challenges, it said.

The total revenues of the company in FY18 was pegged at Rs 14,203 crore.

14,2018-07-08,Reddy,"MUMBAI: The pharmaceutical industry is likely to report a 17 per cent revenue growth in the June quarter, driven by strong domestic growth and currency tailwinds, said a report.

""Domestic sales are likely to spike 26 per cent on the back of a low base due to GST-related disruption,"" it added.

The US sales in constant currency is expected to grow 6 per cent in annual terms, but fall 2 per cent in quarterly terms, on lack of any meaningful launch during the June quarter, according to the report.

Currency tailwinds, namely the rupee's 4 per cent depreciation against the US dollar and 11 and 5 per cent fall against the euro and yen, respectively, are likely to drive EBITDA margin expansion of 350 bps in annual terms and 100 bps in quarterly terms in the June quarter, it said.

Edelweiss Securities said that the optimism is on favourable regulatory environment.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval rate rebounded to 198 nods after a temporary hiatus in the March quarter, with 109 approvals due to extra documentation requirements for elemental impurities, the report revealed.

Following the recent USFDA clearance of Sun Pharma's Halol plant, the report said piled-up filings are expected to keep the approval rate buoyant for domestic pharma companies.

""On the regulatory front, favourable inspections at Cadila's topicals plant, Dr Reddy's Medak, Srikakulam SEZ, UK, and Sun Pharma's Halol plant demonstrate that the worst in terms of regulatory issues is over,"" it said.

40,2018-07-13,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: A likely flash of brilliance may not just be enough for this sector to win over analysts. 

Pricing challenges remain, but the good part is regulatory environment is improving for the pharma sector. The industry is expected to make an earnings rebound in the June quarter -- up to 50 per cent surge in net profit -- largely driven by a low base and rupee tailwinds. 

If analysts are to be believed, this sector is up for a gradual comeback in FY19, but the current valuation may not be that compelling to go long-term bullish on the space.


50% spike in Q1 profits?Edelweiss Securities expects the sector to report a jump of 17 per cent in revenues and nearly 50 per cent in profits. Motilal Oswal Securities, whose pharma universe bounced back in January-March following four consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings decline in 2017, is seeing 44 per cent profit growth.

Phillip Capital sees its pharma universe reporting 42 per cent YoY growth in earnings on a 12 per cent rise in revenues growth. This brokerage noted that the ANDA approvals rate in the three months to June improved to 200, from 112 in the preceding quarter, even as the quarter witnessed only a few new launches by domestic drug makers. 

The brokerage is positive on Biocon, Cipla, Divi's Labs, IPCA Lab and Sun Pharma, and negative on Glenmark and Lupin as far as quarterly earnings go.

The earnings recovery hinges on bottoming out of pricing pressure in the US market, but the worst, insofar as earnings are concerned, is over for the healthcare sector, Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Large cap drug makers may take a lead, thanks to regulatory resolutions, moderating price erosion and new product launches in the second half of the financial year, said HDFC Securities. The brokerage is expecting pharma stocks under its coverage to report first double-digit revenue growth in six quarters.


Pricing pressure loomsIn case of price erosion, analysts feel that significant price erosion may happen only for drugs where there are fewer than three manufacturers. Besides, they feel that the government many bring in more life-saving drugs under the DPCO (Drug Price Control Order) ambit ahead of state and general elections.

""Lowering drug prices by adding drugs to DPCO is expected to gain a favour of citizens during the 2018 state and 2019 general elections. The impact of adding new drugs to DPCO is to lower both the revenues and profits of pharma companies whose drugs may be added to DPCO,"" said Karvy Stock Broking.


Regulatory issues easingThe recent favourable inspections at Sun Pharma's Halol plant, Cadila's facility and Dr Reddy’s Medak, Srikakulam SEZ and UK facilities demonstrate that the worst in terms of regulatory issues is over, said Edelweiss Securities.


Rupee depreciationDuring the June quarter, the rupee depreciated 3.8 per cent against the dollar and 12.7 per cent against the euro. It though appreciated against three BRICS currencies Russian Ruble, Brazilian Real and South African Rand, which could influence the EM market growth for the firms. 

A 1 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has a benefit of average 1.1 per cent on Ebitda even as hedges and interest payments may trim some of the benefits, BofA-ML said on its coverage stocks.


M&A activity to pace upKarvy expects that the drug makers may resort to divest ANDAs or businesses that lack core competence.

""We strongly believe that divestitures, mergers and acquisitions would be the key driver of growth for the large generic pharma companies in India and the US. Timing of mergers and acquisitions may be uncertain, but will be primarily driven by the level of competition and valuations,"" it said.


ValuationsThe valuation premium pharma stocks have enjoyed in the past over the benchmarks is falling, but analysts largely have mixed views on whether the time is ripe for investors to invest in the sector.

""Consensus downgrades during the June quarter was 7-8 per cent for FY19/20E earnings. The sector trades at 18 times rolling one-year forward earnings, implying a 10.4 per cent premium to Nifty versus 42.5 per cent a year ago,"" Edelweiss said. The brokerage expects Dr Reddy's, Cipla and IPCA to do well.

According to Sharekhan, many frontline stocks are still trading close to their long-term average valuations following sharp downgrade in earnings estimates for the past six quarters. It prefers Biocon, Cadila, Cipla and Sun Pharma as investment options.


What to look atUpdates regarding FDA, key product approvals, management commentaries and the exchange rate would be key in deciding earnings upgrades or downgrades, stated Sharekhan."

42,2018-07-15,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: After months of indecisiveness and dullness, barring some intermittent sparks, the bulls put up a brilliant show during the week gone by.

On a weekly basis, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 2.47 per cent while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) shut shop with 2.28 per cent gains.

Going forward, June quarter earnings, macro data and geopolitical developments will continue to influence investor sentiment.


Here's a lowdown on the key factors that are likely to steer market in the coming week -


June quarter earnings
An action-packed week awaits on the earnings front, as several big names are scheduled to announce their Q1 numbers. FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is slated to release its results on Monday, July 16, while Zee, Crisil and Ashok Leyland will announce theirs on Tuesday, July 17.

Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank will announce their numbers on Thursday, July 19. Wipro, Bajaj Auto, MCX and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company will release theirs on Friday, July 20.


WPI numbers
On the macro front, the government will announce wholesale price inflation (WPI) for June 2018 on Monday, July 16. Wholesale inflation accelerated to a 14-month high in May, driven by a broad-based increase in prices that had spilled over to the retail level as well. WPI rose by 4.43 per cent YoY in May 2018, compared with 3.18 per cent in April and 2.26 per cent a year earlier.


Stock-specific actions
PC Jewellers will remain in focus when trading resumes on Monday after the company on Friday withdrew a May 10 proposal wherein it had announced a plan to buy back shares worth Rs 424 crore from shareholders. Aurobindo Pharma on Saturday said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Apotex's businesses in Czech Republic, Poland, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands for 74 million euro.

This apart, Dr Reddy's Laboratories would be in focus after the New Jersey District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the domestic drugmaker on sale of a generic version of Indivior's prescription medicine Suboxone in the US market.


Trump-Putin meet
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on Monday, July 16. Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine, while Trump has said he would press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 US election to the war in Syria, Reuters reported.


Global cues
China's GDP data for second quarter will be unveiled on Monday, July 16. The Chinese economy expanded 6.8 per cent year-on-year in the quarter ended March 2018, the same pace as in the previous two quarters. Markets will closely monitor the data as the first salvos have been exchanged in a trade war with the United States. It is expected to show growth easing very marginally to 6.7 per cent, says Reuters report. 


Rupee, crude prices
Investors will keep an eye on the movement of the rupee against the US dollar and swings in crude prices.

The rupee on Friday surged to a three-week high of 68.31 before closing marginally up by four paise at 68.53 against the US currency mirroring late losses in stock markets and capital outflows. Oil prices rose on Friday but declined for the week as supply concerns eased. Earlier on Wednesday, crude prices plunged 5 per cent for its worst daily performance in over a year amid trade war tensions and reports the US could consider waivers on sanctions against Iran.


Powell's testimony on July 17
According to a report by Reuters, US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on July 17. ""Powell’s testimony will be closely watched as the Fed tries to navigate towards higher interest rates at a pace that keeps inflation under control but without going so far or fast that it slows the economy,"" the report said.


Tech chart
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a small bearish candle on the daily chart, signalling the possibility of a near-term pause in the ongoing momentum. However, a bullish candle was clearly visible on the weekly chart with a full-fledged breakout above the eight-week consolidation zone, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. Weekly momentum oscillators such as 14-day RSI and ADX are all signalling a sharp upside momentum in the market, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He sees strong resistance for Nifty50 in the 11,170-200 zone in the coming week."

58,2018-07-22,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: No-confidence motion against the Modi government, fresh fall in the rupee, poor macro data in the form of rising inflation as well as widening trade deficit and global trade war tensions influenced market sentiment in the week gone by.

Volatility persisted with equities witnessing see-saw trade, although, in the end bears had the last laugh.

On a weekly basis, the BSE Sensex lost 0.12 per cent while NSE's Nifty50 index shed 0.07 per cent to settle at 36,496 and 11,010, respectively.

Let's take a look at the major factors that are likely to steer market in the week ahead:


Next batch of earnings: A slew of big names are slated to release their Q1 report cards during the week.

ACC, Hindustan Zinc and Granules India are slated to release their numbers on Monday. Asian Paints, Borosil ans Symphony will announce their numbers on Tuesday. BHEL, Canara Bank, HCL Infosystems, Hero MotoCorp and PVR will announce theirs on Wednesday.

Telecom major Bharti Airtel, Biocon, Dr Reddy's, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Power, Tata Coffee and YES Bank are scheduled to announce their June quarter earnings on Thursday. Bank of Baroda, HCL Tech, ICICI Bank, M&M Finance will declare theirs on Friday. 


F&O expiry: Trading is expected to be volatile as traders will roll over positions in the F&O segment from the near month July 2018 series to August 2018 series. The July 2018 F&O contracts will expire on Thursday.

Brokerage Emkay Global in a report said, FII positioning has been reduced, and they have increased their Long position by 59 per cent and have reduced Short position by 21 per cent. Also, Nifty FII long short ratio is 1.15 times against 0.64 times of beginning of July series. FIIs have covered their short positions and decent long position is still there. Considering these, it expects Nifty roll level to go up from here.


GST-linked stocks: The GST Council on Saturday slashed tax rates on a number of products, ranging from paints, white goods to footwears. The Council, headed by Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal, lowered indirect tax slab on products such as paints, leather goods, bamboo flooring, stoves, televisions and washing machines from the highest rate of 28 per cent to mostly 18 per cent.

The tax rate on ethanol blended with petrol, footwear costing up to Rs 1,000 and fertiliser grade phosphoric acid has been cut to from 12 to 5 per cent, Goyal said.

This apart, the minister announced that sanitary napkins will be exempt from GST. Sanitary napkins are taxed 12 per cent tax under the one-year old GST regime, which attracted serious criticism from different quarters.


Rupee: Movement in the rupee will be keenly watched by the investors. On Friday, the currency hit a fresh record low of 69.12 against the US dollar before recovering 21 paise to close at 68.84. Deteriorating domestic macro scenario coupled with global uncertainty shocks could continue to keep the rupee under severe pressure in near term.


Impact of no-confidence vote: Stocks are likely to react positively after the government comfortably defeated the no-trust vote in the Parliament late Friday. The motion was defeated with 325 votes against it while 126 voted in favour.


HDFC AMC IPO: The much-awaited IPO by HDFC AMC will be open for subscription during July 25-27. The company has fixed a price band of Rs 1,095-1,100 per share for its initial public offering (IPO), through which it is estimated to garner Rs 2,800 crore. HDFC AMC operates as a joint venture between Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Standard Life Investments.


ECB policy meet: The European Central Bank (ECB) is slated to meet for monetary policy next week with decision due on Thursday. It is widely expected to leave rates unchanged. Reports say ECB chief Mario Draghi could speak on the ongoing trade spat and its possible impact on both European and global growth during his presser.


US GDP data: The GDP data for the second quarter will be released on Friday. Recent US Federal Reserve minutes highlighted that the US economy continued to look strong. Economists predict GDP expanded at a 4.2 per cent annualised rate, compared with a 2 per cent increase at the start of the year, Financial Times reported. 


Tech chart: The Nifty, in the week gone by, traded in a rangebound manner and ultimately posted a negative weekly close. In terms of the bar patterns, it formed an Inside bar along with a Doji pattern on the weekly chart. This shows indecision in the minds of market participants, say experts.

""The detailed structure shows that the index has formed a flat correction over last few sessions. Alternately, the structure can take the form of a triangular pattern if the consolidation continues going ahead,"" says Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Nevertheless, the outlook continues to be positive from short-term perspective with 11,078-11,100 as a key target area. On the downside, 10,935-10,925, which is the lower end of the consolidation, shall be the crucial support zone to watch out for, Ratnaparkhi says.


Other factors: Progress in the monsoon, global markets trends, trade war tensions, investment by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and crude oil prices movement will also dictate the trend on the bourses next week."

61,2018-07-25,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Stock of Dr Reddy's Laboratories on Wednesday appeared unmoved by reports of AstraZeneca filing a lawsuit against the domestic drug maker in the Delhi High Court.

The legal move is a bid to stop DRL from launching generic versions of Brilinta, AstraZeneca's blockbuster medicine for heart ailments.

The UK biopharmaceutical company claims that the potential launch of the copies infringes one of its existing patents on the drug, ET reported.

At 10 am, Dr Reddy's Laboratories rose 0.22 per cent to Rs 2,080.45. AstraZeneca's Indian arm fell a similar percentage to Rs 1,462.55.

The Delhi High Court asked DRL on Tuesday to file a reply to the lawsuit and will hear its arguments on July 31, said lawyers aware of the developments. Until then, DRL cannot launch the generic version of the drug, they told ET.

Copies of the drug can be manufactured only after all the patents covering it expire, Astra-Zeneca’s counsel argued in the court on Tuesday. The case is making news as DRL has not been seen as an aggressive challenger of drug patents in India.

Brilinta, which is used for reducing chances of heart attacks or strokes by preventing blood clots in vessels, achieved blockbuster status in 2017 when it raked in over $1 billion in global sales for AstraZeneca.

DRL’s generic version was to be marketed as Ticaflo, according to those in the know."

Going ahead, it's going to be a policy week as many major central banks are going to declare their monetary policy. 

Here’s an in-depth look at these and other factors that are likely to steer market this week - 


RBI's rate-setting meetingThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to meet during July 30 to August 1 for the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2018-2019. The six-member monetary policy committee of the central bank headed by Governor Urjit Patel in June meet bit the bullet and hiked the repo rate – the short-term lending rate – by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.

Speculations are rife that the bank will hike interest rates for second time on Wednesday as inflation risks mount. 


Next batch of quarterly earningsCorporate earnings will continue to dominate the Street's proceedings in the coming week. Among notable names, Axis Bank, HDFC, Idea Cellular, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Shree Cement are slated to declare their June quarter results on Monday. Bank of India, Dabur India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Motors and Vedanta will announce theirs on Tuesday. Indiabulls Housing Finance and Marico are expected to unveil their report cards on Thursday. Nestle India and Titan Company will declare theirs on Friday.


US Fed meetUS Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed had hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point in June and indicated that two more increases are likely this year. The move pushed the funds rate target to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.


BoJ and BoEBank of Japan (BoJ) will unveil its interest rate decision on Tuesday. According to a report by Reuters, it might be doing some ‘jinarashi’ i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. BoJ had left its key short-term interest rate unchanged at -0.1 per cent at its June 2018 meeting.

This apart, Bank of England (BoE) will declare its interest rate decision on Thursday. Governor Mark Carney is looking to throw off his “unreliable boyfriend” tag and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 per cent, reports Reuters. BoE left its key bank rate on hold at 0.5 per cent on 21 June 2018.


Auto stocks in focusAutomakers will start releasing their sales numbers for July from Wednesday. Auto firms including cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, reported a higher double-digit growth in sales in June. Auto major Maruti Suzuki India posted a robust growth of 44 per cent in the domestic sales with 1.34 lakh units in June as compared with 93,057 units the same period last fiscal.

The Rs 1,125 crore public offer received bids for 5,79,79,780 shares against the total issue size of 1,09,99,828.

Friday's opening gap remains unfilled, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. “A long bull on the daily time frame chart and a similar candle on the weekly chart indicate strength in the upward move. The weekly momentum oscillator is signalling strengthening of the upside momentum in the Nifty50,” the expert said.


US jobs dataUnited States non farm payrolls data for July will be unveiled on Friday. The country added another 213,000 jobs in June, although the unemployment rate rose to 4 per cent, according to a report by CNBC.

Sustained capital outflows in the wake of weakness in global stocks, triggered by renewed trade war worries between the US and China, roiled domestic market. 

An uptick in US bond yields and strengthening dollar, bolstered by the Federal Reserve's positive assessment of the US economy, fuelled foreign capital outflow.

Global stocks reflected the sombre mood. Major Asian markets declined up to 2 per cent, pressed by the worries of a trade war.


Let's take a look at the key reasons that hit market sentiment today:

RBI's rate hike
Investors sentiment affected by the hike in the key lending rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI on Wednesday hiked its key lending rate by 25 basis points to bring the repo to 6.50 per cent citing upside risks to inflation. As a result, heavy selling in interest-sensitive counters includes auto and banking dragged benchmark equity indices on Thursday.


Concerns over GST revenueMarket participants also remained cautious with a report stating that the goods and services tax (GST) collection rose in July but stayed well below the government's target of Rs 1 lakh crore for the third month in succession of the current financial year (starting April 1). 


Precarious macroeconomic indicatorsThe mood of the markets also remained impacted with RBI Governor Urjit Patel flagging the risks to macroeconomic stability from a potential currency war in the wake of rising global trade tensions.


US Fed moveUS stocks closed mostly lower in the previous trading session after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged but signalled another imminent rate increase. Fresh worries over US-China trade friction too dampened sentiment. Asian equity markets also settled lower with Shanghai, Hang Seng and Nikkei plunged up to 2.30 per cent.


Technical reasonNifty on Wednesday formed a 'Spinning Top' candle on the daily chart suggests that the pace of buying is slowing. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities after the previous trading session said that the index needs to hold above 11,300 for any upside towards the 11,400- 11,435 zone."

Let’s walk you through the key highlights of Friday’s trade


Who moved my SensexReliance Industries continued to be the top drag on the 30-share index for the third straight day. YES Bank, with a loss of 5.11 per cent, emerged as the top loser in the index. This was YES Bank’s fourth consecutive fall. The bank stock plunged on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed CEO Rana Kapoor to continue in his present position till further notice. Analysts said RBI kept the Street guessing on Kapoor’s appointment and the announcement came just a day before his current three-year term was to end. Investors reacted negatively to this uncertainty. 


Rupee refused to recoverRupee touched the 71-mark for the first time. Higher crude oil prices and sustained demand for the US dollar have been adding the rupee’s fall. Trade deficit – mostly because of a spike in oil prices – has been a major reason behind rupee's fall. A widening trade deficit is dragging the rupee down as more imports require India to buy more foreign currencies. 


IT, pharma capitalise on rupee's fallTwo major export-oriented sectors IT and pharma clocked decent gains on Friday on account of a fresh fall in rupee. Since a major part of their sales revenue comes in the US dollar, a fall in rupee means more rupee for them in simple terms. Mindtree (5.92 per cent), Abbott India (up 4.89 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 4.80 per cent), Merck (up 4.03 per cent), Sun Pharma (up 1.99 per cent), Infosys (1.59 per cent) and Divi's Laboratories (up 0.54 per cent) hit fresh 52-week highs. Dr Reddy's Laboratories (up 4.67 per cent), Lupin (up 4.35 per cent), Cadila Healthcare (up 3.73 per cent) and HCL Technologies (up 2.93 per cent) clocked decent gains. 


Spurt in open interest Page Industries witnessed the biggest spike in open interest at 157.86 per cent, followed by YES Bank (66.71 per cent), Mindtree (37.48 per cent), Adani Enterprises (32.05 per cent) and NIIT Technologies (31.43 per cent)


52-week highs and lowsAs many as 58 stocks, including Vardhman Textiles, TD Power Systems, Simplex Infrastructures and S Chand And Company, hit 52-week lows on Friday. On the other hand, 46 stocks, including Infosys, ITC, Nestle India, Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra, Divi's Laboratories and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, hit 52-week highs on NSE.

8,2018-09-03,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Falling for a fourth straight day, the domestic equity market ended on a weak note on Monday on selloff in FMCG and bank stocks and rupee’s plunge to a fresh record low.

India’s stellar GDP data for June quarter failed revive market sentiment as further escalation in US-China trade war worries and persistent pain in emerging market currencies played spoilsport.

The rupee extended weakness as it breached the 71 mark against the dollar to hit a fresh intraday record low on Monday. The domestic unit had opened 22 paise up at 70.78.

Moreover, the Karnataka urban local bodies poll outcome hinted at a likely trend reversal in the voters' preference, as the Congress led by slim margin ahead of the BJP and JDS. This holds crucial importance as key states such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the two BJP strongholds, face elections soon.

BSE Benchmark Sensex dropped 332.55 points to 38,312.52, while the Nifty50 closed at 11,582.35, down 98.15 points.

The 30-share index had opened 271 points higher in today's trade only to reverse gains during the day, witnessing a swing of over 600 points. Sensex on the day witnessed the biggest single-day fall since March.

Only eight stocks in the 30-share index managed to end in the green while the rest settled in the red.

In Nifty50 index, 17 stocks settled in the green while the rest 33 shut shop in the red. Dr Reddy's Labs was the top index gainer and ITC the worst laggard.

In the sectoral space, only metals and media indices managed to end on a firm footing. Meanwhile, FMCG, banking, realty, financials and auto indices dropped over 2 per cent. 


Below are five key factors that weighed on market today:

Easing manufacturing growthIndia’s manufacturing sector activity eased for a second consecutive month in August, mainly on account of slower gains in output and decline in fresh orders, a monthly survey said Monday. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 51.7 in August from 52.3 in July, as operating conditions improved at the slowest pace since May.


Subdued global cuesGlobal shares ended mostly in red on Monday as trade tensions returned to the fore, with Donald Trump eyeing fresh tariffs on a swathe of Chinese goods and NAFTA talks with Canada hitting a wall. Asian peers including Shanghai, Hang Seng, Jakarta, Nikkei, Kospi and Taiwan declined between 0.15 per cent and 1 per cent. 


Rupee below 71-markFalling rupee also turned market participants cautious on Dalal Street. The local currency scaled its fresh all-time low of 71.07 against the dollar during the trade.


Fall in GST collectionsThe Finance Ministry on Saturday revealed that the total gross revenue collection towards the Goods and Services Tax (GST) GST for the month of August amounted to Rs 93,960 crore, down from Rs 96,483 crore last month.


Questions over GDPThe Street was cautious after former finance minister P Chidambaram expressed scepticism over India's GDP growth prospects, saying it would ‘not be so favourable’ in third and fourth quarters, despite the GDP growing at 8.2 per cent in the first quarter. He said the country's growth rate might decline in the third and fourth quarters and be the same as that reported in the last fiscal."

18,2018-09-11,Reddy,"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries spent Rs 1,615 crore on professional, legal and consultancy services in 2017-18, the same as what four of its peers – Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), Cipla, Lupin and Cadila Healthcare – spent together during the financial year. The amount was also more than the profit earned by any of these peers.Nonetheless, Sun Pharma’s Halol plant received four observations (albeit not of serious nature) three months after it received the clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that had ended a two-year import ban. Last week, FDA issued one observation on inspecting Lupin’s Tarapur plant. The company is yet to receive FDA clearance for its plants in Goa and Indore that had received warning letters from the drug regulator in November last year.Besides, last month, Cadila Healthcare’s subsidiary received observations after FDA inspected its plant in Vadodara. In April, Cipla received observations on its Pithampur plant. In March, one of the formulation units of Aurobindo Pharma had received nine FDA observations. At around the same time, DRL had got five observations after FDA inspected its active ingredient facility.Pharma companies spent more on legal and consultancy services than companies in any other industry. An analysis of legal costs of 67 companies from the BSE 100 index shows that six pharma companies together constituted a quarter of the total of Rs 3,597 crore incurred by these companies on legal expenses. Sun Pharma has been the top spending company in the country in three of the past four years.Pharma companies incur costs on hiring consultants for FDA compliance, IPR litigation and M&A – areas that have seen increased action in recent years.The total legal costs of six pharma companies show a sign of stabilising, after having peaked in 2015-16. However, continued adverse FDA observations for pharma companies imply that the costs of resolution of these issues are not coming down. The latest instance of Sun’s Halol plant shows that compliance with regulations is a continuous process and any lapse can result in observations.

A weaker rupee also augurs well for the export-oriented sector. However, a series of regulatory clampdowns have taken the wind out of the sector in recent years, leaving none of the players insulated from regulatory risk that has now become a permanent fixture for companies in the sector. Investors need to increase their risk appetite and temper down expectations of returns from the sector. The worst may be over, but with intermittent jolts from regulatory observations the recovery may still be slow and painful."

26,2018-10-29,Reddy,"While we have been able to retain the market share, on the pricing front, there has been quite a bit of a drop and 
  
  
  that has led to quarter-on-quarter decline, Saumen Chakraborty, President, Chief Financial Officer and Global Head of IT & Business Process Excellence, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

What went wrong in the US business? Did absence of Suboxone sales lead to the decline?
Yes, Suboxone is one which was there in the previous quarter and not there in Q2 but also there are a couple of molecules where there is increased competition and lower price. While we have been able to retain the market share, on the pricing front, there has been quite a bit of a drop which includes molecules like Decitabine or even metoprolol. That had impact where it has resulted in a quarter-on-quarter decline.


Do you expect similar sales in the US or do you have some new launches in the coming quarters which can reset the number?
Already in October, we have announced four launches. More launches are lined up for the year but a significant increase happens only when there is a significant product launch. The Suboxone verdict is awaited and it will be the most important trigger for the US market.


What do you expect in terms of approval? Could you update us on the approval guideline for Copaxone and Nuvaring?
Nuvaring approval will be in the first half of 2019. From our side we have given everything. Now, the US FDA has to approve. So far as Copaxone is concerned, we have given both the DMA and ANDA. We have submitted our comprehensive response. We will have to wait. Further query can be expected. We have to wait for some more time for Copaxone. Suboxone. We will know when the verdict comes. The hearing happened on October 4th and normally there is a 90-days guideline for the court verdict. That means some time from now onwards, till 4th of January we can expect a preliminary verdict to come on Suboxone.


Emerging markets have seen a sharp uptick in sales. Were there some new launches which helped emerging market numbers for the quarter gone by?
We have launched in Russia and it is doing well. There have been good traction in some of the markets beyond Russia, in China and Ukraine. On a year-on-year basis, there is very good traction in Romania because last year in the same quarter, we had a lot of problems in terms of supply to Romania as we had embargo on exporting to Europe including Romania. Since there is no supply problem any more, there has been considerable improvement in Romania as well. 

Overall, the situation is improving in various parts of Emerging Markets including Brazil and other LatAm countries.


Are these sales in emerging markets seasonal or do you expect the run rate to continue?
There would be seasonality in Russia depending on when exactly the winter sets in but overall we remain quite bullish on the markets.


Your R&D spend on a sequential basis has come in marginally lower. Do you expect R&D to be lower or is it a conscious decision?
On a quarter on quarter basis, it is almost similar. There is a difference of only Rs 4 crore -- Rs 416 crore vis-à-vis Rs 412 crore now. But for the year, on an absolute basis, our R&D spend will be similar to what we have spent last year. That means in the second half, R&D is expected to be higher than in first half.


Margins have seen a bump-up. Do you expect this to continue?
Yes. You are right. Both currency as well as ongoing initiatives on cost excellence and productivity improvement is helping but at the same time your overall gross margin for the organisation depends on business mix as well as the product mix. There would be some fluctuations from quarter to quarter. 


What are the plants under the warnings letter? One of your plants is going through some kind of global inspection?
At the Duvvada plant, currently an USFDA audit is going on. I cannot comment any further on that. As far as Srikakulam is concerned, we have given response to all the queries that FDA had. They have come back with one more query which we will be answering soon."
27,2018-10-29,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: An across the board buying pitchforked stock barometer Sensex by over 700 points today, led by pharma, FMCG, financials and IT. 

During the day, the gauge even rallied by more than 800 points. The turnaround came after two straight sessions of losses. 

The NSE Nifty closed firm, up 221 points, at 10,251 while the BSE Sensex rallied 718 points to 34,067. Both posted gains of more than 2 per cent. 

Let's take a look at factors that propelled the market to a higher orbit.


Strong buying in heavyweights: Shares of ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro, State Bank of India, Tata Consultancy Services and Axis Bank saw decent traction today. ICICI Bank surged over 10 per cent, contributing most to the rally in Sensex. Shares of the company jumped after the bank beat Street estimates in its September quarter earnings. The bank posted a 55.84 per cent year-on-year fall in standalone profit at Rs 908.88 crore for the quarter ended September. Analysts in an ETNow poll had estimated the profit figure at Rs 815 crore. 


Bond yield eases: The 10-year bond yield fell significantly in nearly a month by 0.80 per cent to 7.81 per cent on Monday. That came as a shot in the arm for battered investors.


RBI's OMO plan music to ears: RBI's plan of buying Rs 400 billion of government bonds via open-market operations (OMO) in November, aimed at injecting liquidity into the system, came as a welcome relief for market, which has been nervous about the liquidity crunch after defaults at a major infrastructure financing company. India’s bonds, rupee and stock markets all broke free on Monday as they took their lead from the RBI’s announcement that it will buy Rs 400 billion of government bonds via open-market operations in November as it seeks to inject liquidity into the market, Reuters said. 


Global leads shine: A turnaround in global cues gave hope to investors at home. European shares opened in positive territory on Monday in a tentative rebound from a sell-off, Reuters reported. UK's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and French CAC 40 climbed up to 1 per cent.


Crude prices drop: Oil prices eased today as the rise in the dollar and concerns of slowing demand owing to weak economic growth weighed on. However, the prospects of a tight supply looms after US sanctions on Iran crude exports kicks in. The market is expecting an increased supply from Saudi Arabia as it has promised to keep the oil market adequately supplied. Brent crude oil futures and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were in the red. 


Earnings hopes alive: Even though September earnings have been mixed so far, the market has still not given up on hope. Close to 800 BSE companies are due to post their second quarter earnings this week. Tata Power today posted an 88.46 per cent surge in second-quarter profit on Monday, underpinned by higher revenue from its power business. Market seems to be riding on the hope of better numbers going ahead. 

Of the 30 shares on the Sensex, only seven ended with losses, with the rest in the green. ICICI Bank was the top index performer (up 10.82 per cent), followed by SBI, Adani Ports, L&T, Axis Bank and Reliance Industries. 

Among Nifty constituents, 42 stocks shut shop with solid gains. Indiabulls Housing Finance, with gains of over 12 per cent, led the way. ICICI Bank, SBI, Adani Ports and Dr Reddy's Labs were next in line.

On the NSE, it was all green mark across all sectoral indices. Nifty PSU Bank index rallied 7.99 per cent buoyed by the news of measure aimed to addressing liquidity crunch and upbeat quarterly results. ""Most PSU lenders have reported profit and their asset quality has shown improvement,"" Yuvraj Choudhary, analyst, Anand Rathi Securities, told Reuters.

The Nifty Pharma too staged a stellar show with gains of over 5 per cent. Metals, realty, private bank, IT & financials too scored healthy gains.


How spectacular was the rally?
1. The Sensex added Rs 3.08,855.62 crore in market cap today.
2. Rally on the Nifty led to addition of more than Rs 1 lakh crore to investor wealth.
3. ICICI Bank saw creation of Rs 20,000 crore investor wealth.
4. All sectors on NSE and BSE ended in the green.
5. The advance-decline ratio stood at 2:1 meaning for gain in every two stocks, one stock fell.


Expert-take
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
""Despite mixed Q2 results, the Nifty got support today after touching the key level of 10,000. Bond yield reduced to 7.8 per cent while the rupee and oil prices moderated. Although the rally was broad-based, financials and pharma outperformed the broader market. The extension of this trend will largely depend on liquidity condition and global sentiment."""

5,2018-11-21,Reddy,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 29.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• JM Financial has maintained its buy rating on 
Bandhan Bank with a target price of Rs 710. The brokerage continues to like Bandhan for its strong track record on profitability, asset quality and efficiency. Bandhan has a strong growth runway and the Gruh merger gives it a much-need diversification while ensuring stability and compliments the business model, said the brokerage. Shares of Bandhan Bank declined 2 per cent to Rs 525.35 on Wednesday.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained its Neutral stance on 
NHPC with a target price of Rs 25. The construction of lower Subansiri project has restarted from October, which is a positive for the company. However the regulated equity growth of NHPC, which has been key driver for earnings, will be muted for the next few years as no new projects are being commissioned. Shares of NHPC closed at Rs 23.5 apiece on Wednesday, up 0.86 per cent.


• Edelweiss Securities has maintained its Buy rating on 
Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services with a target price of Rs 397. The company’s earnings for September quarter remained mixed with softer growth, lower net interest margins and steady asset quality. Edelweiss expects disbursements to witness to improve in the second half of FY20. Going forward, better monsoon and a seasonally strong second half of year portend well, but inherent volatility remains challenging. Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services closed at Rs 330, up 0.7 per cent on Wednesday.

• Reliance Securities has maintained a Buy rating on 
Gail (India) with a target price of Rs 154. Gail posted improved volume performance in quarter ending September with natural gas transmission growing 7 per cent year-on-year. Also , Petrochemical facility utilisation touched a new high of 112 per cent in September quarter. However, Gail sold contracted LNG at lower price in spot market, for which its gas marketing margin fell during the quarter. Shares of Gail (India) closed 0.8 per cent lower at Rs 124 on Wednesday.

• SBI Cap Securities has upgraded 
Dr Reddy's Laboratories to Buy rating with a target price of Rs 3200. The brokerage said the company’s management has taken some major actions such as divestment of non-core assets, trimming of workforce, and rationalisation of research and development. These steps have improved margins and return ratios. However, adverse regulatory developments and continued high competition in US generics could pose challenges for the stock. Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories closed at Rs 2828, up 3.1 per cent on Wednesday."

The company which won the tender to market Olanzapine drug in China, is expected to launch it beginning next year, the official said. 

""As mentioned earlier, we are working towards filing and an eventual launch of over 70 products, across the chosen therapy areas, over the next few years... We have 8-10 products currently available in the market. All our products are marketed either through our Joint Venture, Kushnan Rotam Reddy Pharmaceuticals (KRRP) or through our partners in China,"" Dr Reddy's spokesperson told in an email reply. 

The products are manufactured either in the plant owned by KRRP in China, or partners in China, or in India by Dr. Reddy's, the official further said. 

Erez Israeli, CEO of Dr Reddy's earlier in the recently held earnings call said they are in the process of moving the manufacturing of some of the drugs to a local partner as the company entitled for certain exemptions in terms of tests and studies. 

""...On top of it, we are moving few products to a contractor to make in China. There are certain advantages for example, exemptions from certain tests when you do a bio study and make products in China, and we will explore that. And some products we will sell out of our Indian facilities,"" Israeli said. 

Dr. Reddy's successfully emerged as one of the winners for the supply of olanzapine in the centralised drug procurement programme, becoming the first Indian generic company to have prevailed in the new tendering process in China. 

""The Olanzapine supplies through the tender will start from the beginning of CY 2020, and the initial tender period is for 2 years,"" the spokesperson further said. 

Olanzapine is used to treat the symptoms of psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 

Dr Reddy's generated USD 130 million revenues through product sales including the company's JV in China during the last fiscal. 

DRL has a subsidiary Dr Reddy's (WUXI) Pharmaceutical Co. Limited and joint venture Kunshan Rotam Reddy Pharmaceuticals Company Limited is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of formulations in China."

3,2019-02-04,Reddy,"French packaging group Albéa and US private equity fund Blackstone Group are in advanced negotiations to take a controlling stake in Essel Propack (EPL), India’s largest specialty packaging company, according to three people aware of the development. Amid consolidation in the packaging industry, the parent group is looking to sell assets in order to reduce debt.

Besides the two contenders cited above, Indorama and private equity fund Carlyle have also submitted nonbinding bids but the discussions with Albéa and Blackstone are believed to be progressing, said one of the persons cited above.

Albéa, a global leader in beauty, personal care, oral care, pharmaceutical and food packaging, is owned by French private equity fund PAI Partners. Due diligence is being conducted before binding bids are submitted. Morgan Stanley is advising the EPL promoters.



ET in its August 9 edition was the first to report the company is up for sale. Led by Ashok Goel, the promoters own 57.19 per cent of the company. 

EPL had a market value of Rs 3,381 crore at the Friday close. Buying out the promoters will trigger an open offer for an additional 26 per cent of the company.

EPL, part of the Subhash Chandra-led Essel (Zee) Group, manufactures laminated plastic tubes, extruded laminated plastic tubes, caps and flexible laminates used in packaging of oral care products, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. EPL sells more than 7 billion tubes to over 400 clients globally from 19 global facilities.

“We wish to mention that the company has never commented on transactions by its shareholder(s), and in the absence of verified data available with it considers that such information is speculative,” said Essel Propack chairman and managing director Ashok Goel. “As a policy, the company does not respond to market rumors and speculative news reporting.” He added that the company continues to evaluate various strategic alternatives aimed at enhancing long-term shareholder value, including collaborations.

Carlyle, Blackstone and PAI Partners declined to comment. Albéa, Indorama and Morgan Stanley didn’t respond to queries. Albéa has 38 manufacturing sites globally. Besides India, it has a presence in China and Indonesia. It manufactures tubes and rigid packaging at its Goa and Baddi plants.

Major customers in India include Dabur, Patanjali (oral care); Godrej, Emami, Vicco, Marico (skincare), Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and Piramal (pharmaceuticals), Lakme, Colorbar, Oriflame, Avon, L’Oreal (beauty and cosmetics).


OFFLOADING STAKES
The succession issue is also a trigger for Goel to explore divesting his flagship business, according to people aware of the matter. In the past, he has held informal discussions with PE groups but nothing has fructified so far. In 2015, Essel Propack sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Packaging India (PIPL), valued at Rs 165 crore, to Amcor Flexibles India.

The debt-ridden Essel Group is in the process of selling various assets, including parts of its road and solar portfolio. Subhash Chandra is also looking for a buyer for half his stake in flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

At the group level, Essel has total debt of Rs 17,174 crore. Of this, the infrastructure business accounts for Rs 11,466 crore across three major verticals – power transmission, solar and roads (toll and annuity).

In one of the recent transactions in packaging space, promoters and a PE investor in Manjushree Technopack — India’s largest rigid plastic packaging solution provider— offloaded a majority stake to US PE fund Advent International, valuing the company at Rs 2,300 crore."

9,2019-02-05,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty eked out gains on Tuesday to extend their winning streak into the fourth consecutive session, backed by gains in select bank and a uto heavyweights ahead of the outcome of RBI’s money policy review.

The monetary policy committee of RBI will announce its money policy on Thursday, February 7. The market is speculating that RBI may change its monetary policy stance to ‘neutral’ from 'calibrated tightening' for now, while a rate cut is possible in April, as inflation remains below the central bank’s 4 per cent target.

Positive global trend also gave a leg-up to sentiments, but an uptick in crude oil prices due to tight supply weighed on sentiment.

Let’s take a look at the highlights of Tuesday's session:

RCom’s misery continuesShares of Reliance Communications closed with a massive loss of 27.95 per cent at Rs 5.44, extending the losing run into the third session in a row. In the last three sessions, the stock plunged as much as 54 per cent. The company has moved to file for bankruptcy as it has been unable to sell assets to repay debt over the past year-and-a-half. The stock’s recovery prospects look bleak, said market participants. “Traders may make a quick buck on the stock. But beyond that, there is a huge risk to being long in such stocks,” said Kush Katakia, CEO, Beanstalk Advisory. 


PNB closes with tepid gainsShares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) closed at Rs 73.55, up 0.55 per cent, on BSE after it reported a 7.12 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 246 crore for the third quarter against Rs 230.11 crore profit reported for the same quarter last year. Provisions and contingencies fell by a sharp 38.35 per cent YoY and 71.78 per cent QoQ. Many brokerages were expecting the bank to report loss for the quarter. 


Bharti Airtel shares eke out gainsA day after suffering a 1.51 per cent drop, shares of Bharti Airtel inched up on Tuesday, closing with a gain of 0.41 per cent at Rs 307.85. The stock came in the line of fire after Moody's Investors Service downgraded the senior unsecured rating for Bharti Airtel to Ba1, or junk, from Baa3. The investors’ service company in a statement on Tuesday said its ratings outlook is negative. 


DHFL extends gainsShares of DHFL closed 5 per cent higher at Rs 121.90, extending the gains into the second straight session. The market seems to have shown its confidence on the stock after the company addressed various queries raised by investors in an investor/conference call on Monday, in the wake of the Cobrapost allegations against the company. 


ACC's Q3 numbers fail to impressCement maker ACC on Tuesday posted a more than three-fold jump in profit for the fourth (December) quarter due to a tax credit of Rs 501 crore.

Suzlon suffers major lossShares of Suzlon Energy plunged as much as 43 per cent to touch its 52-week low of Rs 2.70 on BSE, before settling 23.26 per cent down at Rs 3.63. The stock lurched lower on speculations about a possible debt default and selling of some pledged shares by its lenders. However, the stock recovered slightly after the company clarified the matter in a BSE Filing. “None of the shares of the promoters have been invoked. Promoter shareholding in the company has been pledged for collaterally securing the obligations of the lenders of the company and not towards securing promoters’ personal borrowings,"" the company said.


BHEL plunges 9% despite strong Q3 numbersShares of State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) cracked 9.18 per cent to close at Rs 58.90 even as it on Tuesday reported a 25.30 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and 3.66 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) jump in standalone profit at Rs 191.95 for the quarter ended December 31. 


Dr Reddy's Labs jumps 3%Shares of Dr Reddy's Laboratories closed 3.07 per cent higher at Rs 2,826 on BSE after Bloomberg reported that a US court ruling may clear the way for DRL and others to start selling generic versions of Suboxone film, the company’s treatment for opioid addiction. The drugmaker on Friday reported a 45 per cent year-on-year growth in December quarter profit at Rs 485 crore."

30,2019-02-15,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Logging its biggest weekly fall since October 2018, equity benchmark Sensex extended its losing streak into the seventh session and ended the week 1,166 points, or 3.15 per cent, lower. 

Domestic stocks tanked on Friday amid fresh concerns over global economic slowdown after China's producer prices data for January showed a downward trend for the seventh successive month and the US retail sales recorded its biggest drop since 2009. 

Weakness in the rupee following a surge in global crude oil prices further dampened the mood. 

Uninspiring December quarter earnings, anxiety over political uncertainty in the run-up to the general elections and scepticism around the health of NBFCs and PSU banks have made investors stay away from the market. Every rise in the market is meeting with a fresh spell of profit booking. 

After falling some 365 points earlier in the day, Sensex pared much of the losses on support from shares of NTPC (up 4.13 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 1.47 per cent) and Larsen & Toubro (up 1.31 per cent) and closed the day 67 points, or 0.19 per cent, down at 35,808. 

Nifty finished 22 points, or 0.20 per cent, lower at 10,724. Midcaps and smallcaps suffered more, as their sectoral indices on BSE fell up to 1.18 per cent. 


Let's take a look at the highlights of Friday's session: 

Jet Airways settles 3% higher
Shares of Jet Airways (India) ended the day 2.99 per cent higher at Rs 232 on BSE after the company's board on Thursday approved a bank-led resolution plan (BLRP), entailing conversion of lenders’ debt into equity. Separately, a report said the company was planning to raise about Rs 6,000 crore from a government fund and through a rights issue. 


GMR Infra posts loss, but stock up
GMR Infrastructure reported Rs 561.04 crore loss in December quarter earnings against Rs 578.40 crore loss posted for the same quarter in FY18. The company attributed the loss to subdued show by its energy and highway verticals and lower credit ratings for some of its borrowings. Shares of the company closed 0.68 per cent higher at Rs 14.85. 


ONGC gains on Q3 earnings
Shares of ONGC climbed 2.27 per cent to end the session at Rs 135.10 after the company posted 64.77 per cent year-on-year rise in December quarter profit at Rs 8,262 crore in post-market hours on Thursday. Revenue of the company increased by 20.43 per cent YoY to Rs 27,694.09 crore in Q3FY19.

Sugar stocks get sweeter
A day after the government hiked the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar by Rs 2 per kg to Rs 31 to help millers clear farmers' dues, some sugar stocks climbed. Piccadilly Sugar and Allied Industries rose 10 per cent, Dhampure Speciality Sugars gained 4.93 per cent, Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals 4.72 per cent, Parvati Sweetners and Power 4.65 per cent and Gayatri Sugars 4.59 per cent.

However, Dr. Reddys Lab, JSW Steel, Sun Pharma, Tata Motors and Vedanta were among the top losers."
29,2019-02-15,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Stock benchmarks just barely managed to hold on to their crucial psychological levels on Friday, thanks to some last-minute buying. 

Tepid corporate earnings and lacklustre US retail sales did not help matters much. Global cues too did not paint a rosy picture.

Uncertainty over US-China trade deal further kept risk appetite at bay. 

The BSE Sensex fell as much as 365 points during the day on broad-based selling across sectors, but recouped much of the losses to end 67 points lower at 35,809. This was the seventh straight day of loss for the 30-share index. The barometer ended 2.03 per cent lower for the week. 

Meanwhile, its NSE counterpart Nifty ended the day at 10,724, down 22 points.

Global shares lay low amid disappointing data from the world's two biggest economies - the US and China. Rising crude, a falling rupee and a possible escalation in tension between India and Pakistan after the latest terrorist attack hit investor sentiment hard. 



Market at a glance

Among Sensex stocks, 12 settled higher and 18 in the red. Sun Pharma was the top loser with a fall of 3.94 per cent, along with Tata Steel, Vedanta, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Finance and SBI. 

NTPC, Power Grid, ONGC, RIL and L&T looked up though, rising up to 4.13 per cent. 

Shares of pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories plunged as much as 29.78 per cent to Rs 1,872.95. The shares had last hit this level on October 15, 2001. However, the scrip recovered ground to end 4.17 per cent lower on the NSE. 

Jefferies said the 11 observations found under Form 483 on company's Bachupally manufacturing unit includes four repeat observations, including one repeated from 2015 and 2017. The observations are around lack of thorough investigations, written records lacking details, employees not being trained and lack of infrastructure. 

Metals and healthcare were the worst hit on the BSE today, declining over 2 per cent each. On the other hand, power and utilities were the leading sectoral performers, gaining over 2 per cent each. 

Midcaps and smallcaps suffered more than the Sensex. BSE Midcap ended 1.18 per cent lower while BSE Smallcap was 0.83 per cent down.



Factors that moved markets:


Rupee slide continues
Rupee continued to slide against the US dollar on Friday amid rising crude prices and fears of a possible escalation in geopolitical tensions here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday warned Pakistan of a strong response to a car bomb attack on a military convoy in Kashmir. The domestic unit declined 29 paise in intraday session to hit a low of 71.44. It had settled at 71.15 on Thursday. 


Boiling oil cools
Brent crude oil prices slipped away from 2019 highs above $65 per barrel reached earlier on Friday as economic concerns countered Opec-led supply cuts and a partial shutdown of Saudi Arabia’s biggest offshore oil field, according to a Reuters report. Brent rose as far as $65.10, pushing past the $65 mark for the first time this year, before falling back to $64.69 by 0751 GMT. That was still 0.2 per cent above the last close.


Weakness in global markets
Asian stocks fell on Friday, retreating from four-month highs after data out of China raised concerns over deflationary pressures building in the world's second-biggest economy. The equity markets had already been under pressure after weak US retail sales figures triggered fresh doubts about the strength of the world's largest economy, stated a Reuters report.


Emergence of low-level buying
After declining nearly a per cent, the benchmark indices saw low-level buying with NSE flagship Nifty recovering from near 10,600 levels while the BSE Sensex rebounded from 35,500 level. ""A negative candle was formed today with long lower shadow. This daily candle is resembling a bullish hammer, but not a classical one. Hence, today's pattern is signaling an emergence of some buying interest from near 10600 level,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities.



Expert-take
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Market slid due to broad-based selling across sectors as rising yield and weak rupee cast cloud over investor’s sentiment. Volatility may continue due to lack of positive triggers in the domestic market while rising oil prices will impact domestic macros in the near term. Global markets turned negative due to obstacles in the US-China trade deal."

35,2019-02-18,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories has received the inspection closure report for its Duvvada facility in Andhra Pradesh from the USFDA.

The new onco-injectables plant, where DRL manufactures Dacogon and Vidaza, contributes $20-30 million to the company’s revenue.

The facility accounts for 20 of the total 100 products in the company's pipeline, analysts say. The USFDA move has addressed a key issue haunting the stock. But they have mixed outlook for the stock in the near term, as they feel additional revenue from the facility could only come after 12-15 months.

Besides, the USFDA had recently issued Form 483 with 11 observations to its formulation site (FTO-III) at Bachuppally, which also limit any major upside.

The Duvvada news has lifted a big overhang from the stock, said Edelweiss Securities. The brokerage said nearly 10 of the products manufactured here are either injectables or from the niches segments.

“Any new launch from this plant will be incremental to what has already been baked into FY20/21 numbers,” the brokerage said.

Motilal Oswal Securities says the news has come in as a big positive, given that the site was under a warning letter with official action indicated (OAI) status.

“We, nevertheless, believe revenue contribution from this site will be limited over the next 12-15 months, as Dr Reddy’s Labs had filed products from alternative sites to reduce the business risk when resolution of the issues at Duvvada was taking time,” it said.

This brokerage expects DRL to take strong corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) on its Bachuppally formulation site, which received 11 observations from USFDA, given that the facility accounts for a significant 35- 40 per cent of its US base business.

“While we find comfort in the improved pace of ANDA approval and issuance of EIR for Duvvada, the resolution of issues at FTO-III is critical to maintain momentum in the base business. We, thus, maintain our ‘neutral’ rating on limited upside from current level,” the brokerage said.

The scrip closed at Rs 2,570, up 0.51 per cent, on BSE.

Duvvada is the same formulations manufacturing facility which was included in the warning letter received from US FDA in November, 2015. The site was later audited by USFDA in March, 2017, for which the company received EIR in November, 2017, but the site's status remained unchanged. The same site was again audited in October, 2018.

“Based on our responses and follow-up actions, USFDA has concluded that this inspection is ‘closed’ and has determined the inspection classification of this facility as voluntary action initiated (VAi),” the company told stock exchanges on Saturday.

""We maintain our estimates and continue to value DRL at 18 times 12-month forward earnings to arrive at a price target of Rs 2,540,"" the brokerage said.

Edelweiss said the drugmaker's promising complex generics pipeline, strong earnings revival and compelling valuations make it a prime re-rating candidate. 

It valued the stock at 15.4 times FY20E EPS."

Allahabad Bank, Central Bank of India and Dena Bank may be next in line to be taken out of the Reserve Bank of India’s prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, with the government likely to inject more capital into these lenders and hopes of better loan recovery through the insolvency resolution mechanism. The government is expected to provide another Rs 12,500 crore of capital in the current quarter to banks that have capital ratios below the mandatory level. RBI removed Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce from the PCA on January 31.



MACROS 

DA for govt employees hiked by 3%
The union cabinet today approved an additional dearness allowance (DA) of 3 per cent over the existing rate of 9 per cent for government employees and pensioners which will be effective from January 1, 2019. This will cost the government around Rs 9,200 crore per year. The move is expected to benefit more than one crore central government employees and pensioners. 


Oil prices near 2019 highs
Oil prices hovered near 2019 highs on Wednesday, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but capped by soaring US production and expectations of an economic slowdown, Reuters reported. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $55.93 per barrel, down 16 cents from their last settlement, but not far off their 2019 high of $56.33 reached earlier this week.


Fed minutes of Jan meeting to be out today

China central bank announces bill swaps

WTO trade indicator declines to 9-year low
Trade tensions, political risks and financial volatility will continue to pressure global trade and the weakness is likely to extend into the first quarter of 2019, the World Trade Organisation said on Tuesday. The global watchdog’s latest World Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI) was at 96.3, the weakest since March 2010 and lower than the baseline value of 100, signalling below-trend expansion into the first quarter. Readings of 100 indicate growth in line with medium-term trends; those greater than 100 suggest above-trend growth, while those less than 100 show below-trend growth.


Cash dole-out, Pulwama may help BJP
The Rs 6,000-per annum cash dole out to each farmer family in basic income support will help swing votes for the ruling BJP, but issues like the stray cattle menace in the electorally crucial Uttar Pradesh are a concern, says a report by Swiss brokerage UBS. It also said that this time, there was no Modi-wave or any wave at all and its field visits did not give enough fodder for it believe that the BJP will return to power after the summer hustings. Foreign brokerage CLSA on the other hand said rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pulwama attack can have a political fallout, depending on how the situation unfolds. 


Errant CEOs to lose hefty payouts
If a bank CEO airbrushes financials to prop up profitability, makes inadequate provisioning of sticky loans or fails to meet regulatory norms of RBI, Sebi or IRDAI, he will no longer be able to leave his job with hefty payouts in the form of bonuses and stock options. New norms being framed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will ensure that such benefits are taken back from the CEO. The RBI is working on a set of rules that would link remuneration of banks CEOs to parameters like balance sheet size of a bank, loan delinquency, profits and governance record. 


Trade talks: US presses China for stable yuan
The US is asking China to keep the value of the yuan stable as part of trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economies, a move aimed at neutralizing any effort by Beijing to devalue its currency to counter American tariffs, reports Bloomberg. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China were going well and suggested he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations, saying March 1 was not a “magical” date. 


Startup definition widened, relief for investors
The government announced a series of changes aimed at freeing investors and entrepreneurs from the so-called angel tax that has roiled India’s startup ecosystem. It raised the exemption threshold and kept investments by listed companies of certain minimum size, venture capital funds and non-residents in startups outside the ambit of the tax. The move is expected to bring relief to 16,000 companies that are registered as startups with the Department of Investment and Internal Trade (DPIIT).


16 states sue Trump over emergency 
Sixteen US states sued President Donald Trump's administration Monday over his decision to declare a national emergency to fund a wall on the southern border with Mexico, saying the move violated the constitution. Trump announced the emergency Friday in order to bypass Congress, which approved only a quarter of the $5.6 billion he wanted for the wall in a spending bill. Should the states prevail, the case could work its way up to the Supreme Court, setting up a precedent-setting showdown on the separation of powers.

46,2019-02-21,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: The pharma sector took a breather in December quarter, after steep downgrades all through the first half of FY19. While headwinds still persist, analysts say the industry seems to be looking up.

If that’s true, select pharma stocks can be good buying opportunity for investors at prevailing valuations. 

The domestic pharma industry can be divided into three categories. The first would be the drug makers focused mainly on exports such as Sun Pharma (70 per cent revenue from exports), Dr Reddy’s Labs (75 per cent), Cadila Healthcare (70 per cent), Lupin (70 per cent) and Wockhardt (62-65 per cent).

Players in the second category generate a good proportion of their revenues from the domestic market. They include companies like Cipla (over 40 per cent of revenue from domestic market), Ajanta Pharma (around 35 per cent) and Alkem Labs (nearly 70 per cent).

And the third category includes pharma MNCs such as GSK Pharma, Pfizer and AstraZeneca.


Exporters show signs of revival
Having been battered on Dalal Street for quite a long time now, this segment is finally showing hope. December earnings marked first quarterly beat on US revenues for domestic drug exporters in nearly three years. 

Analysts say the sector could stage a recovery from a low base, as product price erosion appears to have bottomed out and US volumes have started picking up.

All through the depressed phase, several drug makers have sold non-core businesses, rationalised R expenditure &D and changed CXOs to ensure better performance.

Kotak Securities said US generic revenues should recover sharply over FY2020-21 on the back of new launches, even though there is uncertainty over launch timelines. “We have seen the first signs of revival in US generic revenues in case of a few companies in Q2FY19, and this continued into Q3 of FY19,” it said.

Various estimates peg the growth in global pharma spend at 3-6 per cent over 2018-22. The US remains the key market with over 40 per cent of total spending. While $212 billion worth of drugs set to see patent expiry in 2019-2024, major expiries have been pushed beyond 2022, say analysts. Meanwhile, entry of Chinese players has intensified competition.

Yet, analysts say most of these concerns are already in the price at prevailing market valuations.

Independent investment advisor Vivek Mavani says while he is unsure about Dr Reddy’s, for drug makers like Sun Pharma, Cadila and Wockhardt, Lupin the worst seems to be over in terms of price performance. Now, the bottoming out process is on, he said.

“Prices are likely to stabilise, as the industry adjusts to different trade channels. Most companies anticipate price erosion to wilt from mid-to-high single digits into the low single digits. However, increased competition on faster approvals led by GDUFA is likely to remain an overhang,” Elara Capital said.


Domestic market strong, MNCs to see recovery
For companies with significant domestic market exposure, earnings continue to grow in double digits.

“Alkem is still attractive at about Rs 1,800-1,900. Ajanta Pharma has corrected significantly to Rs 1,000 level. Cipla, of course, is a long-term slow compounder and would still do well,” Mavani said.

In case of the pharma MNC pack, which analysts say has been in slumber for 15 years, investments made over the past few years are beginning to pay off in terms of earnings growth.

“Probably, it is below-the-radar. Most people missed the trend. But MNC stocks such as AstraZeneca have actually been among the best performers. They will continue to do well on back of robust earnings growth, as heavy investments made in past few years begin to pay off,” Mavani said.

In December quarter, export-driven names logged higher realisations on rupee depreciation, while MNC players reported better sequential margins.

“Domestic-focused companies should structurally outperform, led by recovery in Indian pharma market, a relatively benign operating environment and continued volume expansion. Export-focused players will benefit from currency tailwinds in the near term,"" said Antique Stock Broking.

The brokerage has recommended Dr Reddy's, Natco Pharma and Cipla, which are domestic-focused stories with expanding US presence.


FY19/20 earnings estimates stabilise
Dr Reddy’s, Biocon, Torrent and Ipca Labs saw upgrades in earnings estimates for FY19 and FY20 following solid December quarter numbers, while Lupin, Cipla, Cadila and Glenmark Pharma saw a downward revision in earnings estimates for FY19-20.

Overall, the FY19/20 earnings estimate for the NSE Pharma index remained stable post December quarter earnings, compared with sharp cuts witnessed in H1FY19, CLSA noted in a report.

Pharma stocks are generally considered defensive bets in times of uncertainty in the domestic economy, as the market is somewhat immune to weakness in economic fundamentals and most players derive a major chunk of their revenues outside of India. Yet regulatory issues have hurt the sector hard over the past few quarters.

The Nifty Pharma index is down 20 per cent in last two years and 25 per cent in last three years. For the ongoing financial year, it is down 11 per cent against a one per cent rise in Nifty50.

CLSA said it likes Sun Pharma on improving fundamentals and differentiated product pipeline for the US, and prefers Torrent Pharma for its India positioning.

Elara Capital also likes Torrent Pharma. Besides, it prefers Aurobindo Pharma due to the turnaround in its EU business and strong fresh cash flow generation over FY18-20, given limited capex requirements.

IPCA Labs is another stock Elara is bullish on. The brokerage feels the company’s strong API capabilities and diversified model would provide it with major competitive advantage in the current environment."
47,2019-02-21,Reddy,"HYDERABAD: Dr Reddy's Laboratories has said it re-launched its Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, the generic version of Suboxone in the US market.

According to a press release issued by the Hyderabad-based drug maker on Wednesday night, the re-launch comes on the heels of a favourable decision delivered by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluding that UK-based Indivior had not shown that it is likely to succeed in its claim that Dr Reddy's product infringes a patent pertaining to Suboxone.

Indivior is in a legal battle against the launch of the copycat version of its opioid addiction treatment by competitors, including Dr Reddy's Laboratories in the US market.

Suboxone had sales of around $1.86 billion in the US for the 12 months ended April 2018, according to market reports.

""We are pleased with the decision of the appellate court in Dr Reddy's favour, vacating the preliminary injunction that had prevented Dr Reddy's from continuing to market this important drug to the public,"" Marc Kikuchi, Chief Executive Officer, North America Generics of DRL, said.

In June 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved Dr Reddy's Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, in four strengths including 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg, for sale in the US market.

The product was launched immediately after approval, with sales and commercialisation activities halted as a result of a court-imposed temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction against Dr Reddy's.

The TRO and preliminary injunction did not prohibit commercial manufacture of the product. PTI"

The policy is for Rs 1,457 crore covering advertisement loss due to cancellation of a match.”

2,2019-03-01,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty reversed the losing run of three sessions on Friday, spurred by healthy gains in bank, financial, IT and auto stocks, as investors cheered de-escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan.

Speculators raised their bets across sectors on the first day of March futures and options contracts. A rally in emerging markets also influenced mood. 

Chinese stocks jumped after MSCI raised their weight in its global benchmarks. 

Concerns over weak macroeconomic data eased as investors saw a silver lining in subdued GDP and infrastructure output numbers. They hoped that the signs of slowdown in the economy may push RBI to cut interest rate at its next meet. 

The Sensex jumped 196 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close the day at 36,063.81. IndusInd bank stole the show, advancing 2.94 per cent, followed by Yes Bank and Vedanta. 

The decliners included Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, Axis Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech, sliding up to 3.43 per cent. 

Midcaps and smallcaps stayed ahead of the Sensex, with solid gains, rising up to 2.13 per cent.

NSE's Nifty50 settled higher 71 points, or 0.66 per cent, at 10,863.50.

For the week, Sensex inched up by 192 points or 0.54 per cent, while the Nifty added 72 points or 0.67 per cent.

Let's take a look at highlights of Friday's session.


Rs 1.41 lakh crore added to investor kitty
Friday's rally in the market made BSE investors richer by Rs 1.41 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of listed firms on the BSE jumped to Rs 1,41,82,750.99 crore from Rs 1,40,41,530.33 crore on Thursday.


Spurt in open interest
Reliance Power, with a change of 82.35 per cent, emerged at the top among the stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on the NSE. It was followed by Arvind (71.83 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (48.36 per cent), Just Dial (44.64 per cent), Oriental Bank of Commerce (38.76 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (35.14 per cent).


Over 200 stocks hit upper circuits
As many as 202 BSE stocks, including SML Isuzu, Religare Enterprises, Shreyans Industries, Star Paper Mills, Forbes & Company and Indiabulls Integrated Services, hit their upper circuits. On the flip side, Weizmann, Atlas Jewellery India, Optiemus Infracom and Darshan Orna were among the 162 stocks that hit their lower circuits. 


115 stocks signal upside
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 115 counters on the BSE, indicating that they may climb in coming sessions. Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Engineers India, ITI, Dabur India, Lupin, Repco Home Finance, Mindtree, Dr Reddy's Labs, JSW Energy and Karur Vysya Bank. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Asian Hotels (West) and Orient Beverages were among the 22 stocks that showed bearish crossovers. 


New CEO takes charge, YES Bank jumps 3%
Shares of YES Bank closed 2.68 per cent higher at Rs 237.40 after Ravneet Gill took charge as Managing Director and CEO of the bank. His tenure as approved by RBI is 3 years from the date of his joining, i.e. March 1, 2019 to February 28, 2022. 


Sugar stocks turn sweeter
Most sugar stocks jumped higher, a day after India's Cabinet approved a plan to spend up to Rs 1,054 crore to pay interest on loans to the sugar industry for a year, in a bid to help sugar mills clear their dues to farmers. Dharani Sugars & Chemicals (up 9.99 per cent), Sakthi Sugars (up 6.06 per cent), Triveni Engineering & Industries (up 5.18 per cent), Indian Sucrose (up 4.69 per cent) and Thiru Arooran Sugars (up 4.97 per cent) were among top gainers in the sugar space. 


Airtel falls on EPS worry
Markets reacted negatively to the fund-raising plan of Bharti Airtel as the shares of the company fell 3.43 per cent to close at Rs 307.05. Analysts say the raised funds will help the company pare its debt, but is not enough for its capex and opex plans. Also, the deep discount given for the right issue will hit the company's investors view for further fund-raising and increase worries on EPS estimates.


SBI Life Insurance gains 5%
Shares of SBI Life Insurance Company settled at Rs 612.25, up 5.47 per cent, after CA Emerald Investments, an affiliated entity of a Carlyle Group fund, bought 9 per cent stake in the firm. Separately, BNP Paribas Cardif SA cut its stake in the insurer by 9.23 per cent to 12.77 per cent, the company said. 


Jet Airways jumps 5%
Shares of Jet Airways closed 5.32 per cent higher at Rs 234.65 on reports that founder Naresh Goyal had agreed to step down as chairman. Reuters said Goyal also agreed to reduce his 51 per cent stake in the airline but would continue to be part of the company in some capacity even after stepping down as chairman.


Auto sales
SML Isuzu sold 1,282 vehicles in February 2019 against 965 vehicles in the same month a year ago. The stock closed 20 per cent up at Rs 682.55. 

Domestic sales of Mahindra & Mahindra stood at 52,915 vehicles, compared with 48,473 units during February 2018. Shares closed the day 0.43 per cent up at Rs 649.35.

Maruti Suzuki India saw a marginal decline in total sales at 1,48,682 units. The company had sold 1,49,824 units in February last year. The scrip closed 1.48 per cent up at Rs 6,933.20.

4,2019-03-05,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: NSE barometer Nifty50 kicked off March derivatives series on a solid note, settling last week a tad above its 200-day moving average. In the process, 74 stocks formed bullish crossovers on NSE, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. Technically, this signals more upside for these stocks. 

The fact that many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late is adding credibility to the emerging trend.

Engineers India looks set to rally. The technical indicator has signalled an upward crossover, meaning a bullish signal, on the counter. Dabur India, Lupin, Mindtree, Repco Home, TVS Motor, Sequent Scientific, Network18 Media and MCX are some on other stocks that look positive on the technical charts. The list also includes Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy's Labs, MOIL, Karur Vysya Bank, ABB India and CESC. 




The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 12 stocks showed bearish crossovers on the daily charts, indicating that these stocks may see downsides in the days ahead. They included Eicher Motors, Tourism Finance Corporation, Endurance Technologies, Asian Hotels (West) and Aditya Birla Nuvo. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

In case of Nifty50, it has clearly formed a 'double bottom' on the daily chart, said IIFL Securities. 

It has also surged and tested its critical zone of 10,870-10,900, which is the confluence of the resistance area. ""A break above the resistance would lift Nifty higher towards the 11,000 level, with the 10,800 mark being a key support,"" the brokerage said in a weekly note. 

ICICIdirect sees a resolve in Nifty50 to move out of the upper band of its consolidation range (10,900), unfolding the next leg of upward move towards 11,400 level in the coming months. 

""Volatility would remain high in the runup to the elections, which should be capitalised as an incremental buying opportunity in the 10,750-10,600 range,"" it said.


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Engineers India shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock showed an upward momentum and vice versa.

On Friday, the scrip settled 2.71 per cent higher at Rs 110.10 on NSE."

IDBI Bank: The Reserve bank of India has classified IDBI Bank as a private lender after LIC took control of it. The move may lead to a rating downgrade and a rise in cost of funding as investors would factor in the absence of sovereign backing for the bank. 


Lakshmi Vilas Bank: Private sector lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank may end up raising Rs 200-250 crore through qualified institutional placement of shares, which is about 10 per cent of the bank’s Rs 2,000 crore capital raising plan announced in June last year, a person familiar with the matter said.


Punj Lloyd: An arbitration tribunal rejected a Rs 1,320-crore claim filed by the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor Punj Lloyd against Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and also the latter’s counterclaim against Punj Lloyd for Rs 1,153 crore for loss of production due to delay.


SBI, ICICI and HDFC Bank: State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank will have to comply with additional capital requirement norms by April 1 as the banks continue to remain 'too big to fail' lenders, referred to as D-SIB or domestic systemically important bank, RBI said.


Jet Airways: The airline's revival plan has stalled over promoter Naresh Goyal’s insistence that his shareholding shouldn’t be capped at 22 per cent in “perpetuity”. 


Bharti Airtel: Bharti Airtel named Nakul Sehgal as corporate chief financial officer, reporting to Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal.


ONGC: State-owned ONGC's nine biggest oil and gas fields including Mumbai High and Vasai East came tantalisingly close to being sold to private and foreign companies, but the plan was nixed after strong opposition from within the government.


HUL: Unilever named Nitin Paranjpe global chief operating officer as part of a leadership rejig that also saw the India unit’s chairman Sanjiv Mehta being appointed president of South Asia and a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). Analysts said HUL could get extra focus from the parent company with more Indians on its leadership committee.


Jaypee Infratech: Lenders of debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech asked state-run NBCC and Suraksha Group to sweeten their offers for acquiring the bankruptcy-bound realty firm. The scrip is under ASM framework. 


Jubilant Foodworks: Delhi High Court stayed the National AntiProfiteering Authority order and the penalty proceedings subject to deposit of an amount of Rs 20 crore in the Central Consumer Welfare Fund within four weeks from the date of the order.


Religare Enterprises: The Sebi has directed Religare Enterprises and Religare Finvest to recover loans worth Rs 2,315 crore from the Singh brothers and entities related to them. Religare Finvest had advanced loans to promoter related entities — RHC Holding and ANR Securities.


RCom: DoT is invoking bank guarantees (BG) to recover Reliance Communications’ latest spectrum dues and is set to issue a notice asking why the airwaves shouldn’t be withdrawn, adding to the woes of the telco whose chairman Anil Ambani faces jail for not paying a vendor.


Adhunik Metaliks: The company is seeing renewed interest from a clutch of strategic steel players as well as asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), even as the fate of the company’s ongoing resolution process with the winning bidder, Liberty House, is still to be decided by courts.


Sterling Biotech: NCLT has directed the government, regulators, and investigation agencies to clear their stand before the dedicated bankruptcy court decides on the legality of the one-time settlement (OTS) offer of the absconding promoters of Sterling Biotech. The scrip is suspended due to penal reasons. 


Reliance Infra: Singapore-based Cube Highways and Infrastructure is acquiring 100 per cent stake in DA Toll Road, a special purpose vehicle that operates a toll road connecting Delhi and Agra, from Reliance Infrastructure.


IPO WATCH
The initial public offer of state-owned e-commerce company MSTC was subscribed 12 per cent on the second day of bidding Thursday. The Rs 226-crore IPO received bids for 21,04,200 shares against the total issue size of 1,76,70,400 shares, as per data available with the NSE.


ADRs/GDRs
Global depositary receipts (GDRs) of Reliance Industries jumped 0.94 per cent in overnight trade. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Infosys, Vedanta, Dr Reddy's Labs and HDFC Bank rose up to 0.5 per cent. Tata Motors, Wipro and ICICI Bank fell up to 0.45 per cent.

Analyst calls

• Emkay Global has a sell rating on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 18,000. Royal Enfield volumes suffered a 10 per cent year-on-year decline over November 2018 and February 2019 despite the absence of negative one-off factors such as production losses due to labor strikes, said Emkay. 

• Citigroup has a neutral rating on Info Edge (India) with a target price of Rs 1,715. Info Edge reported muted EBITDA growth in the third quarter owing to elevated ad spends across recruitment, property and matrimonial businesses, said Citi. 

 • Kotak Securities has downgraded KNR Constructions to add from buy and revised target price to Rs 282 from Rs 239. The company has bagged around Rs 10 billion worth of new projects in the last one month and is on track to meet its guidance of adding Rs 20 billion of new orders in 3-6 months timeline, said Kotak Securities. 

• HSBC has initiated coverage on Aster DM Healthcare with buy rating and target price of Rs 205. Aster is among the largest healthcare providers in the Gulf Cooperation Council and India through its hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, said HSBC. The firm has estimated Aster’s GCC EBITDA to double in five years despite the current macro weakness in the region. 

• CLSA has a buy rating on Sadbhav Engineering with a target price of Rs 340. While the stock is up 45 per cent in the last one month led by risk on rally, CLSA sees more legs to the stock. One of the key catalysts is potential divestiture of 9/11 of 12 operating NHs in favour of a global strategic investor, said CLSA.

We expect 12% volume CAGR in FY18-21E and expect OPM to improve to 16.7%/17.2% in FY20/21E vs. 15.4% in FY19E, said the brokerage. Gas prices have come down by 12% in Q4FY19, which should help in margin expansion, it added. 

 • Kotak Securities has initiated coverage on Welspun Corp with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹161, valuing stock at 4.5 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA. Given its strong manufacturing and execution capabilities, strong order backlog coupled with robust bids in the pipeline, we believe, Welspun is better placed compared to its peers, to take advantage of renewed pipe demand globally and in the domestic market, said the brokerage.

Board meetings
 

Analyst calls• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained reduce rating on Sobha with a target price of ₹495. Sobha’s strength lies in consistent sales from ongoing projects during construction phase, the brokerage said. The stock is fairly valued at current market price, the brokerage said. 

• Edelweiss has downgraded Jet Airways (India) to hold from reduce and cut target price by 22% to ₹177. The airline's viability has taken a hit even as varied possibilities are emerging about the company including the hunt for a new buyer and/or a debt write off, the brokerage said. 

• Emkay Global has maintained buy rating on Delta Corp with a target price of ₹380. The brokerage said Delta's fourth quarter results were in-line with expectation with a 14% year-on-year increase in earnings per share. The brokerage sees Delta as a gaming play in India. 

• Nomura has maintained buy rating on Va Tech Wabag and lowered target price to ₹520 from ₹761. Va Tech's share price has fallen 40% in the past 12 months versus a 16% Nifty rise largely due to a miss on order inflows/execution and a rise in debtor levels, said Nomura. 

• Kotak Securities has a buy rating on MOIL with a target price of ₹200. Backed by the firm international price and strong demand at the beginning of FY19, MOIL had increased manganese ore prices across all the grades, said Kotak Securities. The company had revised its prices downwards in the third quarter and the impact of same will be reflected in fourth quarter numbers, said Kotak Securities.

Board meetings
 Analyst callsAntique Stock Broking has maintained buy rating on UPL and revised target price to ₹1,000 from ₹910. The brokerage believes that UPL is likely to get benefit at operating level during fourth quarter of FY19 on account of favorable currency movement, positive product pricing and better acreage in key markets.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Mahindra & Mahindra with a target price of ₹790. M&M's core business faces headwinds in the form of an uncertain tractor demand outlook due to the cyclical downturn and the initial forecast of El Nino, a weak product lifecycle in UVs, a huge product skew toward diesel segment and a deteriorating margin profile.

• ICICIdirect has maintained buy rating on Tata Steel with a target price of ₹625. It is positive on Tata Steel on the back of increasing focus on higher margin domestic operations. Tata Steel’s standalone operations benefit from its integrated operations thereby clocking higher EBITDA/tonne vis-à-vis its domestic peers.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Motherson Sumi Systems and lowered target price to ₹170 from Rs 233. It has cut estimates by 15-30 per cent to factor in weaker domestic and global car markets, rupee appreciation against euro, and slower ramp-up of SMP volumes.

• Edelweiss has maintained hold rating on NMDC with a target price of ₹100. The brokerage expects volume challenges to persist owing to ongoing production halt at Donimalai despite ramp up expected in existing mines at Chattisgarh and new deposits in JV with CMDC. Over the past three months, the stock has underperformed global peers as well as iron ore prices.

27,2019-04-22,Reddy,"MUMBAI: A consortium of Carlyle and Zydus Cadila is competing with private equity group Advent International to acquire Mumbaibased bio-pharmaceutical company Bharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd. (BSV). The two have submitted non-binding offers in the range of Rs 3,450-3,600 crore ($500-520 million), said multiple sources aware of the matter.

They are up against domestic pharma companies Dr Reddy's Labs, Chrys Capital-backed Mankind Pharma and Goldman Sachs which have also made offers in the range of Rs 3,000 crore ($400-440 million), said one of the persons cited above.

The binding offers are due this month end.

However, the overall process has been slow due to the valuation mismatch. The founder promoters, the Daftary family, is believed to expecting a valuation of $600-630 million (Rs 4,000-4,300 crore) for their company. The Daftary family, existing investors Kotak Private Equity and Orbimed Asia are looking to sell a majority stake in the company and had mandated investment bank Jefferies to manage the sale process, ET had first reported in August last year.

The two funds together hold 23% stake and the rest is with the founders. As part of giving an exit to the investors, the company had planned Rs 2,000-crore initial public offering two years ago, which was called off later.

The company was valued at Rs 6,667 crore then, ET had reported in December 2017. If the deal goes through, Daftary would like to keep about 35-40% in BSV as he doesn't want to exit the company, said the second person.

After the buyout of Heinz India, it’s for the second time that Pankaj Patel-led Zydus Group is on the prowl and is exploring to work with a PE partner. Zydus Wellness – a Zydus group company – had acquired Heinz India's consumer wellness business, which includes popular brands Complan and Glucon D. For the Rs 4,595-crore buyout, Zydus received backing of homegrown PE fund True North, which invested about Rs 1,000 crore ($140 million).

Carlyle is trying its luck for BSV for the second time as the fund alone explored acquisition in 2014, which didn’t materialise. Carlyle’s India healthcare portfolio include multi-speciality hospital chain Medanta-The Medicity and diagnostics major Metropolis Healthcare.

BSV, which has 900 employees, sells products in India and in over 45 countries. They include plasma derivatives, hormones, equine anti-toxins and serums, antifungals, anaesthetics, cardiovascular and diagnostic products. BSV, with R&D facilities in India, Germany and the US, has company-owned and joint venture-based plants in Ambernath, Ahmedabad and Aachen, Germany.

BSV competes with Serum Institute of India, Biological E, Panacea Biotec and Shantha Biotechnics in India. The company’s revenue was Rs 620 crore in FY17, with a profit of Rs 40 crore. Latest financial details are not yet available.

Emails sent to BSV managing director Gautam Daftary and the spokespersons of Orbimed, Zydus Cadila, DRL, Carlyle and Kotak PE did not elicit any response till press-time. Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment, so did Advent and Mankind spokespersons.

Zydus Cadila roped in BSV as a joint venture partner in 2015 to develop anti-cancer agents."

Analyst calls

 • Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on Dr Reddy's Laboratories with a target price of ₹3,450. The company is getting fitter and leaner as it divests loss-making ventures and bolsters core competencies, said Edelweiss. 

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and revised target price to ₹,500 from ₹1,600. To address investors’ concerns on increase in pledging of promoter’s share, promoters can utilise their personal assets to reduce pledged shares from 78% to 68% in the next few months, said HSBC. 

 • IIFL has maintained buy rating on Essel Propack with a target price of ₹160 after Essel Propack's promoters sold 90% of their stake to the Blackstone Group at ₹134 per share. Essel Propack could benefit from Blackstone’s management talent, and systems and processes. 

 • Kotak Securities has retained buy rating on Welspun Corp with a target price of ₹161. Given its strong manufacturing and execution capabilities, strong order backlog coupled with robust bids in the pipeline, Welspun Corp is better placed to take advantage of renewed pipe demand globally and in the domestic market, said Kotak Securities. 

 • Morgan Stanley has upgraded Lupin to overweight and raised target price to ₹1,094 from ₹783. After a sharp fall in earnings and stock price over the past four years, Lupin now appears well positioned for recovery, said Morgan Stanley.

43,2019-04-30,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks opened in the red on Tuesday, mirroring bearish sentiment in major Asian markets.

A slight drop in crude oil prices and the rupee's rise against the dollar capped further downside in the market.

Election-related jitters, March quarter earnings and foreign fund flows were other key factors swaying the market on either side. 

Analysts are advising a prudent, stock-specific approach at this juncture. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 11 stocks that analysts say can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in 

HCL Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,270 | Stop loss: Rs 1,090
Long-term charts on the counter are looking interesting. The stock has witnessed a breakout this month to register new life-time highs after almost a year of struggle in the Rs 1,100–900 range. This range breakout itself is projecting a target around Rs 1,300. Going forward, sustaining above Rs 1,100 would be crucial for this stock to retain the positive momentum. “Positional traders, at this juncture, can adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines close to Rs 1,100 and look for a target of Rs 1,270 with a stop loss at Rs 1,090,"" said Mohammad.


Jindal Steel and Power | Buy | Target price: Rs 190 | Stop loss: Rs 167
This counter recoiled on relatively higher volumes from its support level of Rs 165, hinting at a near-term bottom around this level. Sustaining above Rs 168, it can test its recent swing high placed around Rs 191. “Positional traders should buy this stock by adopting a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines around Rs 170, and look for a target of Rs 190 with a stop loss of Rs 167,” Mohammad said.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager, Technical Analysis, YES Securities

State Bank of India | Buy | Target price: Rs 340-360 | Stop loss: Rs 297

On the weekly chart, the SBI stock has turned upward after taking support at the triangle pattern neckline placed around Rs 300-303. Further, volumes declined in the throwback, clearly suggesting a temporary pause before the stock resumes its uptrend. On the daily chart, it has broken out from a bullish flag pattern, suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions. The RSI has turned upward after taking support at the 50-level and has formed a positive reversal on the daily chart, suggesting bullishness in the stock. 


Shankara Building Products | Buy | Target price: Rs 595-620 | Stop loss: Rs 485
On the daily chart, Shankara Building Products is on the verge of a breakout from a bullish flag pattern neckline placed at Rs 540. A successful breakout backed by healthy volumes can trigger a bear trend reversal, taking the stock higher. Further, following a series of lower lows and highs, the stock now has started forming higher highs and higher lows, clearly indicating that the downtrend has been arrested. RSI has turned upwards, breaking out of the upper end of the bear territory i.e. the 60-level and instead took support at this upper end of the bear territory recently during a throwback.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

Ambuja Cements | Buy | Target price: Rs 240 | Stop loss: Rs 219
This stock has taken support near the significant 200-DMA, which is placed near Rs 216 and has made a recovery to indicate a positive bias. It can move further to Rs 240. The RSI has also shown a trend reversal to signify strength.


Jindal Steel & Power | Buy | Target price: Rs 190 | Stop loss: Rs 167
This stock has formed almost a higher bottom formation pattern on the daily chart, taking support near 50-DMA and has produced a positive candle pattern to signify strength. The RSI has also indicated a trend reversal, signalling a buy. ""With good volume activity witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 190, keeping a stop loss of Rs 167,"" Parekh said.


Gajendra Prabu, Senior Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

Hopes of a trade deal helped most Asian and European markets traded in the green. But the Indian market failed to mirror that hope, as local factors, including uncertainty over poll outcome and mixed March quarter numbers kept sentiment depressed. 

""While the US-China trade war remains a concern, the domestic market is reacting to local factors, especially the uncertainty over the election outcome,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICIdirect.

Ebitda margin for the quarter stood at 22 per cent against 22.5 per cent in December quarter and 16.3 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year.

Gross profit margin for the quarter came in at 52.4 per cent. On a sequential basis, it was down 150 basis points, primarily on account of adverse forex rate, change in the business mix, higher manufacturing overheads due to certain one-off charges and overhead impact on inventory movement. 

The margin was down 100 basis points on a yearly basis on account of price erosion, partially offset by new launches and favorable forex rates. 

The decline in gross margin was partially offset due to revenue recognition on PP Derma products, the company said in a BSE filing.

The board of the company has recommended a dividend of Rs 20 per equity share on face value of Rs 5 for FY19."
23,2019-05-20,Reddy,"Elara Capital has given a 'reduce' recommendation on Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) with a target price of Rs 2,759.

Shares of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories traded at Rs 2,561.15 around 1 pm on 20 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.


March quarter highlights:



DRL reported the Ebidta at Rs 820 crore, up 49 per cent year-on-year (YoY), aided by one-time sale of derma brands (Rs 180 crore included in Proprietary products).
There were higher overheads due to certain one-off charges (not quantified). Overall weak operating performance impacted by adverse forex movement and product mix.
US sales were at $212 million against the brokerage's estimate of $225 million, up 3 per cent QoQ. New launches fail to contribute meaningful sales.
India sales disappointed with 6 per cent YoY, while other geographies like Russia, RoW and CIS reported healthy growth. PSAI sales grew by 8.2 per cent YoY. GMs contracted 150bp QoQ to 52.4 per cent, adjusted for one-offs were weak across segments.
PSAI margin fell to 21 per cent (against 30.8 per cent in Q3) while generics GMs fell to 56 per cent against 57.3 per cent in Q3. Tax rate was higher at 26 per cent. Resultant, reported PAT came in at Rs 430 crore, below the brokerage's estimate. 


View of the brokerage:
DRL has faced challenging times over the past two years on the revenue front, although it has done well to rein in cost. The brokerage believes it has a high-value ANDA pipeline; however, timing of approvals remains uncertain. 

""Our FY20E stands reduced by 5 per cent to factor in lower US sales however our FY21E broadly remains unchanged. At the current market price, the stock is trading at rich valuations of 20 times FY21E. We reiterate our reduce rating with a target price of Rs 2,759, valuing at 20 times FY21E P/E, the brokerage said. 

Our FY20-21E factor in key approvals in the US. Delay in key launches is key risk, the brokerage added."

Analyst calls
• Kotak Securities has maintained buy rating on Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India and revised target price to ₹276 from ₹315. The company’s focus on adding right kind of members and rationalisation of sales and marketing spend may impact near term growth rate, but will have positive impact on resort income, margins and cash flows, the brokerage said. Further, addition of new locations and room inventory would support membership growth in the longer run, it said. 

• Investec Securities has maintained buy rating on Karur Vysya Bank and revised target price to ₹114 from ₹115. The brokerage believes most of the asset quality clean-up will be done by FY20 with credit costs at 200 bps of average assets – after which, the bank should post a normalised credit cost of around 80-85 bps leading to a sharp improvement in RoAs to 1.2%. This should help multiples re-rate to historical levels of around 1.2-1.3 times, said Investec. 

• Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Navneet Education with a target price of ₹135. The brokerage has cut estimates of profit after tax for FY20/FY21 by 17%/15% on account of losses in Indiannica due to sluggish recovery. In FY20, change in Gujarat Board syllabus is expected to drive 13% growth in the publishing business, said Motilal Oswal. 

• UBS has maintained buy rating on Bank of Baroda and lowered target price to ₹145 from ₹160. The brokerage likes Bank of Baroda for its high provision coverage and improving core franchise as it would provide it with access to scarce retail deposits and an underserved customer base (cross-selling). It has cut earnings by 11 and 14% respectively in FY19 and FY20 but has maintained buy due to inexpensive valuations and improving operating metrics which doesn’t seem fully priced in at current valuation. 

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and rolled over target price to ₹3,330 from ₹3,200. Dr Reddy’s fourth quarter profit was in-line with our estimate of ₹3 billion after adjusting for a ₹1.8 billion one-time gain linked to the sale of US products, said CLSA. The company has renewed its focus on India, China, and EM and is well positioned to improve performance in these markets in FY20-FY21, said CLSA.

According to a press release from the city-based drug-maker, the detailed safety and efficacy data from the study would be presented in future dermatology conferences.

Senior vice-president and head, proprietary products business of the company, Anil Namboodiripad said PPC-06 is an oral molecule with a novel mechanism of action that has the potential to address unmet medical needs of psoriasis patients.

Further clinical development requirements would be discussed with the US FDA to support the approval of this product, he added.

The most common adverse events (AEs) reported were lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia and gastro-intestinal (GI) disorders, such as diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting.

""Given the positive clinical data in this study, PPC-06 may have a potential to serve as an important therapeutic option for psoriasis patients in a market with limited oral treatments.

13,2019-07-07,Reddy,"Maintaining that pricing pressure will continue in the US market, Dr Reddy's Laboratories has said the company plans to launch several value-added products this fiscal tooffset the persisting problem.

As part of the diversification and new market entry strategy, DRL plans to re-focus some of its Research and Development resources to service the high potential branded generics markets such as China, Russia and other emerging markets.

""We believe that pricing pressures will continue to affect all players in generics in the US. Overcoming this necessitates a robust pipeline of complex formulations with limited competition a pipeline that allows your company to introduce several value-added products each year, and thus make up for price erosions on the earlier launched products,"" K Satish Reddy and GV Prasad, chairman and co-chairman respectively said in the latest annual report.

As many as 110 generic filings awaiting approval from the USFDA and the company has to leverage this and ensure that they succeed in delivering these products, molecule by molecule, to the US on the due dates, they said.

""Given the challenges in the US market, we will continue our efforts to diversify our market presence,"" they said.

The drug maker said it will continue to focus on complex formulations primarily injectables and oral solid dosage forms as well as OTC brands in the medium term, and controlled substances under class II, and non-substitutable generics in the longer term, the report indicated with respect to North America generics.

Despite concerns about a trade war between the US and China, it is not a surprise that China is still viewed as a huge market opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry, the report said.

""We have also grown well in China and expect it to be a relatively high growth market in the next few years,"" it said.

The strategy for growth in emerging markets is to continue improving the company's market share in chosen therapy areas, including expansion of biosimilars and the oncology portfolio.

""We will focus on scaling up in our major markets, which include Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine,"" it said.

The report further said the pharma major will attempt to further strengthen its presence presence in six chosen spaces-United States, India, Russia, China, Global Hospitals including Biosimilars, and the Global API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) business- to drive next level of growth.

""Our target is to attain self-sustainability for each of our business. Despite multiple headwinds being faced by the overall industry, we are cautiously optimistic of improving our performance in FY2020 by calibrating our levers which would suit the business environment better and, thus, guide us to better performance for the year ahead,"" DRL said."

24,2019-07-12,Reddy,"Mumbai: India’s top drug companies are likely to end a period of slow growth, with analysts predicting a double-digit revenue expansion for the just-ended quarter.

A report by brokerage firm Jefferies predicts Indian pharma companies to report 15 per cent growth in revenue in the April-June quarter, the fastest in the past three years, while ratings firm Icra forecasts their revenue to expand 11-13 per cent in fiscal year 2020. They estimate the companies to have benefited from exclusive drug launches, new approvals and, for some, a recovery in India business. On the profitability side, Jefferies predicts a 10 per cent year-on-year profit growth after tax.

Market cap of leading Indian drug makers like Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Dr Reddy's has collectively seen a $1 billion reduction in the past two years, as companies battle stringent regulatory actions from authorities in the US, along with price erosion and tepid drug launches in its most profitable market. But things might be finally turning for better for drug makers, despite underlying challenges.

Jefferies said it expects the US business to be a mixed bag, with some companies faring better than the others over their exclusive drug launches. Domestic growth, it said, would “likely moderate across companies”.

Sun Pharma, which had seen a slowdown in the last two years due to regulatory action, is expected to post a recovery on the back of its increased drug filings and a possible ramp up of specialty drug Ilumya. Cipla, which has been trying to make its mark in the US market, is expected to report a 16 per cent revenue increase with the launch of the generic version of hormone drug Sensipar.

Icra, which tracked 21 drug companies, said moderation in pricing pressure, new launches, consolidation benefits and currency benefit would support their US growth.

“For the US market, companies witnessed positive growth momentum at 21.3 per cent Q4FY2019 and 10.7 per cent FY2019 Vs -13.1 per cent in FY2018,” said Gaurav Jain, the vice-president of corporate ratings at Icra. The firm expects the base business growth for the Indian pharma industry to remain at 11-13 per cent in FY2020 and the credit metrics of leading companies to remain stable in view of future growth prospects in regulated markets and relatively strong balance sheets. “The capital structure and coverage indicators are expected to remain strong despite pressure on profitability and a marginal rise in debt levels given inorganic investments. The key sensitivity to Icra’s view remains productivity of R&D expenditure, increasing competition in the US generics space and operational risk related to increased level of due diligence by regulatory agencies,” it said."

47,2019-07-29,Reddy,"NEW DELHI: After registering a flat opening, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty turned negative on Monday, mirroring depressed sentiments of other Asian markets, as investors anxiously awaited a likely rate cut by the US Fed on Wednesday.

Market sentiment was sombre owing to multiple domestic as well as global factors. Earnings disappointments, concerns over a weakening economy and prolonged liquidity distress in the financial system have dented investors’ risk appetite.

FPIs have been on a selling spree on Dalal Street since the Union Budget.

While there has been pessimism all around, analysts said investors should adopt a stock-specific approach to be able to reap gains and minimise losses. Based on the recommendations of various analysts and brokerages, here is a list of 11 stocks that they say can potentially deliver gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Gajendra Prabu, Senior Technical & Derivatives Analyst, HDFC Securities

SBI Life Insurance | Buy | Target price: Rs 860 | Stop loss: Rs 750This stock has not corrected much in a falling market. In fact, it made a new lifetime high when the fall got extended. Momentum indicators like MACD and KST are looking positive, which can keep the momentum intact. The stock has been forming higher highs and lows, which is a bullish continuation structure. In addition, the stock has been trading above all the key moving averages. ""Traders may look to buy the stock at current market price and add on dips to Rs 770 level for an upside target of Rs 860 over the next 2-3 weeks,"" said Prabu.


Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,630 | Stop loss: Rs 2,360This stock is comparatively strong, compared with its peers in the auto space. It has been forming a contracting triangle (CT) for last 13-14 days, while other stocks have been making lower lows. At this juncture, CT is a bullish development. Technical indicator RSI is showing a positive divergence, which could add to the positive momentum. ""Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price 2,467 for an upside target of Rs 2,630 over the next 2-3 weeks and place a stop loss at Rs 2,360 on a closing basis,"" said Prabu.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Voltas | Buy | Target price: Rs 640 | Stop loss: Rs 567
Unlike the broader market, this counter appears to have bottomed out ahead of others with a low of Rs 568 registered on July 22, indicating better relative strength. With a five-day consolidation around this level, it appears to be positioning itself for a pullback rally. “Positional traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 640, with a stop loss at Rs 567,"" said Mohammad.


SRF | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,647This stock appears to have posted a near-term bottom at the recent low of Rs 2,612 and appears to be on the verge of a pullback as it erased the losses of the past three sessions on last Friday with a strong bullish candle. “There can be an initial hurdle around Rs 2,798 level, but once it manages to close above that level, its momentum shall strengthen further towards Rs 2,900 level,"" said Mohammad.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking

Lupin | Buy | Target price: Rs 830 | Stop loss: Rs 748
After forming a base on the long-term support zone at Rs 720, which has been acting as a strong demand zone for last one year, this stock has started moving higher. ""On the daily chart, we are witnessing a series of higher bottom formations, which indicate a bullish reversal on the strong support zone,"" said Bhosale. Recent volume analysis indicates higher volume during rallies and comparatively low volume during down moves, which indicates accumulation on the counter. In addition, momentum oscillator RSI is placed in the positive zone supporting the buy call.


Power Grid Corporation | Buy | Target price: Rs 227 | Stop loss: Rs 203
In last month, this stock witnessed a strong consolidation by breaking above the barrier of Rs 205 of last two years, which previously acted as a hurdle on four occasions. However, the stock lacked followup buying, as the oscillators were placed in deep overbought territory. At the current juncture, after witnessing a time-wise correction for last few sessions, the stock has resumed a primary uptrend by confirming a range breakout. Momentum oscillator RSI has started moving higher after a minor dip, which suggests a fresh leg of upmove in the near term. ""As the stock is trading in the unchartered territory, it is well above major moving averages, indicating strong optimism,"" Bhosale said.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFC Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,420 | Stop loss: Rs 2,240This stock has seen a price erosion recently and bottomed out near Rs 2,245. The bounceback has been strong with a positive bias, while the RSI has indicated a trend reversal to give a ‘buy’ signal. “With the charts looking attractive, we recommend a ‘buy’ on this stock with an upside target of Rs 2,420, keeping a stop loss of Rs 2,240,"" said Parekh.


Dr Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,575This stock has been in consolidation mode for quite some time and has picked up momentum to cross above the 200-DMA, improving the bias. The RSI has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy.

Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager- Technical Analysis, YES Securities

Federal Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 100-104 | Stop loss: Rs 92On the weekly chart, Federal Bank has taken support at the lower end of the channel pattern, which happens to be the 200-DMA on the daily time frame. Further, the stock has turned higher after halting at the 189 per cent Fibonacci extension level, which signals higher levels in the coming trading sessions. The RSI has turned upward after testing the oversold zone of sub-25 zone, indicating the possibility of the stock touching higher levels in the coming sessions.


LIC Housing Finance | Buy | Target price: Rs 556-580 | Stop loss: Rs 502On the daily chart, LIC Housing Finance is on the verge of a breakout from a channel pattern suggesting bullishness building up in the share. A sustained trade above Rs 530 level will trigger a breakout from the pattern which can take it higher to levels of Rs 556-580. On the weekly chart, it has taken support at an uptrend line, confirming demand at lower levels. Moreover, RSI has formed a positive divergence and turned north indicating at the bullishness in the stock.


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Bajaj Auto | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,740 | Stop loss: Rs 2,540A classic double bottom pattern is seen on the daily chart at Rs 2,500. A reversal high wave candle with a long white candlestick confirms the bottom. The RSI, which was in the oversold zone below 30, has also reversed and is now moving up. ""We expect this to be a short term uptrend with targets of Rs 2,740,"" said Nadeem.


Dr Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,620This stock has bottomed out recently as prices have now moved above the consolidation area it has been in for the last two months.

""On the regulatory front, the API plant at Miryalaguda was given an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) in 2017 resolving the earlier warning letter. We also received EIR for the injectable site at the Duvvada and we are awaiting for CTO VI site at Srikakulam. 

And based on discussions, we expect an inspection ( by the FDA) later this year and hopeful for the resolution of the matter,"" Co-Chairman, Managing Director and CEO GV Prasad told shareholder in the Annual General Meeting held here. 

The USFDA had issued warning letter in November 2015 relating to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) deviations at DR Reddy's API manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam in AP and Miryalaguda in Telangana besides its oncology formulation facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam. 

Regarding the API plant at Miryalaguda, the USFDA reinspected in January 2019, for which the USFDA issued an EIR in May, 2019. 

Similarly, in February 2019, the USFDA issued an EIR for the oncology formulations facility at Duvvada and has determined the inspection classification of this facility as Voluntary Action Initiated (VAI). 

""In March 2019, we responded to the follow-up questions from USFDA regarding the API facility in Srikakulam. 

Based on the subsequent discussion with USFDA, we expect a re-inspection to be conducted for the site,"" Dr Reddy's said in its latest annual report. 

On the pharma industry, Prasad said major players across the world were in turmoil and drug manufacturing companies were under significant pressure because of the pricing environment in the USA. 

According to him, there is also a disruption in the emerging markets as well as new opportunities in China. 

""Healthcare systems around the world are facing huge cost pressures. We believe that these difficult industry situations which look like threats to our industry actually be huge opportunity for focused and efficient players,"" he said. 

He said going forward, Dr Reddy's chalked out three themes for implementation- building strengths in its core businesses of API and generics, streamlining biosimilars and proprietary product business to accelerate their path to profitability and continence of operational excellence across various functions to build world world class competitiveness."

52,2019-07-31,Reddy,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."

The recall started on October 1 after the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) found the presence of NDMA in certain ranitidine products above the permissable levels.

NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen based on results from laboratory tests. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products, and vegetables.

The recall has been initiated at the retail level for over-the-counter products and at the consumer level for prescription products of all of its ranitidine medications sold in the US due to confirmed contamination with NDMA above levels established by the USFDA, Dr Reddy's said in a filing to the BSE.

This recall follows the USFDA's caution note alerting patients and healthcare professionals that NDMA was found in certain samples of ranitidine, it added.

""To date, Dr Reddy's has not received any reports of adverse events related to the recall of Dr Reddy's Ranitidine products. The recall includes all quantities in the US that are within expiry,"" the company said.

All ranitidine products with expiration dated September 2019 to June 2021 are being recalled, it added.

2,2019-11-04,Reddy,"Hyderabad: Dr Reddy's Laboratories, which initiated a voluntary recall of its Ranitidine from the US market following the ongoing investigation by the FDA into the reported carcinogenic impurity in the drug at low levels, has said it made Rs 40 crore towards provisioning, anticipating market impact.

The city-based drug maker in a filing with bourses had said the recall which began on October 1, is at the retail level for over-the-counter (OTC) products and at the consumer level for prescription products of all of its Ranitidine medications sold in the US due to confirmed contamination with N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) above levels established by FDA.

""Following the company's decision to voluntarily recall all of its ranitidine medications sold in the United States due to confirmed contamination with N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) above levels established by the US FDA, the company recognised Rs 231 million as inventory write downs towards semi-finished and finished inventory of ranitidine during the three months ended September 30, 2019.

Further, an amount of Rs 170 million is recognised as a possible refund liability (as a reduction from revenue) arising out of the company's decision to recall the said product,"" Dr Reddy's said in a regulatory filing.

Dr Reddy's CEO Erez Israeli in a recent investor call said the company's North America generics recorded sales of USD 202 million for the quarter and declined by 1 per cent year-over-year and 14 per cent on a sequential quarter basis.

The sequential decline was primarily driven by certain issues impacting the quarter such as provisions related to nationwide recall of Ranitidine product due to NDMA impurities limits following FDA's caution note regarding the same, he said.

""We now have completely suspended the sales of Ranitidine OTC and Rx product (prescription). And, logistics-related challenges leading to temporary disruption in supply, which has been addressed since. We expect the sales run rate to normalise from Q3 onwards,"" the official said.

NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests.

NDMA is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products and vegetables."

Sudarshan Chemicals with a target price of Rs 420. The brokerage is positive on the stock due to a long growth runway, multiple opportunities for marketshare gains and strong evolution of capabilities (R&D, compliances, sales network). Lack of credible Indian players will expedite market-share gains for Sudarshan given capacity shifts from China/ Europe, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 0.7 per cent at Rs 404.45 on Tuesday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has retained add rating on 
JK Lakshmi Cement citing attractive valuation and revised fair value to Rs 350 from Rs 357. The company's EBITDA in the second quarter was above estimate with higher realizations led by a favourable regional mix, said KIE. Asset sweating should help deleverage in FY20-21 but growth capital expenditure is expected to resume from H2 of FY21 with announcement of brownfield expansion in FY21, said Kotak. The stock ended down 0.3 per cent at Rs 306.30 on Tuesday.


• HSBC has maintained hold rating on
 Dr Reddy's Laboratories and revised target price to Rs 2760 from Rs 2750. The brokerage said it is seeing gradual improvement in the pace of US launches for Dr Reddy's. However, it continues to face high price erosion in some of key base products and delay in approval of key opportunities like generic of NuvaRing and Copaxone, making sales from new launches more demanding. HSBC said ongoing efforts in the other key business segments of India, Russia, China, API and global hospital segments will take a while to show results. The stock ended up 0.7 per cent at Rs 2815.35 on Tuesday.

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on 
Varun Beverages with a target price of Rs 860. Varun Beverages remains CLSA's preferred pick given strong growth momentum, upside from recently concluded acquisitions, and financial leverage. Weak season, sharp rise in input prices and aggressive international acquisition are key risks, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 11.4 per cent at Rs 701.80 on Tuesday.

• Citigroup has cut target price on 
Bharat Electronics while maintaining a buy rating. The company's sales in the second quarter fell 19 per cent from year ago levels likely due to slowerthan-expected execution pace in the large LR-SAM order, said Citigroup. The brokerage said the sales miss is not a cause of concern given the robust backlog of Rs 55,100 crore. The company has won orders worth Rs 9100 crore in first half of FY20 and remains on track to meet FY20 guidance of wins worth Rs 13000-15000 crore, said Citi. The stock ended down 5.8 per cent at Rs 112.50 on Tuesday."

13,2019-12-12,Reddy,"MADRID: With the BASIC nations - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - virtually threatening rich countries of derailment of outcome of the current UN climate conference (COP25) due to the latter's failure to deliver on past promises, the European Union (EU) on Wednesday suddenly announced its 'Green Deal' with an objective to achieve 'net-zero' emission by 2050 - a move seen by participants as an attempt to put the emerging economies back on track for higher ambition goal by next year.


It is learnt that the BASIC joint statement, saying ""the progress on the pre-2020 agenda will be the benchmark of success for this COP"", sounded an alarm bell in the EU camp which has been resisting linking of Kyoto Protocol pledges (pre-2020) with the progress on Paris Agreement (post-2020) actions.

Expressing grave concern on the ""current imbalance in the negotiations"" due to differences between developed and developing nations, the BASIC countries said, ""Commitments made by developed countries in the pre-2020 period must be honoured, because the completion of the pre-2020 agenda is of critical importance in building the basis for mutual trust and ambition in the post-2020 period."" 


Noting that ""there has been a lack of progress on the pre-2020 agenda, adaptation and issues related to means of implementation support, in the form of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building support"", the BASIC nations said, ""This imbalance needs to be immediately rectified, in the interests of a successful conference outcome and achieving the global goals in the Paris Agreement.""


The EU (28 nations), on its part, rushed through its 'Green Deal' proposing a European 'Climate Law' enshrining the 2050 climate neutrality objective by March 2020 and presenting a plan by mid next year to increase the EU's climate (emission reduction) target for 2030 to at least 50% and towards 55% from its 1990 levels. 


All these back-to-back development happened on the day when two key reports on business entities caught attention of participants here at COP25 for galvanising countries into action to deal with climate crisis. The COP venue also witnessed a massive protests by activists, demanding higher ambition (emission cut targets) from countries.


The first report - appeared in journal Environmental Research Letters - reflected the negative aspect of private/public entities' roles in climate crisis showing how 88 companies from across the globe, including three - ONGC, Coal India Limited and Singareni Collieries Company Limited - from India, are responsible for most of the acidification of the world's oceans threatening marine life and disrupting food chains while second one - released by the UN Global Compact - pointed out how positively 177 companies, including six from India, aligned themselves with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels by reaching 'net-zero' emissions by 2050.

The Indian companies in the 'net-zero' emission list of 177 includes Mahindra Group, Wipro, Dalmia Cement, Bharti Airtel, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Reliance Jio Infocomm. ""The 177 companies collectively represent over 5.8 million employees, spanning 36 sectors and with headquarters in 36 countries. The companies have a combined market capitalization of over US$2.8 trillion, and represent annual direct emissions equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France, "" said the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), special initiative of the UN secretary-general, in a statement.

""I am encouraged that 177 major companies have committed to set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius future through the 'Business Ambition for 1.5°C' campaign. By stepping up and setting science-based targets, these companies are pioneering new ways of doing business and driving systemic change throughout the global economy,"" said the UN Secretary-General António Guterres at an event here at COP25 venue.

Most of the countries are, however, not keen on announcing such ambition by next year. Asked about unwillingness of countries to do it, Sunita Narain, environmentalist and director general of the New Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""It's a sign of how distrustful and divisive are the climate negotiations. All countries realise the urgency and need for urgent action but given the state of distrust and the fact that developed countries have reneged on all their commitments this is what is happening."" 

The European climate experts, on the other hand, appeared quite enthused of what the EU proposed on Wednesday. “The European Green Deal is a once-in-a-generation transformational opportunity to ensure the EU embarks upon a socially inclusive ecological transition to a net-zero economy, one that delivers tangible benefits to its citizens. This is our chance for a new social contract and building a fairer and more sustainable economy and society,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and one of the French diplomats who drafted the Paris Agreement in 2015."

19,2019-12-17,Reddy,"In times when markets trade at high valuations and it becomes difficult to gauge its direction, it makes sense to stay invested with balanced advantage or dynamic asset allocation schemes.

Depending upon the valuation of markets, balanced advantage schemes allocate 40-60% of their portfolios to equities and the remaining portion in arbitrage and debt products. This flexibility helps to a considerable extent to tide over the prevailing uncertainties in the markets, especially in the long term.

Among balanced advantage schemes, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund is the top performer in the past five-year and 10-year periods. It has given returns of 9.2% and 12% in the past five-year and 10-year periods, respectively, when its peers generated average returns of 8.9% and 9.7% over the same time periods. The scheme’s fund managers S Naren, Rajat Chandak, and Dharmesh Kakkad have constructed a balanced and well-diversified portfolio which includes a fair amount of well-placed large- and blue-chip companies and AAA-rated debt securities. Retail investors may consider adding this scheme to the portfolio with an investment horizon of at least five years as such schemes tend to do well only in the long term.

Expert Take

Vishal Dhawan, Founder, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors
An excellent scheme that has performed over a long period. Ideal for conservative investors. They can invest lump sum. The flexibility in shifting investments from equity to debt and vice versa depending upon the attractiveness of each asset class suits retail investors. To a large extent, this flexibility helps protect the portfolio value better in a down market."

21,2019-12-19,Reddy,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Emkay Global has a sell rating on 
Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) with a target price of Rs 2,580 after Prasco announced the authorised generic launch of Nuvaring. This is the second generic launch for the product within a week’s time, the brokerage said. The drug is one of the key expected launches for DRL in FY21, but launches by competitors earlier than the company could affect the product economics, it said. Shares of DRL ended up 1.6 per cent at Rs 2,873.75 on Wednesday.

• Morgan Stanley has an equalweight rating on 
Bank of Baroda with a target price of Rs 100 after the bank disclosed its divergence details on asset quality and provisioning for FY19. The remaining provisioning divergence at Rs 2,600 crore amounts to 2.7 per cent of FY20 book value (post tax basis) and around 55 per cent of FY20 PBT, said Morgan Stanley. The bank hasn’t provided details on the nature of this provisioning divergence, it said. Shares of Bank of Baroda ended down 3.3 per cent at Rs 98.9 on Wednesday.


• Anand Rathi has initiated coverage on
 Dixon Technologies (India) with a target price of Rs 5,822. Ideally placed to cater to mounting demand across multiple categories in the rapidly growing consumer durables sector, Dixon’s scale and size give it an edge, said Anand Rathi. The brokerage has modelled 24 per cent and 32 per cent CAGRs over FY20-22 in revenue and PAT, respectively, resulting in the RoCE expanding from 26 per cent in FY19 to around 36 per cent in FY21 and FY22. Shares of Dixon Technologies ended up 2 per cent at Rs 3,623.65 on Wednesday.

• Haitong Securities India has initiated coverage on 
Finolex Industries with a target price of Rs 700. Finolex enjoys a dominant position in India’s agri pipe market due to its competitive edge in backward integration (PVC resin), established brand image and strong distribution network in rural market, said Haitong. While Ebitda is projected to remain relatively stable over FY19-FY22, the quality of profit could improve on rising contribution from product business, it said. Shares of Finolex ended down 1.55 per cent at Rs 541.45 on Wednesday.

• HSBC has retained buy rating on 
Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 260. The management clearly stated its intention not to infuse further capital in Idea, said HSBC. The management believes the issues marring the telecom sector are too big to be solved by further capital infusion, it said. Rising contribution from Novelis and potential merger with Aleris, which is not in the base case, make Hindalco a compelling investment case, HSBC said. Shares of Hindalco Industries ended down 0.1 per cent at Rs 213.50 on Wednesday."
