6,2018-01-21,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Grasim Industries has received green nod for expanding the production of manmade fibre VSF at Bharuch, Gujarat that would entail an investment of Rs 2,560 crore, according to an official document.

The company has four VSF (Viscose Staple Fibre) plants in India, of which two are located in Gujarat, one each in Kharach and Vilayat in Bharuch district.

As per the proposal, the company's Grasim Cellulosic Division wants to expand its Vilayat plant.

In a letter issued to the Grasim Industries, the Union environment ministry has said it has given the environment clearance to the company's proposal on expansion of Vilayat unit subject to compliance of certain conditions.

The company's proposal is to increase the production capacity of VSF from 1,27,750 tonnes per annum (TPA) to Rs 2,55,500 TPA. It also wants to set up a production facility of Solvent Spun Cellulosic Fibre with a capacity of 36,500 TPA.

10,2018-01-30,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: With the Nifty50 rejig likely in the third week of February, brokerage Edelweiss Securities has come up with a list of possible stocks up for inclusion in the NSE barometer.

The list included Titan, one of Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's favourite stocks.

Jhunjhunwala and his better half, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, together held 8.45 per cent stake in the maker of jewellery, watches and eyewear as of December 31 (up from 8.06 per cent in September quarter), which at Monday's price was worth Rs 6,700 crore.

Other analysts, too, are gung-ho on the stock. As many as 25 of 31 analysts tracking the stock on Reuters' Eikon either have a strong ‘buy’ or ‘buy’ recommendations, four have ‘hold' and just two of recommend 'sell' ratings.

Analysts said the owner of jewellery brands such as Tanishq, Zoya and Mia has a strong balance sheet. Besides, it has healthy cash flow from operations, robust return ratios and has no debt on its books.

Rising share of studded jewellery, cost optimisation and operating leverage are likely to aid margins at the firm, analysts said.

The recent aggression to capitalise on opportunities across divisions is heartening. Earnings CAGR is likely to be a massive 36 per cent over FY17-20. The sheer scale of top-line opportunity demands premium valuations, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a recent note.

The stock has surged 146 per cent in last one year. Yet, analysts see scope for further upside.

Titan has been a key beneficiary of migration from unorganised to organised players driven by recent regulatory changes such as gold hallmarking and GST, which is evident from sustained market share gains, ICICI Securities said in a note.

Its business model has the inherent strength that would enable it to capitalise on larger opportunities like wedding jewellery and gain significant share in the segment, thereby providing impetus to revenue, profit growth, the brokerage said in a note.

Ambit Capital expects the jewellery maker's earnings to grow at 33 per cent annually over FY17-22. Even after this, Titan would still command only 8 per cent market share in the jewellery space and 5 per cent in wedding jewellery. This long growth runway implies Titan will continue to command punchy valuations and, hence, current valuation of 53 times FY19E EPS is inexpensive, the brokerage said.

The jewellery industry has grown at 13 per cent CAGR over FY07-17 and its size is pegged at Rs 2,50,000 crore, compared with Titan’s FY17 revenue of Rs 10,400 crore.

Besides jewellery, Titan retails watches and accessories through World of Titan, Helios and Fastrack stores.

The company also offers sunglasses, contact lenses and frames and retails them through Titan Eye Plus stores. The review looks at liquidity, free-float market cap, trading frequency, domicile and availability on the F&O segment as some of the criteria to pick stocks for the Nifty50 pack.

Bajaj Finserv and Grasim Industries are other two stocks, which are likely to be included in the February rejig. Bosch, Ambuja Cements and Aurobindo Pharma are the three stocks that may make way for the likely new index constituents."
9,2018-01-30,Grasim,"Mumbai: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan Company are likely to replace Bosch, Ambuja Cement and Aurobindo Pharma in the Nifty50 index soon, said analysts at Edelweiss Securities and IDBI Capital Markets & Securities.

These changes are likely to be made in the upcoming semi-annual review of the Nifty index, the brokerages said. The index is reviewed on a half-yearly basis and a fourweek notice is given to the market before making changes to the index. Edelweiss expects the index changes to be announced by the third week of February and the same to be effective on March 30.

The inclusion of Grasim, Bajaj Finserv and Titan will lead to buying of 59.8 lakh shares, 9.2 lakh shares and 63.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

At current prices, it would mean buying of Rs 707.2 crore in Grasim, Rs 451.8 crore in Bajaj Finserv and Rs 567.9 crore in Titan.

Conversely, the exclusion of Bosch, Ambuja and Aurobindo Pharma will lead to selling of 1.4 lakh, 1.13 crore and 43.3 lakh shares, respectively, said Edelweiss.

There are certain criteria that determine the inclusion and exclusion of a stock from the Nifty index, including liquidity, float adjusted market capitalisation, domicile and trading frequency.

For inclusion in the index, a security should have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less during the last six months, for 90 per cent of the observations for portfolio of Rs 10 crore. Impact cost is a measure of liquidity of a stock and reflects the costs faced when actually trading an index.

Companies will be included if free-float market capitalisation is 1.50 times the freefloat market capitalisation of the smallest constituent in respective index. These stocks must be available for trade in the futures and options segment and the company must be domiciled in India.

The company’s trading frequency should be 100 per cent in the last six months.

Following these changes, the weightage of sectors in the Nifty is also likely to change. The weightage of financial services will increase to 35.9 per cent from 35.5 per cent and that of cement and cement products will rise to 2.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent, said IDBI Capital in its report.

The weightage of consumer goods will rise to 10.1 per cent from 9.4 per cent, while that of pharmaceutical sector will come down to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent, the brokerage added.

The last revision in index constituents took place on September 29, 2017, when ACC, Bank of Baroda, Tata Power and Tata Motors DVR shares were excluded. They were replaced by Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and UPL."
0,2018-02-01,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: After a sharp jump in volatility as a knee-jerk reaction to Budget proposals, sanity came back to the market. Market watchers though were left disappointed with the reintroduction of long-term capital gains tax and fiscal slippages.

After cracking over 400 points immediately after the LTCG announcement, Sensex recovered most of the losses to end marginally lower by 58 points.

Market pundits called the Budget balanced and advised investors to look out for stars emerging out of Budget proposals.

“All Is Well,” tweeted smallcap czar Poriju Veliyath. The market expert added that one should forget the Budget and start focusing on stock picking.

“There was no major disappointment in the Budget proposals. On overall basis, long-term capital gains tax doesn’t look that dampening and revenue growth assumptions are looking realistic. Investors should focus on sectors/stocks having agri or rural theme,"" said Hemang Jani, Head Equity Sales & Advisory at Sharekhan.

Jani said the Budget announcements will be positive for companies such as Escorts, Ashok Leyland, M&M, PI Industries and UPL.

In an interview to ET Now, Pawan Goenka of Mahindra & Mahindra said the rural focus could lead to higher demand that we have for both equipment as well as on the agri input side.

The expert said that Apollo Tyre could gain on raising of custom duty on truck bus radial tyres from 10 to 15 percent to benefit the company. No bad news is a good news for cigarette company like ITC.

B Gopkumar, Executive Director & CEO at Reliance Securities said that Budget 2018 had a strong focus on infrastructure development, which is in line with the expectations.

FM has allocated an extra budgetary support of Rs 5.97 lakh crore against Rs 3.96 lakh crore in last Budget for infrastructure sector. However, road construction for FY19E pegged at 9,000 km was a tad lower than the earlier guidance given by the road ministry.

""We understand higher allocation in infrastructure segment will essentially expedite infrastructure development in the country, which in turn will aid many industries i.e. metals, cement, building materials, "" Gopkumar said.

Insurance sector is seen gaining from the introduction of universal health insurance that includes Rs 5 lakh cover for 10 crore vulnerable families or 50 crore Indians.

Crucial rural impetus along with continued allocation to infra and a heavy focus on health care,"" Devam Modi, Director of Equirus Securities.

Sanjeev Jain, Associate Vice President of Ashika Stock Broking said, “In this Budget government tried to create structural and sustained demand. We are positive on companies like ICICI Prudential given the world's largest health insurance scheme the government has announced.”

“Major focus of the Budget was on rural economy that may benefit companies which have strong presence in hinterland like ITC, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra and Grasim Industries. JK Tyre is looking good in tyre sector, while L&T is looking attractive in the infrastructure space,” Jain added.

The Budget has not addressed the proposal for reducing GST rates on electric vehicles. This may not be good for Tata Motors and other car makers looking create mass e-vehicles market.

Analysts noted that budget has proposed creation of affordable housing fund under NHB. This will benefit all affordable housing players like Mahindra Lifespace, Ashiana Housing etc. It will also have positive impact on affordable housing financiers like Gruh Finance, DHFL and Can Fin Homes, says Reliance Securities. KNR Construction, J Kumar, NCC are major plays play on infrastructure theme, it said. The move on healthcare is also expected to benefit hospital chains like Apollo Hospitals and Narayana Hrudyalay. Besides, it will have positive rub off impact on companies like Thyrocare and Dr. Lal Path Labs. Insurance companies will also benefit because of insurance premium received towards coverage of families.

We understand higher allocation in infrastructure segment will essentially expedite infrastructure development in the country, which in turn will aid many industries i.e. metals, cement, building materials, Reliance Securities said. The brokerage believes that construction companies such as KNR Construction, J Kumar and NCC are a majo infra play. The brokerage also expect cement companies such as JK Cement and Sagar Cement to benefit from infra push..

Auto component makers are likely to gain as custom duty on select parts has been raised from 7.5-10 per cent to 15 per cent. 

A higher 20 per cent custom duty has been imposed compared with 10 per cent earlier. Custom duty on footwear parts too has been raised to 15 per cent from 10 per cent."

HEARD ON D-STREETThere may be a case for indexation benefit for the LTCG levy."
3,2018-02-11,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market witnessed highly volatile trade during the week gone by. Selloff on Wall Street amid fears of rising inflation, higher interest rates and a spike in US Treasury yields engulfed stock markets globally, including in India.

On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex shed 407 points to close at 34,006 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) lost over 1 per cent, or 122 points, to settle at 10,455. On a weekly basis, the Nifty50 lost 2.84 per cent while the 30-share Sensex pack declined 3.02 per cent.

Among key highlights of the week, RBI kept the repo rate unchanged in its sixth bimonthly money policy review on Wednesday while maintaining a neutral stance. However, it did flag concerns on inflation.

From the earnings corner, country's largest public sector lender SBI took everyone by surprise when it reported a massive quarterly loss on the back of a spike in provisions towards bad loan and hardening of bond yields, which led to treasury losses. On the other hand, steel giant Tata Steel's Q3 net jumped five-fold to Rs 1,136 crore from Rs 232 crore reported for same period last year.

Here's a look at the events and triggers that may decide market direction next week. The market will remain closed on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, on account of Mahashivratri.


Global cues hold keyMovement in US stocks and in Asian markets will be watched keenly. On Friday, US equities ended higher, but posted their worst weekly loss in two years.

The benchmark S&P500 fell 5.2 per cent for the week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. Asian indices such as Nikkei and Hang Seng also witnessed heavy selloff.


Nifty may rally when volatility easesNifty's recent gap-down openings suggested fear among the traders, but post such openings, the market did not witness follow-through selling at least for that day, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. ""This kind of behaviour points to some accumulation at intraday low points. Hence, there will be a higher possibility of a rally once volatility subsides in global financial markets,"" Mazhar added. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said if the index manages to cross and hold above 10,500, a bounceback towards 10,600 and 10,650 levels cannot be ruled out.

Misra will assume his third position starting April 1. He is taking over from KK Maheshwari, the former managing director of Aditya Birla Chemicals who moved to lead the group’s UltraTech Cement business two years back. 

Misra said there will be no trouble managing three portfolios at the group, which shuffles, expands and sharpens responsibilities of senior management frequently. “I have very stable and competent teams at HR and Carbon Black. They know the deliverables, quality standards, professionalism expected. Once the expectations are set, life becomes easier,” Misra told ET.

“It (giving him another responsibility) has nothing to do with paucity of senior talent.” The $43 billion conglomerate also hired Kalyan Madabhushi from Shell as the business head of the chemicals sector. Madabhushi, formerly the global general manager for chemicals at Royal Dutch Shell, will report to Misra, who was one of Kumar Mangalam Birla's earliest hires and has been with the group for 22 years now.

Aditya Birla Chemicals makes bulk and speciality chemicals and viscose filament yarn. The business is spread across 16 manufacturing locations in four countries: India, Thailand, Germany and China. Its India business was merged with Grasim in 2015."

The S&P BSE Sensex gained 141 points to settle the session at 33,844, with TCS (up 3 per cent) being the top gainer and Sun Pharma (down 6 per cent) the worst laggard. The broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had a touch-and-go moment with the 10,400 level.

The index eventually failed to top that level and settled 37 points higher at 10,397. Out of the 50 components, 29 advanced while 21 slipped. 

“After a consecutive downtrend, the market today managed to close on a positive note due to the outperformance of the IT index and a rebound in PSU bank stocks. Investors are waiting for fresh triggers to get direction. Quarterly earnings showed a pickup but concerns over inflation and possible rate hike in the US may keep the pressure,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The market breadth remained in favour of declines with the advance-decline ratio pegged at 1:2. Here’s a look at the top newsmakers of the session:


IT stocks log big gains
The day belonged to IT players, as the Nifty IT pack surged over 2 per cent to 12,660 with nine out of 10 constituents ending in the green. A slew of factors such as a fall in the rupee, Nasscom’s prediction that revenue from software services exports will rise 7-9 per cent and change in CLSA’s model portfolio where the brokerage raised the IT sector to neutral from underweight and gave wings to IT companies. Big boys such as TCS (up over 3 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 3.54 per cent) and HCL Tech (up 4 per cent) were shining spots in the pack.




Sun Pharma catches cold
Shares of drug major Sun Pharma cracked over 6 per cent to settle at Rs 524 apiece on BSE. The stock dragged the Nifty Pharma index lower, which closed 2 per cent down at 8,843. Other culprits in the pack included Cipla (down 1 per cent), GlaxoSmithKline (down 1 per cent) and Aurobindo Pharma (down 1 per cent). 




Spurt in open interest
Shares of Bharti Infratel witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest at 65.05 per cent. Grasim Industries (46.42 per cent) and Godrej Consumer Products (46.14 per cent) grabbed the second and third slot, respectively.




Gruh Finance on a high

In the intraday trade, the stock jumped 9 per cent to hit a high of Rs 554.90. 




Fear eases
India VIX, the fear guage, saw a sharp decline of 5.61 per cent to 15.92, suggesting normalcy is returning to the market. The India VIX index is a volatility index that is a broad measure of the market’s expectation of volatility over the near term.




Banks recover
After creating a kind of pandemonium among investors, financial stocks got back to recovery path. The Nifty PSU Bank index, which has seen relentless selloff in the last few days, today climbed over 1 per cent to settle at 3,170.70, with 7 out of 12 constituents ending in the green.

""Nifty recovered smartly from day's lows and made a Hammer Candle on the daily scale, which indicates that decline is being bought after the recent sharp decline in the market.

Rollovers in focus

 As per brokerage Edelweiss Securities, stocks such as Coal India, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki and Vedanta will be in focus on the F&O expiry day. Here's what the brokerage said on the stocks:


Coal India: At 35 per cent, Coal India 
rollovers are lower than expected. Akin to the trend seen in last expiry, dividend expectations have led to futures trading at a discount to cash, the brokerage noted.

""The stock has seen reverse arbitrage positions (sell cash and buy futures) being set up. With the street expecting a hefty dividend payout, the counter is rolling at -645bps (cost to short roller). With the expectations of dividend in the next month, long future holders will opt to buy the inventory in the VWAP,"" the brokerage said. VWAP stands for volume weighted average market price. 


Vedanta: At 52 per cent rollovers on this counter too are low. A total 21.9 million shares are outstanding in the near month, which is 2.1 days' average daily volume in cash the market. With the street sensing dividend in Mar or April, Edelweiss expects long future holders to convert the positions to cash. 


ICICI Bank: At 44 per cent 
rollovers, the counter has fresh arbitrage positions (buy cash and sell futures). Roll levels in the counter are 39 basis points (profit to short rollers) which is lower. If levels don’t pick up, we expect short rollers to sell cash in the VWAP, the brokerage said. 


Maruti Suzuki: Fresh arbitrage positions (buy cash and sell futures) have been set up. Roll levels in the counter are 48 bps (profit to short rollers) which is lower. If levels don’t pick up, we expect short rollers to sell cash in the VWAP, Edelweiss Securities said. The counter has seen 52 per cent 
rollovers so far."

19,2018-02-26,Grasim,"Karnataka’s solar programme has received two setbacks in quick succession: its latest solar auction for 1200 MW has been postponed, while the results of an earlier one for 860 MW have been stayed by the Karnataka High Court.

Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL) invited bids for 1200 MW of projects at the Pavagada Solar Park in Tumkur district on January 31 this year, setting out dates through February on which various stages of the auction would be held. But on February 22, it issued a notice saying the earlier auction notice had been recalled and set fresh dates for the auction in early March.

The reason it had to do so was because hardly any developers responded. Azure Power and Shapoorji Pallonji, both of whom had put in bids for 100 MW at the auction, received identical notices saying the tender had been recalled “due to minimal number of responses”. It emerged that these two were the only ones who bid -- seeking a mere 200 MW together -- in the 1200 MW auction.

KREDL’s fresh auction announcement includes a long “addendum” which relaxes a number of the conditions set in the earlier tender, which suggests that it was these stiff conditions which restrained developers from bidding. While the earlier bid documents gave developers eight months to complete their projects from the date of receiving their letters of allotment (LoAs), for example, the new one provides 10 months’ time. Similarly, the maximum time allowed for achieving commercial operations before the developer’s performance guarantee is encashed has been extended from 12 to 14 months.

However, not all the concerns of developers have been addressed. “We did not bid in the Karnataka auction because the bid documents do not include the provision for tariff change if there is a change in law,” said Vikram Kailas, CEO and Managing Director, Mytrah Energy. With the Director General Safeguards having recommended 70% ‘safeguard duty’ on solar equipment imports and the Director General, anti-dumping, also conducting an enquiry into whether anti-dumping duty should be imposed on these imports, developers are worried that their input costs could go up sharply in the near future, thereby affecting their financials unless the tariff is correspondingly raised. About 90% of solar panels and modules used in Indian solar projects are imported, mostly from China.

At the same time, the earlier 860 MW solar auction held by KREDL on February 3 has come under a cloud with Grasim Industries -- part of the Aditya Birla Nuvo Group -- moving the Karnataka High Court against it, saying it had put in its bid and also paid the required deposit of Rs 10 lakh, but due to a technical glitch, its bid was never uploaded and thereby remained excluded from the shortlist of bidders. The auction for projects across 43 talukas of Karnataka saw 11 winners in all, with winning bids ranging from Rs 2.94 to Rs 3.54 per unit. Shapoorji Pallonji, Acme Solar and ReNew Power were the three biggest winners.

With the petition being admitted on February 8, five days after the tenders had been opened and results announced, the court directed KREDL “not to proceed further from the stage at which the tender process has reached as on today”."

The Nifty50 index opened with a gap down and remained highly volatile throughout Wednesday. It fell towards the 10,460 level, but recovered from the lows and formed a Doji candle on the daily chart.

The formation of a Doji candle after the decline of last session indicates that both the bulls and bears are fighting hard to get a grip on the market. 

Now, the Nifty50 has to cross and hold above 10,550 to witness a bounceback towards its major hurdle at 10,620 while holding below 10,500 could extend its decline towards the next support at 10,430, and then 10,400 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,400 followed by 10,300, while maximum Call open interest was at 10,700 followed by 11,000. Fresh Call writing was seen at strike price 10,900 followed by 10,500 while fresh Put writing was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,400. 

The option band signified a trading range between 10,400 and 10,630 marks. 

India VIX slipped 0.83 per cent to 13.80.

Bank Nifty opened with a gap down by more than 250 points and continued its weakness for the second consecutive session. It recovered partially from the day’s low but, the bears put pressure at higher levels.

The index formed a long-legged Doji on the daily chart, which implies indecision in the market. It also formed an Island Reversal pattern on the daily chart, which suggests that bears are in a powerful position to drag the market to lower levels.

Overall, candle patterns indicate limited upside and volatile swings in the coming days. As long as the Nifty50 holds below 25,350, further weakness can drag it towards 24,750, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 25,500 and then 25,750 levels.

Nifty futures closed with a loss of 0.42 per cent at 10,520. Long buildup was seen in Bharti Infratel, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, IDBI, MRF, Ashok Leyland, Mindtree and Granules, while shorts were seen in Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Bank of India, Godrej Consumers, M&M Finance, BHEL, Grasim and Colgate Palmolive..

2,2018-03-14,Grasim,"The domestic stock market saw heavy consolidation on Wednesday. It made a negative opening, dipped lower in the first half of the session, and then recovered over 75 points from the low point of the day.

The Nifty still ended the day with a minor loss of 15.95 points or 0.15 per cent. The index continued to consolidate near its 100-DMA, and also deliberated there and halted its pullback on expected lines.

At present, it remains in a trading zone without any directional bias, and it is likely to remain this way for some more time.

On Thursday, the Nifty is unlikely to breach its pattern low of the 10,275-mark, as also a possibility of runway upmove seems remote.



In all likelihood, it may continue to consolidate before it prepares to move past the 100-DMA, which rests at 10458. The levels of 10,450 and 10,485 will act as immediate resistance levels for the market. Supports come in at 10,365 and 10,320 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 47.4862. This indicator remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish as it trades above its signal line. A long lower shadow occurred on the candles. However, in the present context and looking at the place it occurred, it remains insignificant to draw any conclusions for it.

The pattern analysis continues to show Nifty in the trading range. This range is formed with the lower range support of 10,275 and upper range extending itself 10,600 with the levels of 100-DMA lying exactly in between.

Overall, it is beyond doubt that the Nifty tested its 100-DMA and showed minor corrective tendencies after that. However, it clearly continues to exhibit the underlying positive bias.

Also, the broader market indices have continued to show resilience, while the sectors have consolidated.

We expect such rangebound consolidation to continue. However, we also expect that despite some amount of volatility and some continued consolidation, there are greater chances of Nifty moving past the 100-DMA mark closing in short time.

We continue to reiterate a cautious but positive outlook in the market for the immediate the short term.

Jayashree Textiles is a leading manufacturer of linen yarn and fabric as well as merino wool. 

""We are expecting a steep fall in EBIDTA margins between 2015-16 and 2017-18, particularly after the implementation of GST (Goods and Services Tax),"" the company official said. 

In the last fiscal, the division's revenue stood at Rs 1,700 crore. 

He said that pre-GST, Chinese players had effected a 23 per cent price drop which was making the company's products uncompetitive in the domestic market. 

The source told that post-GST, Chinese imports were getting a 15 per cent offset in the value chain which was taking the effective drop in selling price to 38 per cent. 

""This situation has made things very difficult for us and the company and other domestic manufacturers had written to both the commerce and industry ministries to take remedial measures against cheap Chinese imports,"" he said. 

He said that the only way was increasing productivity and the company had introduced modern and high-speed machines at its Rishra unit in West Bengal to facilitate it. 

Linen Club branded stores, which sells the company's apparel and yarn, was on an expansion mode across the country. 

""There are 180 Linen Club stores in the country now. We plan to add 30 to 35 stores each year. All the stores were run on franchisee basis,"" the source said."

A busy political calendar aside, earnings growth should revive in FY19 after three years of flattish earnings on account of various disruptions (GST, demonetisation, RERA, NCLT).

“A cleanup of banking system and resolution of few NCLT cases will inspire confidence in the earnings recovery story. Consumption recovery is firmly in place in our view and we are seeing some very early signs of private capex revival,” said Duggad.

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet on April 4-5 for the first bimonthly monetary policy review of 2018-2019, with the decision due on April 5 (Thursday). The central bank is likely to keep the monetary policy steady at the meeting, but shift to a hawkish stance. It will raise interest rates early in 2019, as inflation pressures build, economists said in an analysts’ poll.

At its last meeting on February 7, RBI kept the repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate at 6.25 per cent, each.


Macro data
A number of macroeconomic numbers are slated for release next week. The Nikkei India Manufacturing PMI data for March will be released on April 2. India’s manufacturing activity declined to a four-month low in February. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 52.1 in February from 52.4 in January.

Markit Economics will unveil the result of a monthly survey on the performance of India’s services sector in March 2018 on Wednesday, April 4. The seasonally-adjusted Nikkei India services purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in February from 51.7 in January.


What do tech charts say?
The Nifty50 index on Wednesday came under selling pressure and formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, suggesting weakness in the market. On the weekly chart, the index formed a Harami candle, which indicated that the bulls were not ready to lead, even after a major downtrend. “If the index sustains below 10,141, a fresh push could take it towards 10,050 level. On the upside, a major hurdle is seen at 10,222,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

Angel Broking expects the Nifty50 to see resistance in the 10,230-10,350 range next week. It sees support for the index at 10,049, followed by 9,951 level.


ICICI Bank crisis
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has questioned few ICICI Bank officials as part of a preliminary enquiry to find if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank issuing a Rs 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012. Media reports this past week alleged that Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot invested Rs 64 crore ($9.83 million) in Nu Power Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, after Videocon secured a loan from a consortium of banks, including ICICI Bank.


Auto stocks in focus
Auto shares will be in the limelight as the companies will start releasing monthly sales numbers for March 2018 from April 1. Vehicle sales maintained their upward momentum in February, backing up India’s revival story. Automakers reported steady growth with new models such as Maruti Suzuki Swift, Hyundai Verna and Tata Nexon pushing up sales numbers.


Stock-specific action
Many stock-specific actions are likely to play a key role in determining market direction. Ambuja Cements, Aurobindo Pharma and Bosch will be excluded from the benchmark Nifty50 with effect from April 2. They will be replaced by Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan. These replacements will also be applicable to the Nifty50 Equal Weight index, said a PTI report. 

This apart, IndianOil plans to invest Rs 1.43 lakh crore ($22 billion) over next five years, as it seeks to raise annual capacity to about 3.2 million barrels per day by 2030. The company currently owns and operates 11 out of the country’s 23 refineries, with a total capacity of 80.7 million tonnes per annum.


Crude prices rising
Oil prices rose on Thursday as the producer cartel Opec and other suppliers look set to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019. US WTI crude futures were at $64.57 a barrel at 0242 GMT, up 19 cents, or 0.2 per cent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were at $69.72 per barrel, up 19 cents, or 0.3 per cent, Reuters reported. Major US financial markets including commodities were closed on Friday on account of Good Friday.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward movement, and vice-versa.



However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

Market participants should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm such trends.

Retail investors should consult financial advisers before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers in seven stocks on NSE, which meant a ‘buy’ signal. 

They included Kwality, KPIT Technologies, Grasim Industries, Eris Lifesciences, Johnson Controls- Hitachi Air Conditioning India, Dalmia Bharat and Eurotex Industries.


Nifty has been making higher highs for the past 11 sessions. It formed a strong bullish candle on the charts, indicating further strength going ahead.

“Chart patterns suggest if Nifty trades above 10,540, it is likely to climb towards 10,580 and 10,610 levels. On the downside, immediate support exists around the 10,500 level. The index is sustaining above its 20-day, 50-day and 100-day SMAs, which indicate bullish sentiments,” said Rajesh Palviya, Head – Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Axis Securities.

Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said: “As long as the Nifty50 holds above 10,480, it can extend gains towards 10,580 and then 10,630 levels. On the downside, supports are seen at 10,480, and then 10,440 levels.”


Understanding MACD



A close look at the chart of Cera Sanitaryware shows whenever the MACD line has crossed below the signal line, the stock has shown downward momentum and vice versa. 

Shares of the company closed 1.74 per cent down at Rs 3,235 on April 16, 2018"

18,2018-04-23,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Despite major headwinds such as rising crude prices, rupee's free fall and the RBI's hawkish stance, the bulls retained an upper hand on Dalal Street for the fourth week in a row.

On a weekly basis, the 30-share Sensex gained 0.65 per cent, while the broader Nifty50 index added 0.79 per cent.

The Nifty IT index was the hands-down winner, gaining 4.90 per cent for the week, while the Nifty Metal pack shut shop with a 4.45 per cent gain. The Nifty FMCG index added 4.18 per cent.

“Apart from the ongoing corporate earnings, the market will now start factoring in the sharp rise in crude oil prices and a weak rupee and their impact on the economy,” said Gaurav Jain, Director at Hem Securities.

Brent crude moved near $74 a barrel last week. Any rise in crude oil prices can raise India’s import bill as the country imports majority of its crude requirement. This also hits the currency, as a weak rupee raises the cost of importing oil. Last week, the rupee hit a 13-month low of 66.10 against the US dollar, after the minutes of the monetary policy panel meeting suggested that the central bank was likely to take a more hawkish stance starting as early as June.

This week’s F&O expiry and the May Karnataka assembly elections are two other key triggers that will decide market direction in the days ahead. Some analysts say any slump in the market could throw up opportunities for investors to lap up stocks.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially see good gains over the next three weeks.


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities

V-Guard Industries | Buy | Target Price: Rs 280 | Stop loss: 232
The stock, as per larger time-frame like weekly chart, has witnessed a sharp upmove in last week. It is now making attempt to stage upside breakout of the strong overhead resistance of previous highs at Rs 252-255 levels. Hence, a sustainable rally above the resistance could have a sharp positive impact on the stock price ahead. Volume rose during last week’s upmove and weekly 14-period RSI is showing positive indication.


Wipro | Buy | Target Price: Rs 330 | Stop loss: 276
The IT sector outperformed last week and this stock (Wipro) fared in line with the sectoral performance. The stock has witnessed a sharp bounce from the lows, in the past couple of weeks. Currently, it is placed at the edge of the hurdle of nearly Rs 300 levels (previous larger consolidation highs). Hence, further sustainable upmove from here could lead to an extension of upside momentum for near term. Volume and momentum oscillators are also supporting a positive pattern in the stock price.


Aditya Agarwala, Technical Analyst, YES Securities

Oil India | Buy | Target Price: Rs 250-260 | Stop loss: Rs 210
This stock is on the verge of a breakout from a Triangle pattern, with the resistance line placed at Rs 233. A breakout and sustained trade beyond this resistance line can extend the upmove to Rs 250-260 levels. RSI has also broken out of the consolidation zone; a move beyond the Rs 60 levels will take the stock higher in the coming trading sessions. Moreover, crude oil prices have shot up recently and are expected to touch levels of $77 which can extend the rally in the stock.


Apollo Hospitals | Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,205- 1,290 | Stop loss: Rs 1,065
The stock has broken out from a Triangle pattern neckline placed at Rs 1,110 with healthy volumes triggering resumption of the uptrend. Moreover, it has turned upwards after forming a bullish harmonic pattern suggesting higher levels in the coming weeks. A sustained trade above Rs 1,160 i.e. 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level can take it to Rs 1,205- 1,290 levels. The RSI has entered the bullish territory affirming strength.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher

Veto Switchgears | Buy | Target Price: Rs 250 | Stop loss: Rs 195
The stock has been gradually on the rise and has indicated a positive bias and with a positive candle pattern formed in the daily chart, we anticipate a decent rise further in the coming days with potential and strength. The indicators have been favourable, supporting our view of a positive trigger. With good volume participation, this stock can be a good buy.


Lupin | BUY | Target Price: Rs 880 | Stop loss: Rs 750
This stock has given a positive candle moving above the 34-WMA moving average indicating a positive bias to rise further with potential and strength. The stock has been consolidating for quite some time at around Rs 770 level and now it should see a breakout above the previous peak of Rs 820 and scale further upward. With good volume activity witnessed, it can be a good buy.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Grasim | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,201 | Stop loss: Rs 1,037
This counter appears to have registered a bottom around Rs 1,040 levels after topping out in November 2017 at a high of Rs 1,300. Last four weeks of consolidation in a small range of Rs 1,100 –1,040 with a bullish engulfing pattern on weekly charts is making it an attractive buy around these levels. Hence, positional traders can buy into this counter.


Mahindra & Mahindra | Target Price: Rs 920 | Stop loss: Rs 777
Last week, this counter registered a breakout above its multi-week ascending channel, with new lifetime highs. This shall augur well for the scrip. This channel breakout is throwing up a lucrative target of Rs 935. Hence, positional traders should go long with a stop of Rs 777 for a target of Rs 920 over a period of time.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA

Tata Global | Buy | Target Price: Rs 308 | Stop loss: Rs 275
After peaking out in early 2018 at Rs 328, the stock has been under classical corrective retracement. The stock bottomed out in the Rs 250-255 zone and has shown signs that could trigger resumption of upmove in the coming days. A not-so-classical inverted (bullish) head and shoulder formation is seen on the daily charts. Daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high. This is a bullish sign. A buy signal has emerged over Stochastic on the Daily Charts with a bullish divergence against the price.


Bombay Dyeing | Buy | Target Price: Rs 320 | Stop loss: Rs 265
 The stock tested highs of Rs 301 in late 2017 and has not made any major headway since then. It is moving in a broad trading range over last couple of weeks. A rounding bottom formation is observed within a large symmetrical triangle. Such formations have larger possibilities of getting resolved with a breakout on the upside. The prices have closed above the upper Bollinger bands on the daily chart. Though short-term pullback inside the bands is likely but on a broader note, upward momentum may continue. RSI is seen breaking out of a formation and has marked a fresh 14-period high which is bullish.

17,2018-04-23,Grasim,"Analysts are getting bullish on Grasim Industries, expecting strong standalone earnings growth and large free cash flows in the next 2-3 years. 

Grasim is a global viscose staple fibre (VSF) major and, along with its group companies, has a global VSM market share of 17%. In recent years, the global rise in demand for VSF has been much higher compared to competing products such as cotton, polyester, etc. 

This explains why Grasim is operating its VSF facility at close to full capacity levels, despite having recently raised its capacity by 50%. Global VSF capacity additions are happening slowly due to stricter environmental norms. To capitalise on the opportunity, Grasim is planning to increase its VSF capacity by another 50% in the coming years. 


Buy: 10

Sell: 1

Hold: 3

The company commands higher margins due to its product mix and also has clear advantage over its rivals due to its high backward integration. While inputs like caustic soda and power already come from its own plants, it is planning on sourcing more pulp from its own supply chain by converting the paper-grade capacity of its joint venture in Canada to pulp grade. Since the outlook of the caustic soda business is bright in the medium term, Grasim is increasing its capacity further. 

The company aims to become the seventh-largest global caustic soda player in the next five years. The capacity addition is going on smoothly and its capacity is expected to go up by 30% in 2018-19. Global caustic soda prices are also on an upswing due to shutdown of facilities in China because of environmental concerns. India is a net importer of caustic soda and eastern India accounts for around 80% of this import. Grasim, which is a pan-India player, will benefit from its ongoing expansion in the eastern market. In addition to its core businesses—VSF and caustic soda— Grasim also has investments in cement, 60.3% stake in Ultratech Cements; financial services, 56% stake in Aditya Birla Capital; and telecom, 28% stake in Idea Cellular. 

Though telecom is under pressure, other big subsidiaries are doing well now. Grasim is now trading at a discount of 50% compared to its holdings and analysts hope that this holding company discount may narrow in coming years. Brighter prospects in standalone business and receding capital allocation concern can be the triggers for this counter.

Selection MethodologyWe pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in ‘consensus analyst rating’ in the past one month.

Next batch of Q4 earnings
Among notable names, Colgate-Palmolive (India), Just Dial and Mahanagar Gas are scheduled to announce their March quarter results on May 21, 2018. Andhra Bank, Bata India, Cipla, Dr Reddy's Labs, IOC and State Bank of India are expected to unveil their score cards on May 22, 2018.

Bank of Baroda, BEML, Cadila Healthcare, Engineers India, Hindustan Copper, NBCC, Sun Pharma and Tech Mahindra are slated to announce results on Friday.


BJP’s Karnataka debacle
Analysts say market may see a knee-jerk reaction to BJP’s Karnataka debacle when trading resumes on Monday. In a dramatic turn of events, BS Yeddyurappa, who took oath as the Chief Minister on Thursday, resigned on Saturday, after he failed to secure the magic number of 112 required to form the government. 

 G Chokkalingam, founder and CEO, Equinomics Research & Advisory said it was just a political setback and it may not have any major implication for the market.

 ""What matters to the market is whether the ruling government will come back to power in 2019. To that extent, BJP has already doubled its seats in Karnataka. The outcome will have only a knee-jerk reaction,"" Chokkalingam added.


Indostar Capital listing
NBFC Indostar Capital Finance, which recently concluded its initial public offer, will make stock market debut on Monday.

The Rs 1,844-crore IPO was subscribed 6.80 times during May 9-11. The price band of the offer was fixed at Rs 570–572 with a face value of Rs 10 per share. Indostar is mainly into offering structured term financing solutions to companies and loans to SME borrowers.


Crude prices
Oil prices posted their sixth straight weekly gain after touching $80 a barrel earlier this week. However, both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude slipped in Friday’s trade, paring weekly gains. 

 Global prices have been supported this week by concerns over US sanctions against Iran, shrinking stockpiles and production shortfalls in Venezuela, Bloomberg reported.

 “Oil prices are in overbought territory, which has prompted some profit taking,” Reuters reported quoting Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

 Spike in oil prices raises India's import bill as the country imports majority of its crude requirements. A weak rupee raises the cost of importing crude oil.

What do the tech charts say
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a robust bearish candle on the daily chart and made lower highs and lower lows for a third straight session. The index made a bearish engulfing formation on the weekly chart, suggesting the possibility of further downside. Analysts say the 50-day moving average around the 10,550 level should act as a major support for the index for now. 

“The market is expected to head lower and traders should not short but wait for lower levels to enter long positions,” said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO at SAMCO Securities.

""As long as it holds below 10,680, weakness could take Nifty towards its next support at 10,550, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,680 and 10,725 levels,"" said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.


Global cues
The minutes to the Federal Reserve’s May monetary policy meeting will be released on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve left its target range for the federal funds rate steady at 1.5-1.75 per cent during its May 2018 meeting, in line with market expectations.

 This apart, the next round of Brexit talks will take place in Brussels on Tuesday. The UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that Britain would leave the EU customs union after Brexit, but a source said London was considering a backstop plan that would apply the bloc’s external tariffs beyond December 2020, Reuters reported."

31,2018-05-27,Grasim,"Calling Asia
The second India Mobile Congress, which was launched last year as a marquee annual event by the industry, will have a distinctly Asian vibe. The government will be rolling out the red carpet for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical & Economic Cooperation or Bimstec. The mission is to give these Asian neighbours a sense of India’s digital prowess and emerging opportunities in the high-speed broadband realm as the country gets set for 5G. By involving the Bimstec members–Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, apart from India– the government is looking to turn IMC into a powerhouse Asian telecom event. The Department of Telecommunications has its work cut out, with the Prime Minister’s Office said to be directly monitoring Operation IMC-Bimstec.


Travel PlanA fund manager with one of the biggest private equity funds has moved to Singapore, ostensibly to start his own venture. The real reason is said to be tax planning — he’s set to get close to $150 million as carry fees for exceeding a threshold return for the fund. At 10% in Singapore, tax amounts to $15 million, while it would be three times that in India. That’s a $30 million homecoming (or farewell) gift.


Land LordWhat his collection of Tanjore paintings couldn’t do, a Scandinavian retailer just might. We’re talking about the Delhi descendant of a storied business family who, despite his khandaani surname, has fallen on hard times. Like many before him, he’s pinning his hopes on the family’s real estate holdings across the country. Fortunately, a much sought-after furniture and lifestyle retailer is in search of large land parcels for its sprawling stores and a deal is said to be in the works.


Cinema ParadisoA big shoutout to Nisaba Godrej and Radhika Piramal for being India Inc’s LGBTQ champions. We saw them in action at the recently held Kashish film festival for the community. Nisaba’s uncle Nadir Godrej had even written a special ditty for the evening. Just goes to show that Mumbai can shed the stuffy suits for some goodhearted fun and frolic in aid of the right cause.


Jumping ShipIs this former Tata executive and blue-eyed boy of Bombay House joining the Shapoorji Pallonji Group after leaving his previous organisation just months ago? That’s the buzz in Mumbai. Some of his peers have also joined rival conglomerates but, given the recent history of conflict, this one could burn a few bridges.


Higher BenchmarkIndia’s largest aluminium maker Hindalco Industries announced record earnings last week, thanks to rise in commodity prices and strict cost controls. However, group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has posed a stiff challenge to Hindalco’s low-profile managing director Satish Pai, raising the profit target of the company for the next quarter.


New StudioThe Aditya Birla Group’s one-time flagship Grasim Industries is looking for greater international acceptance from garment manufacturers for the viscose that it makes, by setting up a 20,000-square feet design studio to fulfil the needs of global clients. It’s also launching a branded viscose product for its women apparel buyers as it looks to make gains on cotton.


Back on TrackNot long ago, the Welspun Group’s BK Goenka was fighting battles on various fronts, including alleged mislabelling of products as being made of Egyptian cotton and challenges faced by the debt-heavy solar power business. With the solar power unit divested and the textile issue fading from memory, Goenka’s business seems to be back on the rails. On top of that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged his contribution in completing phase I of the Delhi-Meerut expressway well ahead of schedule. The Prime Minister wished him success in his “future endeavours” in the May 23 note. Welspun is the contractor for the section of highway that was inaugurated on Sunday by PM Modi.


Constant GardenerWhat happens when the Piramals join forces with the Jindals, Tatas, Godrejs and Mafatlals? Before you think matrimonial alliances or distressed assets, let us say this — let a thousand flowers bloom. Swati Piramal and her girl pals conceived of a cricket-themed garden for the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show in London. The perfectly manicured roses, orchids and poppies dazzled the Royal Horticulture Society’s guests and won a prize. Don’t know if this season’s Indian Premier League was the inspiration, but we can tell you this — Swati continues to surprise all. First, with her homemade cakes and desserts and now, with her gardening.


Getting OutHowever, the lobby group that represents the country’s handset makers is said to be pulling out of the India Mobile Congress. Hardware companies, including some handset brands, were peeved at the focus on carriers at the inaugural event. Still, given the government’s strong backing for the event, could there be a reconsideration?


Ace Investor
Ratan Tata’s private investment firm RNT Associates, which had invested in Chinese handset maker Xiaomi a few years ago, could make about three times that amount. The company had been valued at $30 billion at the time and is now pegged at a listing valuation of about $90 billion.

General Electric has just dropped out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was one of the 12 stocks to be included in the index when it was created over 120 years ago, and the last one to get out. Changes to an index represent changing times and hold some important lessons about blue chips.

An index is a representation of the market. It is well established that tracking a few actively traded stocks is a fairly good indicator of the overall direction of the market. Indices are a parsimonious and efficient way to track the market. Some argue that every stock in the market should be included and tracked. Laborious efforts have been made, including by RBI and CMIE, to create broad-based indices. However, the correlation between these indices and the narrow ones like the 30-stock Sensex or the 50-stock Nifty, is very high. It is not worth tracking too many stocks to track the market.

A narrow index of 12, 30 0r 50 stocks tracks large and highly traded stocks listed in a market. It thus represents the blue chips or market leaders that are established businesses from various sectors. It is a diversified portfolio of top stocks. The index thus becomes a benchmark for forming risk and return expectations from investing in equity. Investors can simply buy the index at low cost using exchange traded funds (ETFs) that enable such investment strategies to earn market returns.

Returns from equity investing are also measured using the index. These results documented across many markets around the globe show the story of how equity returns beat inflation, bond yields and other investment opportunities over a long period of time. Investors consider buying and holding equity stocks for the long run based on such results.

The story of the index and replicable superior returns are both made possible not by buying and holding a chosen blue chip stock for the long run. It is primarily enabled by holding a portfolio of diverse stocks and by revisions that throw out what is not working and bring in new stocks that represent the current trends in business success. Therefore, there is no case for buying and holding without review.

Reviewing the names in our own Sensex will show how things change all the time and how favourites get edged out of the index. In 1986, when the index was released (and also back calculated to April 1979) it included blue chips of those times: Century Textiles, Mukund Iron and Steel, GSFC, Hindustan Motors and Scindia Shipping, to name a few.

All these stocks were blue chips at that time. They were large, well established successful businesses and were actively traded. However, with changes in the economy, business conditions, competitive environment or management within the company, these blue chips fell into bad times and faded off.

The story of blue chips is also about there being no formula for businesses to succeed. With the benefit of hindsight, we may be able to thread together practices that enable a business to excel. But none of these insights are adequate to define a successful business ahead of its actual stellar performance. And none of these metrics persist to keep the business at the top forever. Businesses that have featured in the books of management gurus who searched for excellence or listed business that were built to last or went from good to great, have all failed spectacularly. Some businesses last and continue to lead the sectors they are in. Hindalco, Mahindra and Mahindra, L&T, Grasim and Tata Motors have been in the index for the longest time. But they have also gone through their trial and struggle as times changed, and modified their business strategies for the new world as they saw it.

The question for investors is whether they would have been able to isolate the handful of businesses that stood the test of time, from the ones that failed along the way, if they were shown the 30 or 50 names when these indices were built. Each one in that list was good enough at that time. To imagine that one could have picked the best, and left out the rest is unrealistic. Perhaps loads of luck would have to aid that decision.

To replicate the index is a better approach than trying to pick a few bluechip stocks and hold on to them for the long run. The business risks and management risks will persist, and the investor may lose out on newer businesses that hold better promise. Investors choosing from the Sensex stocks in 1986 and shutting themselves out to whatever came later, would have missed holding Infosys, HDFC Bank, TCS, Airtel, and Maruti Auto for example—stocks that rose to become blue chips much later.

The best shot at long-run returns from equity comes not from individual stocks held for the long-term, but from holding a diversified portfolio that is reviewed to weed out what is not working and include stocks that hold potential. This is done objectively by an index committee that works with defined parameters for inclusion and exclusion. With an ETF, it is possible to hold the index and benefit from this reviewed portfolio for the long term.

Active fund managers strive to do better than the index, by modifying the weights to the index stocks they hold—they overweight or underweight stocks based on their views. They also hold non-index large caps to take a shot at better returns. These large-cap funds also offer an opportunity to hold a diversified portfolio that benefits from review. Just as one cannot tell which stock will outperform in the future, one cannot tell which fund will do better than the index much in advance. Stock selection and fund selection, both are subject to risks of choosing and holding losers rather than winners. Winners don’t persist in both cases, either.

Index ETFs that protect from selection risks, held for the long run without any effort at review or revision, and at a low cost, should be the core portfolio of an investor. To this core, a set of equity funds can be added to include the benefits of stock selection and review by a manager. This satellite portfolio will have to be reviewed and revised annually. Beta returns from the index, and alpha from fund managers is a combination that should work for most investors.

38,2018-06-27,Grasim,"His first stock investment was in Microsoft. He saw Yahoo, Google and Netflix get listed right in front of his eyes. But this Silicon Valley returnee is not really running after big names in Indian market. He hunts for smaller companies with big dreams.

Pune-based investor Jiten Parmar is extra busy these days; he loves cyclical downturns in the economy and businesses, because that’s where he finds greener pastures to pick potential value bets.

Parmar, 49, claims his success stories in the market have been written on mispriced, contrarian opportunities and cyclical turnaround stories.

He does not spend his energy trying to spot big gainers. Instead, he focuses on creating solid annualised returns.

Peers who know him talk about his knack for identifying gems in market down-cycles. It is such stocks that have delivered him multibagger returns over the past 15 years since he took to serious investing.

One of his early picks, Balaji Amines, is up over 7,000 per cent in last 14 years. He still holds the stock. 

Another favourite, Godavari Power, has risen more than 600 per cent since he bought it in 2016 at Rs 63. He has since sold 25 per cent of his holding at Rs 530 apiece. The stock currently hovers around Rs 453.

Rain Industries is another stock that multiplied his wealth in less than three years. He bought it in 2015 at Rs 36 and sold 30 per cent of his holding at an average price of Rs 380. He still holds the rest.

His very recent exit was Piramal Enterprises, which he sold with over 600 per cent returns.

“Jiten is one of the most astute and humble investors I know. He is a master at investing in cyclical businesses. His success story has inspired many to go down that path successfully,” says Gurgaon-based investor Gaurav Sud, who knows Parmar for last 12 years.

Parmar has a sweet tooth for sugar stocks, predominantly a cyclical business. He bought Dwarikesh Sugar, Dhampur Sugar, Ugar Sugar and Triveni Industries in 2015, bagged an average return of 700 per cent in just 18 months and then exited all of them in 2016 and 2017.

Cyclical investing is nothing but value investing, says he.

“You buy an asset that is grossly mispriced due to the business being cyclical in nature. And sell it when the stock comes close to its intrinsic value,” he says.

Paper is another pocket Parmar is fond of. He bought Kuantum Paper, Star Paper and West Coast Paper from end of 2015 through the first few months of 2016, earned on an average 600 per cent returns on them in next two years and then exited.

ETMarkets.com could not independently verify all of his holdings at present or back then.

“I do not run after multibaggers,” Parmar claims. “I am more concerned about CAGR return of my portfolio. As long as the portfolio delivers above-average returns on a CAGR basis, I am happy. One has to understand that the market does correct periodically and all portfolios take a hit. The only thing one can do is minimise that knock. I am a firm that no one can consistently call the top of the market,” Parmar told ETMarkets.

His keeps investing strategy, too, is simple: understand the sector, study past cycles and find out the reasons why a stock is mispriced.

Parmar swears by the India growth story, and says in the currency one should keep investing at every dip.

He says while the domestic market currently faces short-term challenges on the macro and political fronts, the micro factors look better. “Investors with a view of over three years should keep investing at all corrections. I like infrastructure, specialty chemicals, paper, fertilisers and agri-related, auto ancillary and metals sectors,” he said. 

In between talks, Parmar suddenly stops to serve a disclaimer: “I am not a Sebi-registered analyst and the stocks mentioned are not recommendations”.

He says investors should not get wedded to a stock just because it has delivered multibagger returns once. One should keep challenging an investment decision on valuation and fundamental parameters. “One must keep reading all filings of the company, quarterly results, shareholding patterns and annual reports and try and attend analyst calls,” he said.

One must understand P/E re-rating and de-rating in different phases of the market, and adjust accordingly, says he.

“Valuation is an art. Investors need to understand the concept in different phases of the market. In a bull market, one might get slightly higher valuations, and in a bear market, one may need to adjust,” he said.

How does he judge a company management?

Reading past annual reports, say for five years, is a must before taking exposure to a stock, says Parmar.

“A report can tell you a lot about the company management,” he said. Annual reports can help investors know whether the management is always over-promising or under-delivering. It can tell you if the management is realistic about the challenges in the market.

“I rarely meet company managements. I prefer to let their performance speak for themselves. I read balance sheets diligently, and try to find red flags in them. I read transcripts of concalls, if available. That speaks a lot about the management’s ability to deliver on it promise. One has to assess whether the management is good at capital allocation and frugal in operations. Insights into cash flow patterns can also help avoid mistakes in investing,” said he.


Investing lesson
Mistakes are opportunity to learn and failures the stepping stones to success. That’s a piece of Parmar’s own wisdom

He says investing has four parts: conviction, valuation, discipline and patience. One who gets all these aspects right will rarely lose money in the market.

He said conviction comes from research about a company, sector and competitors, while valuation is an art and science. “Look at the margin of safety. Risk-reward ratio is something you should be always focusing on. That’s where valuing a business comes in handy.”

Parmar prefers to have at least 1:5 risk-reward ratio in his investments.

“Conviction has to be seen in conjunction with valuation. A business might be great, but the price may not offer value. On the other hand, one may get an average business at huge undervaluation. I prefer the second option, as long as I understand the business,” says he.

Be greedy when everyone is fearful, and fearful when everyone is greedy. That bit is familiar. But Parmar has another take on this: “It’s easy to say, but very difficult to follow. That's where discipline comes in,” he said.

Patience is another important virtue in investing. One must understand that stock prices follow company performance over long periods. In the short term, the market is mostly irrational and inefficient.

“One must be able to bide time and wait till the market is ready to give a fair price to a mispriced bet,” says he.

Many investors lack temperament in investing. They are more focused on short-term market gyrations, and a lot of times they miss the big picture. “Investing is simple, it is we who make it complicated,” Parmar said.


What attracted him to stock market?
Parmar’s father had invested in the IPOs of Hindustan Unilever, Grasim and Tata Motors, among others, which helped the family in tough times. He made enough money on them to be able to buy a home and marry off his daughters. This helped Parmar Junior understand that wealth creation through stock market.

A software engineer by education, Parmar went to the US in 1992 and worked with HP in the Silicon Valley. In 1995, he co-founded a consulting company called Aquas Inc with a capital of $2,000. “We grew rapidly and were acquired by a Nasdaq-listed company in 1998-1999. I returned to India in 1999,” he recalled.

Parmar’s first investment was Microsoft, where he invested more than two decades back.

“Back then, I was not well-versed with fundamentals. Over the years, and mainly after returning to India, I learned the intricacies of the market. Being an engineer, balance sheet reading did not come to me naturally. But I had the passion to learn and over time learned to figure out financials,” he said.

His passion turned him into a full-time investor. Today he also conducts seminars in equity investment. “I have conducted many sessions on the behavioural and temperamental aspects of investing. I like to share whatever I have learnt and love to learn from others,” says he.

Parmar, now a partner at Pune-based investment advisory firm Aurum Capital, saw wealth creation through stock market from close quarters during his stint in Silicon Valley.

“Stock markets give companies the value they deserve. Many tech bellwethers of today started and listed right in front of my eyes. Yahoo, Google, Netflix and so on. That's when I realised this is what I want to do: become a partner in this wealth creation,” he said.

The journey was not that smooth, though. He did burn his fingers in a couple of stocks such as Assam Company, Alok Industries, Euro Ceramics, GEI Industrial and ICSA. However, he was quick to realise his mistakes and exited the stocks fast.

“I have made many mistakes in my investing career. We all make mistakes; what is important is to realise and learn from them,” he said.

Parmar says Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor is his bible. He loves to learn from great investors and then tries to develop a customised approach that would suit him.

“I do not follow anyone blindly. Books can only be a starting ground. The best teacher is experience. And outcome depends on your adaptability,” said Parmar."

30,2018-07-25,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: This $164 billion fund owns roughly Rs 80,000 crore worth of Indian shares, making it the largest foreign portfolio investor (FPI) in India.

Private lender HDFC Bank (fourth), Reliance Industries (sixth), Kotak Mahindra Bank (14th) are a few Indian stocks, which were among its top 25 holdings in value terms as of June 30.

A part of American Funds, owned by investment management firm Capital Group, this is EuroPacific Growth Fund.

As the name suggests, the fund focuses mainly on Europe, but its exposure to India as percentage of its net assets was significant at 7.4 per cent as of June 30, according to the fund’s website. This, at a rupee-dollar exchange rate of 69, stood at Rs 84,000 crore.

Others
PRIME Database Group pegs EuroPacific Growth Fund’s total Indian stock holding at Rs 78,473 crore, and that of Capital Group as a whole – which includes Capital World Growth & Income Fund, New World Fund Inc, Smallcap World Fund and Europacific Growth funds – at Rs 96,764.20 crore. 

Individual fund or group-wise, it is India’s largest foreign investor, PRIME Database confirmed to ETMarkets in an email. This, it says, is based on data available for only those companies where the fund or the group holds more than 1 per cent stakes. 

Two years back, the fund’s total holding in Indian market stood at Rs 51,564 crore.

Portfolio
The US-based fund hiked stake in HDFC Bank, TVS Motor, UltraTech Cement and State Bank of India in June quarter while trimming its exposure to Grasim Industries and Eicher Motors, June quarter shareholding data showed.

Data suggests the fund held 10,70,36,464 shares, or 5.02 per cent stake, in HDFC Bank as of June 30, against 9,88,65,874 shares, or 4.66 per cent stake, it held as of March 31, 2018. This 5.02 per cent stake alone was worth roughly Rs 29,000 crore.

In case of TVS Motor, the fund increased its exposure to 3.12 per cent at the end of June quarter from 2.74 per cent at the end of March quarter and 2.68 per cent at the end of December quarter, Ace Equity data showed.

At a time when there were concerns over the health of public sector lenders, this fund bought 49,22,000 additional shares in SBI to raise its holding to 1.17 per cent from 1.12 per cent. In UltraTech Cement, it hiked its stake to 1.15 per cent from 1.03 per cent. 

Calendar 2018 has not panned out well for emerging markets, thanks to the onset of Sino-US trade war, rise in crude oil prices and concerns over the Fed tightening. India, too, has been at the receiving end. The country has seen outflow of portfolio money worth Rs 6,430 crore in the first six months of the year.

Despite this, the equity indices have hit new highs, as money continued to chase the largecaps. Thus, a look at what the biggest FPIs are doing is noteworthy.

Ace Equity data suggests EuroPacific Growth Fund cut its holding from 2.37 per cent to 2.20 per cent in Eicher Motors and from 2.41 per cent to 1.61 per cent in Grasim Industries, sequentially, in June quarter.

During the quarter, the fund maintained its holding at 3.38 per cent in Reliance Industries, 1.25 per cent in ACC, 2.65 per cent in Ambuja Cements, 2.66 per cent in Axis Bank, 1.89 per cent in HDFC, 4.94 per cent in Kotak Mahindra Bank, 1.34 per cent in Mahindra & Mahindra and 1.59 per cent Motherson Sumi.

19,2018-08-10,Grasim,"Mumbi: Aditya Birla Group is in talks with Canada’s third largest pension money manager, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board to raise as much as $250 million for its non-banking finance business, Aditya Birla Financial Services, in yet another example of Canadian interest in long-term capital flow into Indian entities.

If successful, the transaction will help the Birlas to expand the NBFC’s base as well as strengthen their presence across the country at a time when bank credit is getting tight and most of the commercial lenders are struggling with the pile of bad assets in their portfolio.

The Birlas are expected to dilute up to 20 per cent stake in the entity, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told ET.




“The talks are on. Birlas have been building a credible financial services platform and are one of the most trusted names. They already have a partnership with another Canadian firm, Sun Life for the insurance business. The deal, if it happens, will give fillip to Birla’s financial services aggregation,” said one of the sources.

The Birlas have an 18-year-old insurance joint venture with Sunlife — Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Co — which manages Rs 357,314 crore. Sunlife has increased its stake to 49 per cent from 26 per cent in 2016.

Both Birla Group and OTPPB declined to comment.

Formed two years ago after the merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo with Grasim Industries, the group has brought the entire financial services business under Aditya Birla Capital. The company handles the group’s housing finance, broking, corporate lending, structured finance, wealth management, private equity and insurance businesses.

Aditya Birla Capital fell 39.6 per cent over the past year, underperforming the benchmark Sensex, which surged 19.6 per cent during the same period. AB Capital shares closed 0.27 per cent higher on Thursday.

The lending business of the group, Aditya Birla Finance, has a loan book of Rs 43,200 crore with retail as well as small and medium businesses contributing 36 per cent to the book. It has a net NPA of 0.92 per cent. Meanwhile the holding company, Aditya Birla Capital, through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, manages aggregate assets worth Rs 3.05 lakh crore and has a lending book of Rs 51,400 crore as of March 31, 2018, its website showed.

Ontario Teachers is Canada’s third largest pension money manager with an aggregate $148 billion has been backing Indian private equity funds and was not an active direct investor in India. The fund, which manages investments of 182,000 school teachers in Ontario, has deployed roughly a fourth of its corpus of $140 billion in real estate and infrastructure investments globally. It is an investor in London City Airport, the Chicago Skyway toll road and owns a number of retail and commercial properties in Canada. Though it has largely refrained from making direct investments in India, OTPP is an investor in ecommerce firm Snapdeal.

42,2018-08-18,Grasim,"ET Intelligence Group: When a clutch of foreign investors recently voted against the reappointment of Deepak Parekh, one of the senior-most persons in the corporate and financial world, for “over-boarding” — or, presence in boards of more than 6 companies — many, probably including Parekh and his team, were stunned, even outraged. First, corporate India has no law against “over-boarding”; second, does it really make a difference?

But there aren’t many who are on the same boat with Parekh. Among the non-executive chairmen in the list of BSE100 companies — the universe of Indian listed entities that primarily interest the foreign portfolio investors — only Kumar Mangalam Birla and Harsh Mariwala have presence in boards of more than 5 companies.

Do they have to grapple with a similar predicament as Parekh?

Harsh Mariwala (similar to Parekh) is non-executive chairman of Marico and Kaya (both group companies), and is on the boards of L&T Finance Holdings, Zensar Technologies, Aster DM Healthcare, JSW Steel and Thermax. In contrast, Birla is director only on the boards of his group companies.

While Birla declined to respond to queries from ET, Mariwala spelt out his views that possibly echoes the belief among corporates.

“I endorse the view that multiple directorships beyond a reasonable limit may pose challenges to a director in allocating sufficient time to the companies, thus hindering his ability to play an effective role. In light of which the Kotak Committee on corporate governance recommended a limit of seven listed companies for a director to hold positions in and the same has been enforced by Sebi through its recent amendments to the listing regulations. While global views on this differ as they treat a director having more than 5 public directorships as overboarded versus 7 public directorships which is the limit in India, investors need to give due regard to some of the factors like the capability of the individual serving the board, his contribution to the company, the needs of the board on which he serves and the depth and quality of executive leadership, when they (the investors) are insinuated with such views from the proxy firms,” said Mariwala, founder and chairman of Marico.



According to him, the law in India has already put many checks and balances in place to ensure that each director fulfils his fiduciary responsibility.

Birla and Mariwala each serve on boards of nine and seven publicly-listed companies, respectively. FPI holding in companies such as Idea Cellular, Grasim Industries, Ultratech Cement, Hindalco and Marico is more than 20%.

ISS, the global proxy advisory firm, had voted against Parekh’s re-appointment on ‘over-boarding’ concern since he served on boards of more than six listed firms. Explaining the reason for voting against the re-appointment of Parekh, ISS has mentioned in its voting recommendation report: ‘investors may be concerned whether directors are able to fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities when they are serving on a large number of boards, as in this case. While the demands of each board will vary, and the capacity of each person will vary, holding the equivalent of more than six directorships with publicly-listed companies may make it challenging for a director to devote adequate time to the affairs of each company’. None of the chairmen of companies from the S&P 100 and FTSE 100 indices serve on more than four and six listed companies, respectively.

These checks, said Mariwala, take various forms — public disclosure of attendance of directors, limit on his membership in board committees, board evaluation, recommendation of re-appointment based on the outcome of evaluation, succession planning, provisions on disqualification of directors, etc.

“Merely, a number on directorships may not necessarily hinder the capability of a director in fulfilling his duties but one has to evaluate the ends and means of a board before deciding if a person can be boarded or not to be boarded, else, it may go on to deprive a company from retaining a good leadership/independent directorship,” he said.

However, he agrees that corporates should take a cue from this to strengthen their disclosures as regards to matters like appointment or re-appointment of directors for investors as well as proxy advisory firms to take pragmatic views on such matters.

While the global norms consider more than six companies to be over-boarding, the Sebi regulations notified in May this year have a slightly higher threshold for individuals having board memberships in listed firms.

The newly notified Sebi (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 limits the number of directorship of a person to eight listed entities with effect from April 1, 2019 and not more than seven listed entities with effect from April 1, 2020."
43,2018-08-18,Grasim,"The domestic equity market seems to be enjoying a seesaw ride, by taking cues from global tides. The entire globe was filled with terror with the escalation in the lira crisis amid fears of trade wars escalating into a full-blown crisis, led to a spiralling rupee along with the depreciation of other emerging market currencies across the world.

Indian indices tried their best to withstand the global onslaught and closed the week in the positive territory – commendable strength indeed.

With the earnings season almost at an end, it will mainly be the macros which will decide the fate of the Indian bourses, but the currency ghost will not die soon and it will keep the bulls on their toes.

Midcaps and smallcaps, which had been beaten down since the start of the year, are seeing some traction as mutual funds and other investors have started accumulating value picks. The fear and pessimism have created good opportunities in a few stocks for value investors. However, one must be cautious because the kind of volatility and valuations that the largecaps are witnessing is unprecedented.

An investor must cautiously go shopping on Dalal Street and not blindly pick up all the beaten down midcaps and smallcaps.


Events of the week
The rupee crossed the Rs 70 to the dollar mark this week ahead of the 72nd Independence Day. The Erdogan-Trump head-on collision created bloodbath in the markets, which caused the rupee to depreciate.

On the other hand, commodity prices witnessed huge blows, which led investors and traders to stick to defensive plays and take refuge in IT stocks. On the Q1FY19 earnings front, Sun Pharma stole the show with a stellar bottom line performance by reporting Rs 982 crore PAT this quarter compared with Rs 424 crore reported for the previous year. Cadila, Jain Irrigation, Balkrishna Industries, Tata Steel, Grasim and DHFL are a few other companies that showed robust growth in profits this quarter, which led to sectoral rallies. which was quite encouraging.


Technical Outlook
The Nifty50 seems to have exhausted its momentum in the near term. Time cycle suggests a sharp correction is overdue. The upward channel is acting as a strong resistance and it seems that the market will respect the same.

The oscillators have turned distinctly negative, suggesting loss of momentum on the upside. All long positions should be exited below 11,300 and shorts can be initiated below that level. No fresh trades are advisable unless the Nifty50 decisively breaches the 11,300 level. Till that time, hold all long positions with a stop loss at 11,300.




Expectations for the week
Markets are a function of liquidity; greed brings liquidity, but fear takes it away. Markets are not pricing in worsening scenario which in a way is rational, but not everyone is rational, especially politicians.

India can’t be an island, in the integrated world order, no sooner do the global political leaders act irrationally, fear would rein in, thus choking liquidity and impacting all markets, including the Indian market.

But it is better to remain little optimistic and ride the wave so long as it lasts. There are imponderables, but sticking to quality stocks would be sensible. The recent correction in the HDFC Bank stock is a good opportunity to accumulate it. Indiabulls Realty looks ripe for a powerful rally once its buyback is over, which is in the last leg.

Pharma seems to have begun the bull market and taking a basket approach would be the best strategy. Lupin, Aurobindo, Cadila and Dr Reddy’s would be ideal options. With the tremendous inflow to the technology space in the previous week, it would be advisable to avoid fresh buys in this space.

Tata Steel, BPCL, Vedanta, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra & Mahindra and HPCL stood as the top losers in the Nifty pack of stocks.

Equity market finished Tuesday's session marginally up as gains in Reliance Industries, Axis Bank and Sun Pharma was mostly offset by losses in Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, HDFC and Mahindra & Mahindra. 

Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty colled off after hitting fresh record highs of 38,402.96 and 11,581.75 in the early session of Tuesday's trade, buoyed by positive sentiment in other global markets after trade war worries subsided.

Moreover, Trump's comments on alleged manipulation of currencies by China and Europe ahead of the scheduled trade talks also kept investors a little nervous. 

The Sensex and Nifty managed to settle at their respective record highs of 38,285.75 and 11,570.90, although by slight margins of 0.02 per cent and 0.17 per cent, respectively.

We feel that themes such as consumption and retail will do well with both urban and rural areas fuelling future growth. However a weakening rupee and higher crude oil prices pose a threat to Indian markets in the short term. IT and pharma may continue to see some buying interest due to a weaker rupee. We like stocks such as Arvind limited in the consumption space and Shoppers Stop from the retailing space.”

58,2018-08-25,Grasim,"MUMBAI: Larsen & Toubro’s decision to buy back Rs 9,000-crore worth of stock from shareholders reflects the engineering behemoth’s strategy to be assetlight and execute projects that do not require significant cash expenses.

“We will have capex but the jobs we have on hand don’t require the kind of cash reserves we have; so, we have decided to honour our commitment to improve shareholder returns,” SN Subrahmanyan, L&T’s chief executive officer, told reporters after the company’s 73rd Annual General Meet on Thursday. “We have a robust order book and have decided to remain asset-light.”

The AGM coincided with the decision of the company’s board to buy back sixty million outstanding shares, representing 4.29% of the equity, at a maximum price of Rs 1,500 a share.

Some equity market experts also see the company’s first ever buy-back as a safeguard against any possible attempts at hostile takeovers.

“Our share price is made up of how we perform and if we continue to perform well, the price of the share is the fortress against any outside factors,” said Subrahmanyan. The company had Rs 8,700 crore in standalone cash and cash equivalents, and Rs 17,500 crore on a consolidated basis as of end-March.

L&T has faced, resisted, and succeeded in retaining its ownership twice in the past when the undivided Reliance Industries and later Grasim made attempts to take over the company. L&T has no promoter; Life Insurance Corporation is its biggest shareholder. LIC, Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India and L&T Employees Welfare Foundation together own little less than 35% in the company, ring fencing against any such activity.

“Even though awarding of infrastructure projects continued to be unpredictable in terms of the timelines, we registered significant growth,” AM Naik, group chairman told shareholders in his first AGM in a non-executive role.

Naik was criticised by former employee and shareholder Uday Dikshit for wrongfully diverting land in Powai to commercial residential projects. The mood at the AGM became tense when some other former employees joined in and started shouting. Another shareholder complained that while employees like him were asked to opt for Voluntary Retirement Scheme at the age of 50, why was Naik, now 75, still at the helm of the company.

While former employees have in the past raised issues at AGMs, in a first, some shareholders demanded an answer to the questions raised by the former employees. Naik refused to answer, and told security guards, “
koi bhi awaaz kare toh baahar nikalo” (Anyone who makes noise should be taken out).

Subrahmanyan pacified shareholders by telling them that due process was followed in every decision taken by the company."

Hitesh Agrawal, head of retail research, Religare Securities, favours a buy on dip approach in the current market scenario. 

“Bond yields are indicating that a further rate hike is on the cards. The broader trend in the interest rate is also headed higher in the next six months. We may see some slowdown in incremental money flows in equities as FMPs get better. Market participants will not mind re-jigging their portfolio. Strengthening of bond yield is negative for equities,"" Agrawal said. ""As a broking house, we recommend only stock selective approach. We still have a target of over 12,000 for Nifty this year only. Fundamentally, there is no sell signal.”

ETMarkets.com drew up a list of five stocks which global brokerage houses are betting on. 


Reliance Industries
Global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on Reliance Industries with an upward target price of Rs 1,500 (Rs 1,365 earlier). CLSA believes that grand omni-channel strategy may be a big long-term promise for the stock and high customer engagement creates a big market opportunity. 


Bharat Forge
Credit Suisse maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on Bharat Forge with a target price of Rs 750. The company may benefit with sharp rupee depreciation as 60 per cent of revenues come from exports. “Order wins will help further diversify from CVs. The CV share is likely to decline even further,” Credit Suisse said. Peaking of US Class 8 trucks cycle is among main concerns.


Grasim Industries
Deutsche Bank maintained ‘Buy’ rating on Grasim Industries with a target price of Rs 1,430. The global financial services firm also said the robust earnings growth outlook is not yet discounted and margins are likely to remain strong based on global demand-supply dynamics. Volume growth should also improve substantially as VSF capacity is expanding.


Tata Motors
Nomura maintained ‘Buy’ on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 356. “JLR’s August 2018 US retail volumes are better than our estimate. For FY19, expect 4 per cent growth in overall JLR volumes driven by stronger demand in China. Stock trading is at lowest end of the historical trading band,” Nomura said.


ICICI Bank
CITI maintained ‘Buy’ on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 390. The bank is minimising exposure to riskier loans while aiming at 15 per cent consolidated RoE by June 2020. The brokerage firm believes that NPA recognition is in the last leg and focus will shift to recoveries."

11,2018-09-18,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: The rupee’s prolonged poor health and worries over intensification of trade war weighed on domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty, as both extended losses into the second consecutive session on Tuesday.

The domestic equity market remained indifferent to an uptick in global stocks despite the US slapping tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

The government’s attempt to arrest the fall in the rupee did not prove effective, as the domestic currency remained on a downward trajectory. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was 40 paise lower at 72.7962. 

Analysts have found the government steps less convincing. An HDFC Bank report said the government’s recent measures to support the rupee may not drive fund inflows and are a negative from a longer-term perspective, as they would increase short-term debt.

The Sensex plunged 295 points, or 0.78 per cent, to settle at 37,290, while the Nifty50 lost 99 points, or 0.87 per cent, to close at 11,278.


Let’s walk you through the key highlights of Tuesday’s session:

Asian shares rose despite trade war
Worries of intensification of trade war after the US slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from September 24, but stock markets in Asia shrugged off those worries. China, in response, vowed retaliation, despite Trump’s warning that in case of Chinese retaliation, the US will impose tariffs on further $267 billion worth of imports. Thus, virtually all of Chinese imports will come under new tariff regime. But China’s Shanghai SE Composite Index and Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.82 per cent and 1.41 per cent, respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.56 per cent.


Who dragged my Sensex
State Bank of India (down 4.06 per cent) finished as the top loser in the Sensex pack. It was followed by Tata Motors (down 3.36 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 2.84 per cent), Axis Bank (down 2.81 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 2.31 per cent). In terms of contribution to the index movement, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Axis Bank and RIL remained the top five drags on the index. Only six stocks – Hindustan Unilever (up 3.87 per cent), YES Bank (up 1.43 per cent), Wipro (up 1.02 per cent), ONGC (up 0.93 per cent), ITC (up 0.23 per cent) and HDFC Bank (up 0.05 per cent) – managed to shut shop with gains.


BoB tanks, but Dena makes merry
Shares of Bank of Baroda tanked 16.03 per cent on BSE. The government decision to merge Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank apparently has not gone well with investors. Shares of Vijaya Bank (down 5.69 per cent) also suffered strong losses, but Dena Bank (up 19.75 per cent) made merry.


Nifty PSU Bank sinks
The PSU bank index on NSE cracked 5.44 per cent, with all components ending in the red. Shares of BoB, Union Bank, Indian Bank, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank plunged over 5 per cent. 


Most traded stocks
Shares of Bank of Baroda (number of shares traded: 14.49 crore) led the pack of most-traded stocks on NSE, followed by Reliance Communications (14.35 crore), Bajaj Hindusthan (6.35 crore), Balrampur Chini (5.43 crore), Suzlon Energy (4.45 crore), JP Associates (4.22 crore), PNB (3.72 crore), Vijaya Bank (3.54 crore), SBI (3.39 crore) and YES Bank (3.02 crore). On the other hand, Bank of Baroda (Rs 1712.19 crore), YES Bank (Rs 982.94 crore), SBI (Rs 940.11 crore), RIL (Rs 935.66 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 663.80 crore), Infosys (Rs 556.79 crore) and HDFC (Rs 543.43 crore) stood as most active stocks in value terms on NSE in that order. 


52-week highs & lows
As many as 95 stocks, including Aptech, Balkrishna Paper Mills, Blue Dart Express, Cera Sanitaryware and Centrum Capital hit 52-week lows on NSE on Tuesday. However, 24 stocks, including Monnet Ispat & Energy, Century Extrusions, Delta Magnets and Electrosteel Steels, hit 52-week highs on NSE.


MACD showed bullish signal on 40 counters
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed Dena Bank, Divi's Labs, Grasim Industries, Jayshree Tea, Gallant Metal and Central Depository were among the 40 stocks which saw bullish crossovers on NSE. However, 48 stocks, including Allahabad Bank, Hindalco, Jet Airways, Jain Irrigation and NTPC, saw bearish crossovers on NSE."
12,2018-09-25,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: A sharp 1,800-point plunge in the BSE Sensex in just five sessions till Monday has left investors and traders wondering what lies ahead. 

Rumours about liquidity crunch and major asset-liability mismatch among NBFCs, a steady slide in the rupee, a spike in crude prices, flareup in US-China trade tensions and uncertainty ahead of the US Fed policy review have triggered a major spurt in fear gauge India VIX to the 17 mark. 

The benchmark indices have fallen below the 100-day moving averages and are signalling a weak outlook.

While most stocks have already seen a significant drop, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, has signalled downward crossovers, meaning a bearish signal, on at least 106 counters, suggesting that these stocks may see further downside in the days ahead. 

Some of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes in recent time, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Among the stocks that witnessed such bearishness were Suzlon Energy, Balrampur Chini, Tata Steel, Hathway Cable & Data, Jindal Stainless and Castrol India. 

Others included MTNL, Meghmani Organics, Mercator, Grasim Industries and Gruh Finance. 



The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. 

Only three stocks –TCS, TD Power Systems and Oswal Agro Mills – showed bullish crossovers on MACD charts on NSE. 



However, the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call based on this indicator alone, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio. 

Market veterans say the MACD alone is not good enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Analysts say for the Nifty50, the ongoing correction may continue, barring a few short-term bounces. “The index has closed below the rising trend line, indicating that the bearish trend is likely to continue. On its way down, the index should drift lower towards the 10,866 mark and, subsequently, towards its short-term target of 10,815. On its way up, the 11,170-11,233 range will act as a key resistance. Any pullback towards the resistance level shall be considered as selling opportunity,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan

As long as Nifty holds below 11,080, weakness will continue and drag it towards its recent swing lows of 10,866 and 10,850, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. This range is the 50 per cent retracement of the entire upswing from 9,952 to 11,760 levels.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Suzlon Energy shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show an downward momentum and vice versa. 

On Monday, the stock fell 3.70 per cent to close at Rs 6.50 on NSE."
13,2018-09-25,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: August was a tricky month for domestic equity fund managers, as there was a spike in redemptions and a marked slowdown in flows to equity-linked funds, thanks to fragile investor sentiment amid US-China trade war, emerging market contagion and a rupee depreciation.

Amid such volatility, fund managers were busy buying some of the Nifty stocks such as Adani Ports & SEZ, Vedanta, Tech Mahindra, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC and Asian Paints, data showed. 


Top MF picks in volume terms

Adani Ports, where each of 18 funds held 2 per cent or less, saw the holding of the institutional category rise 15.4 per cent by the end of August from that in July. MFs held 3.95 crore Adani Ports shares at the end of August.

Some 18 funds raised their cumulative holding in ITC by 11.9 per cent in August from that in July. Among others, Tech Mahindra (up 11.9 per cent), Indiabulls Housing (up 10 per cent), HDFC (up 6.6 per cent) and Asian Paints (6.3 per cent) witnessed good buying by MFs during the month.

Bharti Infratel, TCS, Grasim Industries and Hindalco were other Nifty stocks that saw brisk buying by mutual funds during the month.

While inflows to equity funds rose 9 per cent month-on-month to Rs 28,300 crore by August end, redemptions surged 66.1 per cent month-on-month to Rs 22,400 crore. Net inflows to equity and equity-linked funds during the month stood at Rs 5,900 crore against an average of Rs 8,900 crore seen during the March-August period, data showed.


Increase in MF holdings in value terms

There were also counters where mutual fund holding rose in value terms, primarily due to a rise in stock prices. Six of the top 10 stocks that saw a largest change in mutual fund holding in August were from financials and technology sectors, said Motilal Oswal Securities.

BSE Bankex gained 2.4 per cent during the month, and BSE IT index 7 per cent. The Sensex gyrated in a 1,900-point range during the month, while Nifty50 swung in a 500-point range.

ICICI Bank saw net buying by eight of the top 20 funds. MFs collectively bought 40 lakh shares in the private lender. However, the change in mutual fund holding in the bank in value terms was largely in line with 12.7 per cent surge on the counter during the month.

In case of ITC, MF holdings increased by 7.2 million shares, or 0.8 per cent, to 924.4 million shares. The value of MF holding on the counter rose by 8.4 per cent, or Rs 2,280 crore, to Rs 29,570 crore. The stock rose 7.4 per cent during the month.

Axis Bank saw a drop in MF holding, but given the 18 per cent surge in stock price, the value of MF holding jumped 17 per cent during the month to Rs 15,430 crore. 

Reliance Industries was another preferred stocks among MFs in August, where 14 funds bought extra shares. The stock saw MF holding rise by 9.5 per cent, Rs 2,230 crore, in value terms even as the stock rose 4.6 per cent.

NTPC and Tech Mahindra were two other stocks which saw buying by mutual funds, even as the stocks logged gains.

7,2018-10-03,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Losses in shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) (down 3.86 per cent), Infosys (down 2.04 per cent), HCL Technologies (down 1.25 per cent) and Wipro (down 0.74 per cent) dragged Nifty IT index down in Wednesday's session. 

The IT heavyweights fell even as rupee touched its record low against the US dollar today. 

The Indian rupee Wednesday crashed below the 73-mark against the dollar for the first time ever on strong demand for the American currency from importers amid rising global oil prices and unabated capital outflows.

The Nifty IT index was trading 1.55 per cent down at 15,962 around 01:35 pm. 

However, shares of Infibeam Avenues (up 15.25 per cent) jumped over 15 per cent.

In a voluntary clarification to the BSE on Friday, lnfibeam Avenues said that all the material information ""that have a bearing on the operation/ performance of the company which include all price sensitive information have always been disclosed within the stipulated time"". 

At the annual general meeting on Saturday, Managing Director Vishal Mehta said the management and the entire team are working very hard towards the company's growth, according to PTI. 

NIIT Technologies (up 5.24 per cent), Tata Elxsi (up 3.77 per cent), MindTree (up 1.24 per cent), Oracle Financial Services Software (up 0.84 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (up 0.09 per cent) too were in the positive zone at that time. 

Sustained capital outflow, surging crude oil prices and rupee's poor health weighed on market sentiment.

Moreover, investors remained on the sidelines even as the RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) meet began to decide on key rates. 

Benchmark BSE Sensex was 203 points down at 36,323, while the NSE Nifty50 index was down 55 points at 10,953.

YES Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bajaj Finance, Vedanta and HPCL were among top Nifty gainers.

Bharti Infratel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Tata Consultancy Services and Grasim Industries were among the top losers in the Nifty index."
6,2018-10-03,Grasim,"The domestic equity markets witnessed an impulsive correction in September. As a result, nearly 60 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks breach their respective support at the 200-day moving average (DMA). 

As of September 28, 2018, blue chips such as Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Coal India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, YES Bank, UPL, Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, Grasim Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment and Kotak Mahindra Bank were trading below their 200-DMAs.



When a stock falls below its 200-DMA, it generally means it is trading below its last one-year’s average price. The 200-DMA is most commonly used indicator among traders and investors as it typically represents one working year. 

The average is perceived to be the dividing line between a stock that is technically healthy and one that is not. Furthermore, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving averages helps determine the overall health of the market.

However, when a stock dips below its 200-DMA, it in a way gets oversold and shows signs of recovery and a possible technical pullback. It also offers good entry points to investors from a medium-term perspective.

“What we saw in the market in September was a sharp revision to the mean. Mean revision is a powerful concept wherein we see a market return to its average,” says Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“This usually occurs when the market runs up much ahead of its curve. With regard to largecaps that are trading on, near or below their 200-DMAs, many -- but not all -- have shown signs of bottoming out. In this kind of a market, investors should remain with largecaps and use these levels to make bargain purchases,” he said.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said historical behaviour of a particular indicator or technical tool should be given due importance while making buy and sell decisions in technical analysis and the 200-DMA is not an exception to that rule.

“Technically, we can conclude that stocks that breached 200-day moving averages are in a longer-term downtrend, which may not be practically true because often we find stocks or indices breaching 200-day moving averages for a brief period and then resuming their uptrend,” he said.

For instance, Maruti Suzuki breached its 200-day moving average in May and stayed below it for a couple of days and then resumed its uptrend from the low of Rs 8,255 to move all the way to Rs 9,929. A similar thing happened with HDFC Bank in December 2016. 

“Just a breach of 200-DMA is not an indication to stay away from a scrip, especially if it is from the largecap segment. Along with this average, it is important to consider the larger trend and direction of the market. Unless the entire market itself is reversing, we should not avoid such largecaps. They should be considered an opportunity to create fresh longs by looking at various other technical parameters,” Mohammad said.

However, Ruchit Jain, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, said largecaps that have breached their 200 DMAs in this correction are likely to continue the underperformance in the near term.

“Traders should avoid bottom fishing in such stocks. A prudent strategy for traders should be to avoid bottom fishing at current juncture. In such times, weekly charts should be given more weightage and only when a reversal pattern is formed on the higher time frame charts, should traders look at opportunities for stock picking,” Jain said. 

He said this market could correct further in the near term and hence, traders should wait on the sidelines and be vigilant on market moves.

Other analysts also said while over half of the largecaps are trading below their 200-DMAs, only a few of them look attractive.

Mohammad said one can look at the HDFC twins and Kotak Mahindra Bank at present, as they appear to have formed a short-term base after breaching their 200 DMAs. Asian Paints also looks good as it is taking support on its 200 DMA.

“As Maruti Suzuki is trading far below its 200-day moving average, traders or investors should avoid this for the time being till the price stabilises at a particular point,” he said.

Vaishnav said stocks from pharma, infrastructure, IT, metals and energy sectors qualify for bargain hunting at this moment. “The main reason for selecting these sectors and leaving the rest out is that they have clearly outperformed the broader market on a relative basis and are improving on their relative momentum when benchmarked against the broader market,” he said.

IT stocks Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies are now trading above their 200 DMAs. Reliance Industries (RIL) and ICICI Bank were also trading above their 200 DMAs as of September 28, 2018."

9,2018-10-08,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: The recent bloodbath in the domestic stocks has hurt small investors as hard as the country’s top billionaires.

The across-the-board selloff eroded market capitalisation of many bluechips, resulting in notional losses in the value of promoter stakes. 

Mukesh Ambani, who owns oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries, has $50.7 billion in wealth as of August 28, a day before the BSE Sensex hit an all-time high of 38,989.65 on August 29. He is now worth $39.5 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaire index shows.

The owner of the world’s largest oil refining hub at Jamnagar has lost all the gains he made so far this year on the surging shares of Reliance Industries, the second-most valued stock in India. RIL scrip has corrected 20 per cent (till Friday) from its all-time high of Rs 1,328.75 (hit on August 29). On Monday, RIL shares saw a 5 per cent rebound to trade at Rs 1,098 on BSE at 1300 hours.

Another group stock, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, has lost 40 per cent of its market capitalisation (m-cap) so far this year. Year-to-date, Ambani's wealth has shrunken by $750-odd billions. 

Kumar Mangalam Birla, who owns the Aditya Birla group, saw eight group companies erode nearly Rs 60,000 crore in market value. Six of the eight listed stocks have declined up to 70 per cent this calendar, data available with Ace Equity suggests. Vodafone Idea (Rs 23,000 crore), Grasim Industries (Rs 16,000) and UltraTech Cement (Rs 14,000 crore) have been the biggest wealth destroyers. On Monday, Birla's wealth stood at $5.91 billion, against a high of $9.38 billion hit in January. Year-to-date, he has lost $3.16 billion. 

Gautam Adani, whose Adani Group has interests in ports, logistics, shipping and rail, coal mining and management and energy, with renewable and, thermal power generation and transmission and agro commodities, has taken a $3.8 billion hit year-to-date, data showed.

Adani was worth over $11 billion in earlier in January. On Monday, he was worth $6.57 billion.

Among five of the group’s listed stocks, four – namely Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Adani Power and Adani Transmission – have lost Rs 40,494 crore in combined market value this calendar. Adani Green, the renewable energy business, on Monday traded at Rs 32, marginally higher than its June 2018 listing price of Rs 30.

YES Bank has named former IRDA chief TS Vijayan and former SBI chief OP Bhatt as external members in the search committee.

25,2018-10-23,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: A sharp selloff in global stocks, sustained capital outflows amid rupee's precarious health and rising clout of the US dollar kept the bulls at bay on Tuesday.

Indian market extended its fall to the fourth consecutive session, mirroring the weakness in global stocks. A mix of negative leads such as Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation, worries about Italian budget, the Brexit uncertainties and global trade concerns proved to be a dangerous cocktail.

In Asia, Hang Seng plunged 3 per cent while Shanghai Composite, Nikkei and Taiwan indices suffered losses of over 2 per cent each.

Let's take a look at highlights of Tuesday's session.

TVS reports flat growthTVS Motor Company today reported a flat growth in profit at Rs 211.31 crore for the quarter to September. The two-wheeler firm had posted a profit of Rs 213.16 crore in the same quarter last year. Analysts in an ETNow poll had estimated the profit figure at Rs 210 crore. Revenue from operations jumped 22.85 per cent to Rs 4,993.47 crore in Q2 FY19 over Rs 4,064.72 crore in Q2 FY18. The stock closed 3.75 per cent up at Rs 536.05 today. 


NPA pain for Bajaj FinanceGross NPAs of Bajaj Finance for the September quarter rose to 1.49 per cent from 1.39 per cent in the June quarter while loan losses and provisions rose to Rs 315 crore against Rs 221 crore in the year-ago period, the company said in a BSE filing. However, consolidated profit jumped 54 per cent year-on-year to Rs 923 crore for the second quarter. The scrip closed 1.63 per cent down at Rs 2,083.95. 


Global stocks roll downGlobal markets hurtled towards their lowest level in a year today. Following a share decline on Wall Street, heavy selloff emerged in Asian markets which took European markets under its ambit. Emerging market stocks and currencies took a beating on Tuesday as concerns over Italy's budget, Brexit talks and Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's killing kept investors' appetite for risk in the doldrums, Reuters reported. 


Rupee in a tight spotThe rupee lost vigour today, which made market players nervous. The domestic unit swung between gains and losses throughout the day. After falling by 27 paise to 73.83, it turned flat, only to resume on a downward trajectory. A slight fall in crude oil after Saudi Arabia's assurance of playing a ""responsible role"" in energy markets brought a some respite to the domestic unit. 


Who dragged my Sensex down?IT, pharma, energy, bank and FMCG stocks were the top casualties of Tuesday's selloff. Infosys, TCS, Sun Pharma, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, SBI, HUL and ITC emerged as the top drag on Sensex, in that order. Sun Pharma and Asian Paints were the top percentage losers, falling up to 5.21 per cent. Wipro, TCS and Infosys declined over 3 per cent. By contrast, IndusInd Bank, PowerGrid and HDFC climbed up to 2 per cent in the Sensex heatmap.

On the other hand, Veerhealth Care (up 18 per cent), AYM Syntex (17.72 per cent), CNI Research (15.42 per cent) and Kavit Industries (12.62 per cent) stood up to market sentiment and won the day. 


Sectoral losersIT (down 2.79 per cent), technology (down 2.48 per cent) and healthcare (down 2.34 per cent) stood as the top three sectoral losers on BSE. Barring power and realty, all sectoral indices suffered losses today. Gains in shares of PowerGrid, Suzlon, NTPC, BHEL, Oberoi Realty, Godrej Properties and DLF kept the power and realty indices in the green.

However, market cooled off a bit on selling in select metal, IT, pharma and auto heavyweights.

27,2018-10-24,Grasim,"It was a deluge of a different kind. India's biggest institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) found itself in the middle of a major stock churn in the September quarter.

To bring in some perspective, the said quarter was also marked by heightened volatility over the IL&FS default crisis. 

LIC, which holds stake in over 320 companies, was seen reshuffling its portfolio heavily in financials, healthcare, oil & gas, chemical and information technology sectors, shareholding data for the September quarter suggests. 

Close to 30 companies caught LIC's fancy during the quarter gone by. The insurance behemoth raised its stake in auto majors Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki to 6.45 per cent and 6.55 per cent, respectively, from 6.40 per cent and 5.76 per cent in the preceding June quarter. 

LIC also upped exposure in TVS Motor to 1.75 per cent from 1.12 per cent during the same period. However, it offloaded some shares in Bajaj Auto and Mahindra & Mahindra, according to data available with ACE Equity till October 23. 

BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty plunged over 6 per cent in September even though for the quarter both the indices gained around 2 per cent. 

The insurance company also bought additional shares in select public sector banks, including Allahabad Bank (to 9.90 per cent from 9.89 per cent), Bank of Baroda (to 3.86 per cent from 3.18 per cent) and Indian Bank (to 1.89 per cent from 1.82 per cent). On the other hand, it slashed stake in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Vijaya Bank and YES Bank during the quarter under review. 



In the oil and gas space, it scooped up additional shares in GAIL, BPCL, Chennai Petroleum and Oil India for the quarter to September. 

Among FMCG majors, LIC further increased its holdings in Britannia Industries, Gillette India, Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Healthcare. However, it sold some shares of Colgate-Palmolive and Nestle during the quarter under review.

Piramal Enterprises, OFSS, Wipro, Blue Dart, Tata Consultancy Services, Crisil, Future Enterprises, Future Lifestyle, General Insurance Corporation of India, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation and Grasim featured among companies where LIC increased its holding during the quarter under review. Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have plunged over 65 per cent in 2018 so far.

On the other hand, NTPC, Tata Power Company, Peninsula Land, Bata India, Arvind Ltd, National Aluminium, Larsen & Toubro, Sun Pharma, Merck, Cipla, REC, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Rajesh Exports, Voltas, Pidilite, Chambal Fertilisers and Seshasayee Paper & Boards are a few where LIC reduced stake in July-September."
28,2018-10-24,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty settled in positive territory after four straight sessions of losses, on healthy buying in most sectors. 

IT and pharma came as major disappointments.

Easing global crude oil prices lifted mood and the market remained in the green for much of the day.

The Sensex was up 187 points, or 0.55 per cent, to end the day at 34,033.96. A good 16 stocks were in the green and 15 in the red. The NSE Nifty finished at 10,224.75, up 78 points, or 0.77 per cent.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were ahead of the Sensex, closing 0.95 per cent and 0.74 per cent higher, respectively. 


Let's run you through today's market highlights:

Oil prices at two-month lowOil prices fell near $75 a barrel to its lowest since late August on concerns of weak demand and ample supply after Saudi Arabia promised that it will keep oil market adequately supplied in the wake of US sanctions on Iran. Moreover, a fall in global equities due to weak prospects of economic growth amid fears of an intensifying trade war cast their shadow. According to Reuters, the International Energy Agency expects a slower oil demand growth for 2019 due to a slowing economy.


Rupee gains weightThe oil cool-off rubbed off on the rupee as the domestic currency closed higher today, offering more hope to market participants. Rupee's rise is a major relief for the market as current account deficit swells on a weak rupee, which distorts India's macroeconomic mathematics. 


Who moved my Sensex?Bharti Airtel, surging 11 per cent, stood out as the top Sensex gainer, followed by Asian Paints (up 4.49 per cent), IndusInd Bank (3.21 per cent), HDFC (3.02 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (2.06 per cent) and Larsen & Toubro (1.76 per cent).

The funds will be used to reduce existing debt of about $5 billion and grow its Africa operations, Airtel said in a regulatory filing. Shares of the company closed 10.79 per cent up at Rs 316.75 on the BSE. 


Bajaj Auto plumbed 52-week lowBajaj Auto plunged nearly 5 per cent to its 52-week low of Rs 2,460 on the BSE today, before closing at Rs 2,475.30, still down 4.30 per cent. The stock dropped even as the company posted a 4 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 1,152 crore for July-September. Total revenue jumped 21.63 per cent to Rs 7,986.79 crore in Q2 FY19 over Rs 6,566.43 crore in Q2 FY18.

250 stocks at 52-week lowsAs many as 250 stocks, including Tata Motors, Time Technoplast, CCL Products, CG Power and Industrial Solutions, D B Corp, GHCL, Grasim Industries, Wockhardt, Shree Cement, Navkar Corporation, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Manpasand Beverages, Laurus Labs, Kwality, Kalpataru Power Transmission and Greaves Cotton, melted despite positive market sentiment to hit 52-week lows on the BSE. On the other hand, Grandeur Products, Sportking India, Tiaan Ayurvedic & Herbs, Coastal Corporation, Dalal Street Investments and Kothari World Finance featured among 28 stocks that scaled 52-week highs.


Rs 1.05 lakh crore wealth createdThe cumulative market capitalisation of BSE companies jumped by 1.05 lakh crore as the m-cap jumped to 1,35,24,629 crore from Rs 1,34,19,627 crore today. JP Associates, Reliance Communications, YES Bank, DHFL and Vipul emerged as the top five most traded stocks on the BSE while Bajaj Finance, Infosys, Piramal Enterprises, Mahindra & Mahindra and Indiabulls Housing Finance featured among the top five most active stocks in value terms.


136 stocks hit the upper circuitRadico Khaitan, Zim Laboratories, Manaksia Steels, Polymechplast Machines, Gulshan Chemfill and Sportking India were part of 136 stocks that hit upper circuit on the BSE today. However, 241 stocks, including Kwality, CRP Risk Management, Advance Syntex, Unique Organics, Omax Autos and ANG Lifesciences India, hit lower circuit.

29,2018-10-26,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: The bears had a free reign today as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty fell for the second consecutive day.

Sentiment turned sour as global shares fell, the rupee stumbled from one low to another and FIIs just kept hitting the exit button. 

Global stocks were to face their worst week in more than five years as anxiety over corporate profits added to fears about global trade and economic growth, Reuters reported. 

The market has been battered by a string of issues like the ongoing trade war, prospects of weak economic growth and geopolitical tensions arising out of death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Domestic factors such as weak macroeconomic numbers, rupee's poor health and tepid September quarter earnings are other top drags. 

Closing at a fresh seven-month low, the Sensex plunged 341 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 33,349 and the Nifty 95 points, or 0.94 per cent, at 10,030. On a weekly basis, the Sensex lost 966 points, or 2.82 per cent, while the Nifty came off 274 points, or 2.65 per cent. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outsmarted the benchmark Sensex today, settling with nominal losses of 0.11 per cent and 0.04 per cent, respectively. 


The big highlights of today's session:

Rs 75,000 crore gone in a dayFriday's loss shaved off over Rs 75,000 crore cumulative wealth of BSE investors as market capitalisation of companies slid to Rs 1,33,31,977.38 crore from Rs 1,34,07,102.28 crore, available data showed. The top five companies in terms of m-cap were Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 6,75,279.15 crore), Reliance Industries (Rs 6,62,180.42 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 5,33,294.35 crore), ITC (Rs 3,43,592.12 crore) and Hindustan Unilever (Rs 3,37,782.64 crore).


Who dragged my Sensex down?YES Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, TCS and Kotak Mahindra Bank emerged as the top five Sensex losers. In total, seven stocks - Tata Motors, Reliance Industries, Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, HDFC and Hero MotoCorp - stood up to the bearish trend, settling in the green. In terms of index contribution, Infosys, TCS, ITC, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank featured as the top five drag on the Sensex basket.


YES Bank stock plunges 9% Shares of YES Bank settled at Rs 180.55, down 8.97 per cent on the BSE, a day after the private lender reported a 3.8 per cent year-on-year drop in profit at Rs 964.70 crore for the September quarter on onetime hit on mark-to-market (MTM) investments in corporate bonds and higher provisions on loans to a corporate client. Total provisions increased to Rs 940 crore, up from Rs 447 crore a year earlier, and higher than the Rs 626 crore reported in June 2018, hitting profits. 


Bharti Airtel shrugs off poor Q2 Shares of Bharti Airtel settled 1.06 per cent up at Rs 299 on the BSE even as it reported on Thursday a fall in consolidated net profit for the tenth straight quarter as losses on mainstay India business widened due to pricing pressure from aggressive competition. Global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Buy’ on Airtel with a revised target price of Rs 415 (Rs 500 earlier).


Equitas Holdings & Ujjivan Fin crumbleShares of Equitas Holdings and Ujjivan Financial Services closed the day with losses of 23.34 per cent and 17.62 per cent, respectively, on the BSE today after the RBI issued directives to them on compliance of rules for listing their small finance banks. The Reserve Bank has asked both companies to comply with guidelines and list their small finance banks within three years of commencing operations, Ujjivan and Equitas said in separate BSE filings on Thursday. 


Earnings update FMCG major ITC on Friday posted 11.92 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 2,954.67 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The numbers failed to excite the investors as the stock fell 2.30 per cent to Rs 280.65 on BSE. UPL reported a 13.92 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit at Rs 270 crore. Shares of the company jumped 3.90 per cent to Rs 621.70 on the BSE today.


Rupee sinks furtherThe domestic unit settled 19 paise lower at 73.46 against the dollar today after the dollar rose to a 10-week high. Weakness in stocks amid uninspiring corporate earnings have pushed investors to safe havens, including dollar and gold, putting pressure on emerging market currencies. Gold prices rose today, eyeing a three-month high. 


Crude easesGlobal crude oil prices eased today amid oversupply concerns after Saudi Arabia's Opec governor remarks to this effect. Oil prices dropped more than 1 per cent on Friday, heading for a third weekly loss. A slump in stock markets and concerns about trade clouded outlook for fuel demand, Reuters reported.


European, Asian stocks falterWorries over global trade and economic growth weighed on global stocks today. Shanghai Composite settled 0.19 per cent down while Hang Seng fell 1.11 per cent.

Technical viewThe Nifty50 formed a candle like ‘Bearish Belt Hold’ on the daily chart today. ""The index made a strong bear candle on the weekly chart, with the 400-point range pointing towards severity of the correction. As the bulls are unable to make any meaningful recovery, the chances of dipping below 9,950 to complete one corrective structure looks bright in the next couple of trading sessions,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

The Nifty50 index opened positive but failed to continue its momentum in line with Monday’s session and witnessed a dip towards the 10,180 level.

It formed a small Spinning Candle and remained consolidative with limited upside for most part of the session. Recently, it took support near the psychologically important 10,000 mark and it has showed a positive divergence with technical indicators, turning from its deep oversold territory.

Now, it has to continue to hold above the 10,180-10,200 zone to extend its move towards 10,280 and then 10,333 levels, while on the downside support exists at 10,138 and then 10,080 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,000 followed by 10,200 and 9,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by strike price 10,500. There was Put writing at 10,200 followed by 10,000 and Call writing at 10,300 followed by 10,500.

India VIX moved up 3.27 per cent to 20.47. Volatility is not cooling down and that is the only concern for the market. VIX has to go down below 17-16 levels to confirm a short-term trend reversal and a decent bounceback after the sharp cut in last two months.

Bank Nifty opened flat but failed to hold above 25,000 and drifted towards 24,700 mark. It failed to continue the momentum of last session and remained negative to range-bound for most part of the session. Now it has to hold above 24,650 to extend its gains towards 25,250 and then 25,500 levels while on the downside, major support is seen at 24,500 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 10,225 with a loss of 0.57 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Union Bank, Divi’s lab, Ujjivan, Bank of India, Grasim and Escorts while shorts were seen in BPCL, LIC Housing Finance, Jubilant Foodworks, NIIT Tech, IndusInd Bank, Eicher Motor and Kotak Bank."

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 3 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• CLSA has retained buy rating on 
Lemon Tree Hotels with a target price of Rs 80. With the launch of the Kolkata and Udaipur property in the second quarter of FY20, the execution risk for Lemon Tree is now largely behind, said CLSA. Lemon Tree completed the acquisition of ‘Keys’ on November 1 and would be consolidated from third quarter onwards, said CLSA. Shares of Lemon Tree ended down 2 per cent at Rs 59.35 on Friday.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating on 
Jindal Steel and Power with a target price of Rs 139. High leverage ratios and losses in international operations were a drag on Jindal Steel stock, said Morgan Stanley. Any initiative that turns around the international operations and helps in monetizing these assets would help in improving its net debt position, said morgan Stanley. The company has also signed an agreement to sell its Botswana assets, which if executed, could further help improve the net debt situation, the brokerage said. Shares of Jindal Steel ended up 2.79 per cent at Rs 143.65 on Friday.


• Citigroup Global Markets has maintained buy rating on 
Varroc Engineering and revised target price to Rs 630 from Rs 750. The company reported a much weaker VLS eprformance than expected, said Citi. Ramp up in the new plants (a little prolonged than earlier expected) should aid revenue growth, said Citi. As dependence on Tesla comes down (as per cent of total VLS business), the company would likely see a steadier revenue and margin trajectory, the brokerage said. Shares of Varroc Engineering ended down 0.25 per cent at Rs 447 on Friday.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on 
Grasim Industries and lowered target price to Rs 780 from Rs 790. The brokerage said sharp fall in VSF and caustic soda prices hurt second quarter results with standalone Ebitda declining 38 per cent from year ago. Clarity on fund infusions into Vodafone Idea is the need of the hour and it could remain and overhang, the brokerage said. The brokerage has lowered target price but retained buy rating as steep holding company discount is unjustified. Shares of Grasim Industries ended up 2.8 per cent at Rs 755.25 on Friday.

• Investec Securities has maintained hold rating on 
Thermax and revised target price to Rs 1,095 from Rs 950. The brokerage said Thermax's second quarter results were operationally in line with estimates with Ebitda growing at 18 per cent year-on-year (YoY). The management has indicated new order finalisations continue to get deferred in both domestic and international markets and does not anticipate any large order placement in power/ steel/ fertilizer sectors. The brokerage sees limited positive triggers for the stock in the absence of revival in industrial capex cycle. Shares of Thermax ended down 1.7 per cent at Rs 1,050.50 on Friday."

The financial distress at Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture has dragged down the wealth of Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose group is the second-largest investor in the teetering wireless carrier.

The tycoon, who joined forces with the British operator last year, has lost about a third of his fortune since the end of 2017 as mounting losses and debt decimated the equity of the troubled Vodafone Idea Ltd. In addition, shares of his flagship firms that produce chemicals, metals and cement have also tumbled amid a demand slump, eroding his wealth.

The net worth of Birla has shrunk to about $6 billion from $9.1 billion two years ago, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A majority of his fortune is derived from his ownership of Aditya Birla Group, a conglomerate that controls his main holdings.

Birla is the latest mogul to burn his fingers in India’s cutthroat phone-services market since Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. entered the fray in 2016 and drove two rivals to bankruptcy. Formed by the merger of Vodafone’s local unit and Birla’s cellular operator, Vodafone Idea last week reported the worst loss in the nation’s corporate history, while the British partner flagged the risk of a collapse.


Bloomberg
Aditya Birla Group has a stake in Hindalco Industries Ltd., the world’s largest aluminum rolling company, and owns a part of Grasim Industries Ltd., which controls India’s biggest cement maker.

For the Aditya Birla Group, the hit on the telecommunications business couldn’t have come at a worse time. Cooling global growth amid a trade war between the U.S. and China, as well as an economic slowdown at home has curbed demand for industrial raw materials the group produces.

Vodafone Idea’s woes deepened last month after India’s top court sided with the government’s demand for $4 billion in fee-arrears from prior years. Already burdened by $14 billion of debt, the order came as a blow to its finances weakened by a brutal war with Jio. Ambani’s operator this year became the country’s No. 1 carrier with 380 million users by offering free calls and cheap data.

Shares of Vodafone Idea have plunged 90% since end-2017, shrinking its market value to $2.7 billion.

“Vodafone and Idea have been going through a complex merger and, at the same time, trying to keep their heads above water in the battle with Reliance Jio,” said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, a professor of business strategy at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. “The Supreme Court judgment came at the most inopportune time.”

Hindalco, which makes aluminum and copper, reported a 33% drop in profit for the latest quarter as the prices of both the metals slid in the three months through September. Shares of Hindalco have tumbled 31% since end-2017, cutting its market value to $5.9 billion. The S&P BSE Sensex has gained 19% in the same period.

The slowdown in India’s $2.7 trillion economy has cooled demand for commodities such as cement to chemicals and textiles manufactured by Grasim. Its stock has dropped 33% since end-2017.

Vodafone Idea’s troubles have also weighed on Grasim, which owns about 12% of the carrier.

This week brought some signs of relief to Vodafone Idea shareholders. Its shares have more than doubled in the four days through Nov. 20 as the three rivals -- including Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd. -- signaled an end to the price war. Bharti reported a record quarterly loss last week as well.

On Wednesday, the government deferred airwave payments for two years, providing some relief for the industry roiled by high license fees and spectrum costs. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said she wants all companies to flourish and none to fail.

“The tariff hikes are positive,” Jefferies analysts led by Piyush Nahar said in a note this week. Despite the positive move, relief from the government remains crucial, especially for Vodafone Idea, they wrote."
10,2018-11-22,Grasim,"I am expecting a revival in FMCG and pharma sectors in the coming quarters. In case of big ticket items like steel industry, fertiliser industry, power industry, I am not expecting it to happen in the immediate future, says MS Unnikrishnan, MD & CEO, Thermax. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The improvement in the chemical segment lead to better margins but do you think it can be sustained at these levels?Margins that we clocked in the current quarter will certainly be sustained and possibly improved going forward, though not substantially.


You have secured orders worth about Rs 1,700 crore in Q2. Inflows were driven by domestic orders largely. What are some of the key wins and what else is in the pipeline?In the domestic market, the largest order in the quarter was for a flue gas desulphurisation system for air pollution control from a power plant. It was worth around Rs 470 crore. We have had orders from different sectors within the country. There was also a booking from cement industry of a wastage recovery-based captive power plant; a fairly large order was from one of the cement companies in the southern part of India. We have had orders coming from dairy, food processing, varied consumer-oriented industry but larger projects were limited to the flue gas desulphurisation and the captive power plant.


What is the outlook in the energy segment? What about the execution of RCF, Grasim and the JSW orders?That would be the Dangote order from Nigeria. The last part will be revenue recognised in the current quarter. JSW will continue to be recognised in the next two quarters also. We have got National Fertiliser, Gujarat Alkalis… in total Rs 5,300 crore worth of orders available on hand and a good part of them are to be revenue recognised in the next 12 months. So, a good deal of execution will go through in the next two quarters also.


Analysts believe that it is crucial for the company to see a full-fledged revival in the private capex cycle and a pickup in export order finalisation. What is the situation on ground? What more does the government need to do?I do not think anything further can be done by the government. What has gone wrong so far in the Indian market could be out of the rural distress. Fundamentally, the cash in the hands of the consumer has come down and not much positive enthusiasm is being shown by the consumer. Once the consumption comes down, the capacity utilisation of the industry will also come down. Once the capacity utilisation comes down, nobody will want to create new capacities. Only when you create any capacity, do capital goods companies like Thermax get benefitted. 

The government has done a lot in the last three to four months. A slew of changes have been brought in terms of the tax rate being reduced, interest rates coming down, but none of that seems to be picking up the consumption pattern in the country.

There was a slight improvement in the order in October. Unless positive sentiments prevail in the market for not less than 6-7 months, you would not see consumption going back to the original levels that prevailed in the pre 5-5.5% GDP growth era of 8-9-10% growth when everybody consumed everything. 

In order to create capacities, one has to wait for some more time. I do not blame the government for it, the government has done a lot of things but that alone cannot make the entire consumer sentiment change in the country. And possibly the government can go ahead with a lot of mega projects which they have announced that they will be having $1 trillion worth of projects will be taken up by the government in the current five-year period of time but that remain there on the announcement level. Further working it out in detail as to whether there may be a new 100 railway stations, another 100 airports to be created, bullet train not only for one segment, multiple areas to be introduced, ports be built and rural electrification, rural roads, water supply system, I mean, a slew of things are already known to the government to be started but that cannot be remaining at the announcement level. It has to go down to the level of tendering, placement of orders and once that is done, there will be a demand pickup but that will take some time. 


I am expecting that the international markets will also start improving going forward, but one has to give time for it.-MS Unnikrishnan

Your export order inflow has suffered from lack of order finalisation. Given the pickup in the export market, it is fairly vital for the next leg of growth for the company. Can you share with us some sort of an outlook here?The inquiry levels are fairly good in the international market. The only thing is the order finalisation in the market that we operate in, i.e. Middle East, South East Asia, South America and Africa -- these markets also are slowing down. I do not see a recovery in that market happening at a faster pace. Possibly it will follow the same pattern as India. One has got to be content with the selective orders which going to get concluded and where we need to be very aggressive in pricing. That is something which we are already doing to ensure our costs are under control and our execution is at the peak in terms of capabilities. A combination of both should be helping us to a certain extent. 

But the main challenge that I am worried about going forward is the trade war between China and America which is almost at peak level and they are unable to settle it out at this point of time. There are capacities idling in China and they do not mind picking up an order at any kind of price from anywhere in the world. So the Chinese competition in the global market is not for Thermax alone. It is going to hot up for the entire Indian industry or even European companies. In that kind of a scenario, picking orders is not a problem, but maintaining margins could be difficult. One has to be a lot more careful. I am expecting that the international markets will also start improving going forward, but one has to give time for it.


You have also mentioned that there have been inquiries across sectors but the conclusion remains challenging and that you even may end FY20 with a flattish order inflow growth. So, where do you see your overall order book?I am expecting a conclusion of orders for the Barmer refinery and the Gujarat refinery and the Panipat refinery going forward. I expect the refinery sector to be opening up. I would see a lot more of consumer-oriented industries in anticipation of the consumption improvement in the 21-22 years. We will start finalising orders going forward because whatever said and done, after placement of an order for a factory to get constructed even in the food sector or FMCG sector, would take not less than 16 to 18 month from commission of the factory. If somebody were to create capacity for FY21-FY22, they have to place orders immediately and things are going to be reversing in India. 

I am expecting that there will be a revival in the FMCG sector, pharma sector, and I am looking forward to all of them picking up in the coming quarters but for the big ticket items like steel industry, fertiliser industry, power industry, I am not expecting it to happen in the immediate future.

Please remember, in the consumer-oriented sector, the sizes of the projects are not so large. You would find that the entire ticket size may be less than Rs 1,000 crore and orders for companies like mine will be limited to maybe Rs 2 crore, Rs 5 crore or Rs 10 crore. But when you talk about a steel industry, a single order could be as high as Rs 500 crore. Those kind of projects will take some more time to happen.


Danstroker made an operational profit in Q2 marking a turnaround but reported a PAT loss due to one off payments so can we see a profits in the second half what is the update there?Second half will be profitable but after absorbing the loss of the first half there will be break even plus is my expectation but going forward with the kind of improvement that we have been able to bring into the operational efficiency the company will be profitable next year certainly."

Ashok Leyland| Buy| Target price: Rs 119| Stop loss: Rs 109

Positional traders should buy into this counter with a stop below Rs 89 on closing basis,"" said Mohammad.

0,2018-12-03,Grasim,"Offering products that have a strong consumer preference plays a significant role in the long-term growth of a company. 

Strategies like product differentiation, brand building, promotional campaigns and customer servicing are often used by companies to remain competitive. Market share, which is derived by using sales revenue, is a useful metric to determine the relative competitiveness of a company. Market share is calculated by dividing a firm’s sales revenue by its industry’s aggregate sales revenue. 

A company with rising market share enjoys consumer preference. A larger market share acts as a strong entry barrier for other firms. A large, growing, market share also enables a company to benefit from the economies of scale that contribute to higher profitability. Scale of operations leads to costs savings as large-scale production reduces per unit or variable costs. Larger market share induces confidence in both the existing and prospective customers, providing a strong foundation for new product launches. Companies with rising market share not only have robust business models but also the ability to generate market beating returns. 

We studied data for the past five financial years, starting from the 2013-14 and calculated the market share for companies with market cap greater than Rs 500 crore for each of these five years. To derive the market share, the consolidated annual net sales of each company were divided by their industry aggregate net sales. The industry aggregate sales included sales of listed as well as unlisted companies. 

We filtered out companies whose market share for 2017-18 was the highest relative to their share in the past four financial years. Only companies whose market share rose consistently over the past five years were included. An additional filter was applied to look for companies with a minimum market share of 10% in the year 2017-18 in their sector. Some 14 companies passed these filters. 

In the past three years, these companies delivered an average point-to point returns of 86.2% compared to the BSE 500 Index that delivered a return of 34.82%. In the past five years, the average return of these companies was 794.5%, while the BSE500 Index delivered a return of 90.11% during the same period. 

Let us look at six companies out these 14 that have strong buy recommendations and significant one-year stock price growth potential according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some companies like Inter-globe Aviation, TVS Motors and Kansai Nerolac that have decent market share are not included in the our list as they have already surpassed their 1-year target prices.


1. Apollo Hospitals Enterprise
 The company operates in the healthcare industry and has a robust presence across the healthcare ecosystem, with hospitals, pharmacies and diagnostic clinics. According to a report by ICICI Direct, the company’s margin improvements are visible across segments as its long capex cycle is near completion. 


The proposed pharmacy reorganisation will help unlock value for Apollo. The stock is poised to offer a better riskreward perspective at the current level. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company’s return on equity (RoE) is likely to be 8.6% in 2018-19 and its price could rise by 13.7% in one year


2. CCL Products (India)
 Its a tea and coffee player. Besides manufacturing coffee, CCL also offers customised coffee products. Antique Stock Broking is positive on the company due to its strong business model, management’s rich experience, capacity augmentation and sharpening brand focus. 


The stock has strong re-rating potential due to its robust free cash flows and inexpensive valuations. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to generate an RoE of 21.4% in 2018-19 and has 1-year price growth potential of 28.2%.


3. Dixon Technologies (India)
 It operates in the electronic consumer durables industry and manufactures LED TVs, washing machines, LED and CFL bulbs, tube lights, mobile phones and CCTVs. According to a report by Dolat Capital, increasing share in original design manufacturing segment, backward integration in all the segments and customer additions will improve margins and return ratios. 


 Though Dixon results for the second quarter of 2018-19 were below expectations, the management has maintained its guidance and expects improvement in the next half of 2018-19. The company is likely to generate an RoE of 20.9% in 2018-19.


4. Grasim Industries
 A Diversified player, Grasim produces fibres, chemicals and cement. Other business segments include NBFC, asset management and life Insurance. JP Morgan believes that Grasim is well-placed to deliver strong earnings growth over the next 2-3 years. Its standalone businesses, VSF and chemicals, are generating significant free cash flows. 


The brokerage feels there could be capital allocation-related concerns due to Vodafone and Idea’s announcment to raise Rs 25,000 crore—Grasim would like to hold its stake in the entity. According to Bloomberg, the company’s RoE in 2018-19 is likely to be 6.7%.


5. KEI Industries
 A Cable industry player, KEI manufactures and markets extra high voltage, medium voltage and low voltage power cables. It supplies products to private as well as public sector clients across the world. Indsec Securities is bullish on the stock due to its strong order book and robust growth outlook, given the capacity expansion in the cables and wires segment. 


In addition, the substations segment is likely to see a considerable pick-up due to the recent growth in the electricity and railways sectors. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company is likely to generate an RoE of 27.5% in 2018-19 and its 1-year price could grow by 36.9%.


6. Maruti Suzuki
 
The company manufactures and sells passenger cars, auto components and spare parts. JP Morgan believes that Maruti’s revenue will continue to improve in 2018-19 due to rising volumes and improved pricing. Moreover, the current high EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins are likely to sustain, given the high operating leverage, platform consolidation and limited impact from its Gujarat plant. 


The valuations more than adequately discount near term margin concerns. The brokerage house expects that Maruti Suzuki will be able to hold onto its market share in 2018-19. According to Bloomberg, the 2018-19 RoE of the company is likely to be 20.3%.

9,2018-12-21,Grasim,"The profitability of Indian cement companies should recover from the recent lows, but the pace will be slower than expected, said Morgan Stanley, downgrading its view on the industry to ‘in-line’.

The financial services company has downgraded UltraTech Cement to ‘equalweight’ from ‘overweight’ and cut target price by 17 per cent to Rs 4,116. It has also cut rating on Grasim Industries to ‘equalweight’ and lowered target price by 25.5 per cent to Rs 958.

Morgan Stanley has maintained ‘underweight’ ratings on Shree Cement and JK Lakshmi Cement, and an ‘equalweight’ rating on Ambuja Cement. ACC is Morgan Stanley’s only ‘overweight’ rated stock in the sector due to operating leverage and valuation relative to history.

Shares of UltraTech Cement ended down 1 per cent at Rs 4,047.30. Grasim Industries ended down 3.1 per cent at Rs 830.90.

Cement companies’ earnings in the first half of the ongoing financial year 2018-19 (April-March) was disappointing due to weaker-than-expected cement prices and higher costs, said Morgan Stanley.

The firm raised FY19 demand growth estimate to 9 per cent from 7.5 per cent due to strong first half of financial year 2018-19. However, it sees downside risks in the urban and semi-urban real estate segment even as infrastructure-led demand is likely to be sustained.

Morgan Stanley expects industry capacity utilization to rise a modest 1 percentage point from a year ago in the next financial year 2019-20, to 79 per cent. Potential moderation in demand in the second half of FY19 also caps upside risk to prices, said Morgan Stanley."
10,2018-12-27,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Healthy buying in energy, FMCG and technology stocks helped domestic equity indices extend gains for the second consecutive session on Thursday. 

Firming trend in US markets and a dip in crude oil prices amid oversupply concerns boosted investor mood back home. However, a fall in the rupee against the dollar capped the gains. 

Sensex opened in the positive terrain and stayed in the green throughout the day, before settling 157 points, or 0.44 per cent, higher at 35,807. NSE’s Nifty added 50 points or 0.47 per cent to end at 10,779.

The market traded in the negative zone throughout the day, as gloom in global markets extended to the domestic bourses.

Emerging stocks and currencies slid, as fears of slowing global growth spooked investors and made them move towards safe haven assets.

Optimism stemming from third quarter earnings faded and market reacted to the global sentiment due to the absence of fresh decisive triggers back home.

Sensex closed with a cut of 134 points, or 0.37 per cent, at 36,444.64, while Nifty settled 39 points, or 0.36 per cent, lower at 10,922.75.

As per Reuters, base metals prices dropped across global markets with benchmark London copper extending a sharp drop from the previous session, after economic growth in top metals consumer China slowed to its weakest in 28 years.


Sun shines againNotching up gains for a second straight day, India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharma closed 4.95 per cent up at Rs 418.05 after the company clarified that it neither gave any loan nor guarantees to Suraksha Realty.


A dull Q3 showAsian Paints on Tuesday posted 14.60 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit at Rs 635.60 crore for the quarter ended December 31. Consolidated revenue of the company increased 24 per cent to Rs 5,293.99 crore in Q3FY19 over Rs 4,267.49 crore in Q3FY18.

12,2019-02-07,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Headline equity indices Sensex and Nifty ended flat on Thursday after seesaw trade as RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) lowered the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent in a surprise move and changed its policy stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘calibrated tightening’. 

The market was expecting a change in policy stance, but the rate cut came as a surprise. The market swung between gains and losses after the RBI move that economists say can give a boost to the domestic economy. 

However, after an initial knee-jerk response, the market turned stock-specific and remained so for the rest of the session. Sensex closed 4 points down at 36,971, while Nifty settled with a nominal gain of 7 points at 11,069.

Gains in shares of Sun Pharma, ITC, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto were offset by losses in Reliance Industries, HDFC and Larsen & Toubro in the 30-pack Sensex.

Global cues, too, were lacklustre. However, rupee's rise against the US dollar and a fall in crude oil prices offered some relief for the market.

16,2019-02-11,Grasim,"Edelweiss Securities has a buy call on Grasim Industries with a target price of Rs 988.

The current market price of Grasim Industries is Rs 710.80.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Grasim Industries price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage: Grasim Industries’ standalone Q3FY19 EBITDA impressed yet again rising 18 per cent YoY (being 11 per cent ahead of estimates). While VSF performance is in line, the chemicals and textile segments led the overall outperformance. Factoring in 9MFY19 and Grasim’s proven ability to withstand global headwinds, we see no major risks to our FY19 and FY20 estimates. Besides, we are introducing FY21E with EBITDA growth of 8 per cent. While the overhang of capital allocation to group companies – Vodafone Idea (Idea) and Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL) – remains, we retain ‘BUY/SP’ on Grasim given : (1) 60.3 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement exceeds its current market cap (therefore a value play), and (2) sanguine outlook for the SA entity over medium to long term. Factoring in the recent cuts in target prices of key holdings and rolling over the valuation to Q1FY21E, we are tweaking down our SOTP based target price to Rs 988 (from Rs 1,066)."
17,2019-02-12,Grasim,"I don’t think Binani would have been resolved if it wasn't for IBC. It’s a very brave reform by the Modi govt. You must give them credit 
Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla Group, spoke to ET on issues ranging from how Vodafone Idea is tackling competition to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and his views on the next government. 
Edited excerpts:


How do you see Vodafone Idea in a tough market after Jio unleashed a tariff war?
The industry is in a tough situation, but what is Vodafone Idea doing to combat the situation is more important. We know that the number of telecom operators have shrunk from 8-10 to three … therefore it has changed the dynamics in a way. But, having said that, we have created scale and size. There are 387 million subscribers (and) 40% of India's mobile voice traffic. Having said that, the promoters have invested Rs 2,57,000 crore and so it’s not an entity to be scoffed at. Will it withstand Reliance Jio is a different question, but the fact that it is underinvested is not true, because together the investment has been substantial.


How is the merged entity shaping up?
In one quarter of its market, the two networks have been hooked up — which means the consumer gets more penetration more coverage and you're bringing both networks together so that the consumer experience goes up. And that's done in Bangalore, Karnataka (and) all of Madhya Pradesh, which is fairly quick considering the consolidation has just happened. At this scale, nothing like this has been executed anywhere in the world. In the next 12-18 months, both networks will be hooked up completely and that's addressing the basic question of consumer experience, which has taken a huge beating for all operators in the last few months and is likely to get only worse.


Are synergies of the merger showing?
We had talked about synergy targets of $10 billion in NPV (net present value) terms and this quarter results already indicate Rs 3,500-crore annualised savings, which to my mind, given that it has just been three months, is huge. They are also saying there will be Rs 8,500 crore of savings rate in the third year of the merger, which is substantial. Bringing down the cost is obviously a very important part of the equation and that’s what is going to essentially push up your operating profit.

I hadn't thought that the combined entity would become so productive so early, so I don't hear any Idea vs Vodafone now in the last two months. It happened for the first two months but died down very quickly.


How are you responding to tariff war?
Vodafone Idea has also now come up with some schemes that are looking at a minimum commitment plan. They are saying we want to weed out the non-paying or very lowpaying subscribers, which would release capacity to some extent but, more importantly, take ARPU (average revenue per subscriber) up, because in that base of non-paying or very low-paying — which is less than ?25 kind of customer — there has been a lot of churn … it’s the people that they wanted to churn out that have left the network — 35 million is the right kind of people who have left.


How about beefing up finance?
We are talking about a Rs 25,000-crore rights issue out of which Rs 18,500 crore comes from promoters and the balance by way of rights. At the current price level, that seems doable. Will it happen very easily? Obviously not. But there is an ongoing effort to ensure the rights issue goes through. We are also selling non-core assets, whether it is towers or optic fibre and that cash flow will come through.


There are some concerns about group companies and investors subscribing to the rights issue…
Vodafone is completely committed. I think the view is that Grasim should not dilute its holding (in Vodafone Idea) at this point in time because prices are attractive, there is a definite plan in place and why should Grasim as a promoter, having been invested for more than 25 years at these price, dilute its holding. Plus, there is the affordability issue as well. We don't see as promoter, and also Grasim as a board and its independent directors, the rationale for not subscribing at this point in time: it doesn't seem the right thing to do. There has been a very transparent communication about this with investors and, second, I don't think investors seem to have a problem.


Will the money be enough?
We believe it is good enough for the next three to four years. No one raises funds that will last for the rest of your life. But if you have enough funding for the next three years, it is good enough for the current situation. So, you are not a pushover.


Will Vodafone Idea be restricted to pure mobility play?
Our play is much more restricted as compared to Jio. We are not getting into content, we are not buying content providers, we are not getting into direct-to-home. When you look at investments, you can't really compare like-to-like since our’s is much more pure mobility play. The stock did well after the last quarter results and will only get better. But if you ask me how you will compete with Jio, do you have as much cash flow, obviously not. We have a high level of confidence from the point of view of operations, quality of network, customer experience, costs.


When do you expect tariffs to rise?
I can't crystal ball. But I think we are on the right path. The strategy that Vodafone Idea is going to follow is to collaborate with other parts of the ecosystem as opposed to owning every part of the ecosystem. Therefore, capital requirements come down and it is much more pure mobility play. None of this will come without incremental investment and I am assuming that at some stage a return on investment is a criterion they (Jio) will look at. On tariffs, no one knows. All prediction has been proven wrong.


What can the government do for telecom?
I think there is a huge block up of cash that has come on account of GST for the telecom sector because there isn't any way to offset it. What else can the government do but help ease that burden? That's a very legitimate way of releasing cash for the industry. And I'm sure that's the case for Jio also.


Is there a chance for another consolidation in the telecom sector?
I don't think so. I think there are enough examples globally when there are three players in the market, they have survived it.


How was your experience of acquiring Binani Cement through the IBC process?
First, the IBC is a very deep reform. It is almost as deep a reform as GST or demonetisation. It changes the fundamental character of Indian business. I think a lot of promoters treated debt as equity and did not find the need to actually repay within a specified period. Obviously the banking system has gained tremendously.

At the time when we went through Binani, it (IBC) was all still very new, and there were lots of tweaks that were needed to be done but that is true of any important legislation as IBC. I don’t think a Binani would have been resolved if it wasn't for IBC. So, that’s a very brave reform carried out by the Modi government. You must give them credit for it.


Do you think some promoters are trying to game the system by constant appeals and counter appeals?
I think it’s a robust enough law. It can cause delays, but I don't think the system can be gamed. That's my clear sense.


Does it change the fundamental character in a good way?
It does. There is this fear of losing your assets if you are not keeping financial commitments which can only be good for the economy.


Will the market, economy or investment climate be affected if elections throw up a hung parliament?
I think the good thing is that structurally, the economy will grow at more than 7%. That is a sturdy situation to be in, irrespective of the kind of government that comes in. I don't think any government is going to go back on the reforms process. There is no government that won't attempt to get people to come and manufacture in India. Having said that, a coalition will have its own pulls and pressures and can never be the same as the situation today. I think the government has a role to play in taking that 7% (growth) to 9.5-10%. Therefore, the shape and composition of the government is important. We haven't reached a point where politics and economics have been totally divorced from each other.


The threat of imports from FTA nations…
Most of them are one-sided … when make in India is such a large theme and creation of jobs has become a huge issue, why would you want to sign an FTA which hurts Indian industry?


Has dialogue with the government helped?
I think the government understands the need for doing away with FTAs. This government is very cautious in terms of being a very responsible global player, so they don't want to take an action that is seen as being out of line in any way.

For example, I don't think they want to be being adversarial to China in any way at all, which is perhaps an important part of the reason behind not protecting domestic industries from China. But it’s not about protecting, its providing a level playing field. So, the government's general view is that it needs to be reviewed when it comes for revision and one hopes at that time an objective view will prevail."
18,2019-02-13,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Ignoring decent gains in its Asian peers, Indian equity benchmark Sensex suffered losses on Wednesday, extending losing streak to a fifth successive session, on selling in bank, energy, auto and metal stocks.

Stocks opened in the positive territory as macroeconomic numbers in terms of retail inflation and industrial production boosted market mood. 

However, a fresh spell of selling emerged in the latter half of the session, which caused the market to end the day in the red.

Experts say other than the uninspiring December quarter earnings and anxiety around general elections, the pressure in NBFC and banking spaces were still making investors jittery.

“The issue surrounding the NBFC sector is still not out of the way and auto and infrastructure sector is struggling in terms of numbers, which is not giving comfort to the market in terms of growth visibility,"" said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President at Sharekhan.

Sensex closed 120 points, or 0.33 per cent, lower at 36,034.11, while Nifty lost 38 points, or 0.35 per cent, to close at 10,793.65.

19,2019-02-15,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Logging its biggest weekly fall since October 2018, equity benchmark Sensex extended its losing streak into the seventh session and ended the week 1,166 points, or 3.15 per cent, lower. 

Domestic stocks tanked on Friday amid fresh concerns over global economic slowdown after China's producer prices data for January showed a downward trend for the seventh successive month and the US retail sales recorded its biggest drop since 2009. 

Weakness in the rupee following a surge in global crude oil prices further dampened the mood. 

Uninspiring December quarter earnings, anxiety over political uncertainty in the run-up to the general elections and scepticism around the health of NBFCs and PSU banks have made investors stay away from the market. Every rise in the market is meeting with a fresh spell of profit booking. 

After falling some 365 points earlier in the day, Sensex pared much of the losses on support from shares of NTPC (up 4.13 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 1.47 per cent) and Larsen & Toubro (up 1.31 per cent) and closed the day 67 points, or 0.19 per cent, down at 35,808.

ONGC gains on Q3 earnings

20,2019-02-18,Grasim,"New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries Monday said it has inked a pact to acquire chlor-alkali business of KPR Industries by way of a slump sale for a cash consideration of Rs 253 crore.

The company, which has inked a definitive agreement to acquire the business, said the transaction will be funded through internal accruals.

KPR Industries' chlor-alkali business comprises an under-construction 200 TPD project at Balabhadrapuram, Andhra Pradesh.

As part of the deal, Grasim would take over the assets and identified liabilities associated with the business. KPR Industries on the other hand will utilise the capital towards a full and final settlement of the lenders' dues.

""This acquisition is a strategic fit, and further strengthens our group's leadership in the chlor-alkali sector. Caustic soda is a critical input in the aluminium sector. Given the expansion plans for the aluminium businesses, it will serve as an excellent sourcing point for leading aluminium players,"" Birla Carbon Business CEO Santrupt B Misra said in a statement.

The acquisition is in line with Grasim's strategy to strengthen operations on the East Coast of the country, the company said.

""Further, the purchase of a partially-completed project vis-a-vis a greenfield project will translate into a shorter time-to-market,"" it added.

Once operationalised, the project, along with other ongoing expansion projects, will enhance Grasim's caustic soda capacity to 1.22 MMTPA.

Caustic soda is one of the essential inputs for the manufacture of alumina. It is also used widely in various other industries -- viscose staple fibre, water treatment, pharma, chemicals etc.

The chlor-alkali division of Grasim is already operating seven chlor-alkali plants across India.

23,2019-02-19,Grasim,"When a large number of companies do not show any visible signs of improvement in earnings, one should follow the age-old market wisdom: focus on the value theme. Schemes which follow value theme are not only extremely careful about valuation, but also consider earnings growth equally important.

Among value schemes, Tata Equity PE stands out for its consistency. In almost all market cycles, the scheme has outperformed its benchmark index and peers by a reasonably good margin. The scheme’s fund managers Sonam Udasi and Amey Sathe follow a clearcut strategy of investing in companies whose valuation is lower than what the Sensex is quoting at the time of the investment.

Given the looming uncertainty over the pace of earnings’ growth in mid- and small-sized companies, high exposure to large-sized companies is a sensible strategy. Keeping this in mind, the fund managers have constructed quite a diversified portfolio with high exposure (82%) to large-sized companies. This strategy has paid off. The scheme has given 17.5% and 20.1% returns in the past three- and five-year periods, while its peers in the category have returned 12% and 16% during the same period.

True to its value, in the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers have bought well-placed companies which look attractive in terms of value theme. A case in the point is Sun TV Networks.

Tata Equity PE has been a consistent performer in the past three- and five-year periods. Its fund managers have followed a prudent strategy of enhancing exposure to large-sized companies as a large number of macroeconomic factors show that there would high volatility in earnings of mid and-small-sized companies. A large number of companies of the scheme’s portfolio have performed well in the December 2018 quarter."

Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities said, “Trump on Sunday postponed sanctions on $200 billion worth of goods from China which caused the dollar to weaken and rupee to gain strength. On the line of Asian markets, Indian indices opened in the green rose through the day.” 


Rupee gains strength

Rupee extended its rally. The domestic currency was trading over 13 paise higher at 71 against the dollar in afternoon trade after the greenback came under pressure against indexed currencies amid foreign fund flows and a higher opening for domestic equity market.

3,2019-03-11,Grasim,"The market tends to downsize the valuations of large conglomerates, as it is difficult to analyse them. Parent companies, therefore, often quote at a discount to their intrinsic values. “It is easy to analyse standalone companies. A number of businesses makes analysis quite difficult. Since the risk is higher, the market gives only lower valuation,” says Shailendra Kumar, CIO, Narnolia Financial Advisors.

Also, with holding companies, investors are forced to buy several businesses, all of which may not be their favourite, and this also leads to lower valuations. Another reason is that most Indian holding companies are investment companies of their promoters, and their actions may often be in the interest of the promoters and not of the minority shareholders. Finally, the valuation differentials across countries also contribute to the parent company discount. For instance, Maruti Suzuki is now quoting at a premium to its Japanese parent, Suzuki Motor Corp.


Sound investment bets
As discounts of some holding companies have recently increased, they have become quite promising. “About 30%-40% holding company discounts are common in India and, therefore, go with companies with larger discounts,” says Daljeet S. Kohli, Fund Manager, Valentis Advisors.

But you need to be careful of intergroup transfers that may favour promoters and not the retail investors. For instance, the recent decision of Cairn India Holding—a subsidiary of Vedanta—to pay Rs 1,430 crore to Volcan Investments—the parent company of Vedanta—to invest in Anglo American, held by Volcan, has raised concerns. You should also avoid parent companies that are quoting at a discount because of poor corporate governance. Also, you need to stay invested for the long term, as it can take time before a parent company decides to unlock the value in the subsidiary companies.

After taking all of the above into consideration, the following holding companies seem ripe for investment*.


1. Bajaj Holdings: Robust growth of subsidiaries
Total value of holdings: Rs 68,215 crore
Market-cap of Bajaj Holdings: Rs 35,270 crore
Discount: 48% 

 Bajaj Holdings has several fast growing companies under its umbrella. It has direct investment in Bajaj Auto, and holdings in Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance through Bajaj Finserv. “Consumer durables finance penetration is only around 20% and Bajaj Finance has around 70% market share. Despite strong growth in past five years, Bajaj Finance’s loan book should grow at 32% CAGR over 2018-19 to 2020-21,” says a recent Jefferies India report. It’s unlisted subsidiaries, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, are also doing well. Given the performance of all its subsidiaries, the 48% discount to net asset value (NAV) is not justified.


2. Godrej Industries: Holds promising unlisted firms
Total value of holdings: Rs 30,644 crore
Market-cap of Godrej Inds: Rs 16,868 crore
Discount: 45% 

 After the listing of Godrej Agrovet, Godrej Industries has almost became a holding company because it generates major value from its listed subsidiaries and associate companies. However, the business of the parent company, which mostly deals in chemicals now, is not negligible—it generated revenue and net profit of Rs 573 crore and Rs 50 crore, respectively, during the third quarter of 2018-19. As it has several unlisted subsidiaries with 100% holdings, the actual discount is much more than the 45% computed on the basis of its listed subsidiaries.


3. Grasim Holdings: Parent sees sharp growth
Total value of holdings: Rs 84,823 crore
Market-cap of Godrej Inds: Rs 53,131 crore
Discount: 37% 

 Since the domestic demand for VSF—a biodegradable fibre— continues to be robust, the standalone business of Grasim is also doing well. While its revenue for the third quarter of 2018-19 grew 21% year-on-year (y-o-y), to Rs 5,293 crore, its net profit grew 28%, y-o-y, to Rs 608 crore. The outlook for its standalone business remains robust. While its discount based on listed subsidiaries is placed only at 37%, this does not consider its booming standalone business. Even at a PE of eight, based on its last year’s standalone net profit, this division should be valued at Rs 14,000 crore, which will take the discount to 46%. While most of its subsidiaries are also doing well, there is concern about its loss-making telecom subsidiary—Idea. However, Grasim’s Idea holding came down to 11.55%, after the telco’s recent merger with Vodafone.

6,2019-03-16,Grasim,"MUMBAI: Engineering major Larsen & Toubro's Chairman AM Naik received India’s second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, from the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, at a ceremony in the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on Saturday.

For the 'Padma' awards this year, 112 people were selected. Naik is only business leader to recieve Padma Vibhushan this year. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2009.

Accepting the Padma Vibhushan, Naik said, ""I have always considered myself fortunate to be in a position of service to India and to millions of my fellow countrymen. To receive such a high national honour is a matter of utmost joy for the L&T Group.""

The septuagenarian started his career at L&T in 1965 as a junior engineer at a salary of Rs 670 a month. He has on several occasions summarised his stint with the company with the song, “Jeena yahan, marna yahan, iske siva jaana kahan.” (You live here, you die here. Where else can one go but here?)

""For me, the Padma Vibhushan is an acknowledgement of the contributions made to the nation, industry and society by Larsen & Toubro – the company I am proud to have served for over five decades and led for the last two,"" he said.

Under his leadership, L&T expanded its portfolio in diversified fields like defence, nuclear power, aerospace, infrastructure, water and effluent treatment, hydrocarbon, financials services, and new age businesses like information technology and engineering services.

L&T, under his leadership, faced, resisted and succeeded in retaining its ownership twice in the past when Grasim and later the undivided Reliance Industries made attempts to takeover the company. 

He is involved with many charitable initiatives. He was recently appointed as the Chairman of National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship."
5,2019-03-16,Grasim,"Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries Saturday said it has received Rs 5,872.13 crore tax demand from the Income Tax department with respect to its merger with Aditya Birla Nuvo and Aditya Birla Financial Services.

""The company has, on March 15, 2019, received an order dated March 14, 2019, issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (DCIT) raising a demand of Rs 5,872.13 crore on account of dividend distribution tax (including interest),"" Grasim Industries said in regulatory filing.

DCIT held that as the demerger of the demerged undertaking is not in compliance with Section 2(19 AA) of the Act, the value of shares allotted by Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL) to the shareholders Grasim Industries, in consideration of the transfer and vesting of the Demerged Undertaking into ABCL, amounted to dividend, within the meaning of the Act, the filing added.

The company said, it is of view that, the aforesaid order is not tenable in law.

""The necessary action(s) against the order is being taken by the company,"" Grasim Industries added.

The company said, DCIT had issued a show cause notice on February 11, 2019, subsequently revised on March 1, 2019, as to why the provisions of section 115-0 read with section 115-Q of the Income Tax Act, 1961 should not be applied on the allotment of equity shares by ABCL to the shareholders Grasim Industries, pursuant to the mega merger between the three entities.

Following which, the company said it had filed its detailed submissions in response to these notices.

In September 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), bench at Ahmedabad, had approved the merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo (ABNL) with Grasim Industries to be followed by the listing of Aditya Birla Financial Services Ltd (ABFSL)."

7,2019-03-18,Grasim,"Once again, Grasim Industries’ quarterly results surpassed market expectations. The company’s standalone revenue and net profit for the third quarter zoomed 21% and 28%, respectively, year-on-year (y-o-y). Though there was a small fall in the margin of its viscose staple fibre (VSF) segment, it was offset by the steady performance of its caustic soda segment and the recovery in its textile segment.

Along with its group companies, Grasim enjoys a 17% share in the global VSF market. To strengthen its position further, Grasim is now looking to expand its capacity by 50%. Since domestic and global VSF demand continues to be robust, this capacity expansion should play out in Grasim’s favour. The company’s VSF monopoly in India, slower capacity additions by other global VSF majors due to environmental concerns, better margins due to backward integration, introduction of value-added VSF products, etc., are the other factors in favour of Grasim. 

The company is also increasing the capacity of its chemicals segment. This is a step towards strengthening backward integration because Grasim’s VSF segment is a major consumer of caustic soda. The capacity expansion in the VSF and chemical segments will involve an outlay of around Rs 7,600 crore over the next three years. But it will not lead to any financial stress for Grasim because all its three segments have been generating free cash flows.


Analysts’ views 
Hold 2
Buy 12

In addition to its standalone businesses, the company’s subsidiaries have also been doing well. For instance, its Ultratech Cements—Grasim holds 60.3% in it—and Aditya Birla Capital—Grasim stake is 56%—continue to do well. With most cement companies increasing prices by `25-50 per 50 kg bag in recent months, cement companies are expected to report better numbers in the coming quarters. The concerns about Grasim’s loss-making subsidiary, Idea, have also been allayed due to its recent merger with Vodafone— the merger has restricted Grasim’s stake in Idea to 11.55%. As its standalone business as well as subsidiaries are doing well, analysts feel that the holding company discount, of around 45%, particularly considering the performance of its standalone business, is not justified.

This discount is likely to come down in the coming years. The deep cut in valuation in the past year was because of capital allocation concerns with respect to Idea. But, as Grasim’s holding in the merged entity, Vodafone-Idea, is just 11.55%, any infusion of capital will now be in proportion to Grasim’s reduced take and won’t bring its balance sheet under stress.

11,2019-03-19,Grasim,"The promoters of Mindtree are in a desperate huddle, trying to retain the control of their firm from L&T that is pushing for a hostile bid. They have termed the move as a “grave threat” to the company's future.

L&T's ambition is backed by money; there is not much that can stop the firm eyeing a scale that it has long desired. 

For the founders of the Bengaluru-based firm, who hold about 13% of the company, there are fewer options. Two decades ago, L&T, the aggressor now, was in a similar spot. 

A M Naik, the non-executive chairman of the country's largest construction and engineering firm, thwarted hostile takeover bids from the Ambanis and Birlas in early 2000s when the company had almost slipped from his hands, a situation Mindtree sees itself in now.

In 1987, the late Dhirubhai Ambani had managed to wrest significant holding in the cash-rich L&T and then launched a hostile takeover bid in 1989.

However, political and other developments ensured Reliance remained a passive shareholder. Naik, who joined L&T as a junior engineer in the mid- 1960s and went on to become its Chairman, later recalled in a book the events leading up to Reliance's stake sale.

In November 2001, when Naik, then CEO and Managing Director, who was in Chicago, got a call from Mohan Karnani, then president of L&T cement business saying 'apna maalik badal gaya hai' (our owner has changed) and that the Birlas had bought complete stake of Reliance Industries in L&T in an all-cash deal.

""Within few minutes got another call from Anil Ambani, the then managing director of RIL, saying 'Anilbhai (Naik) you never wanted us. So we are going. We have sold the entire shareholding of Reliance in L&T to Kumar Mangalam Birla',"" the book quotes Naik as saying.

Naik recalled that he got another call, this time from Birla, who said ""you didn't come to us Naikji. So we have come to you.""

The mild-mannered Naik staved off Birlas entry into the company, pushing the case that firm should be allowed to retain its professional status. Known for his business acumen, he quickly drummed up support from political as well as institutional leaders to back his case. 

After months of haggling, Birla gave in, selling the stake to a trust run by L&T’s employees in June 2003. Birla got L&T’s cement division in the bargain, which we now know as UltraTech Cement.

""In the end we kept L&T independent. We ringfenced it from future takeover attempts by setting up the L&T employees welfare foundation that eventually bought Birlas stake. And the Birlas got our demerged cement business that added to their cement production capacity.""

This was to be Naik’s biggest contribution, turning the attentions of a hitherto pure engineering company oblivious to market realities, towards ways and means of protecting its independent status. 

""It relieved us of a non-core asset-heavy business, making us an AAA rated company by drastically cutting out debt equity ratio. It was a win-win for all,"" Naik said in the book.

""What seemingly started as a conflict situation with Grasim ended in a win-win solution for both the companies. Grasim became the largest and top quality cement producer and L&T emerged as one of the best engineering, manufacturing and projects company in this part of the world.

""A great moment of satisfaction came when, at the end, Mr Birla extended his hand to me and said, 'history should never, never forget you. You know what you have achieved: employee ownership of the company',"" Naik remembered."
13,2019-03-23,Grasim,"MUMBAI:The Bombay High Court on Friday granted interim relief to Grasim Industries, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, on a Rs 5,872-crore dividend distribution tax demand linked to a 2016 demerger plan of group businesses.

The revenue department had raised the demand on Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL) shares that Grasim received after the demerger of Aditya Birla Capital from Aditya Birla Nuvo.

The restructuring was part of a plan that involved the merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo with Grasim. However, after the merger, the financial services business of Aditya Birla Nuvo was demerged into Aditya Birla Capital. In 2017, the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the demerger.

“The company has, on March 15, received an order issued by the deputy commissioner of Income Tax raising a demand of Rs 5,872.13 crore on account of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) that includes interest,” argued a counsel representing Birla Group in the court. “The order is not as per income tax norms.”

The division bench of justice Akil Kureshi and justice SV Kotwal, while allowing an interim stay, said the revenue department had raised a huge tax demand and directed the firm to deposit the amount without giving enough time to file an appeal.

The court has asked the tax department to file its reply, adjourning the case to April 12.

An email query to Grasim remained unanswered until the publication of this report. Atul K Jasani, an advocate representing the company, was also not available for his comments.

As per the 2016 restructuring plan, Aditya Birla Nuvo investors got three shares of Grasim Industries for every 10 shares held. Grasim shareholders received seven shares of Aditya Birla Capital for every one held."
12,2019-03-23,Grasim,"The Bombay High Court on Friday granted interim relief to Grasim Industries, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, on a Rs 5,872-crore dividend distribution tax demand linked to a 2016 demerger plan of group businesses.

The revenue department had raised the demand on Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL) shares that Grasim received after the demerger of Aditya Birla Capital from Aditya Birla Nuvo.

The restructuring was part of a plan that involved the merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo with Grasim. However, after the merger, the financial services business of Aditya Birla Nuvo was demerged into Aditya Birla Capital. In 2017, the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal approved the demerger.

“The company has, on March 15, received an order issued by the deputy commissioner of Income Tax raising a demand of.`5,872.13 crore on account of Dividend Distribution Tax that includes interest,” argued a counsel representing Birla Group in the court. “The order is not as per income tax norms.”

The division bench of Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice SV Kotwal, while allowing an interim stay, said that the revenue department had raised a huge tax demand and directed the company to deposit the amount without giving enough time to file an appeal. An email query to Grasim remained unanswered until the publication of this report. Atul K Jasani, an advocate representing the company, was also not available for his comments."
14,2019-03-25,Grasim,"MUMBAI: Larsen & Toubro chairman AM Naik said his company was not seeking a hostile takeover of Mindtree and was open to talks with the IT services firm’s founders to allay their concerns.

“This is no hostile bid. The shareholder approached L&T first—how can that be hostile by us? We are open to further negotiations with Mindtree—our doors are always open,” he told ET. “L&T has done much more for its employees than Mindtree for theirs. We formed the L&T employees’ trust, which owns a sizeable stake in the company.

Our culture has been called the best by several studies. So it is ridiculous to state otherwise.”

Naik also responded to remarks by Mindtree cofounder Subroto Bagchi and others.

“Who is Bagchi to ask why L&T cannot build a Mindtree?” he said. “We have built huge businesses and in the same space too. And we will do what we can to grow our businesses further.”

Naik has so far remained in the background, allowing the L&T’s executive leadership to engage with stakeholders in Mindtree.

After signing a deal to buy longterm investor VG Siddhartha’s 20.3% stake, L&T plans to increase it to 66.3% through an open offer and by purchasing shares from the market.

The move has sparked stiff resistance by Mindtree’s founders and employees. The outburst took the leadership of L&T by surprise. The Mindtree promoters, including chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan, Bagchi, chief operating officer NS Parthasarathy and managing director Rostow Ravanan, hold a 13.32% stake in the company.


L&T’S NAIK THWARTED TWO HOSTILE TAKEOVER BIDS
Naik, the veteran boss of India’s largest construction and engineering company, is credited with having thwarted two hostile takeover attempts of L&T , once by Grasim and before that by the undivided Reliance Industries. He then established the L&T Employees’ Welfare Foundation as the holder of a significant stake in the company to ringfence it from further takeover bids. The trust owns about 19% of L&T.

ET was the first to report on L&T’s interest in buying Siddhartha’s stake on January 21.ET first reported the details of the deal on March 18.

Naik had previously refrained from weighing in on the acquisition plan. He told ET a day after the deal was announced that the transaction was being led by managing director and chief executive officer SN Subrahmanyan, who had been approached by Siddhartha. The L&T management has stated that Mindtree would be allowed to operate as an independent entity. The $18 billion engineering conglomerate has two listed technology companies—L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services.

An L&T board member said Naik’s comments could go a long way to calm the fears of Mindtree’s founders, although that in no way diminished the efforts of Subrahmanyan and CFO R Shankar Raman in putting together the deal."
15,2019-03-25,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Grasim Industries Monday said it has challenged the Rs 5,872.13 crore income-tax demand with respect to its merger with two Aditya Birla group firms before the Bombay High Court, which has granted stay against the recovery.

DCIT held that as the demerger of the demerged undertaking is not in compliance with Section 2(19 AA) of the Income Tax Act, the value of shares allotted by Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL) to the shareholders of Grasim Industries, in consideration of the transfer and vesting of the Demerged Undertaking into ABCL, amounted to dividend, within the meaning of the Act, the filing had added.

In September 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) bench at Ahmedabad had approved the merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo (ABNL) with Grasim Industries to be followed by the listing of Aditya Birla Financial Services Ltd (ABFSL)."

The recent fall has brought down this stock almost towards its January 2019 low at Rs 6,500, where it appears to have clearly registered a double-bottom formation on the price charts. Besides, last Friday’s strong price action post minor consolidation over four sessions is clearly hinting at a near-term bottom. Sustaining above Rs 6,500, this counter can eventually test its long-term moving averages from where it started faltering.

0,2019-04-01,Grasim,"MUMBAI: Ahead of Vodafone Idea’s $3.6 billion rights issue, Kumar Mangalam Birla is reorganising unlisted group companies to raise funds, said people with knowledge of the matter. 

SKI Carbon Black Mauritius Ltd (Birla Carbon) is set to buy a controlling interest in Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd for $450 million. Both are promoter companies of the Aditya Birla Group chairman. Birla owns 100% of Kiran Investments, which owns these entities.

Carbon Black is said to be in talks with banks to raise short-term debt of $300 million and $150 million. It has also sought a relaxation in loan covenants from 3.5 times debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) to 4.1-4.2 times, said the people cited above.





BIRLA CARBON RAISED DEBT FOR TELECOM VENTURE DURING MERGER
Axis Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi are believed to be funding the acquisition. An independent valuation will determine the controlling interest that will get transferred.

An Aditya Birla Group spokesperson declined to comment.

As co-promoter, Birla and the group companies are to contribute Rs 7,250 crore to the rights issue. Vodafone Group intends to pitch in with Rs 11,000 crore.

The funds from SKI Carbon will be up-streamed to Kiran Investments, one of the apex promoter entities of Idea. Aditya Birla Group owns 26.54% of Vodafone Idea, held through Grasim, Hindalco and Birla TMT Holdings, among others.

The rights issue is expected to provide the company with ammunition for about two years in the highly competitive sector, analysts said. Vodafone Idea’s debt was Rs 1.24 lakh crore at the end of December. Finance costs were about Rs 7,750 crore each in the past four quarters and losses in that period added up to Rs 10,700 crore. And, coming up is the 5G spectrum auction.

“Bankers are increasingly getting wary of funding Idea’s losses. As a promoter too, his flexibility is getting crimped,” said an executive with one of the lenders to the group. “Earlier, Birla relied heavily on Essel Mining, another private company, as his key money spinner. But following the mining ban and regulatory crackdowns, Essel has lost much of its earlier sheen.”

The worry is that group financials are being stretched to support telecom, experts said. Birla Carbon still has some headroom left but the use of proceeds will create an overhang as it already has on Grasim and Hindalco, they said.

According to Fitch Ratings, the positive outlook of the company’s credit ratings is on the expectation that Birla Carbon’s leverage will improve over the next few years, after increasing in the financial year ended March 2019 due to a large payout to shareholders and other entities.

SKI Carbon Black raised about $500 million in debt during the Idea-Vodafone merger. With this round, it will nearly touch a $1 billion.

Its revenue has fluctuated historically along with carbon black prices, which move in tandem with the underlying feedstock—carbon black oil. Ebitda has declined since 2012 on the back of global oversupply. In FY16, it fell 40% because of an increase in supply from Chinese producers with low-cost carbon black products, which led to a drop in global operating utilisation levels to 75-80%.


PRIVATE JEWELS
The Aditya Birla Group had previously explored the idea of merging Essel with Hindalco for additional financial support after the 2007 Novelis acquisition, according to those with knowledge of the matter. Hindalco eventually made a success of the purchase, generating $350-400 million of free cashflows every year and went on to acquire Aleris for $2.58 billion in July 2018 to become the leading value-added aluminium maker globally.

Incorporated in 1978, Swiss Singapore is a leading bulk commodity trader dealing in various metals and minerals (coal, oil, sulphur, caustic soda), agro commodities (pulses, beans) and fertilisers across the world for group entities as well as third parties.

SKI Carbon Black is one of the world’s top three producers of carbon black with an 11% market share by value, behind Cabot Corp that commands a 21% share. The top three companies account for 40% of the estimated $15 billion global carbon black market. The rest of the market is fragmented, with many small companies competing at the regional level.

Birla is betting on the telecom sector normalising soon, which makes the success of the rights issue crucial. Idea will have nearly Rs 20,000 crore in debt maturing before FY21.

“Completion of Vodafone Idea’s announced deleveraging initiatives—rights issue and potential asset divestments of tower and fibre network—would help the company address potential funding shortfalls in the near to medium term, all else equal,” said Manish Adhukia and Manish Mubayi of Goldman Sachs.

“However, our analysis suggests leverage (net-debt-to-Ebitda) by FY21E is likely to remain at >7x, given its elevated capex/interest payments and resulting negative free cash flows (FCF); we forecast FCF for Vodafone Idea to stay negative at least until FY23E.”

Vodafone India merged with Idea Cellular on August 31 last year, making Vodafone Idea the country’s biggest phone company. It has a subscriber base of about 387 million and a revenue market share of 36%."

5,2019-04-03,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Private weather forecaster Skymet’s projection of a below normal monsoon and a spike in crude oil price triggered a spell of selloff and snapped the bull run in domestic stocks on Wednesday.

8,2019-04-05,Grasim,"India’s equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty are like twin sisters gone separate ways – the former is a people’s choice and the latter traders’ favourite. 

It remains a never-ending debate whether Sensex represents the economy better or Nifty. It resurfaced earlier this week, after the 30-share Sensex delivered 17.30 per cent return for the just-ended financial year to outpace the 50-share Nifty’s 14.93 per cent.

This is the second straight financial year that the BSE benchmark managed to be ahead. Prior to this, Nifty outperformed Sensex in 2015-16 and 2016-17. In last 10 financial years, each has managed to outpace the other in five.

In terms of absolute return, long-term data shows both the indices climbed 73 per cent in last five financial years. However, Sensex rallied 277 per cent in last 10, and Nifty 265 per cent.

From Nifty’s base date of November 3, 1995 till April 2 this year, it has advanced 1,064 per cent, while Sensex has grown 1,020 per cent. 


What’s in it for market participants?
Sensex is now around 3.3 times Nifty, having climbed to 38,672 on March 29, 2019 from 32,967 on March 28, 2018. Nifty has moved to 11,623 from 10,113 in the same period.

A rally in the stocks that are common constituents of both indices – Bajaj Finance (up 71 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 54 per cent), Axis Bank (up 52 per cent), ICICI Bank (up 43 per cent) and Tata Consultancy Services (up 40 per cent) – mainly supported them in 2018-19. 

Similarly, a fall in the shares of Tata Motors (down 47 per cent), Vedanta (down 34 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (down 28 per cent) put pressure on both. 

Two other stocks, Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 31 per cent) and Eicher Motors (down 27.50 per cent), proved a drag on Nifty, which Sensex survived as the two are not part of it. Nifty also suffered due to subdued performance of Zee Entertainment (down 23 per cent) and Grasim Industries (down 18.36 per cent) – stocks not part of Sensex.

“Out of the 20 Nifty stocks that are not part of Sensex, 10 fell badly. They belonged to two major segments: oil and gas PSUs and two-wheelers,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.

This was attributed to volatility in crude oil prices, a slowdown in two-wheeler sales and issues related to share pledging. Other individual stocks suffered due to a generally weak business outlook. “That being the case Nifty’s underperformance may not change significantly in the short term,” Chokkalingam said.


So, which index to follow? 
Sensex, which came into being in 1979, long enjoyed its monopoly as India’s heartbeat index and became synonymous with the domestic equity market till Nifty’s arrival in 1995. The latter gradually won investors’ allegience as NSE’s pioneering futures and options market grew popular and allowed investors to bet on the index. This also helped Nifty gain global acceptance by becoming a true proxy play on Indian equity.

There are claims that most people in the market today follow Nifty, instead of Sensex, as the former represents larger number of industries. “Nifty is widely tracked as it contains 50 stocks. It is a broader index compared with Sensex and gives a better view of the economy,” said AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets. 

The 50-share index accounted for about 54 per cent of the asset under management of India-focussed ETFs at Rs 1,13,827 crore as of February-end 2019, data provided by NSE Indices showed.

BSE MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan recently said Sensex is a picture of changing India and will continue to remain so in the time to come. 

Sensex completed four decades of existence last week. “Over the last 40 years, it has given CAGR of over 17 per cent which is the highest returns for any asset class in India,” Chauhan said.

He insisted his index is a true reflection of India’s growth over all these years. “It is the symbol of India’s aspirations and will continue to guide future generations as it has done in the past. It has incorporated new industries like IT, pharma and banking over these 40 years and shed industries that didn’t do well,” he said.

Mukesh Agarwal, CEO of NSE Indices, says Nifty50’s total return index has delivered 15.8 per cent in last 10 years, which he claims is in alignment with India's nominal GDP growth during the same period at 13 per cent CAGR (FY09 - 19E). This, he claims, validates the fact that the equity market returns are aligned with the long-term income growth trajectory of the economy.

Veteran Dalal Street money manager Saurabh Mukherjea trashes both the indices, saying they are no longer a proxy for India’s economic growth. 

Mukherjea, who recently founded alternative asset management firm Marcellus Investment Managers, says India’s GDP growth (in nominal terms) has averaged at 13 per cent in last 10 year, while Nifty’s annual earnings expansion has been 8 per cent.

He says the increasing disconnect suggests key drivers of the Indian economy have gone missing from the listed space."
9,2019-04-06,Grasim,"Mumbai: The Central government has raised Rs 1,150 crore by selling over 4.44 crore shares of information technology major Wipro.

The shares were offered by the Custodian of Enemy Properties for India, an agency under the Union home ministry. Market participants now expect the agency to sell shares it holds in ACC, Tata Steel, Tata Power, India Cements and Grasim Industries, among others.



 The sale of Wipro shares happened on Thursday through multiple block deals at a price of Rs 258.9 apiece. The stock gained 1.2% to close at Rs 262 apiece on Friday.

All the shares being offered were bought by state-owned entities led by Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which only subscribed to 3.86 crore shares or over 85% of the offering.

Public sector reinsurer General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) bought 38 lakh shares while another state insurer New India Assurance picked up 19 lakh shares, data compiled from stock exchanges showed.

Enemy properties are those movable and immovable assets of Indians who migrated to either Pakistan or China.

These properties were taken into the custody of Indian government in late 1960s following the wars with both the countries.

Apart from large chunks of real estate spread across major Indian cities including New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, there are also several other assets including shares of companies, jewellery lying with the agency.

Around 6.5 crore shares of 139 listed functional companies and other unlisted entities are held by the agency, whose total value is estimated at Rs 2,500-3,000 crore.

In 2017, the government approved the process to divest the equity shares held by the agency and the proceeds of these sales were to be used for state-owned development and social welfare programmes."
10,2019-04-08,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday promised to spend Rs 25 lakh crore on rural productivity and Rs 100 lakh crore to kickstart the investment cycle if it is voted to power.

13,2019-04-23,Grasim,"When it comes to investing in Indian stocks, consumption is a theme one can ill-afford to ignore.

While rising incomes and an ever-growing younger population make consumption a sure-shot bet, newer trends in the market are throwing up definitive cues on where money is waiting to be made.

Indian policymakers’ increased focus on financially empowering the poor, and rapid spread of mobile and internet are working as an icing on the cake for investors looking to cash in on India’s consumption boom.

India Inc is taking note.

Billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani last month acquired ITC’s mid-segment menswear brand John Players to strengthen Reliance Retail’s readymade garments and accessories portfolio in the fashion and lifestyle retail space.

In another development, Aditya Birla-led Grasim Industries acquired Soktas India for Rs 135.12 crore. Soktas India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Soktas Tekstil Sanayi ve Ticaret AS, a world-renowned producer and marketer of premium shirting fabrics with its main facilities at Soke in Turkey.

The growth potential of India’s consumption sector can also be gauged from the fact that India emerged as the only big market to clock FMCG growth of 13.8 per cent in 2018 while global growth stood at 2-2.50 per cent, according to AC Nielson.

That high base may result in a slowdown in consumption this year, but it still remains a solid bet for faster growth.

“This sector is in a long-term bull market,” says Atul Suri, CEO, Marathon Trends PMS. “I have been overweight on consumption on a longer timeframe,” he told ETNow in an interview.

Divergent trends have emerged in this space of late; some stocks are faltering while others are touching lifetime highs. 

“There are divergent trends emerging across the sector. We like to identify stocks and watch their behaviour in a falling market, because stocks that go up or hold up well in a falling market usually emerge as leaders in the next bull market,” Suri said.

Analysts say lifestyle changes among individuals, especially millennials, is the hottest theme, as this is what is increasingly driving India’s consumption story.

There are expectations that India will become the largest country globally in terms of population size at 1.60 billion by 2030. It currently has around 1.05 billion citizens in the age group of 15-60 against China’s 0.98 billion.

Going with market experts, FMCG, e-commerce, smartphone manufacturers, auto, telecom, education, and services are some of the industries that are likely to benefit, given the spending behaviour of these consumers. 

In the offline space, the salience of food products is increasing in every retail outlet as witnessed in rising throughput per store, says Elara Capital.

The brokerage believes the food space is expected to perform better than home and personal care (HPC) products in calendar 2019. 

Elara recommends Britannia with a price target of Rs 3,478 and Nestle with a target price of Rs 11,716 as these companies have been growing direct reach every year.

In the online space, health (juices), organic, babycare products (diapers, skincare and wipes), ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook products and children & school-oriented foods were among the fastest-growing categories in Calendar 2018. 
At present, eCommerce contributes around 2 per cent of total FMCG sales in India. With the rise of smartphone us, the figure is likely to multiply in the days ahead.

India is projected to have around 1,200 million smartphone users by 2030 against 300 million in 2016. It may touch 440 million by the end of next year, according to a research done by AC Nielsen and Elara Securities.

Select companies are already doing profitable business riding the eCommerce boom.

Bata India’s Ram Kumar Gupta says its eCommerce business is quite profitable and the contribution from the medium is almost 6 per cent. 

Brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Bata India with a target price of Rs 1,479.

Organised players engaged in production and distribution of health food drinks as well as milk and milk products are the others to watch.

India’s per capita milk consumption stood at 110 gm until 1970s and was declining. It now stands at 370-380 gm and is expected to reach 800-850 gm a day (equivalent to that of Europe and the US today) by 2030. In the dairy space, Elara is bullish on Heritage Foods and Parag Milk Foods with price targets of Rs 825 and Rs 366, respectively.

Despite a 12.50 per cent rally, the BSE FMCG index underperformed Sensex (up 15 per cent) in FY19. Stocks like Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, United Breweries, Godfrey Phillips, Dabur, Nestle, HUL and Britannia Industries advanced 25-77 per cent during the financial year, while Kwality, Manpasand Beverages, LT Foods and Ruchi Soya tanked over 50 per cent."

9,2019-05-24,Grasim,"New Delhi: Grasim Industries, a part of Aditya Birla Group, Friday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,531.86 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2019.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 853.62 crore during the January-March period of the previous fiscal, Grasim Industries said in a regulatory filing.

Revenue from operations during the quarter under review stood at Rs 20,965.25 crore. It was at Rs 17,363.24 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

The company's total expenses were at Rs 18,747.22 crore during the quarter.

The results are not comparable with that of the previous period as it includes financial results of Viscose Filament Yarn (VFY) business of Century Textiles and Industries, whose management rights was acquired by it, and cement plants acquired from Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement Corporation, the company said.

Besides, it also includes the financial result of erstwhile Aditya Birla Nuvo Limited (ABNL) and its subsidiaries, it added.

Grasim Industries' revenue from cement business during the quarter stood at Rs 10,905.15 crore. It was at Rs 9,290.29 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

""The consolidated sales volume registered an increase of 16 per cent on YoY basis to 22 MTPA,"" Grasim said in a statement.

Revenue from viscose segment was at Rs 2,624.81 crore in January-March. It was at Rs 2,231.38 crore a year ago.

""For January-March 2018-19 the production and sales volume was at 130 KT and 139 KT, respectively, recording an increase of 15 per cent and 13 per cent YoY,"" it said.

Revenue from chemicals segment was at Rs 1,687.93 crore. It was at Rs 1,438.61 crore a year ago.

The revenue from financial services was at Rs 4,702.50 crore during March quarter. It was at Rs 3,475.76 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

For the financial year 2018-19, Grasim Industries' net profit stood at Rs 2,775.95 crore. It was at Rs 3,687.62 crore in 2017-18.

Revenue from operations for 2018-19 fiscal stood at Rs 72,970.64 crore. It was at Rs 57,033.67 crore in 2017-18.

Meanwhile, in a separate filing the company informed that its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sushil Agarwal has resigned.

It has appointed Ashish Adukia as the new CFO. His appointment would be effective from July 1, 2019.

On the outlook, it said its viscose, staple fibre and filament yarn business will continue to focus on expanding the market in India, while the chemical business would continue the brownfield expansion projects.

The government's thrust on infrastructure development viz. construction of cement concrete roads, metro rail networks, airports, DFC, irrigation projects and increase in the pace of execution under the low cost housing program supported strong volume off-take of cement, it said.

""All of these are expected to result in sustained demand growth for cement going forward. This augurs well for the industry,"" it said.

The company's board has recommended a dividend of Rs 7 per equity share of face value of Rs 2 each for the year ended March 31, 2019.

Shares of Grasim Industries Friday settled at Rs 908.30 on the BSE, up 2.46 per cent from its previous close."

Analyst calls

 • Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Whirlpool of India and revised target price to ₹1,560 from ₹1,625. Most positives are priced in at current valuations, as key risks such as demand softness, raw material head-winds and rising competition (pricing pressures) prevail, said Jefferies. 

 • CLSA has retained buy rating on Dish TV India and cut target price to ₹60 from ₹70. Dish TV's fourth quarter revenues and Ebitda were below estimates with subscriptions down 5% YoY, hit by delays and disruption in implementing TRAI’s new tariff regime, said CLSA. 

 • Edelweiss Securities has maintained buy rating on Indraprastha Gas with a target price of ₹365. Indraprastha Gas remains a preferred pick among city gas distribution companies due to its robust volume growth outlook and high exposure to priority sectors giving it access to cheaper APM gas, said Edelweiss. The brokerage has estimated an EPS CAGR of 15% with a robust RoE of over 20% over FY19–22. 

 • Nirmal Bang has initiated coverage on Tata Chemicals with a buy rating and target price of ₹749. The recent decision to hive off its consumer business is positive as this transforms Tata Chemicals into a focused chemicals and specialties company, said Nirmal Bang. The growth from nutrition, and silica, will likely gather momentum from FY21 based on new capacity being set up at a cost of ₹5.7 billion, said Nirmal Bang. 

 • Citigroup has downgraded Cummins India to neutral from buy and cut target price to ₹800 from ₹881 after weaker-than-expected fourth quarter result. Export uncertainties are likely to persist through FY20, also reflected in the management guidance of flattish to negative sales growth, said Citi.

13,2019-05-28,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: NHPC with over 0.29 crore shares changing hands was leading among the most traded stocks on NSE on Tuesday.

Shares of Unitech (number of shares traded: 0.23 crore), YES Bank (number of shares traded: 0.17 crore), Rail Vikas Nigam (number of shares traded: 0.13 crore), ZEEL (number of shares traded: 0.12 crore), PNB (number of shares traded: 0.11 crore), BHEL (number of shares traded: 0.10 crore), Vodafone Idea (number of shares traded: 0.10 crore), JP Power (number of shares traded: 0.09 crore) and Future Consumer (number of shares traded: 0.07 crore) also featured among the most traded stocks on the NSE.

InterGlobe Aviation (Rs 66.21 crore) was leading the pack of most active stocks in value terms.

It was followed by ZEEL (Rs 44.08 crore), Supreme Industries (Rs 39.42 crore), RIL (Rs 29.82 crore), YES Bank (Rs 25.05 crore), Adani Ports SEZ (Rs 19.13 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 13.77 crore), RBL Bank (Rs 11.48 crore), PNB (Rs 10.23 crore) and SBI (Rs 9.83 crore).

The NSE Nifty index was trading 1.15 points down at 11,923.60 while the BSE Sensex was up 14.47 points at 39,697.76 around 09:16 am. 

In the Nifty index, YES Bank (up 1.87 per cent), GAIL (India) (up 1.71 per cent), Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone (up 1.25 per cent), Zee Entertainment Enterprises (up 1.18 per cent) and Vedanta (up 1.11 per cent) were among the top gainers.

After a dull start to the quarter, rupee bond sales by Indian companies are set to revive as borrowing costs have declined to the lowest in a year following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s landslide election victory.

Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Grasim Industries Ltd. and UltraTech Cement Ltd. plan to raise a combined 7.5 billion rupees ($108 million) selling five-year bonds. State-owned NLC India Ltd. priced 14.75 billion rupees of debt Monday -- its first issuance in a decade -- as average yield for 10-year AAA paper fell to 8.31 per cent, the cheapest since last May.

“Yields have come down and corporates waiting to refinance will borrow,” said Sandeep Bagla, associate director at Trust Group in Mumbai. “Issuance will pick up pace as clarity on the regime improves business sentiment.”

JSW Steel Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest producer, plans to raise 70 billion rupees via bonds and State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, is considering raising as much as 50 billion rupees through notes on Wednesday, according to exchange filings.

Local-currency issuance in the three-month period that began April 1 is about 700 billion rupees, or 25 per cent of the total raised in the March quarter, as companies held off fundraising during the six-week election process that ended May 19. Corporate bond sales in the year to March 2020 may be between 6.75 trillion rupees to 7 trillion rupees, up from 6.5 trillion rupees a year earlier, according to Care Ratings.

The potential for reforms after Modi’s comprehensive victory is likely to improve the flow of foreign capital to corporates, according to S&P Global Ratings. That’s good news for India’s credit markets, which have suffered from a crisis of confidence after shock defaults since last year by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and a string of downgrades at mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. and Reliance Capital Ltd."
17,2019-05-30,Grasim,"As Dalal Street continues to speculate over a potential earnings revival time for India Inc, some 125 out of over 1,200 firms listed on NSE have doubled March quarter profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. 

Among the top grossers, textile player Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing posted 114 times or over 11,345 per cent YoY increase in profit for the quarter, while Kanoria Chemicals, Yuken India, Hathway Cable & Datacom, Linde India, EID Parry, TVS Electronics, Alfred Herbert, Bhagyanagar Properties and Shriram City Union Finance reported profit growth in the range of 10-55 times, or 1,000 to 5,250 per cent.

Except for Hathway Cable (down 9 per cent), Linde India (down 16 per cent) and TVS Electronics (down 95 per cent), net sales of these firms have increased from 8 per cent to 1,472 per cent during the quarter.

Is it worth looking at stocks of some of these companies to invest?

""Sustainability of profit growth should be the key determinant; make sure these are not one-off surprises,"" says Siddharth Sedani, Vice-President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

“Many companies would have reported strong numbers in Q4. Some of them delivered exceptional gains in terms of profitability. However, investors should look at the sustainability of those earnings and see how these numbers were in the past four to five quarters. One can consider companies with good management and promising earnings. However, global factors will continue to impact Indian markets,” he said.

India Inc’s March quarter earnings season has entered the last leg, with 48 companies from the Nifty pack and 28 from the Sensex pack having already declared their numbers till May 29. 

In the 50-share Nifty, as many as 33 companies have posted an increase in bottom lines, while 15 have reported a drop in profit.

Among others, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Globus Spirits, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TV18 Broadcast, Aro Granite Industries, Kirloskar Industries, Asian Hotels, Hatsun Agro and The Jammu & Kashmir Bank and Kakatiya Cement posted 500-965 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of TV18 Broadcast, Kirloskar and Kakatiya Cement increased over 50 per cent YoY for the quarter. 

Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on J&K Bank post Q4 results with a price target of Rs 80. “At 0.6 times on March 2021 adjusted book value (ABV), the valuation is reasonable given healthy loan growth and margins outlook, robust liability franchise, controlled asset quality and waning capital concerns,” the brokerage said.

Among Nifty companies, Ultratech Cement and Cipla posted 131 per cent and 106 per cent year-on-year rise in profit on a 17.38 per cent and 22.17 per cent YoY sales growth, respectively.

Dr Reddy’s reported 67 per cent YoY profit growth. It was followed by Grasim Industries (up 59 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 57 per cent), NTPC (up 48.70 per cent), Adani Ports (up 38.69 per cent) and Wipro (up 37.74 per cent). 

Reliance Securities has upgraded UltraTech to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ post Q4 results. Centrum Broking maintained ‘buy’ rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 640. 

Axis Bank and SBI posted net profits of Rs 1,505 crore and Rs 838 crore, respectively, for the quarter against net losses of Rs 2,188.70 crore and Rs 7,718.20 crore, respectively, in the same period last year. 

Yes Bank posted Rs 1,506.60 crore loss for Q4FY19 against net profit of Rs 1,179.40 crore posted for the same period last year. 

Among others, Tata Steel, UPL, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, JSW Steel and Tata Motors reported 77 per cent, 72 per cent, 62 per cent, 53 per cent, 49 per cent and 47 per cent YoY drop in profit for the quarter.



While commenting on the ongoing earnings season, Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interaction with ET Now said that only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. 

“The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60 per cent of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space,” he said.

DCM Shriram, Orient Cement, Godrej Agrovet, Nectar Lifesciences, Usha Martin, Sagar Cement, Insecticides (India), Brigade Enterprises, Godrej Properties, Bharat Forge, Procter & Gamble Health, Bluestar, Phoenix Mills, Butterfly Gandhimathi, Marico, Indiabulls Ventures and Orient Paper were among other companies on the NSE that reported over 100 per cent YoY profit growth for March quarter."

10,2019-06-17,Grasim,"""Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago""

-Warren Buffett
This pearl of wisdom, by extension, means the best time is to invest stocks was several years ago and the second-best is today. That, even when the market is looking all bleak and depressing.

On Monday, as business news channel ETNOW celebrated 10 years of its existence, some of India’s top stock pickers liked Basant Maheshwari, Porinju Veliyath, Vijay Kedia, Sandip Sabharwal, Samit Vartak and others named one stock each for a ‘Power of 10’ portfolio.

These stocks, they say, can deliver fabulous return to investors over next 10 years. The list included diverse stocks right from the consumption sector to a life insurance company. 

Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal recommended Britannia. “On the consumption side, you have to look at companies that have got products which more and more people will consume. Plus, these company can also come out with new products that can fit into the consumption basket of the new millennium. In this segment, I think Britannia will continue to do well,” he told ETNOW. 

Shares of Britannia Industries have rallied 1,791 per cent in last 10 years to trade at Rs 2,959.70 on June 14, 2019 from Rs 156.50 on June 12, 2009. However, the scrip is down 1 per cent for past one year. On Monday, the stock had 7 ‘buy’, 11 ‘outperform’, 9 ‘hold’, 6 ‘underperform’ and 1 ‘sell’ ratings, according to Reuters.

Basant Maheshwari, Co-founder of Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisors and Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss Investment Research, both recommended Titan for the long term.

Shares of the jeweller-to-watch maker have jumped over 2,000 per cent in last 10 years and 250 per cent in last three. Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his wife together held over 7 per cent stake in the company as of March 31, 2019. 

Brokerage firm Stewart & Mackertich believes Titan deserves higher valuation due to the visibility of double-digit top-line growth in the largecap FMCG/retail space and Ebitda margin expansion backed by high SSSG contribution, an increase in exchange sales, increasing demand for high margin studded jewellery and sustained ROE and ROCE improvement from 25 per cent and 23 per cent in FY19 to 27 per cent and 26 per cent in FY21, respectively.

Samit Vartak, Partner, SageOne Investment, is bullish on Edelweiss Financial Services, while Kochi-based investor Porinju Veliyath, founder Equity Intelligence, recommended Tata Global Beverages.

Shares of Tata Global and Edelweiss Financial Services have rallied 225 per cent and 275 per cent, respectively, in last 10 years. The stocks are, however, down up to 44 per cent in last one year.

Tata Global Beverages is aspiring to be a consumer products company and looking to gain scale by adding more products to its portfolio. 

“In the FMCG segment, we need a large portfolio. We cannot just be a single tea player and depend on it to attain scale. Tea, water are good, but they are not going to give scale. The company has to gain scale by a wide range of products,” TGBL Chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders at the company’s recent annual general meeting.

Vijay Kedia of Kedia Securities suggested Repro India, Rakesh Arora of Go India Advisors picked Grasim Industries and Atul Suri of Marathon Trends-PMS named HDFC Life. Grasim Industries advanced 90 per cent in last 10 years, but is down 13 per cent in last one year.

HDFC Life Insurance reported a 5 per cent rise in March quarter profit with healthy growth in premium income. The company’s net profit for March quarter increased 4.90 per cent to Rs 364.01 crore from Rs 346.84 crore in the same period a year ago.

Repro India is a provider of content, print and fulfilment solutions. It is engaged in printing of magazines and other periodicals, books and brochures, maps, atlases, posters and others. The company posted 17.55 per cent YoY dip in Q4 net profit on a 21 per cent YoY rise in net sales.

Pankaj Murarka, Founder, Renaissance Investment Managers, is bullish on Syngene, while Manish Sonthalia, Associate Director and Head Portfolio Management Services, Motilal Oswal Asset Management recommended DCB Bank.

DCB Bank has delivered 30 per cent return to investors in the last one year and 485 per cent in past 10 years.

Analysts say investors will struggle to figure out a strategy to play. Milan Vaishnav picked the following stocks based on their technical charts, which can potentially help investors make the most of this lacklustre market.NextMaruti |Sell | Target : Rs 655016 Jun, 2019The stock is presently in a descending triangle formation which has resulted out of the structure of a similar bottom in the range of 6480-6500 and with sharply falling tops. The daily MACD is in continuing sell mode. The price has slipped below its 50 and 100DMA which is bearish. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period low. The weekly RSI, too, is seen making lower highs upon visual inspection. The levels of 6950 should be used as a stop-loss.NextBEML | Sell | Target: Rs 82016 Jun, 2019This stock has shown a couple of signs which point towards possible weakness over the coming days. After failing to clear a double top resistance, the stock retracted. It breached its 50-DMA and presently sits on its 100- DMA. The RS line against the broader CNX500 index is seen inching lower and has also fallen below its 50-DMA. The daily MACD remains in continuing sell mode. On the weekly charts, the weekly RSI has shown a bearish divergence against the price, and it is seen making lower tops. A fresh sell signal also emerged on the weekly Stochastic. Any close above 1025 should be used as a stop-loss.NextNCC | Buy | Target: Rs 10816 Jun, 2019The stock suffered a sharp set back due to negative news flow over previous days. It has taken support over its multi-month upward rising trend line which also coincides with the 200-DMA, and another multiple pattern supports. The daily MACD is about to show a positive crossover over the coming days. The daily Stochastic remains negative. The stock moved past the levels of 100 and as per the options data, if it stays above 100, it can potentially test 105 and 108 levels. Any close below 95 should be treated as a strict stop-loss.
Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services. NextSBIN | Sell | Target: Rs 328 16 Jun, 2019The stock cleared its significant double top resistance that was formed in the 326-334 range and tested highs near 364 levels. However, it witnessed some corrective moves after that. Based on a couple of signals that have emerged, the stock may see some weakness and may complete its throwback. The stock has slipped below its short term 20-DMA, and this can infuse some short term weakness. The daily MACD stays in continuing sell mode. The RSI remains neutral against the price, but it is seen marking lower tops. Similar formation in RSI is also observed on the weekly charts. Any close above 355 should be used as a stop-loss. Next"

11,2019-06-19,Grasim,"Brokerages remain cautious on the cement sector as price increases that began in April have failed to sustain.

Sluggish demand and the onset of monsoons suggest price moderation should continue and margins could peak near term in the June quarter.

Cement prices in June 2019 have corrected by 2 per cent or Rs 7 per kg, reversing the increase in May.

While Ambuja Cement and ACC declined 5 per cent each in the past month, UltraTech gained just a percent. The other two cement majors such as Shree Cement and Grasim gained 5 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.

“We see June quarter cement prices and margins at near-term peak and expect price moderation to continue,” said Sumangal Nevatia, analyst, Kotak Securities. “We believe large capacity addition will keep industry utilisations low over the next two years and will restrict sustainable improvement in margins.”

Companies such as ACC, Ambuja Cement and Grasim are currently trading 12 times their FY20 estimated EV/EBITDA. Shree Cement and UltraTech Cement are trading at 16 times. “We maintain a cautious stance on the cement sector on expensive valuations of large-cap cement names at 12-16 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA,” said Nevatia.

Analysts believe that steep increases in cement prices are not sustainable and there could be a decline once the demand from non-trade segment improves.



“Although cement prices have not seen much of a correction in North, demand has taken a knock and this remains a cause for concern,” said Sanjeev Kumar Singh, analyst, Emkay. “Most (dealers) expect some decline in cement prices going forward and some of them believe average price increase in FY20 should be limited to 3-4 per cent year-on-year”.

Sales volumes for the industry has seen a steep decline after March 2019.

In April the decline was 3.2 per cent yearon-year and 14.9 in May. Volumes for June are expected to fall by14-17 per cent year-on-year. This seems to be driven by higher spending during the pre-election period, unavailability of labour and surging temperatures. Industry experts, however, believe that the liquidity crunch has had a greater impact in causing demand to soften."
12,2019-06-20,Grasim,"Consumer defensives has become a steady state now as we are not seeing too much great additions, says Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser. Excerpts from the interview with ETNOW. 


ET Now: Are you still seeing people getting into the market, putting money in or is everyone waiting on the sidelines?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: From an Indian investor perspective it is kind of a mixed bag. I mean, the first thrust was obviously on the election results, now that has come through, but we have not seen that kind of investor sentiment turning the whole hog in terms of large lump sum domestic money coming back in.

Mutual fund domestic flows have not been as strong as we would have thought that they would start picking up, but hopefully over the next couple of quarters they should. That obviously depends on the way the markets function, which is going to be sentimentally driven, but we think that at least with the election overhang, one big play is out of the way.


ET Now: Dewan Housing, Yes Bank, ADAG names, Indiabulls; are all the outflows concentrated within these names?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: So luckily in terms of equity holdings we had limited exposure in these companies.


ET Now: Fortunately??


Kaustubh Belapurkar: Fortunately yes. We have seen some trimming in Dewan and Indiabulls and a little bit of in Yes Bank, but like I said, it was very marginal exposure to start with, so I would not worry too much.


ET Now: But this panic, is it trickling down to other NBFCs as well because even Piramal Enterprises is quite off from its highs, some of the other NBFCs actually leaving Bajaj Finance most of them are in the red. So as a trend what are you witnessing there?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: If you look at the housing finance companies some of the good names are still seeing investment happening. HDFC obviously, but even the likes of PNB Housing or LIC Housing are seeing some flows coming in.

On the other side, say a Bajaj Finance has seen some profit booking where we saw some money was taken off the table, even like a Muthoot, which has run up so sharply is seeing some money being taken off.

But again, managers were not very-very largely allocated to some of the other NBFC names, so I think again there has not been much for play around that.


ET Now: Everyone has been struggling to find or make the most of the kind of phase where to find opportunities that could perhaps play out later. In that context what is looking interesting right now?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: So there are a couple of interesting things that have popped up if I just look at the May data. One was obviously telecom, which was kind of abandoned, beaten down sort of play, and obviously with the two rights issues from Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, we have seen a fair bit of money coming in. They were in fact the largest buys for the month.

Obviously there is some positives that have been talked about; ARPUs kind of is inching up, Bharti is obviously looking to monetise their Africa through an IPO so that is obviously positive, but managers have been having some marginal exposure, they have kind of added on to that.

The other thing that we have seen is healthcare, which has not really been spoken about for a while now.


ET Now: Where within healthcare, because it is such a restricted listed entities? What are the names?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: Actually not all of them, but a fair bit, so I would say the likes of Sun, Cadila, Lupin, Torrent. We have all seen a couple of hundred crores come into these counters over the last month or so.


ET Now: What is everyone staying away from like the complete no-no’s right now?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: Real estate clearly. I mean that is something, there has never been too much money.

ET Now: Even DLF?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: I think a little bit came, probably the only counter that we saw coming in but otherwise nothing much.


ET Now: Godrej Properties, like some of these that are still withstanding?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: I think in the greater scheme of things very marginal exposures if anything at all, you know, the likes of Sobha and probably we have seen some, but nothing significant that will move the charts. 

Consumer defensives has kind of become steady state now, we are not seeing too much great additions.

The other swing that we have seen again maybe early signs of money coming back given the valuations having come off in the likes of Maruti, Motherson Sumi and Eicher. You know these have been stocks that have been loved for a long time and we have seen a large bit of selling that has been happening but again that trend seems to be -- and if I look at it on that kind of counter we are seeing some tradeoffs happening so we are seeing an M&M being sold off, a Bajaj being sold off but a TVS and a Hero or a Maruti being bought. So it is probably a little bit of a swap that is also happening there on some of these counters.


ET Now: Where are you seeing buying besides telecom?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: Banks, some of them select banks continue.


ET Now: The usual Axis, ICICI Bank, IndusInd?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: I think these two are the favourites, HDFC again continues. We have seen some trimming of positions in the likes of SBI and Kotak, but that is again just some profit booking happening.


ET Now: Coming back to auto. Do you feel that this is just like a minor reshuffle or is it more than that and it is a trend change if you are saying from a Bajaj to a Hero or even into Maruti, what is the logic?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: So I would still probably wait till more data to actually substantiate that. But it looks like there is some sort of a swap happening, at least that is what initial data tends to suggest, but when you speak to the managers they are not gung-ho on this sector yet.

I mean, it is gloomy news flow in terms of demand pickup and all of that. So they are going to go slow, but they would probably swap out some of their better picks from some of probably the lower or lesser favourite picks on that.


ET Now: We had an interesting view coming in on the OMCs about how it could be an inflation hedge going forward given what we are seeing with regards to global growth and the impact on crude prices, what would you make of the energy names?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: So the energy names and I do not know if I should call Reliance a pure energy name now but I would not, right so, but otherwise on that BPCL has seen some buying and it has been seeing some buying for a while but the others IOC, HPCL have been trickling down on the positions so it is not really something that they have been seeing too much action.


ET Now: And the broader market then. Let us get a view on that, midcaps, smallcaps anyone managing to go out there and take a risk and get into them?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: I am just looking at pure flows from investors and which would kind of guide where managers put money into midcap and smallcap funds have again started getting fair bit of traction.

If I just look on a year to date basis there are actually almost the same amount of flows that you would see in a largecap or a multicap sort of strategy. So clearly then there would be managers looking to add on those positions.

ET Now: Would that also be in infrastructure, cement, some of these names because we are hearing a lot


Kaustubh Belapurkar: Yes.


ET Now: Is it a substantial interest?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: In fact, some of the cement additions, which have happened are largely on the sort of the large cap side; you know UltraTech, ACC and Grasim or the like but that has happened. Infrastructure, some of the names are coming up, Thermax has been seeing some buying, even some names like Escorts and some amount of buying is coming in on that side too.


ET Now: You would be tracking data on gold ETFs, would you because a lot of people are actually saying that it may make sense to have some exposure to gold in your portfolio as well, gold we already know is at a six year high and one is seeing traction build in over there so is that what the data is telling you?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: Actually the data is telling exactly the opposite, we have only seen for the last six years a bleed on the gold ETF AUMs, they have been coming off month on month and there has really been no significant move and they have just been de-growing in terms of that.


ET Now: So what is justifying the prices, I mean there is obviously some mismatch here?


Kaustubh Belapurkar: So well in terms of purely in terms of just gold ETF I mean it is a very small component of the overall -- and so that is not really what moves -- so I mean pure physical gold demand is really what probably still drives that and we would like people to shift to gold ETFs but that has not happened yet."

4,2019-07-11,Grasim,"We expect constant currency growth in the high single digit for Infosys, says Sanjeev Zarbade, VP, Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. Excepts from interview with ETNOW.


Infosys is all slated to come out with their numbers tomorrow. How do you expect the stock to shape up?So far as the IT sector earnings are concerned, we have seen that in FY19 they had the benefit of good growth on the BFSI segment. Also, there was some rupee depreciation which was a tailwind for the IT sector. 

In the first quarter, benefit is not available for the sector. At the same time, there has been some reduction or some challenges for discretionary spending, especially in the BFSI sector, partly because of the US-China trade tensions. This will be a challenging year for the entire sector and we are expecting constant currency growth in the high single digit for Infosys.


What about the banking space? Do you think private banks will have issues but some will get rerated?Yes. We are positive on the banking sector, more so on the corporate banks. As I said, the worst in terms of the asset quality has been behind and FY19 was one of the first years where we really saw that the gross NPAs peaking out. Going forward, we believe that the banking sector will be one of the biggest contributors to the Nifty profits in the current fiscal and we are expecting good numbers from the banking sector although the loan growth in the first quarter has been a bit muted.

Definitely, there will be lower loan loss provisions and that will result in good profit growth for the entire banking sector. 


We have started to see a little bit more of a pick up at least in stock price movement when it comes to some of the real estate names. Cement continues to be quite a strong favourite. Would there be any specific names that you are looking at within the basket?In the real estate sector, we believe that the recent provisions from the government in the Union Budget have been positive. Also certain geographies in India have continued to show good growth especially in the southern market and within the overall stocks under our coverage in the real estate sector. We are most positive on the Brigade Enterprises followed by we have a moderate kind of a positive outlook on Oberoi Constructions. 

So far as the cement sector is concerned, we are expecting good profit growth numbers from the sector because the realisations have been quite firm and the cost pressures have been low for the cement sector so we are positive on the midcap cement companies like Dalmia and JK Lakshmi and within the largecaps Grasim Industries looks interesting so far as the cement sector is concerned."
5,2019-07-12,Grasim,"KOLKATA: Kumar Mangalam Birla is consolidating group investment/holding companies under a few heads. He is planning to merge Trapti Trading, TGS Investments, Turquoise Investments and Finance, and a few other entities with Birla Group Holdings (BGH).

The investment companies that would be merged into BGH have substantial stake in major group entities like Grasim, Hindalco, Aditya Birla Capital, Century Enka, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail. These companies do not have any stake only in Century Textiles & Industries, which is one of the companies Kumar inherited from his grandfather, Basant Kumar (B K) Birla. Pilani Investments is a major shareholder in that entity.

According to disclosures made by different Aditya Birla Group firms, the NCLT approved the amalgamation of TGS, Trapti, Turquoise, Gwalior Properties, BGH Exim and Seshasayee Properties with BGH late last month.

Some of the major corporate houses like the Singhanias had earlier consolidated group holdings into one or few companies. When contacted, a Birla group spokesperson said that whatever they have to say is there in the stock exchange disclosure.

The merger of some investment companies with BGH will lead to a major consolidation of holdings of A V (Aditya Vikram) Birla Group firms in BGH. Trapti, TGS and Turquoise taken together have over 18% in Grasim. BGH, too, has around 0.83% in the textile giant. So, following the amalgamation, BGH will have close to 19% in the firm.

Total promoter holding of A V Birla Group in Grasim is a little over 40%. So, following the merger, BGH will hold a majority of the 50% of promoter holding in the company. In Hindalco, where, the group has 34.66% stake, these investment companies have close to 10% stake. Additionally, these investment companies have close to 23% in Aditya Birla Retail, where the promoter holding is more at 59.01%"
6,2019-07-15,Grasim,"Bullish on Ultratech and Grasim in cement, says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior V-P & Head of Research, Centrum Broking. For the next 2-3 years, money can be made in cement, he says. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.


What is your view on Infosys stock? What should be suggested in terms of a strategy for investors?Infosys is known for its conservative guidance historically speaking. In that backdrop, if Infosys is increasing its guidance. there is a lot of heart to take from it, I am sure markets will like that in this kind of slow revenue growth kind of scenario, at least a credible management coming out and talking about increasing the guidance. I am sure investors will love it. 

In terms of overall margin performance, even though there was a cool-off in margins, we believe that is an overall stabilisation and consolidation phase. 

If things were to stabilise, there is a good chance that even margins will come back. Of course, there is another major issue about buyback taxation. Considering IT industry as a whole, people understand that unlike 20 years back, IT and Infosys are no longer high growth industries or companies. These are good stabilised companies with a lot of cash. The play is more about cash payouts and in that backdrop, the buyback and dividend related news in the new taxation regime probably will keep making the headlines than the companies’ operational performance. All in all, it is a great set of numbers. The revenue guidance uptick should see stocks fairly strong.


D-Mart has come up with a good set of numbers in the quarter gone by and saw the sharpest rise in five quarters. The margins have been very commendable but the management has said that the Q1 margins are not a reflection of the full year. Should one look at D-Mart with a bit of caution?D-Mart has a good set of numbers and also new store opening shows that the company is on an expansion spree. All that makes a lot of sense. In this slow environment if somebody can post that kind of numbers and the store expansion is a lot of heart to take from. 

But having said that, in the case of D-Mart, the budget announcement of promoter stake dilution to 65% will be an overhang. Already when the IPO came, they came down to 75% and now they have to come down to 65%.

 Still we need to wait for SEBI in terms of how much time will be given but make no mistake. It is a lot of stake to be diluted. Even in terms of aggregate amount, a good Rs 15,000-20,000 crore is a lot of money even for any brand and any credible promoters’ track record. 

Keeping that into account, till the time SEBI gives sufficient time, that provision may act as an overhang and investors should be mindful of that. But operationally things are looking good. In this slow environment, it is commendable to talk about growth and expansion.


What are some of your picks within the cement space?In cement, UltraTech has been doing good and even Grasim has been showing a good performance. Overall, cement is appearing as a bet on the hope of revival in both housing as well as the government infrastructure projects. We feel the government will be focussing on infrastructure in this new tenure. They have to because staying in power for 10 years and not doing the revival of infrastructure will not look good. So I am sure, infrastructure will be the main thrust area for the government so cement should come handy. 

Already we had witnessed in the March quarter performance as well and we believe the good work done by them should translate into June quarter as well. Anyway in cement, do not play for a quarter. Look at least look for two-three years. I am sure there is a lot of money to be made. 


Quess Corp from Rs 1200-1300 had come crashing down to Rs 350. From Rs 350, it closed on Friday at Rs 480. There was this issue of loan to a builder which cropped up 10 days ago, but that Rs 150 crore loan has knocked off 30% of the market cap. What is going on?In this market, any small bit of issue about any builder loan exposure or corporate governance can spiral out even if it is not a proven issue. Even if there is a small doubt, markets have become extremely punishing. We are in a strange market and that is understandably because of the kind of damages we had seen over the last six-eight months. Market panic is understandable, but in some cases, probably market is also getting irrational. 

But that is where the opportunities come and also news that probably Amazon has already put something in this company is also taken note of by investors. The market is a zone where extreme polarisation in terms of whether quality money is moving there.

I somehow feel that even that polarisation is on the verge of evaporation. Make no mistake polarisation is a very temporary and very perishable phenomenon. It cannot be a perennial phenomenon. Thereby even the fact that the largecap companies where people are taking shelter for quality, should get evaporated in time. I think it can be very good for long term health of the market because quality high net worth individual money will come into these quality companies at lower valuation. For the multi-year bull run to establish, it is very important that this polarisation should disappear and largecap companies correct. So, that there will be restoration of normalisation in the market.


Where are you expecting some major positives and where do you think we will get the nasty shockers?Analysts and markets are of the opinion that earnings for the June quarter will be a wash out. Best part is nobody is entering this earning season with anticipation or expectation. People’s expectation is so low and muted that this is probably one of the earnings season I have not seen for a while where people have entered into earning season with the absolute mindset that it is a washout.

It is a quarter where almost from April till May 23, that is more than the first 45 days, is completely pre-election season and almost all countries are in the freezing mode and technically nothing has happened in terms of economic performance. Keeping that into account, markets do not have great expectations. This can be a great comfort factor because even if there is any disappointment, people will take it in their stride. 

All in all, as we had witnessed in the March quarter, BFSI was a clear outperformer because of the provisions that they created over the previous two years and the low base effect they had and non-BFSI was struggling. Probably we can see the similar performance even in the June quarter.

BFSI may still do some positive surprises because of the low base effect but the expectations from non-BFSI, is not so great. Cement can be a surprise winner because the momentum is keeping good even in terms of the volume numbers looking good. 

Cement and BFSI can surprise positively and IT can be a decent play because of the way things are stacking up. But in the broad market, I do not think analysts have great expectations for this quarter."

8,2019-07-20,Grasim,"Nearly 17 months after it began operations, Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank Limited Saturday announced winding up of its business on account of ""unanticipated developments"" that made its economic model ""unviable"".

The company is the fourth payments bank to shut shop after Tech Mahindra, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company and a consortium of Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank Ltd and Telenor Financial Services that pulled the plug of operations.

Vodafone Idea Limited in a regulatory filing said, ""the Board of Directors of our associate company Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank Limited (ABIPBL), has subject to receipt of requisite regulatory consents and approvals, approved the voluntary winding up of ABIPBL"".

The decision has been taken due to unanticipated developments in the business landscape that have made the economic model unviable, the filing added.

In February 2018, Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank became the fourth such entity to begin operations since the issuance of licences to 11 firms by the RBI in August 2015.

ABIPBL had received the banking licence from the RBI on April 3, 2017, for carrying on the business of a payments bank and had also received an authorisation to carry on the business of Prepaid Payments Instrument business. It commenced business from February 22, 2018.

Sources privy to the development said that the payments bank has about 200 employees and a majority of them are likely to be absorbed in other group entities, while the rest will be offered outplacement assistance.

Total deposits with Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank stand at about Rs 20 crore, according to sources.

""The payments bank does not want customers to worry about what happens to their money. They will be given enough time and notice to transfer or withdraw it,"" the source said adding that the closure of operations could take about three months.

Aditya Birla Payments Bank is promoted by Grasim Industries Limited and Vodafone Idea Limited with 51 and 49 per cent shareholdings respectively.

According to the filing, ABIPBL incurred a loss of Rs 24 crore at the end of 2017-18.

Aditya Birla group said ABIPBL has made full and complete arrangement of funds for the return of customer deposits and meeting its all liabilities and is taking steps to ensure smooth closure of all the customer accounts and settlement of their balances.

""The Bank will continue to be operational for limited banking transactions and will provide a facility to the customers for withdrawing/transferring their balances,"" the group said in a statement. PTI PRS MBI

10,2019-07-23,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal has imposed an interim penalty of Rs 1 crore on Grasim Industries Limited for storing huge stock of the mercury, obtained as a by-product, in its premises in Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the company to shift the hazardous waste in accordance with the Hazardous Waste Management Rules, 2016.

16,2019-07-30,Grasim,"I do not see Sebi planning to put a cap on broker fees in PMS and AIF as a negative because the pricing and the disclosure in some of the products is not necessarily the best in terms of practices. That may be good for the industry, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

We are already grappling with the consistent sell-off from the FPI fraternity right after the budget. Now it seems the regulator may be tightening its noose on PMS as well as AIFs. It appears to be bad news overall for the markets. There does not seem to be any glimmer of hope anywhere in sight?I agree with the first part that there has been relentless selling by the FIIs and FPIs and as a result, we have seen a huge underperformance by the Indian market the whole of the year and more so after the budget. But the fact that the regulator is looking at some kind of norms or the current practices being followed by the participants in the PMS or the other structures which are available in the market, is not necessarily bad news. 

We have seen time and again that for mutual funds and for any other products in the market. It is the job of the regulator to look at the practices and take the feedback and put in place a mechanism which is in the interest of the investors. I do not necessarily see that as a negative because the pricing and the disclosure in some of the products is not necessarily the best in terms of practices. So, that may be good for the industry. I do not think we should read too much negative into it.


Would FIIs still think midcaps are expensive? Back home, everyone is hunting for value and are yet incredibly risk averse. Where would you be looking at in the midcap universe?Some of the small companies in the cement space definitely look interesting because that space is looking pretty good, particularly in terms of pricing and the fact that you will have some kind of an improvement post monsoon in terms of dispatches. 

JK Lakshmi and Ramco Cement are some of the stocks that one can really look at because there is a lot of uncertainty about earnings in many sectors and there are a few sectors like cement or may be some of the private sector banks and may be a couple of consumption names like HUL where the volume growth was about 5% odd in the most challenging environment and of course Asian Paints. 

The companies which are performing in this environment are the ones the investors should bet on versus the companies where the prices have corrected but one is really not sure about the business and where the debt levels are pretty high.


Apart from Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra is also slated to come out with its numbers today, What kind of commentary are you expecting and how have you read into the kind of Q1 report card that we have seen so far from the IT majors?Typically, this is a subdued quarter for the IT companies in general and in Tech Mahindra, we have seen that the guidance which they had given, both for telecom as well as enterprise solution, was not good. They had tweaked the enterprise business part a bit and the sense that we are getting is that in terms of revenue there could be a 1% dip there. Even the margins could dip by about 160 bps. Typically, Tech Mahindra margins have been relatively lower compared to the general IT services industry. So, net-net, in terms of expectations, they are pretty muted.

The only thing that people would be watching out for is whether there is going to be any kind of a clarity or colour in terms of the overall growth in the telecom space that one is really looking at and what kind of margins can one expect on a sustainable basis. Though in terms of valuation, the stock looks pretty attractive but in terms of growth, the performance may remain muted.


How you are approaching the telecom space? Is it Bharti versus Idea or it is an avoid for both?Overall, things are looking quite tough for the incumbent telecom companies as the operating performance has been extremely weak with high debt levels. More importantly, for any capex they need to do -- whether 5G or for the normal -- it is going to be quite tough. We have been liking Bharti for the fact that now that Rel Jio is already there and that entire competitive intensity is likely to come off.

You might see a bit of price stability but that is taking a while. Our sense is that if you have a one or two year kind of view, Bharti appears to be much better in terms of the balance sheet strength and the overall operating performance that they have. Idea definitely we would avoid at this point of time and more importantly if you see the actual performances in terms of call drops, etc, the network issues that are there it is pathetic in terms of servicing. It would take a while for the telecom companies to show up in terms of better investor sentiment.


 The preferred bets within real estate are Mumbai specific plays like Godrej Properties or Oberoi Realty. At a time when you are seeing real estate in doldrums and it seems that the pain is going to last for some more time to come, is this a good time to buy into DLF? They seem to be ahead of the curve when it comes to deleveraging their balance sheet?I agree on the deleveraging part. DLF has taken some steps and given the fact that the commercial side of the business, the lease rentals, have been good and we had some kind of deals where REITs were launched. These are the positives for DLF but given the overall environment that we have in our economy today, though interest rates are falling, the appetite to buy more into real estate is still not there.

For DLF, on the enterprise level and at the company level, the debt is still pretty high. Unless we see some kind of stability in the residential part of the business, it would be hard to make out a case for buying into a stock like DLF. Yes, because of the lower interest rates, if somebody wants to buy some of the real estate players, maybe some of the better ones like Godrej, etc, one can really look at it but overall we would definitely stay away from the sector for a while.


Would there be any concerns you have on the fundamentals of the Grasim stock apart from the fact that we have seen that rub off price drop yesterday.The structure of Grasim is such that, there is UltraTech and more importantly the remainder of the Idea stake. That could become a pain point for Grasim and the rest of their other commodity businesses like sponge iron and a couple of chemical businesses. 

I do not think there is too much of an issue. But because of the holding company nature and the investment that they have in the telecom, there is some kind of an issue going on in terms of the derating. That could have led to a weakness. On an overall basis, Grasim continues to look quite okay because the UltraTech part of the business where they have significant stake is shaping up well and the other businesses are also quite stable. I continue to have a positive bias on Grasim. Yesterday’s selloff could be either technical or with respect to their stake in the Idea I think.


What you are expecting from Axis Bank’s numbers this time around?In terms of the numbers, the loan growth could be in the range of about 15% to 16%. The key moniterables for Axis Bank could be the slippages because last time around the slippages were somewhere in the range of about Rs 3,000 crore on a total watch list of about Rs 9,500-10,000 crore. The sense that we are getting is that the slippages could be somewhere in that range about Rs 2,800-3,500 crore. 

Fillers that we are getting is that the gross NPL in terms of percentage could be a bit higher versus the last quarter at about Rs 5.7-5.8 crore. So there might be a bit of a negative surprise in terms of the slippages and gross NPL. The loan growth part should be okay and there might be a bit of a negative reaction when these numbers are announced by Axis Bank. Within the banking space, ICICI Bank definitely stands out vis-à-vis some of the other banks.


 What about Dr Reddy’s? How do you read into the kind of quarter that the company has delivered and the kind of management commentary that has come about?The numbers appear definitely subdued. The fact that some of their key products have got pushed into 2020 again because of some regulatory issues is not great news. The only positive takeaway could be that the generic business in the US is stabilising and there was a bit of a growth over there but the rest of the markets -- be it India or some of the other markets there -- has not been that great outcome as far as the Dr Reddy is concerned.

It would take time for some of these companies to come out with a stronger set of numbers given the environment that we are into both India and other markets. Within the pharma space, we like Divi’s Lab and Cipla because performance wise, these two companies are better placed.


What do you think about Zee in light of the fact that a deal could be imminent any time now and earnings this time are pretty much intact as well?It remains to be seen what kind of structure they are looking at and what kind of valuation they are going to get for the overall broadcasting part of the business that they have. The quarterly numbers for Zee have been quite good, particularly on the subscription side of it. One would really want to know what kind of overall structure they are looking at because both on the broadcasting and on the digital part of it, some clarity is required in terms of the thought process and plan that they have. 

Also one of the reasons why Zee was under tremendous pressure was that the debt level at the enterprise level was somewhere in the range of about Rs 13,000 odd crore. Post this deal, what kind of repayment are they looking at and what kind of debt level would they be comfortable with in the balance sheet is something that one would be watching out for. We also hear that for some of the group companies where Zee has a stake, there could be some kind of deal involving those also. So, that is something that could bring about some kind of some of parts valuation aspect for Zee. 

Overall, Zee remains quite interesting at this point of time because just a couple of days are left in terms of the announcement that the management made. So, depending upon the deal there might be some action in Zee at this point of time."

19,2019-07-31,Grasim,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."

Kumar Mangalam Birla, the dealmaking tycoon who controls India’s biggest cement maker, hired bankers from Standard Chartered Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for senior roles at his conglomerate, people with knowledge of the matter said.

The billionaire’s Aditya Birla Group appointed Standard Chartered dealmaker Sandeep Agrawal as head of corporate finance, according to the people. He will be responsible for mergers and acquisitions as well as capital raising, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.

Agrawal had been with Standard Chartered for about 16 years, most recently as managing director for global corporates covering Indian business houses like Birla Group and Tata Group. He succeeds Ashish Adukia, who moved to Birla Group’s Grasim Industries Ltd. as chief financial officer last month.

Birla Group has been one of India’s most active dealmakers of late. Last year, the conglomerate completed the merger of its wireless business with Vodafone Group Plc’s local unit and it recently hired banks to offload its fiber network. It has been bidding for distressed cement assets and agreed last July to buy U.S. aluminum producer Aleris Corp. for $2.6 billion including debt.

The conglomerate has also hired Manish Dabir from Goldman to be its head of investor relations, the people said. The banker, who was an executive director in Goldman’s strategic transactions group, joined Birla Group earlier this month, one of the people said.

A representative for Standard Chartered confirmed Agrawal is leaving to pursue other opportunities, while a representative for Goldman said he has no immediate comment. Birla Group hires externally for about 20% of its senior positions while the rest go to internal candidates, Santrupt Misra, director of group human resources, said in an emailed statement.

Birla is India’s 11th-richest person with a net worth of about $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His group, with business from metals and cement to financial services and telecom, employs 120,000 people in 34 countries, it said in a June presentation."

7,2019-08-12,Grasim,"ET Intelligence Group: The Nifty 50 companies have disclosed receiving a cumulative 741 complaints of sexual harassment in their annual reports for the fiscal year 2019. These are the highest number of cases reported annually since FY15, the year from when it became compulsory for companies to make such a disclosure.

Experts attribute this surge in complaints to an increase in awareness, the MeToo movement, impact of mandatory training and companies realising the reputational risk involved.

Analysis by the ET Intelligence Group revealed that the number of cases jumped 14 per cent on-year in FY19 as compared to 3 per cent in FY18. Complaints have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 15 per cent in the past five fiscal years.

IT and banking companies, the biggest employers of women, have traditionally been the top recipients of such complaints. At 142 reported cases, IT giant Wipro topped the list, followed by Infosys (105 ) and Tata Consultancy Services (87). According to a Wipro spokesperson, the number of harassment complaints in the company of 170,000 employees reflected increasing awareness as well as greater conviction in the organisation’s process to be able to address these concerns. The robustness of the system allows employees to share their concerns confidentially, assured of a fair and just hearing, and without fear of retribution. Each case has its own context, and is addressed with full due diligence, confidentiality, neutrality, sensitivity and after assuring the employee of a safe workplace, the spokesperson said.

Banks are the next set of companies to report double-digit complaints. ICICI Bank tops the list with 59 complaints, followed by Axis Bank (51), Kotak Mahindra Bank (27), State Bank of India (26) and HDFC Bank (25).

Five Nifty companies — Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance, Grasim Industries, JSW Steel and UltraTech — have reported receiving harassment complaints for the first time in the past five years.

JSW Group’s spokesperson clarified that “the single complaint reported was found as not an act of sexual harassment but other grievance by the company’s internal complaints committee and was disposed of as such”. “However, it reflects the confidence of our woman employees in JSW Group’s policies and practices to create a safe work environment as well as enabling them to speak-up,” he added. The company undertook several initiatives including deployment of e-learning modules and forum theatre techniques to maximise awareness and highlight various nuances of sexual harassment.



“The biggest thing has been the Me-Too movement that has led to general increase in awareness about sexual harassment,” said Vishal Kedia, founder of compliance advisory firm Complykaro Services. “Organisations that were hesitant earlier have shed their hesitation. Companies realise that there is a reputational risk attached to this and it is no longer something that can be ignored. Several instances of not handling cases properly have led to negative consequences for companies. As a result, the companies are getting skilled people on the board to undertake sensitisation programmes,” Kedia added. According to him, even small companies are now aware and willing to invest in sensitisation programmes.

Among manufacturing firms, Tata Steel reported the highest number of complaints at 20, followed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories at 16. “We have strengthened our prevention of sexual harassment training, by holding small group sessions for our woman employees with a strong focus concentrating on assuring them of non-retaliation and confidentiality regarding complaints, thereby encouraging women to speak up without fear,” said a Dr Reddy’s spokesperson, adding, “In addition to the online training module, we have conducted a series of floor walks and in-person classroom sessions.”

From 21 firms receiving no harassment complaints in FY15, the number has dropped to eight in FY19.

“There is an uptick in demand for year-round communication — with companies wanting to maintain a steady flow of communication,” said Bhumija Saxena, a partner at Integrity Matters, a firm that provides POSH [Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act] training modules to companies. “Men have become wary of working with woman colleagues — an aspect companies are finding difficult to tackle. Companies want the training modules to be gender-neutral and depicting a balanced approach that negates the extremes of not hiring women on one hand and harassing them in any sort on the other,” she added.

According to SC lawyer Nidhi Mathur, increased awareness, stringent regulations, mandatory training, elaborate investigation and zero tolerance policy followed by companies have led to increased complaints over the years. “Young girls have become more confident now to speak up.”"
12,2019-08-14,Grasim,"Grasim posted a 28% rise in its consolidated net profit for the April-June quarter on the back of healthy performance by subsidiaries UltraTech and Aditya Birla Capital even as the profit at standalone textile fibre and chemicals business declined to less than a third due to weak global prices. 

Consolidated net profit grew by 28% at Rs 1,786 crore on the back of Ultratech that almost doubled its net profit in the quarter as well as Aditya Birla Capital that posted a 27% rise. The consolidated net income includes Rs 109 crore impairment charges that Grasim had to incur in carrying value on investment in Aditya Birla Payments Bank that is being wound up. Revenue from operations increased by 13% at Rs 18,861 crore. Consolidated operational income or Ebitda posted a 31% rise at Rs 4,217 crore. 

In its standalone textile and chemicals business net profit declined by 69% at Rs 202 crore due to low realisations as global viscose staple fibre (VSF) prices declined by 21% since last year. Prices have fallen sharply on account of oversupply due to new capacities that have been commissioned in the recent past with the ongoing US-China trade war casting a negative sentimental impact. 

Revenue in the VSF business grew marginally by 1% at Rs 2,509 crore. Chemicals business saw a decline of 5% in revenue at Rs 1,503 crore. 

""At standalone level, there has been volume growth in both VSF and Caustic Soda, however, profitability was impacted due to global softening in prices,"" Grasim said in a release. 

The company that makes fibre for textiles announced that it will be extending its brand 'Liva' to a new product of line of sarees. On the growth front the company's standalone capex program of about Rs 7,800 crore is on course that will raise capacities in both its VSF and chemicals business, apart from modernisation capex at various plants. 

On the outlook, the company said that in the VSF business, new capacities commissioned in Asia in the recent past will continue putting pressure on prices. Chemicals business will gain from expansion in both its chlor-alkali and specialty chemicals business."

16,2019-08-16,Grasim,"Shares of YES Bank were trading over 3 per cent higher in trade on Friday after the lender on Wednesday said it has raised Rs 1,930.46 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) to fund its business expansion.

The QIP opened on August 9 and closed on August 14, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

YES Bank approved the issue price of Rs 83.55, including a share premium of Rs 81.55 per share which is at a discount of 4.95 per cent to the floor price of Rs 87.90 per equity.

The bank offered 23.10 crore shares aggregating to 9.96 per cent of the share capital as against a limit of 10 per cent of pre-issue share capital as approved by the shareholders, it said.

After the QIP, Ravneet Gill, MD & CEO of YES Bank in an interaction with ETNOW said, “We are looking at private equity and preferential allotment. We also have the option to do rights issues as well. There are multiple routes available to us and given the fact that the genres of investors we are currently looking at, we are keeping our options open with regard to what instrument we eventually adopt.”

He also added that the bank’s pre-provisioning operating profit is enough to meet its provisioning needs.

“All capital that we raise will really be growth capital. If you look at the market opportunity right now with the dislocation in so many segments of credit markets, there is a tremendous opportunity for a bank like ours to grow and obviously we would like to do that as soon as possible,” Gill said.

17,2019-08-16,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: At a time when businesses are complaining of slow demand, Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has reported an over 25% jump in sales to a little under Rs 75,000 crore during 2018-19.

It is the humble papad, honey and cosmetics that have contributed to a major chunk of the state-owned entity’s revenues, with much hyped Khadi products accounting for just around 4.3% of the overall sales in the last financial year. KVIC’s sales growth is its fastest in four years and comes after a “moderate” 13% rise in 2017-18.

The entity managed to stay in the black with a small profit of Rs 15 crore.

KVIC’s sales are almost twice as much as HUL, India’s largest consumer goods company, which reported gross sales of around Rs 38,000 crore in the last financial year, though its net profit was 400 times higher at over Rs 6,000 crore.

Going by annual revenue in 2018-19, KVIC would compare with the top 25 listed Indian companies with sales a little lower than Bharti Aritel’s Rs 81,000 crore but a shade higher than Grasim Industries’ Rs 72,970 crore.

KVIC chief targets 20% sales growth in 2019-20

Khadi Village Industries’ (KVIC) chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena told TOI that partnerships with public and private sector enterprises, aggressive marketing and a renewed push from the Narendra Modi government had led to the entity more than double its sales over the last five financial years, from Rs 33,135 crore in 2014-15.

During the current financial year, KVIC chairman is targeting a 20% growth in village industry sales, which he hopes will touch the Rs 85,000-crore mark, while looking to push khadi sales to Rs 5,000 crore, which will be an increase of about 50%.

During 2018-19, khadi sales rose 28% to Rs 3,215 crore.

“Narendra Modi has to be given credit for the growth in awareness of khadi. Sales of khadi products have shot up in the last five years. Most private brands now have a khadi range. For instance, Arvind (Mills) has khadi denims. The quirkiness of khadi material makes it a fashion staple,” said Arvind Singhal, founder of leading retail consultancy Technopak.

For instance, first and business class passengers of Air India on international routes receive amenity kits supplied by KVIC. Similarly, it has successfully tied up with textile and retail majors such as Arvind Mills and Raymond to supply khadi material that is subsequently marketed and branded by them.

While sales have been rising, ensuring that production keeps pace was a challenge. But that too seems to have picked up in recent years.

KVIC provides employment to around 5 lakh people under the khadi category and 1.5 crore people under ‘village industries’."

14,2019-08-16,Grasim,"Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance cracked nearly 10 per cent in early trade on Friday after the global rating agency Moody’s on Wednesday downgraded the company’s long- term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1, while changing its outlook to negative from stable.

The scrip plunged as much as 9.66 per cent to Rs 498, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was down over 250 per cent at 37,046 at around 9.40 am (IST).

The company’s foreign-currency senior secured rating has been downgraded to Ba2 from Ba1 and the foreign-and local-currency senior secured MTN program ratings to (P)Ba2 from (P)Ba1.

The rating agency said the downgrade reflects renewed pressure on the cost and availability of funds for Indiabulls Housing Finance (IBH) and certain other finance companies in the country.

Moody’s pointed out that the company's incremental cost of funding increased 45 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter ending June, while the company’s balance sheet declined by 7 per cent over the same period. 

This rise in funding costs was a key driver for the 28 basis points decline in spreads in the same period, although profitability remains comparatively strong relative to its peer group, it said.

It noted that liquid assets remain high, at around 24 per cent of its balance sheet at end June 2019. 

“This continues to be a key positive credit driver as it allows the company to be able to withstand some period of impaired access to funding. As interest rates on high-quality liquid assets have declined, the company's strategy of holding a relatively high pool of liquid assets -- a positive rating factor -- has become costlier, presenting a drag on earnings due to negative carry,” it said.

The shares of the company closed flat at Rs 551.10 on BSE.

15,2019-08-16,Grasim,"Share of IDBI Bank slipped 12 per cent to Rs 23.80, lowest since May 26, 2003, in Friday's session after its net loss widened to Rs 3,801 crore for the quarter ended June 30 on higher provision for NPAs.

21,2019-08-22,Grasim,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."
22,2019-08-22,Grasim,"Benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty cracked for a third straight session on Thursday after Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian in virtually ruled out a major stimulus package for the economy.

0,2019-09-04,Grasim,"MUMBAI: US private equity group Advent is in advanced negotiations with Kumar Mangalam Birla to invest Rs 1,200-1,300 crore in his listed financial services holding company Aditya Birla Capital Ltd (ABCL) for a 6-7% stake, said people with knowledge of the matter.

The company will hold a board meeting on September 5 to consider and approve the fundraising either through a preferential allotment or a qualified institutional placement (QIP), they said. Advent’s proposal is expected to get ratified at the meeting. The company had already obtained an enabling resolution to raise up to Rs 3,500 crore of equity capital earlier this year. The deal once completed would make Advent ABCL’s single largest non-promoter shareholder.

The capital infusion to fund growth is likely to be through a mix of primary capital into the company and secondary sale of shares. In July 2017, PremjiInvest, the family investment arm of Wipro founder Azim Premji, bought a 2.2% stake in the company for Rs 703.7 crore ($109 million) at a proposed valuation of Rs 32,000 crore.

In September of that year, ABCL got listed after a group reorganisation that saw Aditya Birla Nuvo merging with Grasim Industries and the financial services business getting hived off and brought under Aditya Birla Capital.



Since listing, the stock is down 65% and closed at Rs 87.55 on Tuesday for a market value of Rs 19,309 crore. The deal may be at a small premium of 3-6% to the current market price. Advent may also get a board seat, said one of the persons.


Advent Scouting for Big Deals
Advent and Aditya Birla Group spokespersons declined to comment on speculation. Birla is said to have been looking to raise growth equity for the business to enhance its tier I capital for around six-eight months and had approached a select set of investors. Initially, he was also looking at putting in an equal amount in the business as confidence capital. It is not clear if he will still do so.

“The stress in Vodafone Idea has severely impacted Birla’s ability to infuse significant liquidity in group businesses. That’s a business that’s haemorrhaging with mounting losses and debt,” said a long-time Birla watcher.

Having invested in ASK Investment Managers and CAMS, Advent has been scouting for bigger financial services deals. It was recently in the news for evaluating Yes Bank for a potential billion-dollar investment. It is also in the fray for a near 30% stake in Shriram Capital, which would be a similar-sized transaction. Till date it has made seven investments. This deal, if it goes ahead, will be the sixth in three years. The buyout specialist has already deployed around Rs 6,000 crore in the country.

“There is a holding company discount but this is a good time to take a bet on the financial services space after most companies have been beaten down,” said an executive in the know.

“NBFCs (nonbanking finance companies) are still an important channel for credit growth in the country… In future, many of the underlying businesses can unlock value through demergers, listings etc.” A diversified financial conglomerate, ABCL houses life insurance, asset management, private equity, corporate lending, structured finance, general insurance broking, wealth management, equity, currency and commodity broking, online personal finance management, housing finance, pension fund management and health insurance.


National footprint
Having more than 12,000 employees, ABCL has nationwide reach through 1,300 points of presence and more than 142,000 agents or channel partners.

Despite sectoral challenges, ABCL reported better than expected and operationally steady first quarter performance. While growth softened below trend, focus on profitability and steady asset quality has helped. Performance across verticals has been steady—in financing (16% loan growth from the year earlier), protecting (30% individual annual premium equivalent growth in life insurance) and investing (profitability in asset management company sustained at 28 basis points despite recent regulations).

ABCL’s performance indicates that it is relatively better positioned to navigate the macro headwinds that shadow banks are facing, which might see valuations settle lower till risks attached to systemic risks to construction financing, promoter loans and loans against property (LAP) subside.

“After five years of strong loan growth, the company would be entering a temporary phase of consolidation given the external environment,” said Alpesh Mehta, analyst at Motilal Oswal. “We believe the company’s focus will be on retail loans, while corporate lending would be more opportunistic.”

The company said profit in the previous quarter was largely driven by growth in the NBFC, housing finance and asset management businesses.

A few of the businesses, such as asset reconstruction and health insurance, are at incubation stage, the successful scaling up of which will be the incremental delta to earnings and valuations, according to Edelweiss analysts. One of the key metrics for the life insurance business is the scalability potential of its bancassurance channel, a recent tie up with HDFC Bank. Any blip in that could potentially slow the improvement. The asset management business closed with over Rs 30,000 crore of assets under management and a lending book of Rs 63,119 crore in FY19. Revenue for the year grew 29% to Rs 16,570 crore while consolidated net profit after tax (and after minority interest) grew 26% to Rs 871 crore from the year earlier."
1,2019-09-05,Grasim,"Shares of Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL) advanced over 2 per cent after the company informed bourses that its board has approved raising Rs 2,100 crore through a preferential share allotment to certain marquee investors and the promoter or promoter group entities.

The equity capital will be raised at Rs 100 per share, which is at a 10.62 per cent premium to the ABCL closing price of Rs 90.40 as of September 4.

In a regulatory filing, Aditya Birla Capital said that it will raise Rs 100 crore from PI Opportunities Fund and Rs 1,000 crore from Jomei Investments.

It will also raise Rs 770 crore from the promoter Grasim Industry and Rs 230 crore from members of promoter group of the company including Surya Kiran Investments Pte, IGH Holdings and Pilani Investment.

The scrip jumped as much as 2.38 per cent to Rs 92.55 in early trade. 

“ABCL has entered into definitive share subscription agreements with Jomei Investments, an affiliate of Advent International and PI Opportunities Fund, an affiliate of Premji Invest. Upon the completion of the issuance, Advent, through its affiliate, will hold nearly 4.15 per cent of ABCL’s equity capital, while Premji Invest, through its affiliates will hold nearly 4.11 per cent of the equity capital,” the company said in a BSE filing.

The promoter and promoter group entities will hold about 70.54 per cent in ABCL upon the completion of the issuance. The funds raised will be utilised to fund the future growth of the company’s businesses as well as to repay outstanding debt.

The shares of the company closed 1.16 per cent higher at Rs 91.45 on BSE."
5,2019-09-06,Grasim,"ICICI Securities has given a ‘buy’ rating on Grasim Industries with a reduced target price of Rs 895 per share.

Grasim Industries’ (Grasim) agreed to subscribe to 77 million shares totalling a value of Rs 770 crore on proposed equity raising of Rs 2,100 crore by Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL).

Accordingly, Grasim’s leverage is likely to increase further and its stake in ABCL would decline from 55.97 per cent to 54.29 per cent. “We had already factored in an investment of Rs 1,000 crore in subsidiaries in our estimates. We maintain our FY20E-FY21E estimates. However, with the recent stock price correction of its various holdings, we reduce our target price to Rs 895 per share from Rs 930 earlier, based on 7 times FY21E EV/E and assuming 60 per cemt holding company discount. The stock is trading at an implied 6 times FY21E core business EV / EBITDA assuming higher 70 per cent holding company discount. “We maintain a buy rating on the stock,” the brokerage said.


Grasim to invest Rs 770 crore in ABCL at Rs 100 per share

ABCL has approved raising of Rs 2,100 crore through preferential allotment to promoters (Rs 1,000 crore) and certain marquee investors (Rs 1,100 crore) at Rs 100 per share (9.3 per cent premium to LTP) to fund future growth plans and de-leverage balance sheet. Grasim has agreed to subscribe 77mn shares totalling to Rs 770 crore (~37 per cent of issue size) subject to necessary regulatory approvals.

Accordingly, its leverage likely to increase further and stake in ABCL to decline from 55.97 per cent to 54.29 per cent. During Q1FY20 result concall, the management had highlighted they do not foresee any incremental investments in Vodafone Idea (VIL) over the next two years and any capital infusion in ABCL would be opportunistic and based on capital requirements of ABCL.


Muted pricing outlook in core business for near-term; well-integrated business model to restrict sharp margin erosion:

The management expects pricing pressure in core businesses to continue in the near term, especially led by capacity overhang. “However, Grasim’s well-integrated business model (~55-60 per cent in pulp and fully captive in caustic soda and power requirements) and sharp focus on specialty products and cost efficiencies would cushion against any sharp margin erosion, in our view,” the brokerage said.


Expanding capacity in core businesses; capex outlay of Rs 7,800 crore over FY20E-FY22E

With strong demand outlook and optimum capacity utilisation level, Grasim is augmenting its VSF capacity by 44 per cent to 788ktpa by FY21E via de-bottlenecking and brownfield expansion at Vilayat (219kte).

Besides, the management is targeting to become seventh largest global caustic soda player by FY23 by increasing its capacity by 27 per cent from 1,147ktpa to 1,457ktpa by FY21E. Accordingly, the management has targeted standalone capex of Rs 7,800 crore over FY20E-FY22E.


Capital allocation remains key overhang; net debt to increase:

Post equity investment of Rs 2,900 crore in VIL, standalone net debt of Rs 1,900 crore (including Rs 73 crore lease liability) as of June 2019-end vs net cash of Rs 45.80 crore as at the end of March 2019.

“We estimate net debt to further increase to Rs 3,900 crore by FY21-end. As capital allocation remains a key overhang, we believe holding company discount is unlikely to narrow meaningfully,” the brokerage said."
3,2019-09-06,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: Around 7 stocks rose to touch their 52-week highs on NSE in Friday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs were CREDITACCESS GRAMEEN, Grand Foundry, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Infosys, Libas Designs, N. B. I. Industrial Finance Company and Tree House Education & Accessories. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 24.20 points up at 10,872.10 while the BSE Sensex was trading 98.97 points up at 36,743.39. 

Overall, 31 shares were trading in the green in Nifty50 index, while 19 were trading in the red.

In the Nifty 50 index, Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, Grasim Industries, UltraTech Cement and NTPC were among the top gainers. 

While Indiabulls Housing Finance, Sun Pharma, YES Bank, BPCL and Indian Oil Corp were trading in red."
2,2019-09-06,Grasim,"MUMBAI: Two years after its listing, Aditya Birla Capital Limited (ABCL) raised Rs 1,000 crore from private equity fund Advent International as part of a larger Rs 2,100 crore capitalisation exercise that will also see an equal contribution from promoter entities. Existing investor PremjiInvest will put in Rs 100 crore.

The board approved the fundraise through a preferential allotment at Rs 100 per share at a 10.62% premium to ABCL’s closing price of Rs 90.40 on September 4, the company said in a statement. ET was the first to report on September 4 that Advent was in advanced negotiations with Kumar Mangalam Birla to invest in his listed financial services holding company for a minority stake.

Advent International will invest Rs 1,000 crore via its affiliate Jomei Investment and PremjiInvest’s Rs 100 crore will come in through affiliate PI Opportunities Fund.

Additionally, Grasim Industries will invest Rs 770 crore along with other Birla promoter entities who will, all told, contribute another Rs 230 crore to ABCL as “confidence capital”. After the transaction, the promoter and promoter group entities will hold about 70.54% of ABCL.

Upon completion of the transaction, Advent, a US-based buyout fund with over $36 billion AUM, will own about 4.15% of ABCL’s equity, making it the largest non-promoter shareholder.

PremjiInvest, through its affiliates, will hold about 4.11% of ABCL. In July 2017, PremjiInvest, the family investment arm of Wipro founder Azim Premji, bought a 2.2% stake in the company for Rs 703.7 crore ($109 million) at a proposed valuation of Rs 32,000 crore.

In September of that year, ABCL got listed after a group reorganisation that saw Aditya Birla Nuvo merging with Grasim Industries and the financial services business getting hived off and brought under Aditya Birla Capital. Since listing, the stock is down over 60% and closed Thursday at Rs 91.45 for a market value of Rs 20,135.32 crore.

“The premium that we are getting in the valuation is a validation of the inherent strength of our franchise from a pedigreed global institutional investor,” said ABCL CEO Ajay Srinivasan. “Since our listing two years ago, we have funded our strong growth through internal accruals and debt. This recapitalisation equity infusion is coming at a time that will help us refinance existing debt and also offer growth equity for our business for the next 18-24 months.”

Of the total Rs 2,100 crore, around 50% will be used for refinancing, while the rest is expected to help expand lenders Aditya Birla Finance and Aditya Birla Housing Finance Ltd besides Aditya Birla Health Insurance Ltd.

Financial services has always been a focus area for Advent, having invested in ASK Investment Managers and CAMS. It was recently in the news for evaluating Yes Bank for a potential investment. It is also in the fray for a near 30% stake in Shriram Capital, a similar-sized transaction. “One can never time the market perfectly but we felt this was the best time to enter the NBFC (nonbanking finance company) space as valuations have corrected significantly,” said Shweta Jalan, Advent’s head in India. “There is a clear flight towards quality and scale that is happening across financial services. Liquidity is the key factor that will separate one from the pack and help stand out.”



With assets of more than Rs 3 lakh crore under management, a Rs 63,000 crore loan book and an insurance arm with gross written premiums of around Rs 8,000 crore, ABCL is a diversified financial conglomerate that houses life insurance, asset management, private equity, corporate lending, structured finance, general insurance broking, wealth management, equity, currency and commodity broking, online personal finance management, housing finance, pension fund management and health insurance.

“Their conglomerate strategy of offering diversified services helps serve a wider pool of customers, have benefits in terms of cost controls, talent management and even sales,” Jalan said. “Plus, the Birla parentage ensures that liquidity will not be a challenge. The sum of parts valuation is also far higher than what the market is factoring in. There are tremendous opportunities to unlock value going forward...”

Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas was the legal adviser in the deal.

JM Financial analyst Karan Singh said, “There are multiple growth drivers in place for each business whether in terms of expanding distribution (insurance) or retail penetration (lending) which will drive earnings growth.”

Despite the macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted the financial sector, Srinivasan feels that the company will continue to gain market share even while staying cautious. Some firms will have an advantage and liquidity will be a key differentiator. ABCL reported better-than-expected and operationally steady June quarter performance. While growth softened below trend, the focus on profitability and steady asset quality helped sustain profitability.

“We have cut out most of our exposure in gems and jewellery, auto, real estate — sectors we felt were more vulnerable, but even in these sectors, there are companies with bankable assets,” Srinivasan said. “Between retail, SME (small and medium enterprises) and HNIs (high networth individuals), it’s 50% of our lending book and we will continue to accelerate our pace of growth in these retail segments, cherry picking opportunities that fit our risk return portfolio.” The balance sheet strength will come in handy to scale up through acquisitions.

“There is consolidation across the financial services spectrum starting with banks and NBFCs. This positions us well to capitalise on growth in general as well as to be prepared for any opportunities in any of the sectors in which we operate,” Srinivasan said. “We have been scouting for targets and will continue to do so. Scale liquidity on our balance sheet will give us that extra edge to grow market share when several of our peers are calibrating or shrinking their businesses.”"

Kailash Chandra Jhanwar, currently the deputy managing director and chief manufacturing officer at UltraTech will be assuming the role of the company's MD after Maheshwari steps down.

Himanshu Kapania, former managing director of Idea Cellular was appointed as the non-executive vice chairman of Grasim earlier this year after Idea merged with rival Vodafone last year. Another long standing senior director Debu Bhattacharya, who was the group's flagship Hindalco's former MD was also made the company's vice chairman in 2016. He is also vice chairman of the company's wholly owned US subsidiary Novelis apart from serving as the chairman of the Business Review Council that reviews business strategy and other key aspects of group companies like annual budget and capex proposals. 

Maheshwari has been serving as the MD of the Aditya Birla Group's cement arm since 2016 but has been associated with the group for over 35 years leading many group businesses like global pulp, fiber and textiles, global chemicals business and global international trading. Before taking charge as the MD of UltraTech, he was the managing director at Grasim. He also serves as a director in Aditya Birla Management Corporation, an apex corporate body providing strategic direction and vision to group firms in various functional areas. 

It is under Maheshwari's tenure as MD that UltraTech became the world's third largest cement producer (outside of China) and exceeded the 100 million tonne capacity mark mostly through the acquisitions that it made including the Jaypee cement assets, Binani Cement through the company's bankruptcy law and the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries. 

His tenure ends on December 31 this year. 

KC Jhanwar has also been with the group for 38 years and has held various roles in finance, operations and general management across its cement and chemical businesses."

52,2019-10-31,Grasim,"NEW DELHI: As benchmark equity indices hit fresh all-time highs, stocks of Bajaj group have emerged top wealth creators, with a 33.4 per cent jump in the combined market value so far this year. They beat Ambani, Adani and Tata groups to claim the crown.

Investors made money with both hands in five Bajaj group stocks that rose 17-53 per cent in the first 10 months of 2019. However, six other group stocks fell up to 14-52 per cent in the same period. 

Six Adani group stocks saw a 19.27 per cent rise in the combined market value. All of them have gained so far this year.

In value terms, two of Mukesh Ambani group stocks – Reliance Industries and RIIL – added Rs 2.19 lakh crore to increase combine market-cap to Rs 9.30 lakh crore, up 30 per cent from Rs 7.11 lakh crore at the end of 2018. On Wednesday, RIL became the sixth largest energy firm globally by market cap.

Tata group’s 27 stocks were worth Rs 11.83 lakh crore today, having added Rs 1.34 lakh crore to investor wealth so far this year, representing a 12.77 per cent expansion.

Nine Aditya Birla group stocks saw Rs 33,042 crore wealth erosion. Anil Ambani-led ADAG group also saw Rs 15,000 crore value erosion.

On Thursday, Sensex was just 100 points shy off its record high level of 40,312 while NSE barometer Nifty50 was 150 points away from its record high of 12,103.


Select Bajaj group stocks shine
In the case of Bajaj group, shares of Bajaj Finance have surged 54 per cent this year, followed by a 46 per cent jump in Maharashtra Scooters, 26 per cent rise in Bajaj Finserv, 25 per cent gain in Bajaj Holdings and 17 per cent rise in Bajaj Auto.

Bajaj Auto, in fact, is among a handful of auto stocks that has yielded positive returns globally this year. Both Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have been reporting strong numbers for past few quarters. Bajaj Finance’s Q2 profit grew 63 per cent while that of Finserv 71 per cent.

“Bajaj Finance can definitely give a 10 per cent return, if you are not expecting it to double in four-five years,” said Siddhartha Khemka of MOSL. In the case of Bajaj Finserv, Hemang Jani of Sharekhan said: ""Within insurance, we like Bajaj Finserv because it has both life and general insurance businesses. Besides, compared with some of the other listed entities, it is quoting at a discount of about 16-30 per cent.""

Mukund Engineers, Mukand, Bajaj Consumer Care, Bajaj Hindustan Sugar, Bajaj Electricals and Hercules Hoists are the other of group stocks that are down 14-52 per cent year to date.

Aditya Birla, ADAG stocks drop
Out of the nine listed Aditya Birla group stocks, six eroded Rs 33,000 crore worth of investor wealth this year. Vodafone Idea alone has lost Rs 21,870 crore in value. Hindalco, Grasim Industries and Aditya Birla Money have erased another Rs 20,000 crore. UltraTech Cement added Rs 9,050 crore to the group’s value.

Six ADAG stocks saw 40 per cent erosion in market value. Their combined market value now stands at Rs 22,400 crore compared with Rs 37,880 crore at the end of December 2018. Shares of RNAM have jumped 103 per cent (or by Rs 10,000 crore in value) during the same period. Nippon Life Insurance acquired 75 per cent stake in RNAM from Reliance Capital for around Rs 6,000 crore.

Reliance Capital, RCom, Reliance Home, Reliance Infra and Reliance Power lost 88-95 per cent of their value in 2019 so far.


Adani stocks deliver 19% return
In case of Gautam Adani stocks, except for Adani Ports, all other stocks have performed pretty well. Adani Green surged 113 per cent, followed by Adani Gas (47 per cent), Adani Transmission (32.65 per cent) and Adani Power (30 per cent). Adani Ports rose just 1 per cent for the year.

TCS, Titan, Trent, Voltas and TGBL contributed the bulk of increase in Tata group market-cap, as 17 of the 27 group stocks are down this year. TCS alone added Rs 1.13 lakh crore to the group’s market-cap. Titan added Rs 35,773 crore to its market value. Rest three added a combined Rs 16,720 crore.


RIL a $200 billion company in making
While shares of RIIL have fallen 20 per cent this calendar, those of RIL are up 30.86 per cent. A few brokerages have projected RIL to become a $200-220 billion entity in next 4-5 years.

6,2019-11-05,Grasim,"Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group-owned Grasim Industries and Ultratech Cement have accused Harsh Vardhan Lodha-controlled MP Birla Group of copyright infringement.

In a suit filed in the Bombay High Court, the two companies said MP Birla Group has infringed on their copyright by using the word 'ultra' in its cement brands.

Mumbai-based Ultratech has said that two of Kolkata-based MP Birla Group brands—MP Birla Cement Ultimate Ultra and MP Birla Cement Ultimate Ultra 2—are infringing its trademark by using the word 'ultra'.

""Plaintiffs (Ultratech and Grasim) have filed the present suit to prevent the act of infringement, passing off and unfair trade committed by the defendant by using the impugned mark,"" said the petition, which was reviewed by ET.

Passing off in IPR law means making a false representation that is likely to induce a person to believe that the goods or services are those of another.

Ultratech is seeking relief by restraining the Kolkata-based group from using the mark.

Senior counsel Veerandra Tulzapurkar, who appeared for the Aditya Birla firm, argued that MP Birla Group started using the impugned mark in July 2019.

But senior counsel Ravi Kadam, who is representing MP Birla Group, said the defendant has been using the mark since March 2018 and that it has enough material to substantiate its claim.

“Since the matter is sub judice, Birla Corporation would not like to make any detailed statement on the dispute. However, the company is confident of defending its trademark, MP Birla Cement Ultimate Ultra, against any legal challenge,” said a MP Birla spokesperson in an email response.

An email query to Aditya Birla Group did not elicit any response till the time of filing this report.

Law firm VA Associates is advising Ultratech Cement and Grasim Industries in the dispute while MP Birla Group is being represented by Legasis Partners."
7,2019-11-11,Grasim,"When they start earning, most young people blow away their salaries on eating out, new clothes and expensive gadgets. But Sailaxmi Reddy (see picture) quietly started SIPs in four equity funds and opened a recurring deposit. “I don’t have too many expenses right now and can save a big chunk of my salary,” says the Mumbai-based bank executive. She wants to save aggressively for the next 10 years to fund her entrepreneurial dream.



Sailaxmi Reddy, 22, Bank executive, Mumbai

Nudged by her father Dhananjay Narayan Reddy, Sailaxmi started an SIP of Rs 500 in an equity fund while still in college and has since steadily hiked the investment amount. She now invests Rs 15,000 a month—more than 50% of her net take home salary. She is saving to fund her entrepreneurial dream.

In another part of the city, law student Aditi Joshi is reviewing her stocks portfolio. Bluechips such as Infosys, Reliance and Grasim are stable, but others like Parag Milkfoods, Marico and Himadri Chemicals are facing rough weather. “As a long-term investor, I don’t need to worry. But some changes may be needed,” she says. Joshi started with fixed deposits but soon realised that they weren’t for young investors like her. “I read up about technical analysis and learnt about equity research through various blogs and Youtube videos,” says the 20-year old.

In Bengaluru, commerce student Manav Agarwal is getting ready to invest in mutual funds. He read up several books on personal finance when he was bedridden for 2-3 weeks after a road accident earlier this year and now has a good understanding of mutual funds. This 19-year-old wants to start SIPs in an equity fund out of the money he saves from his monthly allowance.

Youngsters like Reddy, Joshi and Agarwal have a headstart in their investing journey. While most people their age are searching for new ways to spend money, these young investors have already started creating wealth. Much of the credit for this goes to their parents and teachers. Reddy was nudged by her father, Dhananjay Narayan Reddy (see picture), to start saving early. “He read a lot of newspapers and gave me clippings of articles on financial planning and investing strategies. He made me start an SIP of Rs 500 in an equity fund while I was in college,” she says.


 Aditi Joshi 20, Law student, Mumbai

Aditi developed an interest in finance and investing after reading Sudha Murty’s 'How I taught my grandmother to read'. She learnt about technical analysis and other investing concepts through blogs, YouTube videos and financial portals. Her quest for learning was inspired by her mother, a maths teacher.
Joshi’s foray into investing was inspired by her mother, Devyani Joshi, who teaches maths to school students. Agarwal didn’t get any investing lesson at home but was encouraged to delve into the financial and capital markets by his professors and seniors in college. “My parents didn’t dissuade me from investing but wanted me to learn about it before I dived in,” he says.



Yogesh Tungaria 22, CA Article, Mumbai
Yogesh learnt about investing and finance while doing his chartered accountancy course. He is not in the tax net yet but invests Rs 3,000 in an ELSS fund every month. He says the lock-in will force him to remain invested through thick and thin, and thereby control the urge to quit early.

9 money management skills kids should learn: How does your child score?


Early bird advantage
Not everyone is as lucky, though. An early start certainly gives a big advantage to an investor but a large majority of Indians is denied that benefit. Financial literacy is not taught in schools and colleges and families don’t discuss money matters with children. As a result, millions of Indians start working (and investing) without basic knowledge of personal finance. “You won’t allow your child to drive before she learns driving. So, why do you let her invest without basic money skills?,” asks Deepti Goel, Associate Partner, Alpha Capital.

In some households, discussing money matters with children is considered a taboo. “There is hesitation to broach the topic of finance with children. It is considered a taboo and seldom gets discussed,” says Suresh Sadagopan, Founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories. This is surprising because the lessons learnt at an early age guide the person throughout his life. “What you teach your children about managing money will have far reaching impact on their financial lives,” says Amol Joshi, Founder, Plan Rupee.

The problem is that parents themselves are not the best source of investment advice or money management. Given the low level of financial literacy in India, their advice is often wrong, misleading or both. For one, they may not be aware of the market situation or have adequate knowledge of financial instruments available. They could also be prejudiced by their personal experience.



Manav Agarwal 19, Commerce student, Bengaluru Manav was encouraged to learn about investing and markets by his professors. He read up books on personal fi nance when he was bedridden for weeks after an accident earlier this year. He understands mutual funds and wants to start SIPs in an equity fund out of the money he saves from his allowance.


Poor knowledge = Bad advice
Young investors are at greatest risk. According to a study by Hyderabad-based financial planning portal ArthaYantra. com, nearly two out of every three professionals aged 21-25 years base their financial decisions on their parents’ advice. Traditional life insurance policies are an all-time favourite investment choice. It’s common for people to buy an endowment or money-back policy for their child as a gift. They pay the premiums for the initial years and shift the onus to the child when he starts earning.

They might think they are giving their child a great gift, whereas they are actually saddling him with a suboptimal investment for the next 15-20 years. “Parents often push youngsters to start saving. But if children are pushed to invest in life insurance policies and PPF, it may lead to suboptimal outcomes,” says Vipin Khandelwal, Founder, Unovest.

To some extent, the older generation can’t be blamed for forcing poor investment choices on children. They have lived through stock market scams and mutual fund collapses. Life insurance policies, bank deposits and small savings schemes came across as the best ways to save money. They want their children to also invest in the instruments that helped them create wealth in the past.

Investment choices apart, parents need to lead by example. They can’t be splurging themselves and expecting their kids to be prudent with money. Missing EMIs and reckless borrowing can send the wrong message to young, impressionable minds.

“If parents are unable to delay their own gratification and rely on EMI-based financing, they won’t be in a position to advise youngsters on the virtues of patience and long-term investing” says Jayant Pai, Head - Products, PPFAS Mutual Fund.


Baby steps in financial world
Parents also need to handhold their children through the maze of the financial services industry. Introduce your child to plastic money by opening a bank account and giving him a debit card. Children learn to manage budgets better and understand the value of money more effectively if they are in charge. They might make a few mistakes initially and even blow the entire month’s outlay on one party with friends. But only when they are forced to spend the rest of the month in utter frugality will they realise that money is not an unlimited resource. “It’s better they learn the basics of budgeting when they are in college and the amounts are small, rather than later when overspending can lead to more serious problems,” points out Raj Khosla, Managing Director, MyMoneyMantra.

Depending on the individual’s requirement, the parent can transfer money to the child’s account and set transaction restrictions and daily spending limits on a debit card. A parent can even provide an add-on credit card and set appropriate limits on spends. The use of plastic money helps familiarise young adults with how the financial world operates. It is equally important to teach the child about the potential risks posed by fraudsters.


Can money talk backfire?
While it may seem a good idea to teach money skills to young children, some people think that this could distort the value system of the child. He may start equating money with virtue and lack of wealth as undesirable. “It’s a genuine concern which led our elders to insulate children from money talk,” says Rohit Shah, Founder & CEO of Getting You Rich. “But times have changed and children are now smarter and understand things better. If kids are taught about money matters, they learn the value of money,” he says.

Other experts agree that money talk should not be a taboo. “No personal finance book exhorts you to earn wealth at any cost. The urge to earn wealth needs to be managed, through (perhaps) a supplementary course on ethics,” says Pai. “A correct understanding of money will never distort the value system. After all, we all agree that sex education is required in school and don’t question whether it will corrupt the value system,” says Sadagopan."

Anand Rathi Financial Services in a November 6 report said: “With strong operating cash flows, continuous capacity expansions across businesses and a healthy balance sheet, we continue to remain positive on ITC over medium to longer term perspective. We maintain a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 352 per share.”

The fund house added 2.50 to 95 lakh additional shares of these companies last month.

SBI, the country’s biggest lender by assets, reported a nearly six-fold rise in Q2 profit at Rs 3,375.40 crore, supported by a partial stake sale in life insurance venture.

HDFC Securities earlier in November gave a ‘buy’ call to SBI with a target price of Rs 312.

HDFC AMC also added shares of infra players IRB Infra (18 lakh shares), Larsen and Toubro (11 lakh shares), Dilip Buildcon (6.51 lakh shares) and PNC Infratech (3.89 lakh shares). Besides, it further bought Sun Pharma (23 lakh shares), Grasim Industries (21 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (20 lakh shares), GAIL (19 lakh shares), Indian Hotels (19 lakh shares), Delta Corp (17 lakh shares), Kirloskar Ferrous (16 lakh shares) and Mishra Dhatu Nigam (16 lakh shares).

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore. The company had posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore in the same period last financial year.

From among large cap firms, the fund house added nearly 6 lakh shares of the InusInd Bank and 3.87 lakh shares of Bajaj Electricals. Financial firms including HDFC, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank also drew some interest of the AMC.

It further increased its exposure in Bajaj Finance, UltraTech Cement, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Dr Reddy’s Labs, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, M&M, Titan, HCL Technology and Adani Ports.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced 3.78 per cent, or 1,461 points to 40,129 in October amid robust inflows by foreign institutional investors during the month. On the other hand, BSE Midcap and Smallcap index gained 5.39 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month included over 1 crore shares each in Infosys, ICICI Bank, and BHEL.

It also sold over 10 lakh shares each in Edelweiss Financial, Reliance Industries, SAIL, Ashok Leyland, Adani Power, HPCL, BPCL and Vedanta during the month gone by, according to data available with Ace Mutual Fund.

Commenting on general market trend, Kashyap Pujara, head of research at Axis Capital in an interaction with ETNow said, “What we are seeing as a trend is that not only have midcap valuations have become extremely supportive but also we have seen participation of institutions on midcaps go down by 600 bps. It is going to be a U-shaped recovery for the midcaps. They tend to do well when GDP growth surprises and we will see GDP recovery going forward. As the recovery gets a bit broad-based, we will definitely see midcaps outperforming the largecaps over the next two to three years.”"

15,2019-11-13,Grasim,"By Andy Mukherjee
For Kumar Mangalam Birla’s textile-to-telecom empire, adversity is a 100-year-old companion. In 1919, when the Indian businessman’s great-grandfather wanted to start a jute mill, the dominant British firm, Andrew Yule & Co., bought all the surrounding Calcutta land. The Imperial Bank, the forerunner of today’s State Bank of India, initially refused Birla a loan.

The government of post-independence India stymied the Birla conglomerate with kindness. Soviet-style planning and state socialism protected the family’s legacy licensed firms by keeping competition out. But they inhibited growth. Birla’s father, Aditya Vikram, went to Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines because he wasn’t allowed to expand at home. “I for one fail to see where the concentration of economic power is: with the big business houses or with the government?” he wondered in 1979.

Fast forward 40 years, and the 52-year-old current chairman of the group would be justified to reprise his late father’s frustration. The liberalizing spirit of the 1990s Indian economy has lost much of its force. After dismantling the license raj, a system of strict government-controlled production, and encouraging capitalism, New Delhi is gripped once more by a feverish statism that’s making Birla’s shareholders nervous. The slide began before Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, and was one of the reasons why businesses backed his call for “minimum government, maximum governance.” But five years later, relations between private enterprise and the government have turned even testier.


Bloomberg
Take telecommunications, the main source of investors’ anxiety.

Ever since India opened up the state-run sector in the 1990s, the Aditya Birla Group has been an anchor investor. Partners and rivals like AT&T Inc., India’s Tata Group, and Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. came and went, but Birla remained. Currently, the group owns 26% of the country’s largest mobile operator by subscribers, Vodafone Idea Ltd., with the British partner controlling 45%. An Indian court last month directed this bruised survivor of a nasty price war to pay Rs 28,000 crore ($4 billion) in past government fees, interest and penalties. Overall, India wants to gouge its shriveled telecom industry of $13 billion. The fund-starved government expects operators to cough up more at 5G auctions next year. How long can the Birla boss hang in? With Vodafone Idea saddled with losses and $14 billion in net debt, should he even bother?

It’s doubtful whether partner Vodafone Group Plc will linger. This isn’t the first time it has been clobbered by unreasonable government demands. In 2012, India retrospectively changed its tax law to pursue a $2.2 billion withholding tax notice against the U.K. firm. Seven years later, that dispute is far from resolved, and the unit has now been slapped with a new bill.


Bloomberg
In its half-yearly earnings reported Tuesday in London, Vodafone fully wrote down the book value of its India operations, and warned that the unit could be headed for liquidation. Vodafone’s 42% stake in a separate cellular tower company in the country, once sold, will get used largely to pay off the loan it took to pump capital into the main telecom venture. After that, the U.K. firm will have a little over $1 billion left to support Vodafone Idea, according to India Ratings & Research, a unit of Fitch Ratings. However, the India business would be required to find $5.5 billion just for interest- and spectrum-related payments until March 2022.


Will Birla step into the breach?
Out of the Indian group’s 26% in Vodafone Idea, about 11.6% is held by Grasim Industries Ltd., and another 2.6% is owned by Hindalco Industries Ltd. Hindalco, among the world’s largest aluminum makers, is battling weak metals demand and a complicated takeover of the U.S.-based Aleris Corp. The bulk of the burden of a telecom rescue — should there be one — would fall on Grasim. It acts as a holding company for Birla’s cement and financial services businesses, apart from directly owning factories that churn out wood-based fiber and chemicals like caustic soda used in soap and detergent.

Mumbai-based Emkay Global Financial Services says that in the worst-case scenario, where the government doesn’t back down and Birla refuses to fold his telecom cards, a rescue mounted by by Grasim could cost it 187 rupees per share. If Birla refrains from throwing good money after bad, the value of everything else Grasim owns net of debt is 1,126 rupees a share, or 47% more than the current stock market price. Clearly, the overhang of the Vodafone uncertainty is playing on investor psyche. Once the U.S.-China trade war stops making global textile markets jittery, fiber prices will firm. Grasim, in investors’ view, is better off spending $2 billion on new capacities in fiber, chemicals and cement than wasting any more money trying to salvage the telecom. 

The Indian government should see the folly of effectively turning the telecom industry into a two-horse race between Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., controlled by Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian, and Bharti Airtel Ltd., which, too, is staggering under a mountain of debt. As IIFL Securities put it, bankruptcy of Vodafone Idea would hurt all stakeholders. Vodafone and Birla would lose control, the government would forgo $1.7 billion in annual spectrum revenue and banks would take losses on their $4 billion-plus exposure.


Bloomberg
Such an outcome would cast a serious doubt on the ability of private entrepreneurs to flourish, especially if they — like Birla or Amazon.com Inc. boss Jeff Bezos — happen to find themselves in competition with Ambani in a tightly regulated industry. Future investors will think twice. The rift between the government and business wasn’t Modi’s creation, but to allow the mistrust to turn into a chasm would be one of his administration’s gravest mistakes."

21,2019-11-14,Grasim,"New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group's flagship firm Grasim Industries on Thursday posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,472.77 crore for the July-September period helped by good performance of its subsidiaries UltraTech Cement and Aditya Birla Capital.

Grasim Industries had reported a net loss of Rs 1,319.79 crore in the September quarter a year ago, Grasim Industries said in a BSE filing.

Its revenue from operation was at Rs 18,430.27 crore, up 3 per cent, during the quarter under review as against Rs 17,892.42 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

""Consolidated EBITDA at Rs 3,180 crore recorded a growth of 7 per cent Y-o-Y and PAT (before exceptional items and one-time deferred tax benefit) was up by 6 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 639 crore driven by superior performance of the company's subsidiaries, UltraTech Cement Limited and Aditya Birla Capital Limited.

Grasim Industries' total expenses were at Rs 17,069.81 crore during the period as against Rs 16,541.52 crore, up 3.19 per cent.

Its revenue from Viscose segment was at Rs 2,431.42 crore, down 6.67 per cent, to Rs 2,605.36 crore of Q2/FY 2018-19.

""The weakness in the domestic VSF realisations impacted this quarter's profitability. The benefit of falling input costs like pulp prices will get reflected in the coming quarters due to inventory time lag,"" said Grasim Industries.

While, its cement business UltraTech' revenue was at Rs 9,620.47 crore, up 4.01 per cent, as against Rs 9,249.26 crore.

""UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century Textiles and Industries cement business... With this acquisition, UltraTech's cement manufacturing capacity stands augmented to 117.4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), including its overseas capacity. This makes UltraTech the 3rd largest cement company in the world, outside of China,"" the company said.

Revenue from Chemicals during the quarter was at Rs 1,347.30 crore, down 16.44 per cent, as against Rs 1,612.38 crore.

""Softening of Caustic Soda prices globally has led to decline in the domestic prices, resulting in lower profitability on YoY basis,"" said Grasim.

While its Financial Services segment revenue reported a 12.72 per cent increase at Rs 3,960.86 crore during the period from Rs 3,513.59 crore a year ago.

Revenue from others segment was at Rs 1,305.60 crore, up 13.32 per cent, as against Rs 1,152.10 crore.

On the outlook, Grasim said its VSF business will continue to focus on expanding the market in India and its chemical business is under an expansion mode for both chlor-alkali and specialty chemicals.

On UltraTech, it said: ""The company with its presence across the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand, despite the anomalies that may get created in demand patterns in some parts of the country due to extraneous reasons.""

26,2019-11-18,Grasim,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 3 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• CLSA has retained buy rating on 
Lemon Tree Hotels with a target price of Rs 80. With the launch of the Kolkata and Udaipur property in the second quarter of FY20, the execution risk for Lemon Tree is now largely behind, said CLSA. Lemon Tree completed the acquisition of ‘Keys’ on November 1 and would be consolidated from third quarter onwards, said CLSA. Shares of Lemon Tree ended down 2 per cent at Rs 59.35 on Friday.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating on 
Jindal Steel and Power with a target price of Rs 139. High leverage ratios and losses in international operations were a drag on Jindal Steel stock, said Morgan Stanley. Any initiative that turns around the international operations and helps in monetizing these assets would help in improving its net debt position, said morgan Stanley. The company has also signed an agreement to sell its Botswana assets, which if executed, could further help improve the net debt situation, the brokerage said. Shares of Jindal Steel ended up 2.79 per cent at Rs 143.65 on Friday.


• Citigroup Global Markets has maintained buy rating on 
Varroc Engineering and revised target price to Rs 630 from Rs 750. The company reported a much weaker VLS eprformance than expected, said Citi. Ramp up in the new plants (a little prolonged than earlier expected) should aid revenue growth, said Citi. As dependence on Tesla comes down (as per cent of total VLS business), the company would likely see a steadier revenue and margin trajectory, the brokerage said. Shares of Varroc Engineering ended down 0.25 per cent at Rs 447 on Friday.

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on 
Grasim Industries and lowered target price to Rs 780 from Rs 790. The brokerage said sharp fall in VSF and caustic soda prices hurt second quarter results with standalone Ebitda declining 38 per cent from year ago. Clarity on fund infusions into Vodafone Idea is the need of the hour and it could remain and overhang, the brokerage said. The brokerage has lowered target price but retained buy rating as steep holding company discount is unjustified. Shares of Grasim Industries ended up 2.8 per cent at Rs 755.25 on Friday.

• Investec Securities has maintained hold rating on 
Thermax and revised target price to Rs 1,095 from Rs 950. The brokerage said Thermax's second quarter results were operationally in line with estimates with Ebitda growing at 18 per cent year-on-year (YoY). The management has indicated new order finalisations continue to get deferred in both domestic and international markets and does not anticipate any large order placement in power/ steel/ fertilizer sectors. The brokerage sees limited positive triggers for the stock in the absence of revival in industrial capex cycle. Shares of Thermax ended down 1.7 per cent at Rs 1,050.50 on Friday."
27,2019-11-18,Grasim,"HSBC has maintained buy rating on Grasim Industries in the long term and lowered target price to Rs 780 from Rs 790. Shares of Grasim Industries ended up 2.8% at Rs 755.25 on Friday while BSE Sensex closed 70.21 points up at 40,356.69.

35,2019-11-22,Grasim,"By PR Sanjai

The financial distress at Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture has dragged down the wealth of Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose group is the second-largest investor in the teetering wireless carrier.

The tycoon, who joined forces with the British operator last year, has lost about a third of his fortune since the end of 2017 as mounting losses and debt decimated the equity of the troubled Vodafone Idea Ltd. In addition, shares of his flagship firms that produce chemicals, metals and cement have also tumbled amid a demand slump, eroding his wealth.

The net worth of Birla has shrunk to about $6 billion from $9.1 billion two years ago, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A majority of his fortune is derived from his ownership of Aditya Birla Group, a conglomerate that controls his main holdings.

Birla is the latest mogul to burn his fingers in India’s cutthroat phone-services market since Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. entered the fray in 2016 and drove two rivals to bankruptcy. Formed by the merger of Vodafone’s local unit and Birla’s cellular operator, Vodafone Idea last week reported the worst loss in the nation’s corporate history, while the British partner flagged the risk of a collapse.


Bloomberg
Aditya Birla Group has a stake in Hindalco Industries Ltd., the world’s largest aluminum rolling company, and owns a part of Grasim Industries Ltd., which controls India’s biggest cement maker.

For the Aditya Birla Group, the hit on the telecommunications business couldn’t have come at a worse time. Cooling global growth amid a trade war between the U.S. and China, as well as an economic slowdown at home has curbed demand for industrial raw materials the group produces.

Vodafone Idea’s woes deepened last month after India’s top court sided with the government’s demand for $4 billion in fee-arrears from prior years. Already burdened by $14 billion of debt, the order came as a blow to its finances weakened by a brutal war with Jio. Ambani’s operator this year became the country’s No. 1 carrier with 380 million users by offering free calls and cheap data.

Shares of Vodafone Idea have plunged 90% since end-2017, shrinking its market value to $2.7 billion.

“Vodafone and Idea have been going through a complex merger and, at the same time, trying to keep their heads above water in the battle with Reliance Jio,” said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, a professor of business strategy at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore. “The Supreme Court judgment came at the most inopportune time.”

Hindalco, which makes aluminum and copper, reported a 33% drop in profit for the latest quarter as the prices of both the metals slid in the three months through September. Shares of Hindalco have tumbled 31% since end-2017, cutting its market value to $5.9 billion. The S&P BSE Sensex has gained 19% in the same period.

The slowdown in India’s $2.7 trillion economy has cooled demand for commodities such as cement to chemicals and textiles manufactured by Grasim. Its stock has dropped 33% since end-2017.

Vodafone Idea’s troubles have also weighed on Grasim, which owns about 12% of the carrier.

This week brought some signs of relief to Vodafone Idea shareholders. Its shares have more than doubled in the four days through Nov. 20 as the three rivals -- including Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd. -- signaled an end to the price war. Bharti reported a record quarterly loss last week as well.

On Wednesday, the government deferred airwave payments for two years, providing some relief for the industry roiled by high license fees and spectrum costs. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said she wants all companies to flourish and none to fail.

“The tariff hikes are positive,” Jefferies analysts led by Piyush Nahar said in a note this week. Despite the positive move, relief from the government remains crucial, especially for Vodafone Idea, they wrote."
36,2019-11-22,Grasim,"I am expecting a revival in FMCG and pharma sectors in the coming quarters. In case of big ticket items like steel industry, fertiliser industry, power industry, I am not expecting it to happen in the immediate future, says MS Unnikrishnan, MD & CEO, Thermax. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The improvement in the chemical segment lead to better margins but do you think it can be sustained at these levels?Margins that we clocked in the current quarter will certainly be sustained and possibly improved going forward, though not substantially.


You have secured orders worth about Rs 1,700 crore in Q2. Inflows were driven by domestic orders largely. What are some of the key wins and what else is in the pipeline?In the domestic market, the largest order in the quarter was for a flue gas desulphurisation system for air pollution control from a power plant. It was worth around Rs 470 crore. We have had orders from different sectors within the country. There was also a booking from cement industry of a wastage recovery-based captive power plant; a fairly large order was from one of the cement companies in the southern part of India. We have had orders coming from dairy, food processing, varied consumer-oriented industry but larger projects were limited to the flue gas desulphurisation and the captive power plant.


What is the outlook in the energy segment? What about the execution of RCF, Grasim and the JSW orders?That would be the Dangote order from Nigeria. The last part will be revenue recognised in the current quarter. JSW will continue to be recognised in the next two quarters also. We have got National Fertiliser, Gujarat Alkalis… in total Rs 5,300 crore worth of orders available on hand and a good part of them are to be revenue recognised in the next 12 months. So, a good deal of execution will go through in the next two quarters also.


Analysts believe that it is crucial for the company to see a full-fledged revival in the private capex cycle and a pickup in export order finalisation. What is the situation on ground? What more does the government need to do?I do not think anything further can be done by the government. What has gone wrong so far in the Indian market could be out of the rural distress. Fundamentally, the cash in the hands of the consumer has come down and not much positive enthusiasm is being shown by the consumer. Once the consumption comes down, the capacity utilisation of the industry will also come down. Once the capacity utilisation comes down, nobody will want to create new capacities. Only when you create any capacity, do capital goods companies like Thermax get benefitted. 

The government has done a lot in the last three to four months. A slew of changes have been brought in terms of the tax rate being reduced, interest rates coming down, but none of that seems to be picking up the consumption pattern in the country.

There was a slight improvement in the order in October. Unless positive sentiments prevail in the market for not less than 6-7 months, you would not see consumption going back to the original levels that prevailed in the pre 5-5.5% GDP growth era of 8-9-10% growth when everybody consumed everything. 

In order to create capacities, one has to wait for some more time. I do not blame the government for it, the government has done a lot of things but that alone cannot make the entire consumer sentiment change in the country. And possibly the government can go ahead with a lot of mega projects which they have announced that they will be having $1 trillion worth of projects will be taken up by the government in the current five-year period of time but that remain there on the announcement level. Further working it out in detail as to whether there may be a new 100 railway stations, another 100 airports to be created, bullet train not only for one segment, multiple areas to be introduced, ports be built and rural electrification, rural roads, water supply system, I mean, a slew of things are already known to the government to be started but that cannot be remaining at the announcement level. It has to go down to the level of tendering, placement of orders and once that is done, there will be a demand pickup but that will take some time. 


I am expecting that the international markets will also start improving going forward, but one has to give time for it.-MS Unnikrishnan

Your export order inflow has suffered from lack of order finalisation. Given the pickup in the export market, it is fairly vital for the next leg of growth for the company. Can you share with us some sort of an outlook here?The inquiry levels are fairly good in the international market. The only thing is the order finalisation in the market that we operate in, i.e. Middle East, South East Asia, South America and Africa -- these markets also are slowing down. I do not see a recovery in that market happening at a faster pace. Possibly it will follow the same pattern as India. One has got to be content with the selective orders which going to get concluded and where we need to be very aggressive in pricing. That is something which we are already doing to ensure our costs are under control and our execution is at the peak in terms of capabilities. A combination of both should be helping us to a certain extent. 

But the main challenge that I am worried about going forward is the trade war between China and America which is almost at peak level and they are unable to settle it out at this point of time. There are capacities idling in China and they do not mind picking up an order at any kind of price from anywhere in the world. So the Chinese competition in the global market is not for Thermax alone. It is going to hot up for the entire Indian industry or even European companies. In that kind of a scenario, picking orders is not a problem, but maintaining margins could be difficult. One has to be a lot more careful. I am expecting that the international markets will also start improving going forward, but one has to give time for it.


You have also mentioned that there have been inquiries across sectors but the conclusion remains challenging and that you even may end FY20 with a flattish order inflow growth. So, where do you see your overall order book?I am expecting a conclusion of orders for the Barmer refinery and the Gujarat refinery and the Panipat refinery going forward. I expect the refinery sector to be opening up. I would see a lot more of consumer-oriented industries in anticipation of the consumption improvement in the 21-22 years. We will start finalising orders going forward because whatever said and done, after placement of an order for a factory to get constructed even in the food sector or FMCG sector, would take not less than 16 to 18 month from commission of the factory. If somebody were to create capacity for FY21-FY22, they have to place orders immediately and things are going to be reversing in India. 

I am expecting that there will be a revival in the FMCG sector, pharma sector, and I am looking forward to all of them picking up in the coming quarters but for the big ticket items like steel industry, fertiliser industry, power industry, I am not expecting it to happen in the immediate future.

Please remember, in the consumer-oriented sector, the sizes of the projects are not so large. You would find that the entire ticket size may be less than Rs 1,000 crore and orders for companies like mine will be limited to maybe Rs 2 crore, Rs 5 crore or Rs 10 crore. But when you talk about a steel industry, a single order could be as high as Rs 500 crore. Those kind of projects will take some more time to happen.


Danstroker made an operational profit in Q2 marking a turnaround but reported a PAT loss due to one off payments so can we see a profits in the second half what is the update there?Second half will be profitable but after absorbing the loss of the first half there will be break even plus is my expectation but going forward with the kind of improvement that we have been able to bring into the operational efficiency the company will be profitable next year certainly."

6,2019-12-03,Grasim,"Key benchmark indices such as the Nifty50 and the Sensex have gained 10-13% in the last one year. After this gain, a key question that investors face is, how does one recalibrate one’s portfolio?

One of the ways to deal with this situation is to construct a portfolio of stocks which offers stability and some scope for appreciation. This can be achieved by adding schemes which have a combination of large-and-mid-sized companies. Because even though large-sized companies may trading at high valuations, they still offer a margin of safety while mid-sized companies hold the promise of appreciation.

Among such schemes, Canara Robeco Emerging Equities is a good option. The scheme has invested close to 51% of its money in bluechip and large-sized companies. Besides, close to 44% of the scheme’s money is in mid-sized companies, followed by about 4.5% in small-sized companies.

This structure offers a higher scope for investment ideas since it provides access to companies beyond the top 100. The scheme’s fund managers Miyush Gandhi and Shridatta Bhandhwaldar have made the most of this structure by performing well in almost all market cycles.

In the past three-year, five-year and ten-year periods, the scheme has given returns of 13%, 12% and 19% returns while its peers have given average returns of 10.6%, 8.5% and 11.54% returns in the same periods respectively.

7,2019-12-03,Grasim,"Despite the ongoing economic slowdown, some 20 firms in the BSE500 index reported a turnaround performance in September quarter on a year-on-year basis. Plus, 17 of them posted up to 51 per cent YoY rise in net sales for the quarter.

These stocks mostly come from sectors like power, hotels, banking, hospital, NBFC, engineering, pharma and cement.

Adani Green Energy, whose share price has rallied 175 per cent in last one year, posted a net profit of Rs 100 crore for Q2 of FY20 against a net loss of Rs 188 crore reported for the same period last year. Net sales advanced 51 per cent YoY to Rs 675 crore during the quarter.

The company got listed in 2018. Adani Enterprises had announced demerger of its renewable energy business into associate company Adani Green Energy as part of efforts to simplify the overall business structure.

JK Lakshmi Cement and The India Cements also managed to report profits for the quarter after clocking losses in the same period last year. While the former posted a net profit of Rs 48.70 crore against a Rs 4.80 crore loss year on year, the latter reported Rs 5.7 crore profit against Rs 4.50 crore loss for the same period.

The company’s efforts to reduce logistics cost, optimising the product mix and improved efficiency parameters enabled it to boost profitability, JK Lakshmi Cement said, adding that softening fuel prices also helped.

Ashika Stock Broking has a ‘buy’ rating to JK Lakshmi Cement with a price target of Rs 407.

“The management expects demand recovery in the second half of FY20. However, the price would remain the same in key markets. Further, the company is likely to announce brownfield expansion with around $85-90 per tonne capex within 6-9 months to cater to the growing demand. We expect JKLC to generate Rs 300 crore and Rs 360 crore fresh cash flows for FY20 and FY21, respectively, with minimal capex,” the brokerage said.

Shares of JK Lakshmi have gained 7.61 per cent since November 28 last year, while those of India Cements are down 11 per cent. Reliance Securities has a ‘hold’ rating on India Cements with a price target of Rs 90.

“We continue to believe strong cash generation and debt reduction would be the key catalysts for the stock until the stock gets re-rated,” Reliance Securities said.

In the banking space, state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) reported Rs 507 crore profit for the second quarter ended September 30, 2019. It had posted Rs 4,532 crore loss for the corresponding quarter last year.

Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘sell’ rating on PNB with a price target of Rs 45 despite a turnaround in Q2. The scrip traded at Rs 65 on November 29.

“We expect the bank’s return ratios to remain subdued for a prolonged period given the continued weakness in asset quality,” the brokerage said in a report.

Bank of India, United Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India and Andhra Bank are among other players in the banking space whose bottom lines came into the green on a YoY basis.

“Within the PSU banks, our favourite has only been the top name. We do not recommend any other stock apart from the top PSU name,” said Gautam Shah, Founder and Chief Strategist, Goldilocks Premium Research.

“Besides PSU lenders, the entire PSU basket itself is making a comeback after almost 10 years of underperformance,” he told ETNow.

9,2019-12-09,Grasim,"MUMBAI: The Aditya Birla Group will not be denied bank funds or be barred from bidding for insolvent companies if Vodafone Idea were to default and enter bankruptcy proceedings as there were no corporate or promoter guarantees issued by the conglomerate to the telecom firm, say bankers.

When a company faces insolvency proceedings, promoters are unable to raise funds for other businesses, and also they are not eligible to bid for any bankrupt business under Section 29A of the Bankruptcy Act. With effect from December 1, guarantors to any insolvent business too face bankruptcy proceedings.

Of Aditya Birla Group companies, Grasim Industries has the largest stake of 11.6%, followed by Hindalco Industries (2.6%) in the telecom firm, which is not generating enough money to meet its liabilities. Overall, the Birla Group has a 18.5% stake, while Vodafone Group holds 53.6% in the company.

Given Vodafone Idea’s shareholding pattern, an insolvency proceeding against the company would not bar most Aditya Birla Group companies from being a bidder for other companies under the insolvency process.

Last week, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said Vodafone Idea will have to shut shop in the absence of government relief after last month’s Supreme Court directive requiring the telecom giant to pay dues of Rs 40,000 crore in 90 days.




“It is true we will shut shop if we don’t get relief... because there is no company in the world that can pay that kind of fine in three months; it just doesn’t work like that,” Birla had said at an HT event. The chief of Vodafone’s UK parent, too, had voiced a similar feeling. Nick Read, Vodafone’s global CEO, had said that the joint venture may have to be liquidated, citing unsupportive legislation and excessive taxes. Vodafone Idea had reported the country’s highest loss of Rs 50,921 crore for the quarter ended September after the Supreme Court order. The company has a debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore.

Emkay Finance, in a research report last month, said that Grasim was under no obligation to bail out Vodafone. “According to our calculations, in the worst-case scenario, the impact (of Vodafone Idea) on Grasim’s stock price would be Rs 187 per share,” the report said.

According to a note by Edelweiss research, banks have approached Vodafone Idea for the payment of the outstanding debt due to covenant breach, but the company has declined it for now. There is no acceleration in the payment of bank debt yet. Since then, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have filed a review petition in the Supreme Court.

Lenders say that they have not yet taken a call on the action they will take should their guarantees on behalf of Vodafone to the government get invoked and they crystallise into debt. If lenders deny further funds, the likelihood of insolvency proceedings is high."
