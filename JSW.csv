0,2018-01-01,JSW,"MUMBAI: Bank of Baroda last week failed to sell bad loans amounting to Rs 2,300 crore due from Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel as the reserve price was above market rates and only overseas investors and private equity funds were allowed to bid, said two senior bank executives.

“As many as 22 foreign and private investors had shown interest in the loan but did not seal the deal,’’ said one of them. “This only shows that the reserve price is unrealistic.”

The Reserve Bank of India has instructed banks to set aside 50 per cent of the loan value as provisions for cases in which insolvency proceedings have begun at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel are among the 12 defaulting companies that RBI directed banks in June to refer to NCLT for resolution.

Of the assets, the Bhushan Steel dues amounted to Rs 1,300 crore loan while those of Essar Steel were Rs 1,000 crore. The bank had set the reserve price at 50 per cent in cash for Bhushan Steel and 60 per cent in cash for Essar Steel.

Bank of Baroda did not reply to queries. A Bank of Baroda executive who did not want to be named said the auction didn’t succeed because funds could not get clearance from overseas parents due to the Christmas and New Year holiday break. The assets could be put up for sale again soon, the person said.

While the reserve prices may appear close to other recent transactions, there’s a difference in that they involve only a part payment being made immediately. This has been the case in deals involving asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), which are looking to pick up assets during the ongoing insolvency process.

ARCs weren’t invited to bid in the Bank of Baroda bad debt auction held last week.

In June, ICICI Bank sold Rs 2,000 crore of loan assets to Edelweiss ARC at a 45 per cent discount in a deal based on the so-called 15:85 structure. The bank gets 15 per cent as immediate payment and the remaining 85 per cent is in the form of security receipts issued by the ARC that’s paid over five to seven years.

Indian Overseas Bank last week sold a Rs 620 crore loan granted to Bhushan Steel to SSG Capital at Rs 376 crore, indicating a haircut of 40 per cent. This deal too was based on the 15:85 structure. “If a deal is under 15:85 structure, the bank is justified in expecting about 40-45 per cent haircut. But if it’s a cash deal, the haircut is much more,” said a bidder from a private equity fund.

For instance, if the Aion Capital-JSW Steel bid for Monnet Ispat is approved by lenders, the haircut could be as high as 75 per cent since it would be an all-cash deal, said one of the persons cited above."
2,2018-01-02,JSW,"KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Steel companies hoping to post strong numbers in the January-March quarter riding on a strong demand pickup have come in for a rude shock. A day into the new year, they were faced with a steep jump in input costs, thanks to a 20-22% hike in iron ore prices announced by state-run miner NMDC.

Large companies like JSW Steel and Essar Steel which do not have captive iron ore mines and a host of other medium and small firms which rely on NMDC to meet the bulk of their ore supplies will be adversely hit.

After the hike, experts said steel production costs are expected to jump at least Rs 1,100-Rs 1,300 per tonne, a substantial increase by industry standards.

On Tuesday, NMDC announced a Rs 500-increase in price of lump ore to Rs 3,100 per tonne, or up 20%, while fines will now be charged at Rs 2,760 per tonne or 22% higher, excluding royalty, district mineral foundation, NMET, cess, forest permit fee and other taxes.

The last time NMDC revised rates was in November 2017 when price of lump ore and fines were fixed at Rs 2,600 per tonne and Rs 2,260, respectively.

A top executive at a large steel company questioned NMDC’s pricing policy adding that the miner is trying to create a shortage of iron ore in the market by exporting more, despite lower export realisation of nearly Rs 560 per tonne.

“The pricing policy of NMDC is not appropriate and it seems like they slowly want to move towards a system where companies have to import more. With prices of coking coal already shooting up, iron ore is the only advantage India has for steel companies, but that is slowly ceasing to be one,” the official said. This will reinforce the distress in the steel industry that already makes up for 24% of NPAs in Indian banks, he added.

Since small merchant miners typically follow NMDC’s ricing policy, the latest revision will establish an overall upward trend in prices, according to industry watchers.

Experts feel there is a shortage in the domestic iron ore market but is not big enough to justify a sharp price increase. An Investec report said an estimated 15-20 mt of production has been hit by non-payment of penalty, leading to supply shortage in Odisha and local ore prices will stay strong unless the state government steps in to raise the mining cap to ease the shortage."

Now Comes the Electoral Bonds 
Finance minister Arun Jaitley has unveiled the framework for electoral bonds aimed at cleaning up political funding with conditions such as a limited tenure and eligibility restricted to parties with a track record of at least one election. Jaitley had pledged to establish a system for party donations that would help stamp out black money as a source of funding in his February 2017 Budget in the wake of demonetisation. Donors can buy these bonds and give them to the party of their choice. The party can encash them through designated bank accounts within 15 days. Electoral bonds would be issued/purchased for any value in multiples of ₹1,000, ₹10,000, ₹1 lakh, ₹10 lakh and ₹1crore from specified branches of SBI.


New Insolvency Rule
The liquidation value of a company undergoing insolvency proceedings will be kept confidential, a change that seeks to maximise the realisation for creditors.The Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, which funds the sector skill councils through the National Skill Development Corporation, has told them to ensure that their industry partners provide jobs to people who have been trained and that these numbers must be reflected on the smart portal created for the purpose. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has amended the regulations to provide for this confidentiality and has also clearly defined ""dissenting creditor"" to bring more clarity to the insolvency and bankruptcy process. 


Anti-dumping Duty Likely on Chinese Chemical Imports 
India is likely to impose anti- dumping duty of up to USD 397 per tonne on a Chinese chemical used in construction and dyes industry. The move is aimed at guarding domestic players from cheap imports of 'Sulphonated Naphthalene Formaldehyde' from the neighbouring country. Commerce ministry's investigation arm Directorate General of Anti dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) in its final findings has concluded that the product has been exported to India from China below its normal value and it has resulted in dumping. 


Hike in Iron Ore Prices to Raise Cost of Steel 
Steel companies hoping to post strong numbers in the January-March quarter riding on a strong demand pickup have come in for a rude shock. A day into the new year, they were faced with a steep jump in input costs, thanks to a 20-22% hike in iron ore prices announced by state-run miner NMDC.

More Than 5 Lakh Indian Tech Workers May Return to India
India may be looking at more than 500,000 of its ""skilled"" work force returning home from America if a proposal by the Trump administration not to extend H-1B visa of those waiting for permanent residency (Green Card) is implemented. The Department of Homeland Security is said to be considering new regulations that would prevent H-1B visa extensions as part of President Donald Trump's ""Buy American, Hire American"" initiative promised during the 2016 campaign. If an H-1B visa holder has applied for a Green Card at the end of his six-year stay, then he or she will have to exit the United States till the processing is complete. 


I-T Dept to Seek Restoration of Some ‘Struck Off’ Companies 
The income tax department will seek restoration of deregistered companies that have pending income tax liabilities. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has asked assessing officers to request the restoration of companies ""struck off"" so that the government can recover tax dues. ""The Board has decided that request/appeal for restoration of name of the struck off company with retrospective date from the date of being 'struck off"" shall be made by the income tax department,"" it said in a letter. The ministry of corporate affairs deregistered 2.24 lakh companies under section 248 (5) of the Companies Act for not complying with regulatory filings. 


1% GST for Manufacturers under Composition Scheme 
The government has notified lower 1% GST rates for manufacturers who have opted for composition scheme as well as easier norms for traders opting for it. The finance ministry has notified the changes decided by the GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising state counterparts, in November 2017. The notification stipulates that manufacturers who have opted for composition scheme will now have to pay 1% Goods and Services Tax (GST) as against 2% earlier.

7,2018-01-04,JSW,"MUMBAI: Goldman Sachs is bullish on the Indian steel sector as it believes the sector is in the middle of a multi-year upcycle due to higher spreads, rising domestic capacity and improving iron ore supply.

The investment bank has initiated coverage on the sector with a buy rating on JSW Steel and a target price of Rs 315. Goldman has assigned a neutral rating on Tata Steel with target price of Rs 780.

Goldman Sachs’ target price on JSW Steel implies a potential upside of 17.45 per cent from Wednesday’s closing level of Rs 268.20 on the BSE. Tata Steel has a potential upside of 3.67 per cent from Goldman Sachs’ target price. Shares of Tata Steel ended at Rs 733.3 on Wednesday.

The investment bank prefers JSW Steel over Tata Steel due to higher profitability and better valuations.

“In a stable steel price and benign raw material cost environment, we prefer a low cost convertor (JSW Steel) over an integrated steel mill (Tata Steel). On our estimates, JSW Steel screens as attractive among global peers, while Tata Steel looks fairly valued,” said Goldman Sachs in a note dated Tuesday.

Goldman Sachs believes that JSW Steel is set to benefit from weaker global raw material prices and the Rs 26,800 crore capital expenditure announced by the company will help enhance its steel capacity by 5 million tones by the end of financial year 2019-2020.

The investment bank foresees JSW Steel generating strong free cash flow over the next two financial years and its net debt to EBITDA ratio to come down to 2.6 times from 4.2 times in the financial year ended March 2017. Driven by capital expenditure plans and lower operating costs, JSW Steel is likely to generate top quartile return on equity, added Goldman Sachs.

On Tata Steel, the investment bank said the company’s profitability is likely to be partly impacted by narrowing spreads for captive steel mills as global or domestic raw material prices weaken.

Goldman Sachs said it would consider turning constructive on Tata Steel if there is visibility on a timely execution of expansion plan, which would imply faster volume growth and higher profitability trajectory."

9,2018-01-04,JSW,"NEW DELHI: A hike in iron ore prices by state-run NMDC has left steel companies with no choice but to pass on the increased production cost to customers, JSW Steel Chairman Sajjan Jindal has said.

""Recent increase in iron-ore price by state owned NMDC & Orissa pvt. miners is forcing steel companies to pass on increased cost of production,"" Jindal said in a tweet.

On January 2, 2017, the country's largest iron ore miner NMDC increased prices of higher grade iron (lumps) by Rs 500 to Rs 3,100 per tonne for the current month.

The state-run firm also raised the prices for iron ore fines, which is inferior grade ore, by Rs 500 to Rs 2,760 per tonne for January.

The increased cost of other raw materials like coal, refractory, electrodes is further fueling this and leaving no other option, Jindal said.

The price hike in January is the third-straight rise since November 2017 when NMDC had fixed the rates of lump ore at Rs 2,300 a tonne and that of fines at Rs 2,060 a tonne.

In December, 2017, it rose the price of lump ore by Rs 300 a tonne to Rs 2,600 and fines by 200 to Rs 2,260 a tonne."

Nifty forms small bearish candle 
The bulls on Wednesday turned indecisive at the 10,500 level of the Nifty50 and later capitulated to the pressure from the bears, as the index settled flat for the second consecutive session.

US factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017.

18,2018-01-06,JSW,"KOLKATA: India’s steel producers and suppliers of iron ore have very different views on the pricing benchmarks to be used for the primary input material for an industry that is crucial for infrastructure-building. Manufacturers want export parity as the peg, while miners prefer setting the tariff in keeping with deemed import costs.

A top official at a local steel major pointed out that logistics costs play a significant role in domestic ore pricing. For instance, there is price difference of between Rs 600 (Chhattisgarh-Karnataka) and Rs 1600 (Odisha –Karnataka), with plants being located far from the mines.

“Given this scenario, the question of import parity is not relevant. Iron ore is one raw material that is locally available and works to our advantage. The pricing of ore should instead be based on export prices,” an industry source said.

Export prices are lower than domestic realisation by nearly Rs 500 per tonne after adding export duty and transport costs. Out of the 191.6 MT of iron ore produced in 2016-17, about 24 MT were exported. In 2017-18, exports are slated to touch 30 MT.

An official note on miner NMDC’s price increase cited a steep rise in Odisha ore prices in January this year. “While the increase in lump ore prices ranges from Rs 1,200-1300/tonne, for fines it ranges from Rs 550- Rs 700/tonne. Effective price increase by two of the largest Odisha miners who control nearly 40% of the non-captive segment is Rs 1,300 a tonne in lump ore and Rs 700 per tonne in fines,” it said.

Imports, however, are hardly a feasible option for Indian plants, given the logistics and transport costs associated with hauling the ore to hinterland locations, an industry source said.

Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and Group CFO of JSW Steel, the country’s largest private steel company, said it imported around 5 MT of iron ore, or a bulk of the 5.7 MT of ore was shipped into India.

JSW, however, relies on imports only where it is feasible at the Dolvi plant in Maharashtra that is located close to India’s western water-margin. “We are forced to do so since it is costlier for us to transport ore from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra than to get it from Brazil,” Rao said."

21,2018-01-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of NCLT on Tuesday granted the resolution professional of debt ridden steel company Monnet Ispat and Energy an extension of 90 days to complete its insolvency resolution process as the initial 180 days were to expire on January 13. 

The extension will give the resolution practitioner and lenders more time to negotiate with JSW Steel on the terms of the resolution plan submitted by them to acquire the company. A consortium of Aion Capital Partners and JSW Steel had emerged as the sole bidder for Monnet. According to an earlier ET report, the plan entailed paying Rs 2,500 crore to lenders and an equity infusion of Rs 1,000 crore, backed by a letter of comfort by ICICI Bank ensuring financial help to the bidder. 

However, with the company owing banks more than Rs 10,000 crore, the haircut was almost reaching 75% making lenders consider whether to open the floor for another round of bids.

According to media reports, Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company had stepped in the game later on after the final date for accepting bids had passed, and has already submitted an expression of interest. 

People aware of the matter, however said that it is unlikely that more bids will be coming in due to the small window of time available. The 90 days will expire on April 4."
25,2018-01-10,JSW,"MUMBAI: Citing loss of jobs and mineral shortage, steel tycoon Sajjan Jindal pleaded the government on Wednesday to approach the Supreme Court to be allowed to run iron ore mines in Odisha till the matter of iron ore leases is resolved.

In a series of tweets, Jindal expressed his exasperation on how with the closure of 7 mines in the state that had failed to pay fines for illegal operations, a veritable shortage of 20 million tonne of iron ore had been created, which could push small steel companies on the brink of closure, apart from being a cause for job losses for people working on these mines. 

""The government must approach the #SupremeCourt considering that the iron-ore shortage of additional 20 MTPA in the country will lead to a disastrous situation wherein the small companies will be forced to shut operations. @rsprasad @arunjaitley #OdishaMiningStoppage,"" Jindal tweeted. 

""How about approaching the #SupremeCourt & seeking permission to operate these mines by PSUs until a final decision on the fate of these leases is taken? This will solve the employment problem and will ensure competitively priced iron-ore and hence affordable steel. @SteelMinIndia,"" he said in another tweet. 

7 iron ore mines including those run by Serajuddin, MESCO, among others were asked to shut down on December 31 as they had failed to pay penalties for illegal mining. This has led to an obvious disruption in the supply of the mineral to the tune of 15-20 MT on an annualised basis (approximately 16-22% of the 90 MT output from the state), giving govt-run National Mineral Development Corporation and other merchant miners an opportunity to hike prices by almost Rs 500 per tonne. This has caused much anxiety to steel companies like JSW Steel and Essar Steel that depend on third party iron ore for their requirements. 

Experts have said that per tonne production cost for such companies could increase by Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,300 per tonne, a substantial increase by industry standards. This will ultimately cause steel prices to rise in the short term. 

A report by Investec Capital Services said that the state government could look into options to increase mining caps for other miners to compensate for the loss. Alternatively, the central government could also step in to provide some relief."
23,2018-01-10,JSW,"Ten days into 2018, and investor wealth continues to grow on Dalal Street. Data shows more than 10 per cent of companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) scaled fresh lifetime highs in the first seven sessions of the New Year.

The benchmark Nifty50 surpassed the 10,600 mark for the first time ever this year after having logged 28 per cent gain in the last calendar year.

As many as 268 stocks from across sectors and market-caps scaled new lifetime high this year. The list included Aegis Logistics, Bharat Forge, Birla Corporation, Deepak Nitrite, Larsen and Toubro (L&T), Raymond, Unichem Labs, Rain Industries, Dabur India, Biocon and Sterlite Technologies.

Multibagger stocks of 2017, including HEG and Graphite Industries, continued to scale newer heights. Both stocks soared over 800 per cent last year.

Sectorwise, stocks that have been rallying mostly belong to metal, chemicals, auto & auto ancillaries, cement, paper, textiles and pharmaceutical sectors. 

From the metal sector, JSW Steel, Jindal Stainless (Hisar), Ratnamani Metals, APL Apollo and Lloyds Steels have hit new all-time high in barely two weeks into 2018.

Themis Medicare, Albert David and Gufic BioScience have stood out as big performers from the pharma pack. 

Paper majors TN Newsprint, JK Paper, Ruchira Paper and Genus Paper have also hit new highs, as is the case with textile stocks Lux Industries, VIP Clothing, Vardhman Textile and Bombay Dyeing.

Before investing in stocks that are hovering near their all-time high levels, look at valuations, says G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory. “I am bullish on private sectors banks and beaten-down large pharma companies.”


ETMarkets.com
Market experts expect more gains in a couple of these big performers. For instance, GNA Axles and Dabur are among the top picks of Edelweiss Research for 2018. FMCG stock Dabur scaled new lifetime high of Rs 362 on January 8, while GNA Axles hit a high of Rs 458 on January 5.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers Biocon. The stock hit a new high of Rs 564 on January 8.

Cooler manufacturer Symphony, which has also scaled new high in January, is among the high conviction stock ideas of YES Securities for 2018. The stock has risen nearly 70 per cent in the last one year till January 8.

Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga is advising caution. “Only momentum players should get in at this point, as risk levels are high. One needs to ride the rally quickly and exit. Market participants should also maintain strict stop losses,” he said.

Among the stocks that scaled new high this month, Religare Securities is positive on Asian Granito with a target price of Rs 642. 

“Robust outlook for the tiles industry (led by lower per capita consumption and expected pickup in real estate sector) augurs well for Asian Granito. Better product mix, focus on B2C sales and higher capacity utilisation would result in improved profit growth,” the brokerage said."

22,2018-01-10,JSW,"Mumbai: State Bank of India-led bankers have demanded that a proposal in the resolution plan for Monnet Ispat by JSW and Aion Capital to accommodate defaulted promoters Jajodias with a minority stake in the company post restructuring be tossed out, signalling lenders are in no mood to oblige defaulters, said two people familiar with the matter.

Banks who are the worst hit with nearly three-fourth of their funds evaporating in the restructuring of the company said they should be given a bigger stake in the restructured entity so that they get the benefit of the upside if the company revives, said the two person, on condition of anonymity.

The restructuring plan proposed by the JSW Steel-Aion Capital joint venture for Monnet Ispat involved Monnet promoter the Jajodia family owning 8 per cent stake in the company post restructuring, banks 10 per cent, public holding at 8 per cent and the JSWAion venture 74 per cent.

In a fresh round of negotiations with JSW Steel-Aion, lenders have suggested that banks’ stake should be raised to 18 per cent while public holding would be 8 per cent and the JV can have 74 per cent. Currently, founder Sandeep Jajodia and his family have a 25 per cent stake, lenders 49 per cent and the balance is with the public.

In an email response, Aion said it did not want to comment. A JSW Steel senior official said they don’t comment on market rumours and speculations.

As the lenders and prospective owners squabble over the resolution plan, the National Company Law Tribunal granted the resolution professional at the debtladen steel company an extension of 90 days to complete the insolvency resolution process, as the initial deadline was set to end later this month.

The sole bidder for Monnet, JSW Steel in partnership with Aion Capital had given a resolution plan of Rs 3,500 crore which involves cash payment of Rs 2,500 crore to lenders, implying a 75 per cent haircut. It would invest Rs 1,000 crore as equity which will be used to settle dues of employees and workmen, operational creditors and used for the day-to-day running of the company.

Lenders are also demanding that the offer be improved by Rs 200 crore at least toRs 2,700 crore given the interest in other steel assets and the values that are being ascribed to the secondary transactions of such loans.

The tough stance taken by the lenders is in line with the recent amendment in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which says promoters of a defaulted company cannot participate in the resolution plan unless they have regularised their account by repaying dues to the banks.

Monnet Ispat faces claims of Rs 10,359 crore from financial creditors and Rs 116 crore from operational creditors."
26,2018-01-11,JSW,"Mumbai: Bidders for the bankrupt Essar Steel, including private equity funds such as Aion and SSG Capital and steelmakers such as Tata Steel, ArcelorMittal, JSW Steel and Nippon Steel, are seeking to tie up funding from banks, two people familiar with the matter said.

SBI and ICICI Bank have emerged as the first port of call for these bidders as they believe guarantees or letters of comfort from the country’s biggest lenders will count in their favour, said the persons. Final, binding bids are to be submitted by end of the month, they said. “As many as 10-12 firms are likely to bid and we think that Essar itself would be one of the strong contenders,” said one of the persons.

Essar Steel faces claims of Rs 54,851 crore from financial creditors and Rs 22,914 crore from operational ones. With defaulting promoters barred from bidding unless they regularise accounts, it’s estimated the Ruias will have to arrange close to Rs 10,000 crore to be eligible to participate in resolution plan, said the person.The valuation of Essar Steel could rise after financial investors and distressed debt funds bought some of its loans from banks."

Anti-dumping duty is a penalty imposed on low-priced imports to avoid flooding in the destination country and ring-fence the domestic industry from unfair competition.

38,2018-01-19,JSW,"MUMBAI: Dalal Street is not averse to the government turning its focus on the hinterland in the Union Budget 2018.

At the ETMarkets Pre-Budget Meet in Mumbai on Friday, market veterans and industry captains called upon Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to make major investments in the rural belt and on infrastructure for pump-priming the economy.

“Government must spend money at the bottom of the pyramid,” said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mutual Fund.

“The Budget should focus on job creation and growth. We shouldn’t be too much hung up on 3.2 per cent fiscal deficit. Spending and growth are more important,” said Pawan Goenka of Mahindra & Mahindra.

Jaitley will present the Union Budget in Parliament on February 1, 2018.

The Budget is coming at a time when India Inc is desperate for the economy to start firing on all cylinders, while financial markets are worried about a possible slippage by the government on fiscal discipline.

Stock markets and investors have been eagerly waiting to see earnings revival for past many quarters. Consumption has been the only story proving some support to the economy so far.

The only aircraft flying in India is consumption, said Sanjay Mookim, Director at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. “If you want to do fiscal stimulus in next 12 months, it should be handouts, reduction in tax rates and rural subsidies,” he told the elite gathering.

He said the rural economy needs to be vibrant, and growing as it is to become one of the main pillars for India’s growth story. That needs multiple supports, including access to markets, infrastructure creation and access to finance. 

V Srinivasan, Deputy Managing Director at Axis Bank, said the agricultural loans portfolio was growing in different pockets of the country.

Market experts also expect a booster for the beaten-down real estate sector in the Budget. Most stocks from the sector delivered robust return to investors during the previous calendar year, with the BSE Realty index climbing 60 per cent.

“We would expect a huge push for the real estate sector in Budget 2018,” said Rajeev Jain of Bajaj Finance. The construction sector is known to be a big stimulator of the economy the world over.

Last year, the affordable housing theme worked well for the sector. 

Nilesh Shah of Kotak Mutual Fund said select industries have been suffering on account of cheaper Chinese imports. “Indian entrepreneurs are facing hurdles and some Indian policies have created obstacles for our entrepreneurs. Huge unfair dumping from China is hurting domestic players. The Budget must give them a level-playing field,” he said,

Pawan Goenka, Managing Director of Mahindra & Mahindra said corporate India was not ready for huge investment yet. “Budget 2018 has to do things that can incentivise investments.”

Goenka said M&M was seeing more demand for its products from rural India than urban India. “NAREGA and DBT can be immediate solutions to boost rural consumption,” he said.

Credit Suisse's India equity strategist Neelkanth Mishra said there is no quick fix solution to boost consumption. “We need to see how to absorb farm production. Farm exports can be a long-term solution to boost the rural economy,” he said.

As the domestic equity indices hover at the levels never seen before, market veterans are not too worried about valuations.

“Domestic money is coming into the market because the market is delivering,” says Nilesh Shah of Kotak Mutual Fund. He said the bulk of this market looks okay. “But in certain pockets, one certainly needs to be cautious,” he added.

Shah expects moderate return from the market in 2018, but said there could be a major correction in the market before the general election next year.

The Nifty index of NSE hit the10,900 mark in intraday trade on Friday for the first time ever. Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty settled at record high levels of 35,511 and 10,894, respectively, on January 19, 2018.

Shah said 60-70 per cent of the domestic money coming into the market via systematic investment plan (SIP) route. This has been possible because of right selling of products, instead of mis-selling. 

Mookim of BofA-ML said there are clear signs of over-exuberance in this market. “People need to be careful. Bond yield is a good indicator for the stock market. This year is going to be a lot more interesting for the domestic equity market,” he said.

Seshagiri Rao of JSW Steel said the metal sector is seeing some green shoots. The BSE Metal index managed to beat the benchmark Sensex and surged over 45 per cent in 2017. 

Rao, however, said there was still some time before one can say the overall demand is back on track. “At present, most of the steel demand is coming from government side. Now auto is generating good demand. Last few months, the construction sector has also come around.” 

Captains of India Inc said the government needs to ensure more clarity on GST. “Right now, there’s too much confusion related to GST,” said Mishra of Credit Suisse."
37,2018-01-19,JSW,"India is likely to turn into a net importer of iron ore due to shutdown of seven mines in Odisha due to non-payment of penalties. This may help domestic ore producers such as NMDC and Sandur Manganese to regain pricing power given a wide gap between domestic and international ore prices.

Despite the recent price increase by NMDC, largest iron ore miner, domestic iron ore price is at around 20 per cent discount to the global prices, thereby leaving room for future price increase. This would not only be positive for iron ore producers but also benefit Tata Steel. Since the company has its own ore mines — known as backward integration in production parlance — it will have a cost benefit over other players such as JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and Power and SAIL, which source ore from other producers.

After the curbs on excessive and illegal mining in 2010, India’s ore production fell from 220 million tonnes (MT) in FY10 to 130 MT in FY15. As a result, from exporting over 100 MT in FY10, India turned into a net importer by FY15. However with gradual opening up of production, the output increased to 200 MT. India has also started exporting in recent months.

However, the shutdown of the mines in Odisha may change the equation once again. Although the Supreme Court has permitted 5 MT increase in Karnataka’s ore production limit to 35MT last month, it may take time to ramp up. In the meanwhile, the miners will benefit with a better pricing power."
39,2018-01-22,JSW,"Nitin Gadkari,
 the minister for road transport, highways, shipping and water resources, was at his candid self at the ET Markets pre-Budget meet on Friday, enumerating the Narendra Modi government’s mega investment plans to build the underpinnings of infrastructure aimed at kick-starting India’s new growth story. With the union budget round the corner, Gadkari spoke to industrialists, senior bankers and market mavens on his strategy to spur the rural economy, the importance of private investment in rural India and the agriculture sector’s potential linkage to the power and infrastructure sectors. He reiterated his conviction on cleaner, cost-effective fuels to save on import costs, which may be then allocated to villages. Edited excerpts from the conversation:


ET: With the coming of GST, have you seen a pickup in the speed of truck movements across the country? 

GADKARI: This is still in the transition phase. Earlier we used to lose Rs 1 lakh crore every year because of state barriers. With GST, we have already scrapped 22 cesses and 17 taxes. Just take the example of Mumbai to Delhi. It takes up to 40 hours for a truck. But after replacing these toll booths with electronic payment, the transit time will be reduced by 6-8 hours. Every truck will be able to take 3-4 additional trips every month.


ET: There is some way the Eway bill can lead to a setback to this process, at least initially? 


GADKARI: Every time you launch something new, there will be problems. The GST Council has considered and worked upon the majority of the demands from all stakeholders. It takes some time to settle the issues. Demonetisation and GST are big economic reforms. I feel that in due course of time, it will be win-win for all the stakeholders.


PAWAN GOENKA, managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra: 
Sir, we need immediately effective as well as long-term steps to uplift the rural economy. How do you balance that in the budget?


 GADKARI: In rural and agriculture projects, we need government budget, but also private and public investment. Collection of biomass is a big industry. There is a surplus available. Collect it and transport it to the industry. We can initially start with 1,000 industries. Each one contributes Rs 200-250 crore. It will indirectly and directly give the industry at least 5 million new jobs. It is an import substitute, cost-effective and pollution-free. Here, we do not need any government investment. Maharashtra has a 5-6 megawatt solar power project, special agriculture feeder and it is assuring farmers that they will get power from morning 8 am to 5 pm. That power will only be used for irrigation. Maharashtra is losing thousands of crores of rupees because of subsidy. But solar power is available at Rs 3 per unit rate. Using that saves cost, saves subsidy and ultimately helps the farmer.

Sagar Mala is a project of Rs 1.6 lakh crore. I have been assured that within two years, we will generate employment for 40,000 people. In the second phase, we will add another 60,000. Only in JNPT, we will receive an investment of more than Rs 1 lakh crore and give jobs to 1,25,000 youth of Maharashtra. Through several schemes under the Sagar Mala project, including the introduction of modern trawlers, fishing production can rise at 1 least by 5-6 times. So, these are aspects where identification of new fields can be helpful for rural, agriculture and backward regions.

Israel is supposed to be one of the best examples in progressive agriculture. We can work with them to increase production, exports and jobs in the rural and agriculture sector. 


NILESH SHAH, managing director, Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund:
Sir, an Indian ship owner has to pay 5% GST for bringing his ship to India, but a foreign ship owner doesn’t have to. That is an additional tax burden to the former. Secondly, construction contractors have suffered a lot because of delays in projects and disputes where their working capital is locked. We will require your feedback on both these points. 
GADKARI: The first point is correct. I called a meeting with (finance secretary Hasmukh) Adhia-ji and the ship-owner companies, and I conveyed to him that this is a problem. I am aware that the health of ship-owning companies isn’t good. I accept that we are still looking for good solutions for them.

Regarding road construction, when I had taken charge as minister, there were 403 stalled projects; the cost involved was ?3.85 lakh crore. I can claim that my department has saved Indian banks Rs 3 lakh crore worth of NPAs. And, why take bank loans? The National Highways Authority of India has a global AAA rating. I can raise more than Rs 10 lakh crore. My toll income is Rs 10,000 crore. We already have tender processes for monetising some eight to 10 projects, which will get me another Rs 
1.25 lakh crore. I can take money from people like journalists, labourers and policemen and assure them 10-year interest rates of 8%, more than banks that are giving 6%. You can also invest in our ports.


SESHAGIRI RAO, joint managing director, JSW Steel:
Sir, today demand is partially affected because of dues from the government — GST refunds, payments to contractors, or VAT refunds. Is there some simplification which can be done in the budget so that these can be expedited and demand stimulation can happen? GADKARI: This is not related with the budget. I have just mandated that in Maharashtra, any contractor who is submitting 75% of his bill payment to the authority, has to be paid within 24 hours. I understand the meaning of working capital. The government servants never understand the value of money. They are people who get fixed salaries every month. They don’t understand the impact of interest costs. That is one of the reasons we are not paying money in time and why projects are delayed.

We are transparent, corruption-free and time-bound. But giving sanctioning claims and other things is a big problem. Once decided, I say I am not going to do it unless you receive judgements from a tribunal or court. I understand that my approach is not perfect, but I am helpless. My suggestion to my officers is “do not break the law; bend the law up to the last breaking point and try to help the investor and contractors.”


ET: You made this dramatic announcement that after 2030, only electric vehicles will be allowed…


GADKARI: I am giving priority to fuels such as ethanol, methanol, biofuel and electricity. It is my conviction. I am a nationalist. We are importing crude oil worth Rs 7 lakh crore, creating pollution.


ET: Only question was the timeframe… 
GADKARI: Sir, you do not need a timeframe. I can tell you it is going to happen in our industry. Whether they (companies) like it or not, they have to accept. Please compare Rs 80 on petrol, Rs 60 on diesel to Rs 8 per unit of electricity. Ethanol price is Rs 42. People have a choice in countries such as Brazil, Canada and the US. You can see both rates —ethanol and petrol — in pumps and fill your vehicle with whichever is less. There are flex engines in cars made by all brands including Mercedes, BMW, Toyota and Honda. Why not in India?

But, Mr (Pawan) Goenka, I am not going to close any petrol, diesel manufacturing vehicles.

Sir, I will invite you to Nagpur. We have an air-conditioned bus from Scania — it runs 100% on bio ethanol. Indian manufacturers also have the capability. But they now have to concentrate on quality and technology rather than just costs. I want to support them. By using new technology and new innovation, they will increase their exports, too."

Barring Nifty Media (down 0.25 per cent), all sectoral indices ended the day in green.



“The bulls continued to charge uphill on Tuesday. While the ongoing corporate earnings and expectations from Budget 2018 took centre stage for domestic investors, foreign sentiment was buoyed after the US legislators struck a deal to end the government shutdown and as the International Monetary Fund revised its forecast for world economic growth by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% for both 2018 and 2019,” said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, Senior Fund Manager – Equities, BNP Paribas MF.


Broader markets also remained upbeat amid earnings seasons and run-up to the Budget. BSE Midcap index added 202.23 points at 18,078.73 due to stocks such as JSPL, Biocon, Havells, Vakrangee, SAIL and Indian Bank. At the same time, BSE Smallcap index closed at 19,651.16, up 43 points.

44,2018-01-24,JSW,"Rising raw material costs, high customs duties and lower than expected demand growth seem to be major pain points that steel sector players want the Budget to tackle this year. Companies feel improved supplies of locally available inputs like coal, iron ore and graphite electrodes, removal of customs duty on key raw material like ferro-nickel and scrap for stainless steel and an overall thrust on demand generation through higher infrastructure spending will make life a bit easier for them.

At a time when the sector is saddled with 40 million tonne (mt) of surplus installed capacity, with only a few profitable plants amid a bunch of others like Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel and Electrosteel battling debt and insolvency resolution, experts feel, it is important that the operating cost of the sector is brought down. 
For this, steelmakers want assured supplies of locally available inputs like iron ore. 

This year, iron ore exports are tipped to increase to 30 mt as opposed to 24 mt last year. With domestic supply falling short of demand, this has pushed up prices. Similarly, other key steelmaking raw materials like dolomite, graphite electrodes etc have also seen major price hikes. Exports of graphite have increased by 49% with only a 13% decline in their imports. Industry feels measures to check exports would improve supply and stabilise prices in the domestic market. 

""Iron ore export duty should be re-imposed,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel said adding, “an export duty of 30% should be imposed on exports of graphite electrodes.” 

Steel experts too believe that the landed price of raw materials is an important area to focus on. ""Reduction of import duty on coking coal, rationalisation of freight and subsuming of the District Mineral Foundation (DMF), National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) etc. into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) are needed urgently,"" Niladri Bhattacharjee, partner, strategy & operations, mining & metals, KPMG in India said. 

While this could a bone of contention between exporters and merchant miners, the steel sector is equivocal in its demand for raising domestic consumption of steel. 
Per capita use of steel in India is at 65 kg, much lower than the world average of 200 kg. Experts like JSW Steel's Rao feel higher spends on infrastructure can be a game changer in this, and more allocation of funds need to take place in infrastructure and irrigation.

T V Narendran, MD & CEO of Tata Steel also feels the steel industry and Tata Steel would benefit if the government decides to invest more in infrastructure in the budget this year. “You cannot build infrastructure without steel. It forms the biggest component of the steel policy. Secondly, better infrastructure reduces the cost of production since logistics remains a big issue in India and drags down production cost.”

While reservation in favour of domestic steel companies for government contracts has already been implemented through Domestically Manufactured Iron and Steel Policy (DMISP), going forward, KPMG's Bhattacharjee said action in terms of recycling and crash-test norms for automobiles, quality-standard specifications for some steel grades etc. would support the sector.

Stainless steel makers too will gain with policy support from Make in India and investment in infrastructure, smart cities and the Railways. 

While India has emerged as the fastest growing stainless steel market in the world, per capita consumption of stainless steel is at a mere 2 kg against the world average of 6 kg. The industry expects to grow at about 8-9% and achieve a production of about 5.5 mtpa by 2022 from the present level of about 3.5 mtpa.

Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA), the apex industry body, has appealed for removing customs duty on ferro-nickel, a key raw material that has to be necessarily imported because India hardly has any nickel resources. Currently, the customs duty of ferro-nickel is 2.5%, which they feel should come down to nil. While custom duty on pure nickel was removed in the last budget, it didn't help the industry much since most of the nickel is used by stainless steel makers in the form ferro-nickel. Similarly, duty exemption on stainless steel scrap, which currently attracts 2.5% customs duty, could help the industry since a lot of the stainless steel is produced through electric furnaces, where scrap is the main raw material. It also provides a cost-effective source of alloying elements like chrome and nickel. The scrap is also not available in the country and has to be imported. 

President, ISSDA, K K Pahuja said: ""We appeal to the Finance Ministry to remove basic customs duty on both ferro-nickel and stainless steel scrap”. 

Secondary steel makers too would benefit if import duty on steel melting scrap is slashed from 2.5% to zero to help SMEs who depend on imports for 60% of their scrap requirement. The industry body, All India Induction Furnaces Association (AIIFA) has urged the government to do so in the upcoming budget.

47,2018-01-25,JSW,"The $23.21-billion Japanese steelmaker JFE Holdings, and Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel, are likely to put in a joint bid for bankrupt Bhushan Steel, reflecting competitive intensity for an asset that the Tatas and Arcelor Mittal may also seek to buy to benefit from an upswing in an industry overcoming four years of supply overhang.
In an unrelated development, bankers to the troubled alloymaker have decided to extend the deadline for bids from Thursday to Feb 3. The move to postpone the bid deadline is understood to have come about to give more time to bankers to fine-tune the terms for the bidding process for a company that has seen increasing interest lately from prospective acquirers, a top executive source told ET.

JFE is keen to participate and a team from Japan accompanied JSW for the due-diligence process for Bhushan Steel, including making joint site visits to the steel plant. While the contours of the JSW/JFE bid are being worked out, the understanding is that Ajay Piramal’s private equity-arm and JFE will have sizeable equity, with JSW holding the rest. JSW will get operational control of Bhushan Steel if they win the bid.




JFE has had a seven-year association with JSW and holds a 15% minority equity stake in the Indian steelmaker. The success of the partnership is said to have whetted its appetite to increase its presence in India. At the same time, the Japanese steelmaker is known to be cautious and riskaverse, which explains the delay in sealing the partnership, the executive said.

“JFE will take a final call in a few days, whether they are intending to join JSW in bidding for Bhushan Steel,” the executive said on Tuesday. Unsure about JFE’s final nod, JSW also has a plan B ready, he added.

Bhushan Steel faces ₹55,868 crore in claims from financial creditors. Of this, the resolution professional has accepted only ₹44,498 crore by way of claims. It also faces claims of ₹1,436 crore from operational creditors.

Bhushan Steel is among the 12 entities for which RBI directed banks to refer the company to the bankruptcy court immediately.

JSW Steel is in talks with ICICI Bank for a letter of comfort, which is mandatory for all bidders to furnish along with the resolution plan.

“Since the debt is huge, it will not be an all-cash bid. It is expected to be a combination of cash, debt recast and some haircut and some equity upside for lenders,” said a banker, who did not want to be named.

While the liquidation value of Bhushan Steel is at ₹14,500 crore, the asset is likely to get exciting bids in view of the heavyweight bidders in the race. JFE allied with JSW when it needed a technology partner to make valueadded steel, such as electrical steels and auto-grade steel. JSW offered a minority 15% stake in the company for obtaining the crucial technology.

JFE is taking time primarily because of the “uncertainties” involving the bankruptcy process and the fact that the liabilities of the stressed assets are still difficult to estimate. The uncertainties include the tax structure while restructuring the debt.

For JSW, a partnership with JFE as a significant stakeholder is crucial to reining in the acquisition costs of the stressed asset. Hurdle rates for partnering with private equity firms are significantly higher at 20% return on investment, whereas JFE could bring in long-term capital and help source cheap Japanese funds. The Indian steel industry is showing signs of revival after a particularly tough year."

Saying that it was never keen to bid for Essar Steel, JSW said the group did not even do the due diligence or preliminary site visits to Hazira in Gujarat, where Essar Steel is located.

“We are not considering Essar Steel in our calculations. We have a strong presence in South India and the western state of Maharashtra, which would adequately cover the southern and western regions in the country. We need to build our presence in the North and East,” Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director, JSW said. 

The company had announced an expansion plan last year, spending Rs 26,800 crore until 2020 on brownfield and greenfield projects. The plan includes brownfield expansion at the Dolvi facility in Maharashtra, where the company will be doubling capacity from 5 MT to 10 MT by March 2020, with an investment of Rs 15,000 crore.

At its Vijaynagar facility in Karnataka, the steelmaker will be spending Rs 4,200 crore on revamping and upgrading a blast furnace from 3 MT to 4.5 MT and increasing capacity of its cold-rolled mill-1 complex. JSW Steel is also planning to enter the east and is doing the groundwork for greenfield expansion at Odisha and Jharkhand for 10 MT each.

55,2018-01-30,JSW,"MUMBAI: The refinancing of bankrupt companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code would probably be the biggest opportunity for refinancing of loans of up to Rs 2 lakh crore this year.

A few strong banks could scoop up the opportunity even as the state-run banks hold back and clean up their bad loans. Furthermore, the restrictions on joining the consortium will eliminate a chunk of state-run banks from exploiting the refinancing activities.

Several bidders have submitted letters of comfort from banks willing to refinance these loans. In case of Monnet Ispat, the JSWAION consortium has submitted a letter of comfort from ICICI Bank ensuring financial help to the bidder.

In case of Essar Steel, almost all potential bidders have approached either SBI or ICICI Bank to secure bank guarantees or letter of comfort. For Bhushan Steel bids, JSW Steel is in talks with ICICI Bank for a letter of comfort, which is mandatory for all bidders to furnish along with the resolution plan.

“There will be a lot of refinancing opportunities, if you speak to large corporates today they want to participate if there are assets available in NCLT and therefore they want to keep that powder dry for exposure towards Indian Banking,” said Kalpana Morparia, CEO, JP Morgan - South and South-east Asia. “They will also look at bond markets for refinancing their existing exposure so as they get in to the investment mode as they have inorganic opportunities through the NCLT.”

“It’s still early days, the bidding process is still on and depending on who gets the bid they will have different ways of financing it,” said Paresh Sukthankar, DMD, HDFC Bank. “Are there going to be opportunities for lendingRs Yes, but you haven’t had anything decided finally.”

57,2018-01-30,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Want to add zing to your equity portfolio? Consider metals. A financial result posted by South Korean steel giant Posco showed good times ahead for global steel makers.

Posco’s annual sales touched 60 trillion won for the first time in three years in 2017, with 4.62 trillion won in operating profit, the biggest gain in the past six years. The company expects top line to rise further in 2018 as Chinese steel prices should remain strong early this year, thanks to Beijing's efforts to scale down production.

On an aggregate basis, metal majors on the BSE Metal index reported a 43 per cent drop in bottom line in 2016-17 compared with 2010-11. Ajay Jaiswal, President - Strategies & Head of Research at Stewart & Mackertich, said, “Posco is not a bellwether, but its results indicate a trend in Asian steel companies. Financial results of the company suggested good performance from other steel companies as well and it also indicates that a cyclical uptrend in the industry has begun.”

“Posco's earnings increased significantly in 2017 mainly as a result of improved industry fundamentals following cuts in China's large-scale steel capacity and due to the company's increasing sales of value-added products,"" said Gloria Tsuen, Moody's Vice-President and Senior Analyst, in a release.

Listed metal players on Dalal Street have been doing a good job since 2016. Take this: the BSE metal index soared 137 per cent to 15,788.74 on January 23, from 6,661.68 on January 22, 2016. 

Vedanta climbed the most by 430 per cent during the same period. The scrip jumped to Rs 342.90, from Rs 64.75 earlier. Vedanta scaled a fresh life high of Rs 494.30 on April 8, 2010.

Other metal stocks that doubled money during the period included Jindal Steel and Power (up 341 per cent), Hindalco Industries (up 266 per cent), Tata Steel (216 per cent), National Aluminium (128 per cent), SAIL (124 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (104 per cent). NMDC gained 86 per cent in the past two years.

Despite the rally, these stocks are trading up to 74 per cent lower than their all-time highs. NMDC hit its all-time high of Rs 571.80 on January 19, 2010 while Jindal Steel is 62 per cent down from its life time high of Rs 778.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal in a research report said, “Steel sector outlook has turned positive, with growth in industrial production across the world and supply-side discipline, despite slowing fixed asset investment. Steel mills’ spreads are at new highs.”

According to market experts, Indian long product prices have spiked in the last few months, bridging the gap with flat products, driven by improvement in domestic demand and tightening of iron ore supply. 

Margins of domestic steel mills are on the uptick. Analysts expect domestic steel mills to report very strong numbers in Q4 FY18. 

“We are raising our EBITDA estimates by 10-15 per cent for FY19 and rolling over our target price to FY20E earnings. JSPL and NMDC are our top picks. We continue to like JSW Steel,” Motilal Oswal said.

The brokerage house added that flat product prices moved up all through CY16-17, in line with the international trend. However, long product prices underperformed flat products by around $100 per tonne due to sluggish construction. Large mills with high share of flat products in the mix – JSW Steel (JSTL), Tata Steel (TATA), Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel – witnessed significant margin expansion, but steel producers with large share of long products and plates in the mix benefited only marginally.

Bhushan Steel soared 73 per cent to Rs 63.80 on January 23, from Rs 36.85 on January 22, 2016. However, it is still trading 88 per cent lower than its all-time high of Rs 536.93, reached on October 22, 2010.

Anish Damania, Head-Institutional Equities, IDFC Securities, believes that metal stocks will continue to beat markets. “We like all the frontline metals companies, including Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta. Asset heavy plays will rule the roost and given the global economic recovery, we feel that metals will continue to outperform the market,” he said in an interaction with ET Now."

62,2018-01-31,JSW,"Mumbai: Despite headwinds caused by rising prices of raw materials, JSW Steel reported record earnings for the quarter ending December, 2017 with net profits exceeding its double by a huge margin on the back of record increase in volumes sold led by exports. 

Consolidated net profit for the period increased by almost 148% to Rs 1,774 crore from Rs 716 crore last year, beating Bloomberg estimates of 56%. Even as crude steel production reached record levels at 4.11 MT with the steelmaker able to manage costs, EBITDA increased by 37% at Rs 3,851 crore. Level of saleable steel sales touched a record of 4.03 million tonnes with exports constituting 30% of the total volumes sold, up by 56% since last year. 

Revenue from operations stood at Rs 17,861 crore, up by 17% since last year. The company also benefited from a reduction in the corporate income tax in the United States with tax liabilities amounting to Rs 572 crores being reversed. At the same time it took a hit of Rs 264 crore as an exceptional item for the provision it made for impairment towards goodwill, mining development and advances associated with the surrender of its iron ore mine in Chile. 

With the company being able to repay loans, net debt at the end of the quarter stood at Rs 42,068 crore, reduced by Rs 696 crore with the weighted average interest rate decreased by 23 basis points on a quarterly basis to 7.03 %. However, joint MD of JSW Steel Seshagiri Rao said that he does not expect the interest rate to fall so much in the last quarter even though they will keep repaying loans. 


IRON ORE READINESSThe company has been facing issues with iron ore shortage in Karnataka due to which Rao said it will fall short of its yearly production guidance of 15.5 MT. However, with the Supreme Court recently increasing the cap on iron ore mining from 30 MT to 35 MT in the state, it is expected that iron ore prices will stabilise. 

Also, out of the five iron ore mines that JSW Steel bagged in the state last year, two are expected to start production in the last quarter with the rest three to begin functioning in the first quarter of the next fiscal. The total capacity of the two mines will be 0.7 MT. 


ON STRESSED ASSETS ACQUISITION Rao confirmed that the steel arm of the JSW Group is actively involved in the insolvency resolution process of three companies- Bhushan Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel and Monnet Ispat and Energy. He said that the company is not interested in Electrosteel Steels as well as Essar Steel. 

Last year the company had announced that it will also take up greenfield expansion in the states of Jharkhand and Odisha of 10 MT each. However, even though with most of the stressed assets that the company is eyeing having presence in the east and central India, the greenfield plan remains. 

""The greenfield project is moving at its own pace,"" director of commercial and marketing, Jayant Acharya said adding that ""as of now"" the plan remains unaffected by the potential acquisitions. The company however may take a call on adding more capacities in a brownfield manner after the process of acquisitions is over. JSW Steel has a vision of reaching a capacity of 40 MT by 2030 from its present capacity of 18 MT."

4,2018-02-01,JSW,"Equity market witnessed immense volatility on Thursday during the Budget session, as the NSE benchmark Nifty50 swung 175-points on either side during the day.

 Despite such volatility, the index ended virtually flat losing 10.80 points or 0.10 per cent. Market saw a sharp 170-point recovery from the lows of the day in the second half of the session.

 The Budget, in all likelihood, will be perceived in a mature way by the market. Though there will still be some follow-up reactions to the Budget for a couple of days.

 The level of 10,880, which remains in the vicinity of the short-term 20-DMA shall, acts as a strong base for the market.



 The levels of 11,075 and 11,110 will play out as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports came in form of a strong base around 10,880-mark.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 69.2956 and it has just crossed below 30 from a topping formation. The daily MACD remains in buy mode, while trading above its signal line, but is seen moving towards negative crossover.

 On the candles, a long-lower-shadow occurred. This usually halts the downtrend if it happens during a correction or a consolidation and hints towards a potential pullback. However, this needs confirmation on the next trading day.

 The pattern analysis shows that the Nifty has done nothing but consolidated on a closing basis despite 175-point swing on either side.

 The volatility has ensured that a likely base may be formed near the 10,880-mark, which also happens to lie within a close proximity of the short term 20-DMA and hence is expected to act as strong support.

 All in all, from proposals’ point of view, the Budget has not been taken too badly by the market despite some short-term volatility that may still remain.

 The major takeaways from the Budget are rural focus, infrastructure boost, benefits to marginal farmers, extending corporate tax rate cut to MSMEs, and encouraging rural spending.

 It was believed that the Budget will grossly remain a populist one. Not only this turned out to be a more fiscally prudent, the FM also introduced return of LTCG at 10 per cent, which may induce short term volatility.

 Despite looming 2019 elections, the FM choosing to remain fiscally prudent will taken in good spirits by the market in the long run, once the immediate reactions are over.

 We recommend preserving liquidity and saying away from creating any speculative bets as all volatility will present fresh selective buying opportunities.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh longs were seen added in CG Power, Vedanta, Federal Bank, Dish TV, HCC, M&M, NCC, JSW Steel, ITC and Apollo Tyres.

1,2018-02-01,JSW,"MUMBAI: Bulge-bracket bidders for bankrupt companies are working overtime to ensure that they don’t fall afoul of the amended provisions of the bankruptcy law with Seema Jajodia, sister of Sajjan Jindal of the JSW Group and wife of Sandeep Jajodia, the promoter of Monnet Ispat, taking the extreme step of transferring her shares in the company as a gift. Jajodia has also requested that she be excluded from the promoter group of Monnet Ispat in a recent filing to the stock exchanges.

Explaining the reason for her action, Jajodia said she was not involved in the formation, management and control of the company from inception and that her classification of promoter was ‘incidental’ to her miniscule holding in the company.

What is left unsaid is that she is the sister of Sajjan Jindal, whose company, JSW, is a bidder for Monnet Ispat and a clarification and request for exclusion from the promoter group will pave the way for JSW to be on the right side of the law and possibly win the bid for the bankrupt company without any legal hassles.

Section 29 C of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been clarified and expanded to now extend to persons who are in the management or in control, or are promoters of a corporate debtor whose account is classified as an NPA for more than a year. The code also bars bidders if ‘connected people’ like close kith and kin have defaulted on loans. Bidders will also be barred if they or their affiliate, associate companies have been convicted of any offence and been punished with a fine or a prison term of two years.

Mirroring the same legal hurdle and in the same predicament are other bidders such as LN Mittal’s Arcelor Mittal. Arcelor is one of the promoters of Uttam Galva, which has been referred to the bankruptcy courts. Also, Mittal’s brothers, Pramod and Vinod Mittal, had defaulted on loans when they were running Ispat Int’l, a steel company subsequently taken over by Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel.




Can they, and more importantly, the Ruia brothers wriggle out of what is an ironclad clause which puts them in a category of defaulters? The jury is still out. Arcelor Mittal is a promoter of Uttam Galva, along with the Miglani family, by virtue of their 29% in the firm. Uttam Galva defaulted on its loans and thus the resolution applicant process has to be tested, legal circles say.

Another hurdle facing ArcelorMittal is the ‘connected people’ clause which covers close kith and kin like brothers and the resolution application can be rejected, say legal experts.

If a brother is a defaulter under RBI guidelines for more than 12 months, then the participation of the applicants can be challenged.

ET reached out to ArcelorMittal. “There is no legal basis to these claims. Arcelor-Mittal is a minority shareholder of Uttam Galva with no control, no management influence and no board representation. ArcelorMittal has no relationship with said individuals,” a spokesperson for company said.

“We are sure and confident we will be able to participate, should we decide to move forward with the opportunity,” the spokesperson added. ArcelorMittal also says that their promoters were never on the board of Uttam Galva. But legal circles argue that this needs to be tested. After all, holding a significant stake in Uttam Galva they could influence decisions of the Indian company.

MR Umarji, former executive director of Reserve Bank of India and one of the key people to draft the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code said, without going into the specifics of any company: “When it comes to approving a decision of a company in an Annual General Meeting, a person holding over 26% shareholding will have a say because 75% has to accept it. Once you hold more than 26%, you have a casting vote which can tilt any decision this way or that way.”"

ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank’s net profit fell 32 per cent to Rs 1,650 crore in the December quarter due to lower income from treasury though the pace of addition to the list of NPAs slowed the most in the past nine quarters.

Larsen & Toubro: Fiscal third-quarter earnings at Larsen & Toubro Wednesday reflected the revival of growth across the broader economy, with robust home demand helping India’s biggest engineering company offset the impact of muted overseas business and post 53 per cent gain in net income.


Vedanta: India’s leading mining company Vedanta Ltd. reported a 4 per cent decline in net profit in the fiscal third quarter, although a secular uptrend in metal prices drove revenue 19 per cent higher in the period under review.

0,2018-02-01,JSW,"MUMBAI: In a desperate bid to salvage his company from going under the hammer next week, Neeraj Singhal, promoter and vice chairman of Bhushan Steel Limited, has written to all lenders to consider restructuring the Rs 44,000 crore debt under the Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) mechanism by dividing the debt into sustainable and unsustainable parts with no haircut whatsoever even at this stage.

The letter, written on January 29, alleges that the company was wrongly dragged into IBC under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) despite its debt restructuring mechanism under S4A was on the last lap. ET has reviewed the letter.

The lenders had undertaken a series of due diligence exercises and forensic studies by agencies as diverse as MN Dastur (TEV Study), Deloitte (4 years forensic audit) “and found no malfeasance on promoters and the company”. The Deloitte report, according to the Bhushan management, was further vetted and confirmed by the lender’s legal counsel Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas in the steering committee meetings held in December 2016 and further accepted by the joint lenders forum in a meeting dated December 5, 2016.

The proposal to restructure apparently had the blessings of most lenders. “As late as 15.06.2007, SBI called for a JLF for adoption of S4A as the debt resolution plan by JLF,” Singhal wrote, adding, RBI on June 13,, 2016, directed for initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against the company. “It appears the above facts and status of the debt resolution plan was not noted by the RBI including the name of company in list of first 12 accounts for initiating insolvency proceedings.”

Bhushan Steel -- one of the largest non-performing assets in the Indian banking system -- was taken to the NCLT after it failed to repay banks.

Singhal argues that barring Tata Steel and JSW, most steel mills have been under stress, so it is not a “promoter/company problem”. More importantly, in case of debt restructuring under the S4A scheme, there is virtually no loss to lenders unlike the bankruptcy proceedings under IBC where banks are being forced to sell companies at huge haircuts.

According to the earlier restructuring proposal, more than half the debt was sustainable and proposed to be serviced along with interest. Also, there would be no principal loss at all, as balance unsustainable portion of the debt was to be repaid by converting it into a long dated instrument. The interest loss on the unsustainable debt were to be compensated by way of 50% of promoter’s equity transferred to the lenders “on which huge equity upside would have covered the interest loss and additionally the promoters shall be willing to pledge their equity”.

The promoters own 57.82% of the company. Of which 71% is pledged with banks and other financial institutions. The current market cap of Bhushan Steel is Rs 1159.74 crore.

With the steel sector looking up, Singhal has urged all banks not to sell prized assets at deep discounts and instead hold on to the equity of these companies and earn future upsides. His proposal of transferring promoter equity would also give the lenders control over the company.

“No haircut would ensure safeguard to lenders from any question that may be asked in future,” he wrote. “We are also agreeable if the lenders intend to have joint management sort of structure by inducting their representatives and chairman on the board of the company.”

Attempts to reach Neeraj Singhal via email, text messages remained unsuccessful till the time of going to press.

Bhushan Steel, with a capacity of 5 million tonnes per annum, has seen frenzied interest from bidders such as JFE-JSW, Arcelor Mittal-Nippon Steel, Vedanta, Tata Steel, Bain-Piramal, among others. The resolution professional has set the liquidation value at Rs 15,000 crore, below which any bid will not be accepted.

Lawyers specialising in bankruptcy said typically once admitted under NCLT, there is no mechanism to withdraw the application as these are representative suits involving all stakeholders. “However in some cases, where settlements have happened between the applicant and the corporate debtor, the Supreme Court has interfered under Article 142 of the constitution of India on the basis of complete justice have permitted withdrawal,” said Alok Dhir, Managing Partner, Dhir & Dhir Associates.

“NCLT does not have that leeway, only the apex court does. But taking a cue, NCLTs have also started permitting withdrawal of matters post settlements. Even SC has directed the government to amend the IBC to permit withdrawal of cases… However, settlement in this case means full and final and not a scheme or a restructuring mechanism.”

In an earlier interaction with ET, Singhal had echoed a similar sentiment saying promoters who put in their sweat equity to create greenfield assets is always the best bidder.

“I think we should have been given a chance at restructuring. We have not undergone any restructuring in the past 30 years of operation. A number of companies including Tata Steel, JSW Steel and SAIL have also faced problems. In my view, the RBI-led process of deep restructuring under S4A should be brought under NCLT. If it fails to come up with a solution, only then the auction process should be initiated. Elsewhere in the world, in the UK and the US, restructuring with existing promoters is the first option that is tried out. Auctioning off is usually the last resort and it does not capture the best value for the business.”"
3,2018-02-01,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Group frontman Sajjan Jindal who is known to not mince words on social media when it comes to putting across his grievances against the government occasionally, on Thursday lauded the government for budgetary announcements related to health and MSMEs but also expressed disappointment over an unchanged corporate tax. 

Jindal, who's group's flagship JSW Steel is part of an industry ridden by high costs of raw materials in the recent past also said that the step to replace education cess of 3% on custom duty with a higher surcharge rate will push up prices of raw materials. 

This is what he said in his string of posts on Twitter: 

I laud the budget for giving health insurance to 10cr Indians. This budget should bring growth in rural India. Great for MSMEs with upto 250 Crs turnover. Moreover, it’s a populist budget and looks good for the economy. #Budget2018 @arunjaitley @PMOIndia 

The salaried and the corporate are not too happy with #Budget2018. Corporate tax rate in India is among the highest in the world. The government must revisit the corporate taxation policy. @arunjaitley 

Replacing education cess of 3% on custom duty with a surcharge of 10% will have a net impact of 7%. The cost of raw materials for manufacturing industry is bound to go up and the industry will in turn transfer it to the end user. @arunjaitley #Budget2018

The finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budgetary announcement today reduced the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 25% for medium, small and micro enterprises with an annual turnover of up to Rs 250 crore- the ceiling was increased from last year's Rs 50 crore. However, there was no relaxation for big corporates that have been expecting a rate cut since the government came to power. 

Corporates from across sectors have often complained of India having a high corporate tax rate with countries across the world bringing it down to relieve their industrialists. Recently, the Donald Trump led government in the United States too brought down its tax rate to 21% from a high of 35% to give private investment a boost in the country. 

On the raw materials side, steelmakers in India are at the mercy of imports of coking coal, a key raw material in steelmaking and an important determinant in their margins and overall steel prices."
6,2018-02-03,JSW,"NEW DELHI: JSW Steel and Piramal Enterprises are bidding jointly for Bhushan Steel after Japanese company JFE Steel Corp walked out of the alliance, a source in the know of the matter said.

JSW Steel had roped in its Japanese business partner JFE Steel and Piramal Enterprises to bid jointly for Bhushan Steel, the maker of auto-grade steel in India undergoing insolvency proceedings for non-payment of dues.

""JFE has walked out. JSW Steel and Piramal Enterprises will now bid for Bhushan Steel,"" the source said requesting anonymity.

The bid for Bhushan Steel closes today.

E-mail queries sent to JSW Steel and other two companies to seek response remained unanswered.

Besides JSW Steel, Luxembourg-based multinational steel firm ArcelorMittal and domestic industry major Tata Steel and are said to be in race for Bhushan Steel.

Asked if JSW Steel could lower its bid as Japanese partner has opted out now, the source said, ""JSW is in expansion mode, no matter one partner has gone, JSW can even increase the bid along with Piramal. It will be a 50:50 partnership now"".

JSW Steel reportedly had plans to offer Rs 30,000 crore, double of the liquidation amount, for Bhushan Steel.

Liquidation value is the minimum value set for a stressed asset by the committee of creditors.

According to Bhushan Steel's website, the company is the third largest secondary steel producer in the country with an existing steel production capacity of 5.6 million ton per annum.

JSW Steel is in expansion mode and is also evaluating various opportunities for acquisitions to achieve the target of becoming 40 mt by 2030."

Indian bond yield higher among EMs
Indian sovereign yields have been spiking over the past six months, making the 10-year benchmark bond one of the highest yielding in emerging markets. The rise has made India yields attractive to global investors. This may trigger inflows into India despite rising US Treasury yields, if investment limits into bonds are increased. The benchmark gauge has surged 110 basis points in six months as a cocktail of domestic and global factors triggered a sell-off among jittery investors.

9,2018-02-05,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel, Tata Steel and a group of employees along with a private equity firm have submitted bids for the bankrupt Bhushan Steel, said four people familiar with the matter. The resolution professional received the bids on Saturday and these will be opened for examination by Tuesday, they said.

“We have received bids, now the RP will assess them and present it to the committee of creditors but if there are any promoter association with any of the bids, that will be rejected,” said one of the persons. Consultancy firm Deloitte is running the process.

Bhushan Steel, which involves a Rs 44,000 crore default, is the biggest bankruptcy to go under the hammer thus far after the Reserve Bank of India and the government pushed banks to clean up the bad loan mess through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

As many as 451 cases with an exposure of Rs 1.28 lakh crore are pending in the bankruptcy courts. Essar Steel and Electrosteel Steels are the other big metal companies undergoing the bankruptcy process. Bidding for Bhushan has witnessed some twists in the past month with many global giants showing initial interest then withdrawing from the race.




JSW Steel had submitted its bid along with Piramal Enterprises’ distressed asset fund after Japanese company JFE Steel Corp bowed out at the last moment. Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources was also said to be interested in the company but also stayed away from a binding bid.

ArcelorMittal, which was said to have been interested, said it had not bid. “ArcelorMittal can confirm it has not bid for Bhushan Steel, but we remain interested at looking at future opportunities in India,” a company spokesperson said. Bhushan Steel has an annual steel capacity of 5 million tonnes.

The resolution professional has set the liquidation value at Rs 15,000 crore, below which no bid will be accepted. Most bids are expected to be in the Rs 25,000-30,000 crore range.

For JSW, Bhushan Steel will provide a gateway to the east and north, as most of its existing facilities are concentrated in the east. For Tata Steel, which is predominantly in the east, acquiring the company makes sense as its grip on the eastern region will continue.

Neeraj Singhal, promoter and vice chairman of Bhushan Steel, is said to have written to lenders asking them to consider restructuring the Rs 44,000 crore debt under the Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) mechanism. The letter, written on January 29, said the company was wrongly taken to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) as its restructuring proposal had been in the final lap.

The promoters own 57.82% of the company. Of this, 71% is pledged with banks and other financial institutions."

It was an unforgettable Friday for Dalal Street investors, given the kind of upheaval they witnessed after the return of LTCG tax.

With the US markets witnessing a similar crash in Friday’s trade, and Asian shares skidding this morning, things do not look very inspiring as we kick off a new week.

This is Prachi Sharma, your market jockey, bringing you all the news, views and cues to prepare you for the day’s trading.

Nifty futures traded almost 1 per cent down on Singapore Stock Exchange early this morning, signalling a weak opening to Mumbai trade.

On Friday, Nifty had formed a 'Long Black Day' candle on the daily chart and a 'Bearish Engulfing' pattern on the weekly chart, making analysts sweat over what is on the cards. 

Asian share markets stumbled on Monday as fears of resurgent inflation battered bonds, toppled Wall Street from record highs and sparked speculation that central banks globally might be forced to tighten more aggressively. Japan's Nikkei slid 2.2 per cent, while Australia's main index fell 1.3 per cent.

US shares crashed on Friday, falling more than 2 per cent on rising bond yields, which pushed the market down to its worst week in two years. The Dow tanked 665 points, the S&P500 59 points and the Nasdaq 144 points.

Early Monday, crude oil prices extended declines from the end of last week on the back of a stronger dollar, with Brent crude falling to its lowest in nearly a month. Brent was down 1.1 per cent at $67.83 a barrel while WTI crude traded 66 cents lower at $64.

The rupee pared some of its losses, but still closed marginally weaker against the US dollar at 64.06 on Friday, tracking losses in the local equity markets.

Back home, the bond market is suddenly looking attractive after the LTCG tax on equity, forcing investors to do a rethink on portfolio allocation. 

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said the government was not considering abolition of the security transaction tax following the re-introduction of long-term capital gains tax on equities and equity-linked mutual funds.

On the macro front, the January performance of India’s services sector will be known today.

RBI's monetary policy decision is due on February 7. The central bank is expected to tighten its stance, as the government's fiscal deficit target has been revised upwards and retail inflation is making its way up. 

In quarterly earnings, Tata Motors, Cochin Shipyard, Bosch, Ujjivan Financial Services and HUDCO, among others, are due to announce their numbers during the day.

In stock-specific news, futures contract of PC Jeweller saw a 44.18 per cent drop in open interest as the stock lost one-fourth of its value on Friday, Analysts said it was a clear indication of heavy long liquidation on the counter and the stock will remain under pressure for some time.

15,2018-02-07,JSW,"In an all-cash deal, Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are set to sell the Bhushan Steel loan to Acre ARC, owned by SSG Capital, at a 50% haircut just a few days after the steelmaker went under the hammer.

The two banks had together put up Rs 2,430 crore in loans for sale. Bhushan Steel is facing bankrupcy proceedings and in the process of finalising resolution plan. “Acre ARC made the highest offer among other asset reconstruction companies (ARC) which were also in the fray. The final decision on whether to sell the loan to Acre ARC will be made by the end of this week or early next week,” said a person familiar with the development.

If the Union Bank and BoB deal goes through, SSG will have Rs 3,030 crore of loans of Bhushan Steel, and have a significant say on the resolution plan. It would be the third largest lender after State Bank of India, which has an exposure of Rs 12,878 crore, and Punjab National Bank with Rs 4,905 crore.

On February 5, Union Bank put on block Rs 1,130 crore while BoB put on sale Rs 1,300 crore of Bhushan Steel's loans. The other bidders were Edelweiss ARC and J M Financial ARC, said the person cited above.

In the past, Acre had acquired Rs 600 crore of loans from Indian Overseas Bank in an allcash deal for Rs 376 crore, which implies a haircut of 40% for IOB.

The resolution professional for Bhushan Steel has accepted Rs 44,498 crore in claims from financial creditors.

The loan sales assume significance as large steel companies, such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel, are eyeing Bhushan as a prized asset."

The Committee of Creditors (CoC) is all set to approve the sweetened deal from the consortium to showcase the success of the bankruptcy process. Under the earlier proposal lenders would get Rs 2500 crore upfront cash and 10% equity. “The final offer of Rs 2700 crore cash and more than 18% equity is being deliberated upon. We believe it’s a good deal and should go through when the committee of creditors meets next,” said a banker aware with the deal. “It’s a win-win situation as the equity component is expected to get us higher upside in the coming years.” The next meeting of the CoC is likely on Friday.

23,2018-02-08,JSW,"KOLKATA: Bhushan Steel has clarified that the bids received by the resolution professional for the company are being examined to ascertain whether they meet mandatory requirements of the bankruptcy code and there are several steps involved before one single bidder is finally approved by the NCLT. 

The BSE had earlier sought clarifications from the company after reports said JSW Steel had emerged as the highest bidder. Bhushan said on Thursday that after scrutinising the bids, the RP will call a meeting of the Committee of Creditors (CoC) for its approval. 

Tata Steel, JSW and Bhushan employees have put in bids for the debt laden company.

Neeraj Singhal, the company’s promoter, is also believed to have put in his bid. However, the bid is unlikely to be considered, since the revised Bankruptcy Code bars defaulting promoters who are yet to clear their dues from bidding for their companies.

Bhushan Said once the complaint resolution plans are identified, RP will call for a COC meeting to present these plans to the CoC for its approval. 

The resolution plan as may be approved by the CoC will then be presented to the NCLT for its approval, upon which it shall become binding on the stakeholders involved. Thus there are several steps involved in the entire process being run as per the Code, the Rgulations and the NCLT order, before one single resolution applicant and its resolution plan is finally approved by the NCLT. 

The resolution plans put forth by the resolution applicants are an outcome of a process envisaged in the Code and are mere proposals at this stage, Bhushan Steel said."
22,2018-02-08,JSW,"NEW DELHI: JSW Steel today said its crude steel production rose by 7.3 per cent to 1.46 million tonnes in January 2018 compared to the year-ago month.

The crude steel production was at 1.36 million tonnes in the same month last year, JSW Steel said in a filing to BSE.

""JSW Steel reports highest ever monthly crude steel production at 1.46 million tonnes for January 2018...,"" the company said.

JSW Steel is a part of diversified JSW Group which has presence in steel, energy, infrastructure and cement sectors."
21,2018-02-08,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The Street is buzzing with Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings. Reports of stronger companies vying for debt-ridden companies that are facing insolvency proceedings and stressed companies inching in towards reaching a resolution with lenders too are making headlines. Some analysts believe this can be a theme to play on with.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is the legal authority dealing with such debt resolution applications. 

With the start of NPA resolution through the NCLT route, there has been a build-up in interest from buyers for large stressed assets, but smaller accounts still struggle to get takers, observers noted. On Wednesday, JSW Steel reportedly put in Rs 29,700 crore for Bhushan Steel, outsmarting Tata Steel's Rs 24,000 crore bid for the steelmaker. ET on Thursday reported that Adani and the JSW Group are among the 20 big bidders for the company. At least four potential suitors, including distressed funds of Kotak Mahindra and Edelweiss, have also shown interest in Alok Industries.

There are four little-known companies eyeing Lanco Infratech. 

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects the resolution process for several NCLT cases to get over in the next few months.

""One can buy shares of acquirers in the companies as NCLT cases could see a 40-70 per cent haircuts. With a sound balancesheet and probably in the right cycle cyclically, if stronger companies acquire a company at a 60 per cent haircut -- and the IRR on that acquisition is northwards of 20 -- the market is more likely to rerate that company than the lender, which took the haircut,"" Rohit Agarwal from Kotak Life Insurance recently told ET Now.

Agarwal said further that the acquirer with a healthy balancesheet can actually add a lot of value to the company itself.

That said, the bets could also prove risky sometimes.

Rajesh Agarwal, head of research at AUM Capital, noted that while there can be a case of re-rating for potential buyers of stressed companies, the road is riddled with many ifs and buts.

""There are a lot of legal procedures to be followed. In the past, we have seen many deals not materialising due to one factor or the other. Therefore, such stocks are for investors with high risk appetite,"" Agarwal added.

Starting June 2017, the Reserve Bank (RBI) directed banks to refer 40 cases to the NCLT for bankruptcy proceedings in case the company and resolution professionals fail to finalise a resolution plan within the stipulated 270 days. Referred to as List 1 (12 accounts) and List 2 (26 accounts), these stressed accounts form 40 per cent of banks’ NPAs, the analysts noted. 

Some of these accounts are Asian Colour Coated Ispat, Castex Technologies, Coastal Projects, East Coast Energy, IVRCL, Orchid Pharma, SEL Manufacturing, Uttam Galva Metallic, Uttam Galva Steel, Visa Steel, Essar Projects, Jai Balaji Industries, Nagarjuna Oil Refinery, Ruchi Soya Industries and Wind World India . 

In January, the Mumbai bench of the NCLT granted the resolution professional of Monnet Ispat and Energy an extension of 90 days to complete the insolvency proceedings.

""The NCLT is one of the biggest reforms which I have seen because for the first time, there is going to be change in promoters and clean-up of assets is being offered to people who never participated as industrialists,"" said Madhu Kela, a market veteran. 

""It is happening very transparently that anyone can bid. Stressed assets will see a haircut of, maybe, 60 per cent in some cases, where the actual fraud is being committed,"" he asserted."

19,2018-02-08,JSW,"Mining money and doing so consistently is an art. In fact, it requires you to master a set of quick formulas. To be sure, this is no rocket science. A small step in the right direction is all that you need to stay wealthy. 

Money continued to multiply on Dalal Street in January 2018 as benchmark stock indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty soared 6 per cent. That's on top of a rally of 28 per cent in 2017. 

But the worry is valuations are not backing up and domestic equities may run into volatility down the road. 

Ramesh Bukka, co-founder and Director, Entrust Family Office Investment Advisors, said, “Current market valuations on a forward basis are similar to the ones seen in 2007. While 10 years ago, markets soared on the back of high economic growth, this time, it is on factors like TINA, FOMO and anticipated earnings recovery.” 

TINA stands for ‘There Is No Alternative’ while FOMO means ‘Fear of Missing Out’.

With the first month of the New Year already behind us, here are five tips that can help you make the most of the remaining space.


Be contrarian 
Over the last two years, there are two segments that have seen both time and price correction. These would be the IT and pharma sectors. With growth expectations getting reset, stocks in both sectors have corrected reasonably, giving investors a good opportunity to invest with a 3-5 year view. 

“While being contrarian requires a lot of patience as valuation re-rating may take time, the trades turn very profitable over a cycle. Until a few months ago, IT as a sector was nearly 25 per cent cheaper than the Nifty with higher dividend and free cash flow yields making it a perfect contra bet in an election year,” said Bukka.

Rakesh Tarway, Head Research, Reliance Securities, said, “Pharma and IT sector as a whole are available at very reasonable valuations. Within pharma, smaller companies with lower legacy exposure to USA market and specialty products have better chance of outperformance. Similarly in IT, midcap IT companies in niche areas are delivering earnings growth in proportion to valuation. Companies in this space are also likely to do well.”


Companies with cyclical spurts
Unlike 2007 when the economy chugged along and markets were expensive across the board, 2018 could well be a year where investors can make upsides from investing in companies that will deliver earnings acceleration. Take metals, for instance. Stocks in this sector delivered spectacular gains over the last two years when metal prices bottomed out in 2016 and started moving up from thereon. 

“This year, one of the themes is likely to be capital goods on the back of capex revival,” added Bukka.

Margins of domestic steel mills are also on the upswing. Experts expect domestic steel mills to report very strong numbers in Q4 FY18. “We are raising our EBITDA estimates by 10-15 per cent for FY19 and rolling over our target price to FY20E earnings. JSPL and NMDC are our top picks. We continue to like JSW Steel,” Motilal Oswal said.


Review your portfolio
With ever-changing and dynamic markets, one needs to ensure the investment portfolio is periodically reviewed. If certain funds, stocks or investment tools are not giving the desired result, one must look at making an appropriate switch. “For best effectiveness, one must do quarterly review of the portfolio to ensure best returns on investment. Investments which are not giving optimum returns must be replaced with those with a better track-record. Consulting an advisor can help one in planning better and executing the review of portfolio effectively,” said Brijesh Parnami, Executive Director and CEO, Essel Wealth Zone.


Relative value hunting
While 2013-14 was a great entry opportunity for all investors, the rally over the last couple of years has resulted in valuations expanding significantly and thereby, value getting priced out of the market. Market experts say this year, investors buying largecap stocks quoting at relatively lower valuation can benefit as incremental flows from institutional investors may now follow an approach of relative value hunting. 

“In bull markets, when leading stocks in different sectors get overpriced, action moves from absolute value to relative value,” Bukka reasoned. 

G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Adisory, is upbeat on beaten-down largecaps as well as select defensive stocks in the ongoing calendar year.


Understand your debt
A rupee saved is rupee earned. One must revisit the ongoing housing, personal or car loans that one is paying up. After evaluating the interest rates and industry standards, one can switch or refinance as suitable. “With newer policies and housing finance companies coming into the market, competitive rates are easy to find. Hence if you are paying higher interest, it is advisable to review your debt and make alterations to your advantage,” said Parnami."
25,2018-02-08,JSW,"Thursday’s session remained on the expected lines as the benchmark Nifty did enjoy a strong opening and also fiercely attempted to find and maintain base around current levels.

Though the Nifty retraced nearly 100-points from the day’s high, it recovered again and ended the session with a decent gain of 100.15 points or 0.96 per cent.

Nifty has successfully defended its 50-DMA at closing level as of now and has also maintained itself above the 10,480-10,500 zones, keeping hopes of a recovery alive.

We expect a positive opening once again on Friday. The intraday corrective move that was witnessed on Thursday, put and the recovery that followed, makes the base stronger for the market under usual circumstances.



The levels of 10,635 and 10,680 will play out as immediate resistance levels, while the supports will come in at 10,480 and 10,410 mark.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 41.7223 and it stays neutral showing no divergences against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish as it trades below its signal line, but it may flatten its trajectory in coming days if downsides get arrested. No significant formations were observed on candles.

While having a look at pattern analysis, it is evident that the Nifty pulled back sharply after intraday lows that tested the 100-DMA. At closing levels, it has defended both 100-DMA and 50-DMA as well.

Overall, we still feel that volatility may continue to persist for some time. However, select sectors have already started to outperform on expected lines and will continue to do so on Friday as well.

Also it is important to note that the intraday corrections and the recovery from that make the market healthier and light in terms of open positions.

We expect that the market may attempt some more upsides with the only caveat that the levels of 10,500 should be defended.

Any breach of this level will bring in temporary weakness.

We recommend keeping overall exposures moderate until the market restores its upward directional bias.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were observed being added in stocks like Ashok Leyland, Bharti Airtel, RCom, JSW Steel, Ultratech, Grasim, ACC, JP Associates, CG Power and YES Bank.

Senior officials from the banking circle said that the resolution professional received just two bids – JSW Steel and Tata Steel- till close of the day. ArcelorMittal and Vedanta Resources had conducted due diligence but did not submit a binding bid, said people quoted above.

“The resolution professional will evaluate the bid and present it before the lenders,” said a bank official. The company faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore from financial creditors and Rs 1172 crore from operational creditors. 

ET had reported on January 18 that the liquidation value of Bhushan Power was pegged at Rs 20,000 crore by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Duff& Phelps. Liquidation value refers to the worth of a company's assets if they are sold on a piecemeal basis and not as a going concern. 

Interestingly, JSW Steel and Tata Steel have also emerged as the most aggressive bidders for Bhushan Steel, another company that is facing bankruptcy proceedings.

Bhushan Steel is owned by Neeraj Singhal while Bhushan Power and Steel is owned by Sanjay Singhal. Both companies went under hammer within a week. Both are brother but with independent business interest.

In case of Bhushan Steel, the resolution professional has yet not disclosed which among the two has given highest bid as they are still evaluating the bids.

Senior officials who are familiar with the development said that the resolution professional for Bhushan Steel has sought more details on the resolution plan from JSW Steel and Tata Steel since both bids were laced with certain conditions.

There are speculation that JSW Steel is the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel offering almost double the liquidation value which is Rs 15,000 crore.

Only two companies, Tata Steel and JSW Steel, had submitted bids for Bhushan Power & Steel before the deadline closed on February 8. A Dubai-based group too had asked for an extension of the timeline, but that was declined, said a person close to developments. Vedanta Resources and Arcelor-Mittal had shown early interest, but didn’t submit any bids.

The Liberty bid is likely to value the company higher than the others, which means a smaller haircut for banks, an insolvency and bankruptcy professional said on the condition of anonymity. According to banks, the company owed them nearly Rs 48,000 crore.

Liberty declined to comment. Bhushan Power & Steel and its lead lender, Punjab National Bank, did not respond until press time Tuesday to ET’s emails seeking comment.

“Allowing us to participate (in the bidding) would be in the interest of all the stakeholders, in particular the lenders, as ultimate goal of the process is to have the best and most competitive resolution plan for the company in public interest,” said the letter. “In several cases, the bids received have been lower than we had anticipated, so perhaps a follow-up bid should be considered,” said a banker.

However, as the process is laid out at the moment, it doesn’t allow for a second round of bidding or an auction of assets.

Some bidders for bankrupt companies also ask for deferred payments, said a banker. It may make more sense to take a bigger haircut but have the cash in hand immediately, said this banker.

Around a dozen companies including promoter Sanjay Singhal and Liberty had submitted initial expressions of interest in Bhushan Power & Steel. Sanjay Singhal was disqualified after an ordinance amending the bankruptcy code in November prohibited defaulting promoters from bidding for their companies unless they had cleared their arrears.

A person close to the developments said Liberty’s bid delay was due to changes in the bankruptcy regulations. The last amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 was made as recently as on February 6. Bhushan Power & Steel owes close to Rs 48,000 crore to banks and was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal by Punjab National Bank in June last year."
29,2018-02-13,JSW,"MUMBAI/KOLKATA: The race to buy bankrupt Essar Steel has boiled down to just two bidders: billionaire Lakshmi Mittal who built his steel empire by buying up bankrupt companies across the globe, and Numetal Mauritius, a joint venture between Russia’s VTB Bank and Rewant Ruia, a member of the Essar group’s promoter family.

Mittal expressed optimism about the Indian steel industry and said his company, ArcelorMittal, has submitted a detailed plan that would address many of the operational issues that dragged Essar Steel into bankruptcy.

The offer submitted on Monday by ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd (AMIPL) includes a detailed investment plan to address the operational issues in Essar’s existing asset base, Mittal said in a statement. “With our industry expertise and renowned operating prowess, we believe we are uniquely equipped to implement a successful turnaround which would be beneficial to Essar’s stakeholders.”



Other contenders like Tata Steel and mining magnate Anil Agarwal of Vedanta Resources pulled out of the bidding process, after the assets of Essar Steel looked unattractive following an ownership change in a company that is key to Essar Steel’s raw material supply, said two people with knowledge of the matter.

Numetal had recently bought a 70 per cent stake in Orissa Slurry Pipeline India that owns a 253-km slurry pipeline which moves half of Essar Steel’s iron ore. In the absence of the pipeline, it would cost Essar Steel an additional Rs 1,300-2,000 crore a year to transport some 10 million tonne of raw material to its plant. It will also be difficult for any new player to operate the Essar Steel plant at Hazira without access to the pipeline.

A Vedanta executive said the company was not keen on a bid, while a Tata Steel spokesperson said, “We do not have anything to comment.” A JSW Steel spokesperson said the company did not bid for Essar Steel.

Both AMIPL and Numetal have deposited Rs 500 crore each in an escrow account to convey their interest in Essar Steel.

“Essar provides a compelling opportunity for ArcelorMittal to enter the high-growth Indian steel market,” the company statement said.

Details of the bids from Numetal and ArcelorMittal are not known immediately.

Lenders led by State Bank of India are looking to recover Rs 49,000 crore from Essar Steel.

Mittal said Essar benefited immensely from its global expertise.

“Essar would also have access to the deep bench of technical expertise and knowledge from across the group which is unparalleled in the steel industry,” said Mittal."

The resolution professionals and the respective Committee of Creditors of the debt-laden firms will evaluate the bids and review the resolution plans submitted by the bidders, the source added.

According to reports, Indian-origin businessman Sanjeev Gupta-led Liberty House is considering bidding for assets of both the firms.

After this, there will be a final meeting in the second half of next week where a decision is expected to be taken, the source added.

One of the bidders said it is ""surprised to see a foreign company trying to enter the (bid) process even after the biddings have been closed.""

The source also said ""rebidding for the assets can also be discussed. They (Liberty) are saying lenders have allowed them to bid.""

The last date for bidding for Bhushan Steel was February 3, while that for Bhushan Power and Steel was February 8.

JSW Steel and Tata Steel have submitted bids for both the firms.

Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power were among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India for National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings and owe an amount of Rs 44,478 crore and 38,248 crore to their lenders.

The insolvency process was filed by State Bank of India (SBI), the lead bank of the consortium of lenders, in the case of Bhushan Steel while a similar plea was filed by Punjab National Bank (PNB) against Bhushan Steel and Power."
32,2018-02-15,JSW,"UK-based Liberty House on Wednesday confirmed its intent to put in a bid for Bhushan Power & Steel, but the person in charge of the debt resolution process at the company said there was no plan to extend the bidding deadline that had already passed.

“Liberty House will be bidding for Bhushan Power & Steel and in the coming few weeks we will be submitting (a bid for) the same,” a spokesperson for the industrial and metals company said in an emailed statement.

ET reported on Wednesday about a letter that Liberty House had written to Bhushan Power & Steel’s resolution professional Mahender Khandelwal, saying it “was interested in submitting a viable and competitive resolution plan for the company”. It also sought more time to make an offer.

The deadline for submitting bids lapsed on February 8, with Tata Steel and JSW Steel being the only bidders left in the fray.

Speaking to ET on Wednesday, Khandelwal said the deadline would remain the same and “if anyone has another impression, it would be incorrect”.

The next step in the process is opening of the bids that he has already received, Khandelwal said. That is likely to happen on February 23.

Liberty House has been dubbed an acquirer of stressed assets, after it made a string of acquisitions in Europe and Australia.

In India, it submitted a revised bid for Amtek Auto last week and is also preparing a bid for ABG Shipyard. The company said it was “assessing various avenues towards putting a strategy together for the bid for Bhushan Power & Steel”.

Bhushan Power owes close to.`48,000 crore to lenders, of which State Bank of India is the largest. The debt resolution process was handed over to the resolution professional last June."

Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 80.50 points, or 0.77 per cent, higher at 10,543.50, indicating a positive opening start for the Nifty50 in India. Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session:


Sun Pharma: India’s largest drug maker reported 75 per cent year-on-year fall in its net profit for the quarter ended December, but managed a marginal improvement in profitability compared to the first two quarters of this fiscal even as US sales continue to trail.

Religare Enterprises: Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh have resigned from the board of Religare Enterprises , less than a week after they quit the board of Fortis Healthcare Limited.


JSW Steel: The country’s most profitable major steel producer plans to raise $1.5 billion, or about Rs 9,620 crore, through overseas borrowings as it looks to buy stressed assets in the industry, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ET. The company is in discussions with investment bankers on whether to go for dollar-denominated bonds or syndicated loans, or a combination of both, they said.


Allahabad Bank: State-run Allahabad Bank slipped into the red with Rs 1,263.8-crore net loss in the third quarter ended December 2017, mainly due to substantially high provisions to cover the risk against loans that were referred to the bankruptcy courts. The bank has kept aside Rs 2,414 crore as provisions other than tax which was 2.7 times higher than what it had provided for in the year-ago period.


Bharti Airtel: The company's Netherlands-based international holding company for its Africa operations is exploring an initial public offer (IPO) in a move aimed at unlocking value of its African telecom assets amid a revival in the Sunil Mittal-led carrier’s business fortunes in the dark continent.


Bank of India: Bank of India, the country’s fourth largest public sector bank with Rs 6.14 lakh crore in assets, will shut three subsidiaries in New Zealand, Botswana and Uganda as it seeks to conserve capital amidst a sharp rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) in the quarter ended December 2017 and struggles to shrug off restrictions placed on it under the prompt corrective action initiated by the Reserve Bank of India.


Jet Airways: Jet Airways
on Friday said its consolidated net profit fell 38 per cent on a tepid operating performance coupled with lower profit of sale and leaseback of planes. India’s second largest airline by market share posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 186 crore in the October-December quarter, compared to Rs 299 crore a year earlier.


Nestle India: Packaged foods maker Nestle India
on Wednesday reported a nearly 60 per cent increase in its fourth quarter net profit, driven by strong volume growth that also pushed its 2017 revenue beyond the Rs 10,000-crore mark. The Indian arm of Switzerland-based Nestle, which makes the Maggi instant noodles and KitKat chocolates, posted a profit of Rs 312 crore for the quarter ended December 312017, compared to Rs 195 crore a year earlier.


GMR Infra: GMR Infrastructure
on Wednesday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 565.9 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The firm had clocked a net profit of Rs 643.4 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2016-17, it said in a BSE filing.


Piramal Enterprises: Piramal Finance, a subsidiary of Piramal Enterprises, has set up a separate vertical to invest in affordable and mid-income residential projects in major metros across the country.

Infibeam: Listed online commerce player Infibeam said it had another strong growth mainly due to its flagship product Infibeam WebServices (IWS), which grew by 252 per cent YoY in Q3 FY18 and generated 45 per cent Ebitda margin. Its consolidated Q3 FY18 revenue grew 108 per cent YoY to Rs 213.5 crore while profit after tax grew by 146 per cent to Rs 30.8 crore.

34,2018-02-15,JSW,"MUMBAI : JSW Steel, the country’s most profitable major steel producer, plans to raise $1.5 billion, or about Rs 9,620 crore, through overseas borrowings as it looks to buy stressed assets in the industry, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ET.

The company is in discussions with investment bankers on whether to go for dollar-denominated bonds or syndicated loans, or a combination of both, they said.

“The company has spoken with at least eight foreign banks,” said one of the persons. To start with, JSW Steel may just borrow about $400 million, or about Rs 2,565 crore, via overseas syndicated loans, sources said. Citi Bank has already been approached for the same, and JSW Steel is now looking to rope in another two or three banks, they said. Both JSW and Citi declined to comment on the matter.

Foreign banks that the company is in talks with want to assess the pricing part of the proposed bond issue, said the person quoted earlier. “With fluctuation in US Treasury yield, the company is buying time to finalise the issuance,” the person said.

It also depends on how JSW manages to emerge successful bidder to acquire those companies.

JSW Steel is in the race to acquire assets of Monnet Ispat and Bhushan Steel, which are being sold in accordance with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. For Monnet Ispat, JSW Steel’s combine with Aion Capital has emerged the only bidder. JSW group is also seen as a potential bidder for many other stressed steel companies.

“There are sophisticated and strategic set of investors globally for stressed assets,” said Babu Sivaprakasam, partner at legal process outsourcing company Economic Laws Practice. “Large corporates that are bidding big time under IBC resolution process need to raise funds to support their proposed acquisitions,” he added. “Such funding may be either through dollar-bonds or overseas syndicated loans, though it can come in through ECB (external commercial borrowing) or FDI (foreign direct investment) route only,” Sivaprakasam said.

Global rating companies Fitch and Moody’s have graded JSW as BB and Ba3 with negative and stable outlook, respectively. An executive aware of the development said: “JSW may take another few weeks to decide on the shape of the overseas bond sales, which are likely to have 5-10-year maturities.” Nearly a month ago, ET reported that Tata Steel had raised $1.3 billion by selling dollar-denominated bonds to overseas investors, who rushed to grab the high-yielding securities. The company obtained oversubscription in excess of $7 billion, reflecting strong investment appetite for such papers. The bonds were in two tranches -- $300 million with 5.5 years maturity, and $1 billion with 10-year maturity. They offered 4.45 per cent and 5.45 per cent, respectively.

During October-December quarter, JSW Steel reported record earnings with net profits exceeding analysts’ expectations by a huge margin, aided by export growth.

During the period, JSW’s consolidated net profit surged by about 148 per cent to Rs 1,774 crore from Rs 716 crore last year, beating Bloomberg estimates of 56 per cent.

“Looking ahead, we expect the company to continue to maintain a similar proportion of value-added products and export sales in its overall sales mix which will support its profitability,” Moody’s Investors Service said in a statement. During Q3 FY18, the company sold around 30 per cent of its volumes in international markets where prices are relatively higher than domestic steel prices."

39,2018-02-17,JSW,"KOKATA: On a day when the Tatas were seen emerging as a frontrunner for Bhushan Steel, the company’s promoter Neeraj Singal questioned the whole process of auctioning off defaulting steel companies through NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal).

“Steel prices have gone up by ?10,000 per tonne in last six months. The entire issue of default resulted from a sectoral problem. It was not a promoter issue in the first place. On top of it came external factors like de-allocation of captive coal blocks. Each and every steel company suffered, except two — JSW Steel and Tata Steel that too because they have access to raw material,” Singal told ET on Friday evening. Along with other steel players we also faced huge competition from cheap steel imports for nearly two years before the government decided to take protective steps like MIP, antidumping duty and safeguard the steel sector, he said.

“Why are banks taking up to 80% haircut when they can recover their entire money in a few years’ time?” he asked.

“We built the company with our sweat and tears. Our lives have been built around the business and this company. I have made an offer to pay back, the entire amount that is due to our lenders in a few years,” he added.

The steel industry needs to be given one chance to restructure, now that there is an upturn in the sector. Steel is a cyclical industry. Every time there is a downturn it needs a bit of restructuring. JSW Steel went through restructuring. Globally too, a number of companies including ArcelorMittal have been restructured, Singal pointed out.

“We, as in the steel industry promoters, are now in a much better position to pay back our lenders. I, for one, want to pay up the entire debt in a few years’ time. The banks should take up equity and take advantage of the upswing in fortunes of the steel industry to recover their money, “ he reasoned.

Some 400 Bhushan employees have also submitted a bid. The employees would pay an amount upfront and later bring in PE investor to pay back the entire debt. The employees, some of whom have been with the company for 20-25 years, feel they are best suited to run it. This kind of bid is perhaps a first for a stressed steel asset undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. Bhushan Steel currently has a run rate of 4 million tonnes. The employees have said are confident of ramping it up to its full capacity of 5 million tonnes, particularly at a time when the steel market has bounced back and demand is strong."

The domestic equity market had a dismal session on Friday. While decoupling from the global markets for all the wrong reasons, the Nifty50 came off 178 points from the high point of the day to end with a net loss of 93.20 points, or 0.88 per cent.

Looking from a technical view point, the Nifty50 failed to sustain itself above the 50-DMA, which stands at 10,590. On the other hand, the index also drifted below the 10,480-10,500 support zone.

Monday's opening will be crucial for the market. Global markets have been stable and if the Nifty sails past the 10,500 mark, it will stay locked in a trading range. However, its failure to move past the 10,500 mark will mean increased possibilities of the Nifty testing its 100-DMA, which stands at 10,388.

On Monday, the 10,500 and 10,565 levels should play out as immediate resistance for the Nifty50. Supports will come in at 10,430 and 10,385 levels.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 39.0182. It shows a bullish divergence. While the Nifty50 formed a fresh 14-period low, the RSI did not. The daily MACD, too, is seen narrowing its trajectory even as it traded below its signal line. An engulfing bearish pattern has emerged on the candles. Since it has emerged during a downtrend, it can potentially mark a temporary bottom.

However, this formation cannot be read in isolation and it requires confirmation on the following day.

Pattern analysis showed the 50-DMA levels have proved to be the resistance levels for the indices, which is a matter of concern. Also, Nifty’s support zone at 10,480-10,500 was compromised to some extent on Friday.

The damage that we saw on Friday was more of sentimental in nature. With the global picture in place and stability prevailing in global markets, we do not expect the Nifty50 to breach the 100-DMA mark, as easily as significant shorts were seen in the system.

Also as we enter the expiry week beginning Monday, some short covering can be expected if the Nifty does not breach the 100-DMA mark. We would still recommend avoiding shorts, preserving liquidity and holding only modest exposures until a confirmed bottom is formed. Stock-specific out-performances are likely to continue.


STOCKS TO WATCH:

Resilient technical setup is seen in stocks like JSW Steel, CG Power, Infosys, BPCL, Biocon, ACC, Natco Pharma, Emami, MM Forgings, JP Associates, Vedanta and Wanbury.

41,2018-02-19,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Tata Steel has emerged a frontrunner to acquire debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel after lenders to the company decided that they would only consider Tata Steel’s offer of Rs. 24,500 crore for further negotiations on Wednesday, setting aside an offer by rival steel-maker JSW Steel that is lower by Rs. 11,500 crores. Tata and JSW were the only two bidders for the company ET reported on 9 February.

Tata Steel’s offer includes an upfront payment to lenders of Rs. 17,000 crores, a cash infusion in the company of Rs. 7000 crores to meet working capital requirements and a payout to operational creditors as well as employees.

Tata Steel may be asked to sweeten its deal further, after which lenders would put its offer to a vote before submitting it to the National Company Law Tribunal for approval.

There was consensus amongst a majority of lenders that Tata Steel’s offer and accompanying resolution plan was in the best interest of all stakeholders, a banker privy to the process said. The offer would help lenders maximize recovery of their dues.

Bhushan Power and Steel was admitted to bankruptcy court in June last year. Mahender Khandelwal, head of restructuring services at BDO is the resolution professional for the company.

A Tata Steel spokesperson told ET on 18 January in response to queries pertaining to its interest in acquiring Bhushan Power and Steel, ""As a process, we do assess and evaluate various strategic opportunities for growth. This is an ongoing process in the company"". The company was yet to respond to emailed queries sent on Saturday.

Alvarez & Marsal are the financial advisors to Tata Steel. Law firm AZB and Partners are its legal advisors.

Bhushan Power and Steel is owned by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that owns listed-Bhushan Steel which is also undergoing insolvency proceedings. ET reported in its edition on 17th February that Tata Steel had emerged the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel as well.

The unlisted Bhushan Power and Steel has a capacity to produce 3.2 million tonnes per anum of steel and also owns a 700 megawatt captive power plant.

Tata Steel will have to approach the anti-trust regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) for approval post its offer being accepted by the bankruptcy court. An acquisition of both Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel could give the company an almost 50% share of the market for flat-steel products in India, according to a senior executive at a rival steel-maker. Flat-steel products are used in manufacturing of automobiles and consumer appliances among various other uses.

The auction for Bhushan Power and Steel received interest from as many as 12 bidders initially, including ArcelorMittal, Vedanta, AION Capital and Dubai-based businessman Shaikh Ayub. Tata and JSW were the only two bidders that it made it to the final stages of bidding.

UK-based Liberty House expressed its interest to make a bid for the company post the deadline for submission of final offers. Its offer was unlikely to be accepted by the committee of creditors as it would violate the conditions for bidding that were part of the request for proposal document, according to a person directly in the know.

Liberty House was free to approach the National Company Law Tribunal to consider its request, the person said.

A consortium comprising over two dozen banks are owed Rs. 48,524 crores by the debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel. Punjab National Bank leads the lenders consortium though state Bank of India has disbursed the largest proportion of loans to the company."

43,2018-02-19,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group : Tata Steel’s anticipated acquisition of Bhushan Steel would be a good strategic fit for the country’s largest steel producer.

Although its reported bid for the company’s 5 million tonne capacity at Rs 35,000 crore plus 12.2 per cent equity is way higher than what JSW Steel has offerred, the benefits for Tata Steel could derive from this is also much higher. In the short term, the expected rise in debt could be a point of concern for investors, but the acquisition would accrue strong synergies in the long run.

Firstly, Tata Steel is the lowest-cost iron ore producer in the world, thanks to its own mines. It can use that ore for Bhushan Steel’s plants, thus generating higher profits from the same assets.

Currently, Bhushan Steel is operating at around 58 per cent capacity utilisation and its operating profit (EBITDA) per tonne is Rs 7,800. If acquired, Tata Steel could take this to as high as Rs 10,000 per tonne. Capacity utilisation could go upto 100 per cent gradually. To illustrate, the operating profit from Tata Steel’s Indian operations was Rs 14,000 per tonne in the December quarter.

Secondly, the acquisition of Bhushan would strengthen Tata’s foothold in the auto grade steel industry and give it greater access to the Northern market. Auto steel, a high margin segment is around 20-25 per cent of the total Tata Steel revenues and with Bhushan’s acquisition it could go up significantly. Bhushan Steel’s Ghaziabad plant supplies to clients such as Maruti Suzuki. It also has a plant at Khopoli, Maharashtra which has good proximity to auto manufacturing hubs such as Pune and Gujarat.

Lastly, it will allow the largest steel producer to achieve its ambitious target of doubling its capacity by 2022. Currently, Tata Steel has operational capacity of 13 MTPA and the board has approved a brown field expansion of another 18 MTPA. That could rise to 23 MTPA with the acquisition.

The acquisition would increase Tata Steel’s net debt to near Rs 1 lakh crore from Rs 76,000 crore in the end of December 2017, even after a rights issue of Rs 13,000 crore. Higher debt and earnings dilution could lead to a short term concern for the investors and thus keep the stock price under pressure.

On the valuation front too, at Rs 35,000 crore and 12.2 per cent equity, the deal appears expensive. Assuming that Tata Steel would improve Bhushan’s profitability to Rs 10,000 per tonne EBITDA, the stock is trading at 8.5-9 times EV/ EBITDA. Other steel companies are trading at levels of 6.5-7.5 times."

Based on the recommendations of various broking houses, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 11 to 21 sessions.


Analyst: Jay Thakkar, AVP – Equity Research, Anand Rathi 


Britannia | Buy | Target price: Rs 5,100 | Stop loss: Rs 4,670
This stock seems to have completed a wave 4 correction in an A-B-C Zigzag corrective pattern wherein wave B was a symmetrical Triangular pattern. It has fallen in a downward sloping parallel channel and a breakout from the same has come on the upside. The daily and monthly momentum indicator MACD has come into buy mode whereas the weekly indicator seems to be reversing from the zero reference line. 


Analyst: Gajendra Prabu, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities

Amara Raja Batteries | Buy | Target price: Rs 940 | Stop loss: Rs 760
This stock has started a fresh rising leg from the low of 720 which is end of either “wave b/ii”. Price is finding support at the key moving average i.e. 200-day EMA, and has also almost covered the gap witnessed on February 12, 2018. This gap area would be a cluster support and it could provide strength to the stock to move up further in coming sessions. In addition price has validated the last week’s piercing line candle pattern (Moved above pattern’s high) on weekly chart which is a bullish reversal confirmation. In bigger picture, price is in internals of major “wave V” and has good upside potential. “Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price (CMP) and add in dips to Rs 790 for the upside target of Rs 940 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 760,” said Prabhu.


Godfrey Phillips | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,015 | Stop loss: Rs 820
This stock has been forming a contracting triangle in bigger picture, a multi-year pattern started from Dec 2015. Now price is in last leg of the triangle i.e. “wave e”.

The price started gaining momentum from the recent low of Rs 825 levels. RSI oscillator is rebounding from the overbought territory which is bullish development. Apart from this, major “wave v” has begun to unfold and the stock has fair potential to make new life high in the long run. For short term buying can be initiated at CMP and added in dips to Rs 850 for the upside target of Rs 1,015 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stoploss at Rs 820.


Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 349 | Stop loss: Rs 300
In the present uncertain market conditions this counter is registering new life time highs suggesting that it has decoupled itself and can move higher based on its own inherent strength. “Last one year price action chalked out a well defined ascending channel on weekly charts with multiple touch points based on which we can project a modest target of Rs 345 going forward in next couple of weeks. Hence, positional traders should go long with a stop below Rs 300 on closing basis for an initial target of Rs 349,” said Mohammad.


Kotak Mahindra Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,110 | Stop loss: Rs 1,020
This counter appears to have made a decent bottom around Rs 1,028 level and making an attempt to bounce from the basing formation it made last seven sessions. Despite Friday’s attempt to bounce was aborted this counter still managed to close in positive zone. Hence, traders should make use of this opportunity to go long for targets of Rs 1,110 with a stop below Rs 1,020 on closing basis. 


Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities 

CESC | Buy | Target price: Rs 1130-1190 | Stop loss: Rs 935
CESC has retraced 40 per cent of prior down-move, where its long-term moving averages worked as key reversal point. In the past, such kind of reversal from its long-term moving average turned out well for the stock. Major technical indicators are bullish and in favour of a probable up-move.


HDFC Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,020 | Stop loss: Rs 1,830
The stock is oscillating between its medium-term and long-term moving averages after witnessing sharp decline from its life-time- high. Due to undergoing consolidation, the key technical indicators reversed from their lower levels. “We believe the stock will soon surpass near-term hurdles and record new high,” said Jain.


Siemens | Buy| Target price: Rs 1,420-1,460 | Stop loss: Rs 1,200
The stock has retraced 60 per cent of prior up-move and later consolidated between its major daily moving averages. Recent rebound in the stock price helped the key technical indicators to move upward from their lower levels.


Brokerage: Prabhudas Lilladher

PI Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 960 | Stop loss: Rs 830
The stock has made a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart after the correction from the peak of Rs 1,034 and has now indicated a positive bullish candle to signify strength and potential to rise further in the coming days. Technical indicators have turned favourable with the RSI showing a trend reversal, indicating a good revival from the oversold zone and on the rise showing a positive bias. With good volume participation witnessed, Prabhudas Lilladher recommends a buy in this stock with an upside target of Rs 960 keeping a stop loss of Rs 830.


Power Grid | Buy | Target price: Rs 215 | Stop loss: Rs 188

I am Swati Verma getting you a synopsis of the day's trading, with views and insights from top-notch market analysts.

The decoupling effect was on show as Indian shares fell through the cracks for the second session in a row, in a break with the global rally. PNB was a big drag again as the ambit of the probe into the massive banking scam widened. Other PSU banks felt the squeeze.

The Nifty index formed a 'Bearish Belt Hold ' pattern on the daily chart today.

The 30-share Sensex lost 236 points at 33,775 and the 50-share Nifty settled fell 0.71 per cent to 10,378.

The selloff infected BSE midcap and small cap indices more, which dropped by up to 1.05 per cent. 

VIX, the fear barometer, went up, suggesting that volatility is just refusing to go away. 

The final picture at the Nifty50 is 37 declined and 13 advanced.

49,2018-02-19,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Investors’ depression on Dalal Street just doesn’t seem to get over. At a time when global markets have got back to the recovery path and Wall Street is once again making headlines for all the right reasons, domestic equities have lost the momentum owing to back-to-back adverse events.

The S&P BSE Sensex on Monday ended 236 points lower to 33,774 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) failed to hold above the 10,400 level to settle at 10,378, down 74 points.

“As the aftershock of the banking fraud continued to send out ripples across stocks, the risk appetite remained low. Derivatives expiry will now be under focus, with LTCG compulsions still capping gains, but upcoming GST meeting and FPI-friendly measures from Sebi may rekindle buying interest,” said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.


Here’s a look at all the newsmakers that caught investors’ fancy in an otherwise weak market.


Deep in the red!
Marred by Rs 11,400 crore scam, Punjab National Bank shed another 7 per cent to settle at Rs 116.40 on BSE, thus extending the losing spree to fourth session. During intraday trade, the Nifty PSU Bank index tanked 6 per cent. However, it recovered later in the day to settle at 3,110.65, down 2.46 per cent. All but 1 constituents ended in the red.

52,2018-02-20,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The average shares pledged by promoters of top 500 companies listed on the BSE dropped to 7.8 per cent in October-December from 8.3 per cent in the preceding three months, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities Research.

Promoters pledged shares worth Rs 1.98 lakh crore, about 1.47 per cent of the total BSE-500 Index's market capitalisation in December 2017.

According to the report, promoters of 129 companies pledged their holdings among BSE-500 index stocks, with nine firm, having more than 90 per cent of their promoter holdings pledged.

The companies whose promoters pledged more than 95 per cent of their holdings are Bajaj Hindustan, CG Power and Industrial, Reliance Naval and Engineering, JBF Industries, Suzlon Energy, IL&FS Transportation Networks and Fortis Healthcare, the report noted.

""The percentage of promoter pledged holding reduced to 7.8 per cent in December from 8.3 per cent in September,"" the report noted.

During the quarter under review, promoters of Granules India, Future Lifestyle, Reliance Communications, Crompton Greaves Consumer and Bombay Burmah were found to have decreased their pledged holdings.

On the other hand, the highest increase in promoters' pledged holdings was witnessed in companies like JSW Steel, DB Corp, Mcleod Russel, Max Financial Services and Reliance Power.

""Pledging of shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoters' shares,"" it added.

Companies in the Nifty-50 with more than 5 per cent of pledged promoter holdings are Adani Ports & SEZ (24.7 per cent), followed by Asian Paints (14 per cent ), Indiabulls Housing Finance (12.5 per cent), M&M (5.8 per cent), Tata Motors (5.3 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (45.7 per cent), the report noted."
53,2018-02-20,JSW,"After remaining rangebound with modest gains for most part of the session on Tuesday, the benchmark Nifty50 pared its gains rapidly in the last hour of the trade. It ended negative losing 18 points or 0.17 per cent. Going into trade on Wednesday, we enter the penultimate day of expiry of current derivative series. We expect a tepid start to the trade and also expect volatility to remain ingrained in the session.

In our previous note, we had elaborated on the behavior of the market vis-à-vis the levels of 100-DMA and the support zone of 10,300-10,276. Wednesday’s market analysis will remain no different. Nifty has ended a notch below 100-DMA mark which stand at 10,398. But it has remained within its filters and its behavior vis-à-vis the support zone of 10,276-10,300 would be extremely crucial.

The levels of 10,395 and 10,450 will play out as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports come in at 10,310 and 10,275 zones.

The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 35.4477. It has once again shown a Bullish Divergence against the Nifty. Nifty has formed a fresh 14-period low while RSI has not done so. Daily MACD stays bearish trading below its signal line. No significant formation were observed on Candles.



While having a look at pattern analysis, Nifty failed to clear the resistance area of 10,480-10,500 and while retracing from those levels, also slipped below the 100-DMA mark of 10,398.

However, it stays within its filter and trades near important short term support zone.

Overall, if we take an extremely short term view, persistent Bullish Divergences on the lead indicators reflect the struggle and the attempts of the Nifty to find a base around current levels. However, for this to happen, it will have to move past the 100-DMA mark comfortable and advance further towards 50-DMA. Unless this happens, Nifty will remain at the mercy of the immediate support zone of 10,300-10,275. Any breach of this will bring in fresh weakness.

There are large numbers of shorts opening up in the system. Looking at this input and coupled with the fact that Nifty currently trades near to its short term support, we do not recommend opening fresh aggressive shorts in the markets. We recommend staying away from creating major exposures and continue to make select quality purchases in select sectors wherein relative outperformance will be seen.

54,2018-02-20,JSW,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel, India’s oldest producer of the alloy, plans to raise up to $800-900 million through overseas borrowings to replace expensive debt and to raise cash for buying stressed local mills, two people familiar with the matter told ET.

The fresh round of fund raising comes amid a Rs 12,800-crore rights issue that closes the end of this month at the Tata group major.

“Tata Steel officials are in advanced negotiations with at least half a dozen banks, though an official mandate is yet to be signed. However, the intent is to complete the capital raising exercise before March 31,” said one of the sources cited above.

Tata Steel didn’t comment.

A foreign bank loan is priced by adding a spread above the benchmark LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). The whole sum is normally raised from a group of foreign lenders. Overseas loans are seen gaining traction, with many large companies opting for them.

Tata Steel is seen as a major contender for buying stressed assets, such as Bhushan Steel or Bhushan Power. At the same time, the century-old company is expanding its business.

“Tata Steel is actually encouraged by the response from its earlier round of fund raising,” said another source.

The issue would be different from the company’s $2.5-billion loan recast. Earlier last month, ET reported that Tata Steel raised $1.3 billion by selling dollar-denominated bonds to overseas investors, who rushed to grab the high-yielding securities. It obtained oversubscription in excess of $7 billion, reflecting strong investment appetite for such papers. The Tatas are refinancing around $1.5 billion loans housed in its Singapore subsidiaries such as TS Global Holdings Pte and NatSteel Asia Pte.

Abja Investment Co Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, was the actual issuer of the bonds, rated as BB- by S&P, two notches lower than investment grade.

JSW Steel, another large steel company, is also planning to raise $1.5 billion, or about Rs 9,620 crore, through overseas syndicated loans as it looks to buy stressed assets in the industry, ET reported on February 15.

The Tatas and JSW are some of the firms aggressively bidding for debt-laden assets, which lenders have put on block to recover their loans."
55,2018-02-21,JSW,"After conveying its intent last week to be allowed to participate as a late bidder for Bhushan Power and Steel, UK-based Liberty House has submitted a bid on Tuesday to the resolution professional, said people aware of the matter.

This, however, does not guarantee that the bid will be accepted as it has come after the deadline of February 8.

Accordingly, a meeting of the committee of creditors (CoC) will take place on Wednesday to discuss both the eligibility of the Liberty House bid as well as to review the plan submitted by Tata Steel that has emerged as the frontrunner by trumping JSW Steel in the race for the asset.

Liberty House confirmed that it has submitted a bid. ""We have presented our interest today,"" said a Liberty House spokesperson. The steelmaker has in the past shown expertise in buying assets and turning them around and also bought Corus from Tata Steel last year. ""We have conveyed to the RP that we are integration experts and when we buy assets, we work on them in a very different way,"" said the spokesperson. ""A plan coming from an expert will hold more equity as we have done it in the past.”

Liberty House had conveyed its interest to resolution professional Mahender Khandelwal last week, saying that ""it was interested in submitting a viable and competitive resolution plan for the company.""

However, Khandelwal had later said that the deadline would remain the same and if anybody has another impression, it would be incorrect.

Accepting a bid past the deadline could violate conditions in request for proposal document circulated to prospective bidders for Bhushan Power prior to the deadline for submission of final offers, according to a person directly in the know.

Liberty House may approach National Company Law Tribunal to consider its bid if its offer is not accepted at the creditors’ meeting on Wednesday.

ETon Monday reported Tata Steel has emerged as the frontrunner and that the lenders will now only consider the Tata bid. Tata Steel has made an offer of ₹24,500 crore, which includes an upfront payment to lenders of ₹17,000 crore.

JSW Steel's bid trailed the Tatas by ₹11,500 crore.

BPSL owes about ₹48,000 crore to lenders, of which State Bank of India is the largest. It was referred to the NCLT by Punjab National Bank for insolvency resolution last June."

The Nifty50 index remained volatile in a broader trading range between 10,350 and 10,426 on Wednesday. It traded inside the trading range of last session and formed an Inside Bar on the daily scale. The index recovered smartly from the lows and formed a Hammer Candle on the daily chart, which indicates that the decline got bought into.

Now, if it manages to hold above 10,430, then a short-term bounce could take it to 10,480 and 10,500 levels, while holding below 10,350 could extend its weakness towards 10,300 and 10,276 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,300 followed by 10,000, while maximum Call OI was at 10,500 followed by 11,100. Call writing was seen at 10,450 followed by 10,500 while significant Put writing was seen at strike price 10,300 followed by 10,400. The option band signified a trading range between 10,300 and 10,480 levels.

India VIX fell 5.61 per cent to 15.92. The decline in the VIX reduced the pace of selling pressure in the market.

Bank Nifty managed to close in the positive after a decline in last three sessions and formed a small Hammer candle after the steep fall of last few sessions. Bank Nifty has been underperforming the Nifty index and now needs to hold above 25,250 to trigger a short-term trend reversal, while a hold below 25,000 could drag it towards 24,750 and then 24,500 levels.

Reuters reported last week that the US Department of Commerce had recommended that ""President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas.""

Alternatively, the report said that Commerce recommended a tariff of at least 53 percent on all steel imports from 12 countries -- Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, India, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.

According to a report by the Joint plant Committee, India's imports of finished steel fell by 36% to 7.4 million tonnes in 2016-17 while exports jumped 102% to 8.2 MT. By December, 2017, imports fell to 6.8 MT. China, South Korea and Japan are the three largest exporters of steel to India. 

The government of India had notified in February, 2016 that it had imposed Minimum Import Price (MIP) on steel ranging from $341 to $752 per tonne on 173 steel products. MIP is a measure to protect domestic steel producers by way of imposing a minimum price that importers have to pay while buying steel from abroad. However, MIP can be gradually phased out as and when the situation seems conducive. 

Later in 2016, it had also extended safeguard duty on steel imports until March 2018 to protect the domestic steel industry from cheap imports from China. Starting from 20% till September, 2016, it said the duty will be brought down to 10% by March, 2018."

""Committee of creditors (COC) in a meeting today has rejected the bids of Liberty House (of the UK) because the company submitted the bids after the last date of submission date which was February 8,"" a source privy to the development said.

Liberty House had submitted the bid yesterday, he said.

In today's COC meeting the bids of Tata Steel and JSW Steel were disclosed and now the process as well as legal advisors evaluate them, the source said.

The detailed terms and conditions of the bids were disclosed to the lenders at the meeting, the source said.

Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders.

When contacted, Resolution Professional (RP) Mahender Kumar Khandelwal declined to comment on the developments.

The source said that while Tata Steel offered Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders as upfront amount and Rs 7,200 crore for operations of Bhushan, JSW made an offer of Rs 11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs 2000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm.

The COC will now meet on March 6 to take the process forward, including declaration of the highest bidder.

Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India for National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings.

The insolvency process was filed by State Bank of India (SBI), the lead bank of the consortium of lenders, in the case of Bhushan Steel while a similar plea was filed by Punjab National Bank (PNB) against Bhushan Power and Steel."
60,2018-02-21,JSW,"New Delhi: The consortium of lenders to Bhushan Power & Steel has asked Tata Steel to waive certain conditions in its offer for the company and rejected a late bid by the UK’s Liberty House, people briefed on the matter said.

Liberty House’s bid was rejected because it was submitted on Tuesday, past the February 8 deadline. Liberty House may approach the National Company Law Tribunal to consider its bid, they said.

A Liberty House spokesperson declined comment in response to ET’s queries. Tata Steel’s offer of Rs 24,500 crore beat rival JSW Steel’s bid, making it the front-runner to acquire Bhushan Power & Steel, ET reported on Monday.

The Tata offer is conditional on lenders buying the entire equity of two Bhushan Power subsidiaries – BSE-listed Nova Iron & Steel, with a market capitalisation of about Rs 30 crore, and Ambey Steel & Power, which has a net worth of Rs 60 crore.

At a meeting of the creditors on Wednesday, the lenders said this condition was not reasonable, a banker briefed on the matter said. Tata Steel has been asked to revisit its conditions and come back with a final offer later this week.



Tata Steel offered an upfront cash payment of Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders of unlisted Bhushan Power & Steel, which is owned by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that also owns Bhushan Steel. It offered an additional cash infusion of Rs 7,000 crore in the company for working capital and payments to operational creditors and employees.

Tata Steel also proposed to write off the entire equity of Bhushan Power and issue fresh equity to itself. The lenders have not been offered any equity in the company.

JSW Steel offered Rs 11,000 crore to the lenders in upfront payment, some equity in Bhushan Power and a cash infusion of Rs 2,000 crore as working capital.

Bhushan Power & Steel owes lenders a little over Rs 48,000 crore. Punjab National Bank is the lead lender, although SBI has disbursed the highest proportion of loans."

The steel sector in India, which had been under stress due to lack of demand, is finally picking up. Economic reforms initiated by the government such as minimum import price, anti—dumping and safeguard measures and quality control, have provided extensive support to the industry. Undoubtedly, these measures have added new dimensions to industrial growth in general and steel industry in particular.

The classic example of returning confidence was the recent bidding of acquisition of Bhushan Steel by Tata steel and JSW Steel and JSW Group’s sole bid for Monnet Ispat.

These companies are up for sale as part of the insolvency proceedings. In the race of acquisition of Bhushan Steel and Power, Tata Steel has been the highest bidder.

The steel sector in India, like any major steel producing country, shows a strong co-relation with growth in domestic economy. The steel sector contributes over 2 per cent to the country's GDP.

Also, it could be seen that the domestic auto sector continues to be strong and Capital goods sector has picked-up recently and it is expected that the demand for flat steel will continue to grow from these industries in near future.

The sector is expected to benefit from with ongoing capacity rationalisations in China, the biggest steel producing country. On the pricing front, domestic steel prices have improved in the recent months; however, remain at a discount compared to the international prices. India is witnessing significant interest from international investors in the infrastructure space.

Even European demand outlook looks strong as business confidence is high in mainland EU with Germany in the lead, though the United Kingdom remains subdued due to uncertainty.

Factors such as strong demand, improving utilisation levels, support from exports, downside risk mitigation via trade measures and cost advantage due to production from blast furnace will continue to support growth. India has produced 100 million tonnes in calendar 2017 and the outlook looks robust.

Steel production is expected to cross 100 million tonnes this financial year. To conclude, with good raw material supply conditions, a growing market and competent producers, it is expected that India is at the start of a new growth curve.

Though we many not witness it immediately, the fundamental conditions for growth are in place and are positive. One may invest in stocks such as Tata steel and SAIL for the long term..

According to an SBI Research report, December quarter GDP growth number is likely to be in the 6.5-7 per cent range and may expand further in following three months.

73,2018-02-26,JSW,"NEW DELHI: UK-based Liberty House, which saw its bid for acquiring Bhushan Power and Steel being rejected, said it has made a case before National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today and March 5 has been fixed as the next date of hearing.

""The Tribunal has heard us and heard the RP's counsel as well as Tata's counsel who intervened. The Tribunal has deemed it fit that the respondents put their submissions on affidavit explaining conduct of the insolvency process. The parties will now be heard on the 5th (March),"" Liberty House said in a statement.

""We are hopeful that our bona fide will stand out,"" the statement said.

Liberty House also explained to the NCLT that it wants to do business in India as there is no better time than this, the company's spokesperson said.

The matter, the spokesperson said, is sub judice and ""we have full faith in NCLT"".

The company had earlier said that it was planning to move NCLT this week to direct creditors and resolution professional to consider its offer.

Terming itself as a ""turnaround specialist"", the company had said that it has more than two dozen turnaround success stories in the last three years and an ""impeccable track record"".

The Committee of Creditors had last week rejected the bid of Liberty House to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm, a source said.

COC in a meeting had rejected the bids of Liberty House because ""it submitted the bids after the last date of submission, which was February 8"", a source privy to the development had said earlier.

The bids of Tata Steel and JSW Steel were disclosed at the meeting and the detailed terms and conditions of the bids were shared with the lenders, the source had said.

Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders.

When contacted, Resolution Professional (RP) Mahender Kumar Khandelwal had declined to comment on the developments.

According to the source, while Tata Steel offered Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders as upfront amount and Rs 7,200 crore for operations of Bhushan, JSW made an offer of Rs 11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs 2,000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm.

The COC will now meet on March 6 to take the process forward, including declaration of the highest bidder.

Bhushan Power and Steel was among the 12 non-performing accounts (NPAs) referred by the Reserve Bank of India for NCLT proceedings."
74,2018-02-26,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Tata Steel's bidding for Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel is nothing new for the Tata Group firm, which has a history of aggressively pursuing growth opportunities over the last decade.

But this time, there are concerns that the firm may end up shelling out higher-than-perceived price for the two stressed companies, just when things were looking up for the steelmaker. The firm had recently hived off its European business and prepared a blueprint to ramp up production at Kalinganagar plant.


ValuationsTata Steel had submitted Rs 24,500-crore bid for Bhushan Power against JSW's Rs 11,000 crore bid. The steelmaker also had reportedly bade Rs 35,000-crore for Bhushan Steel, which is higher than JSW's Rs 29,700 crore bid.

Market watchers tracking the sector believes that the valuations (EV/tonne) for the two non-integrated flat steel product producers, estimated at $1,125-1,225 per tonne based on various media reports, would be higher than the industry standard of $1,000 per tonne for an integrated plant. Even phase-II expansion at Kalinganagar plant is valued at $750 per tonne.

Investors may fail to ascribe a value to this strategic deal in the short-term, they say, even as it will help the company double its capacity by FY22 to become the largest domestic steelmaker.

""The market was thinking that the stressed assets will be sold out for a very low value. The only issue is that the market participants do not have that kind of long-term view and, therefore, they would take it with little bit of pinch of salt in the short term,"" Rakesh Arora, MD, Go India Advisor told ET Now.


Debt trapWith the acquisition, the debt of Tata Steel is seen peaking at Rs 92,000-1,00,000 crore. But setting up new greenfield projects too isn't easy.

Many big steelmakers such as JSW Steel, Essar Steel, Ispat Industries and Sail have in the past plunged into debt trap, thanks to project delays, high interest cost and cyclical nature of the steel industry, Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.

""Despite strong free cash flows from Jamshedpur, Tata Steel too faced multiple delays, escalation of project cost and a drag on its balance sheet for its Kalinganagar project in Odisha. These sites have been able to create shareholder value because their incremental specific capex is lower,"" it noted.

The brokerage believes that Tata Steel can leverage its captive iron ore mines and drive market synergies.


Strategic senseThe acquisitions may help Tata Steel raise production capacity to 21 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) from the current 13 MTPA. Edelweiss Securities see ebitda for the steelmaker improving to Rs 11,000 per tonne (from Rs 7,800 per tonne at 58-60 per cent utilisation rate) through enhanced capacity utilisation, efficient raw material sourcing and operating synergies, the company's market leadership in automotive steel segment and possibility of further brownfield expansion at Bhushan Steel.

""Bhushan Steel has got value added plants at Ghaziabad as well as Khopoli which are generating profits. It is very active in auto sector as well as other value-added products. Besides, the commodity cycle has undergone a change, especially in regard to developments in China. In addition, Tata Steel would have factored in the synergies in terms of raw material linkage from their mines as well as other synergies in terms of logistics, procurement as well as marketing,"" SK Roongta, Former Chairman, SAIL & Industry Expert told ET Now.


Global steel price on a riseSteel prices are on a rise following the imposition of output cuts by China to help meet emissions targets during the winter months from mid-November to mid-March. 

Fitch Ratings in a note pointed out that hot-rolled steel sheet spot prices in China have increased to $650/tonne from around $450 in April 2017 on improved demand-supply scenario and increase in raw material costs.

Besides, China this month said that it may meet its target for reducing steel capacity by 150 million tonnes in 2018, two years earlier than previously planned.

""Fitch believes steel prices may rise over the next couple of months while producers gradually ramp up output, though they are likely to reduce thereafter,"" it said.


What analysts sayAt the prevailing price, the stock is trading at 5.5 times FY20E ebitda, which should rise to 6.5-6.6 times in FY20 due to higher leverage if the transaction is successful, said Edelweiss Securities. The brokerage has a 'Buy' rating on the stock.

Motilal Oswal Securities says the two companies can produce 7-8 million tonnes saleable steel with current facilities. The business models are similar to JSW Steel. Operating cost for JSW Steel is lower as its furnaces are much larger, while it pays slightly more for iron ore due to its location. JSW Steel pays less outward freight due to proximity to market, the brokerage noted.

""Therefore, we believe the two firms' ebitda per tonne are likely to be either same or a tad lower than JSW Steel's margins of Rs 7,000-9,000 across cycle. Assuming Rs 8,000 average ebitda per tonne across the cycle, the valuation at 8.5 times EV/ebitda appears expensive compared to sector average of 6 to 7 times. The target price may get eroded by 13 per cent to Rs 677,"" the brokerage said while maintaining a neutral stance on the stock.

According to DK Aggarwal, Chairman and Managing Director of SMC Investments and Advisors, the steel sector in India, which had been under stress due to lack of demand, is finally picking up. Economic reforms initiated by the government have provided extensive support to the industry.

“Though we many not witness it immediately, the fundamental conditions for growth are in place and are positive. One may invest in stocks such as Tata steel and SAIL for the long term,” Aggarwal added."
75,2018-02-26,JSW,"The domestic equity market saw a relatively stable and steady session on Monday. The benchmark Nifty enjoyed a positive opening as the session progressed and steadied further to end with a gain of 91.55 points or 0.87 per cent.

Technically important thing to note was that the index managed to open and move past beyond the 10,500-mark. Therefore, these levels of 10,480-10,500 will act as support area for the immediate short term.

Going into trade on Tuesday, we can expect a quiet start to the session. As we approach the 50-DMA mark of 10,617, we expect some minor consolidation to happen. It will be important to see if the market will keep inching higher or consolidate again with the level of 10,617 acting as resistance.

Tuesday’s trade will see the levels of 10,615 and 10,650 acting as likely resistance area for the market. Supports will come in at 10,550 and 10,490 levels.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 50.2279 and it has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish. Daily MACD is sharply moving towards positive crossover and we may see this happening in coming days. On the candles, a rising window occurred. This is usually a gap and often results into continuation of up move.

While having a look at pattern analysis, it is observed that Nifty has defended and revalidated support of 100-DMA at the closing levels. Also, it is likely to resist to 50-DMA, which stand at 10,617.

However, over the past few days, Nifty has formed a small congestion zone. Overall, though some consolidation is likely, but in all probabilities Nifty has formed a base in the support area zone of 10,276-10,300 levels, and is likely to inch higher from current levels.

The congestion zone looks like an accumulation. It is likely that post some minor consolidation, if any, we will see the Nifty inching higher, moving out of this congestion area. This will result into confirmation of the current support levels.

We recommend approaching the market with a highly stock specific view and maintain a cautiously positive view for the day.

Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical & Derivatives, Angel Broking 

Tata Motors | Buy | Target price: Rs 378 |Stop loss: Rs 350
This stock has been one of the underperformers over the past 18 months and is now trading around its 52-week low. However, if we look at the weekly chart we can see a strong support zone of multi-year lows along with the ’89-EMA’ on the monthly chart. “Considering the extreme oversold condition of momentum oscillators in all time frames, we expect a decent bounce back rally in this stock. Hence, we would like to advise a contradictory buy for a target of Rs 378 over the next few days. The stop loss now can be fixed at Rs. 350,” said Chavan.


Analyst: Vinay Rajani, Technical Analyst, PCG Desk, HDFC Securities

HCL Infosystems | Buy | Target price: Rs 70 | Stop loss: Rs 60.50
This stock is on the verge of giving highest monthly close since November 2014. On a month-till-date, the counter has risen 19 per cent with the robust volumes. The stock has broken out from long-term downward sloping trend line on the monthly charts. Oscillators have turned bullish on daily and weekly charts. The stock is trading above its 20, 50, 100 and 200 DMA, which indicates bullish setup for medium to long term.


Ashok Leyland | Buy | Target price: Rs 143 | Stop loss: Rs 129
Ashok Leyland is one of the few large-cap automobile stock, which has managed to sustain around its all-time, even when the market was passing through the bearish phase in the recent past. The stock has been consolidating for last 5 sessions in the range of 130-135. However looking at the overall trend, it is likely to resume its uptrend in the coming sessions. Short term moving averages have been holding above medium to long-term moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.


Analyst: Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities

Bajaj Finance | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,795 | Stop loss: Rs 1,555
Bajaj Finance has retraced 38.2% of prior up-move and witnessed decent rebound from its lower levels. In the past, such kind of reversal from its long-term retracement turned out well for the stock. Major technical indicators like RSI and MACD are in sync for an upward breakout.


Cadila Healthcare | Buy | Target price: Rs 450| Stop loss: Rs 375
This stock has witnessed decent rebound from its current month lows. Major technical indicators are oscillating around their neutral level, signalling lack of selling interest in the stock. Positive sectoral outlook and low-risk set-up are indicating that the stock will once again bounce back.


ICICI Prudential Life Insurance |Buy | Target price: Rs 465 | Stop loss: Rs 375
This stock is making higher bottoms and withholding the supports of its short and medium-term averages. It has made a round saucer bottom over the last 6 months and will continue to find major support at the lower end of the range. Key technical indicators RSI has turned upwards with some positive momentum on the higher side.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist - Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Kaveri Seeds | Buy | Target price: Rs 560 | Stop loss: Rs 447
Ten days of consolidation in the zone of 488-450 paved the way for a decent breakout on relatively higher volumes which erased all the losses witnessed in this zone in a single trading session suggesting that a fresh leg of uptrend kicked in this counter. However, as the stock is almost up by around 7 per cent minor dips or consolidation can't be ruled out. Hence, positional traders need to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying at the current market price and adding further on dips close to Rs 477 levels. Once the rally gets extended logically it should test its 200 Day Moving Average whose value is placed around Rs 564. Hence positional traders are advised to buy for a target of Rs 560 with a stop loss of Rs 447.


NCC | Buy | Target price: Rs 140 | Stop loss: Rs 120
From a recent low of Rs 101, after testing its 200-day moving average, this counter appears to have kicked in a fresh leg of an upswing. Friday's move after six days of pause is suggesting that this counter is again positioning itself for resumption of its upmove. In that case, it should ideally head to test its interim top of 141 from where it tumbled down to 101 levels. Hence, traders should make use of this pause to go long for a target of Rs 140 with a stop loss below Rs 120 on closing basis. 


DCB Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 179 | Stop loss: Rs 159
In a two-week consolidation phase, this counter is attracting buying around Rs 162 levels as it is repeatedly recovering after testing this price point. Once it resumes its upmove it can head to test its 200 moving average from the base of Rs 162 levels. Positional traders in anticipation of a breakout should go long for a target of Rs 179 with a stop of Rs 159.


Analyst: Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory

Bajaj Auto | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,080 | Stop loss: Rs 2,950
After testing the high of Rs 3,468, this stock failed to achieve a clean breakout from multiple resistance area of 3,370-3,400 zone. The stock has seen a sharp corrective move over past couple of days and now looks ripe for a technical pullback. Though the stock has slipped below its 200-DMA levels, it remained grossly oversold on Stochastic. The Daily RSI is refused to get oversold and has been persistently showing bullish divergence against the price. A buy signal has occurred over Daily Stochastic. Some uptick in prices cannot be ruled out over coming days.


Emami | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,105 | Stop loss: Rs 1,055
This stock also witnessed a sharp corrective decline over recent times after testing highs of Rs 1,365. A couple of signals have emerged which point towards likely technical pullback in this stock. After testing lows of Rs 1,025, the stock has attempted to find a temporary bottom for itself.

Just as a bunch of high-value assets are about to exit India's fledgling bankruptcy process, it appears founders won't relinquish control of their steel, power and cement plants without exhausting every last legal trick in the book. 

A knot of clumsily crafted eligibility rules introduced by the government in November have become a thorn in the side of bidders like ArcelorMittal. 

The idea behind restricting the playing field was to ensure that stressed assets don't end up with the same business families who choked the state-dominated banking system with $207 billion in bad loans. The net effect may be just the opposite.

Disqualifying winning bids -- or tying them up in legal knots -- is what rival suitors and erstwhile controlling shareholders are counting on. If bidding is reopened with more relaxed eligibility norms, that would give them a second chance to buy the assets, perhaps for less.

The biggest loser may be Lakshmi Mittal. The London-based billionaire's ArcelorMittal has had to dump its 29 percent stake in Uttam Galva Steels Ltd., an embattled cold-steel maker, for a token amount so it's no longer a related party to a firm in default. It has done so to avoid being disqualified from bidding for a much larger prize -- the billionaire Ruia brothers' Essar Steel Ltd., which is currently in bankruptcy after failing to service the $8.1 billion it owes creditors.

However, the amended bankruptcy law is quite clear: Before making a bid, Mittal needs to make ""payment of all overdue amounts with interest thereon and charges relating to non-performing asset accounts.""


Bloomberg
Selling one stressed asset, the Ruias are bound to argue, doesn't make Mittal eligible to buy another. Yet, as things stand, the ArcelorMittal bid is higher than that of a consortium led by Russia’s state-controlled VTB Group, which includes the Ruias. Whether the brothers' presence as a minority partner disqualifies that offer is another question. Since there's no third bidder, Essar creditors probably face a long wait before they get a cent of the $6 billion they're hoping to realize.

The bankruptcy resolutions of Binani Cement Ltd., Videocon Industries Ltd. and Jaypee Infratech Ltd. have already got stuck in legal quicksand and, as Dev Chatterjee notes in Business Standard, Essar and Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. are headed the same way.

In the case of Bhushan Power, the challenger is Liberty House U.K. Plc, whose bid was cast aside by the resolution professional appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal because it missed a deadline he had set. Other bids hadn't yet been opened, and creditors wanted to see Liberty's offer, the British company told BloombergQuint, adding that it would contest the ""bizarre system"" where lenders are denied recovery by resolution professionals. 


Bloomberg
Liberty is trying to dislodge the winning bid by Tata Steel Ltd., which is trying to overtake JSW Steel Ltd. as India's No. 1 steelmaker. The Tatas have offered $5.6 billion for Bhushan Steel Ltd., another troubled borrower. That price is almost $1.6 billion more than the closest bid by JSW, according to Business Standard. 

Whoever wins, it's crucial for creditors that the sales close quickly, and at a good price. Take state-run Punjab National Bank, hit recently by an embarrassing $1.8 billion fraud. For PNB, being able to cash the Tata check means writing back some of the excess provisions on its Bhushan exposure.

But a whisper campaign is afoot suggesting the Tatas' bid should be disqualified because of a business relationship with C. Sivasankaran, a telecom investor declared bankrupt in the Seychelles in 2014.

That, to me, sounds like a far-fetched argument to take to court. But why blame the bidders for trying? In steel alone, there's at least $26 billion of assets at stake.

Strict eligibility criteria have made it too easy for competitors to narrow the field by pointing the finger. Lawyers will make their money long before India's struggling creditors see a penny.

The committee approved the offer on Monday morning, a person with knowledge of the matter told ET.

The offer entails a payment of Rs 2,450 crore to the lenders and equity funding of Rs 1,050 crore. The company owes Rs 10,237 crore. The remaining debt has been acquired by the consortium for Rs 200 crore.

Aion Capital, a joint venture between ICICI Venture and Apollo Global Management, holds a 70% stake in the consortium and JSW Steel has the remaining 30%. ET had reported in December last year that the consortium was the frontrunner for Monnet Ispat.

The consortium will hold 75% in the company while 18% will be held by lenders and 3% by the existing promoters, it is learnt.

The existing promoters of Monnet Ispat, including founder Sandeep Jajodia and his family, currently hold a 25.27% stake in the company while financial institutions and banks hold 47%.




“JSW will keep Monnet as a separate legal entity but they will ultimately be merged,” a source told ET.

Monnet Ispat owns a 1.5 million tonne integrated steel plant along with an 800,000 tonne sponge iron plant, a 2 million tonne pellet plant, a 960,000 tonne sinter plant and a 230 MW captive power plant in Chhattisgarh.

The company also has 7.5 million tonnes of coal beneficiation facilities in Chhattisgarh and Odisha.

It reported a net loss of Rs 396.6 crore in the October-December quarter. Monnet Ispat’s share closed at Rs 27.80, up 4.32%, on the BSE on Monday while JSW Steel ended at Rs 316, up 2.85%.

According to the RBI, the dozen companies cited above were estimated to account for 25% of gross non-performing assets (NPAs). These companies, including Monnet Ispat, were identified for immediate bankruptcy proceedings in June last year."

84,2018-02-28,JSW,"NEW DELHI: 
After the exclusion of Aurobindo Pharma, it seems that the weightage of pharmaceutical sector in the Nifty50 could slide further this year.


A study by Centrum Broking on potential Nifty50 
exits suggested that three pharma names Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Lupin could be shown the door in the forthcoming index reviews.


Aurobindo
Pharma would cease to be a Nifty50 component from April 2.

""The removal of 
Aurobindo Pharma from Nifty reflects the ongoing pharma sector downturn resulting in only 4 pharma stocks Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and Lupin remaining in Nifty50, with aggregate weightage of mere 3.2 per cent,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, with Bajaj Finserv's entry, the NSE barometer will feature 11 stocks from BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector. This will take BFSI stocks weightage in the index to 33.7 per cent from 33.3 per cent at present, the brokerage said.

Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc, JSW Steel, Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Motherson Sumi are some of the stocks that have potential to be a part of Nifty50 going ahead.

Piramal Enterprises MRF, Shriram Transport Finance and Shree Cement are a few other potential Nifty50 stocks.

The 
index is a diversified 50-stock index, which accounts for 12 sectors of the economy. The index reconstruction after considering several criteria such as the free-float market caitalisation of the company, average impact cost during the last six months, trading frequency and so on.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects Hindustan Zinc to deliver healthy volumes going ahead to strong management focus, investment in drilling and human resources. ""We maintain a bullish zinc price outlook and expect LME to average at $3,800/t in FY19 and little lower at $3,200/t in FY20. Ebitda is expected to increase 45-50 per cent, driven by volume growth, cost reduction and favorable LME,"" the brokerage said.

Another brokerage JM Financial likes JSW Steel given its lowest conversion cost and premium realisation for its products against products of peers. ""We factor in Ebitda per tonne at Rs 8,500/8,700 for FY19E/20E, respectively. We roll forward to FY20 to arrive at our SOTP fair value of Rs 300 per share,"" the brokerage said 
after the company's Q3 numbers.

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher noted that the rural demand has been recovering and Britannia Industries has been gaining market share from both organised and smaller players. The company is expected to launch 50 new products/ variants in FY19."
3,2018-03-01,JSW,"The metal sector is at a vantage point on Dalal Street. And it is likely to remain so, thanks to expectations of steady operational cash flow on demand traction in coming quarters.

India Ratings' outlook revision of the sector for 2018-19 to stable from the earlier negative has also come as a shot in the arm.

On the returns front, the stock has been a trailblazer. Most metal counters have rewarded investors handsomely over the past two years. The BSE Metal index, for instance, soared 130 per cent between February 26 of 2016 and 2018.

According to India Ratings, the companies in the metal space stand to benefit from an uptick in demand, softening of input costs and Chinese capacity closure.

One look at the returns chart can give you a fair idea. Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) zoomed 400 per cent in the past two years to Rs 267.40. Vedanta's jump was 377 per cent, Hindalco's 254 per cent, Tata Steel's 187 per cent and SAIL's 150 per cent. The BSE Metal index, on its part, rallied to 15,483 from 6,749 during the same period. However, select stocks on the list are off their peaks, down up to 65 per cent from all-time highs.

In a chat with ETNow, Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corp Affairs, IIFL, said, “Metals have been a huge outperformer on the back of (Donald) Trump’s policy of protectionism and ban on import of steel. And they also have had the best of times after the China environmental issues.” 

IIFL has a positive outlook on SAIL, which has been ""an outperformer on the back of their export and local business"". ""The company is now consolidating. So, any decline in SAIL would be a good buying opportunity,” Bhasin added. 

Better returns are one of the big reasons why experts are advising to stay invested in the sector. “One should still stay put with metals despite the fantastic rally in the metal stocks. Going forward, we believe that still there is more room on the entire sector and steel has been particularly doing quite well. We have the infrastructure coming in. The way the metals cycle has turned on and maybe a few supply constraints, all this put together makes us believe that there is still some more upside in the steel stocks as well,” said Rahul Shah, Associate V-P at Motilal Oswal. ""So, one should still stay invested or maybe, look at Tata Steel and JSW Steel as a fresh buy from the current levels. There is still more money to be made on both the stocks.""

Margins of steel and zinc companies are likely to stay steady, according to India Ratings. The metrics may improve in the aluminium segment with softening of input prices, but countered by weak premiums in export markets.

Copper business is likely to face margin headwinds with a drop in treatment and refining charges for 2018 and absence of inventory gains. Prices are seen to moderate through the second half of 2018-19.

To top it, metal companies have done a good job on top line, Ebitda and PAT growth for the December 2017 quarter. National Aluminium bottom line jumped a good 402 per cent year-on-year. Tata Steel and JSW Steel posted 390 per cent and 148 per cent growth in profit. SAIL even marked a turnaround, with a net profit of Rs 43.16 crore in the third quarter over net loss of Rs 794.84 crore a year earlier.

Similarly, net loss of Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) narrowed to Rs 272.73 crore, from Rs 453.26 crore previously.

The thinking at Edelweiss Research is realisations continue to remain robust across the space, and operating leverage benefits are evident for SAIL and JSPL. Vedanta, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Hindustan Zinc are among the top picks of the brokerage house.

Metal players are evidently upbeat about their growth prospects. For instance, Hindustan Zinc is confident of achieving 1.2 mt production in FY20 with cost of production per tonne declining to $850. 

“The steel sector in India, which had been under stress due to lack of demand, is finally picking up. Economic reforms initiated by the government such as minimum import price, anti-dumping and safeguard measures and quality control have provided extensive support to the industry. Undoubtedly, these measures have added new dimensions to industrial growth in general and the steel industry in particular. One may invest in stocks such as Tata steel and SAIL for the long term,” said D K Aggarwal, CMD, SMC Investments and Advisors."

2,2018-03-01,JSW,"Fitch Ratings today said that it has revised the outlook on JSW Steel to 'stable' from 'negative'.

""Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on JSW Steel Ltd's long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to stable from negative and affirmed the rating at 'BB',"" the rating agency said in a statement.

The agency has also affirmed the company's senior unsecured rating and the rating on its senior unsecured notes at 'BB'.

'BB' ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists that supports the servicing of financial commitments.

""The outlook revision reflects our view that robust profitability from improved industry fundamentals and a measured approach to capacity expansion will enable JSWS (JSW Steel) to deleverage steadily over the next few years,"" the statement said.

""We estimate that the company's leverage will remain relatively high, with funds from operations (FFO) adjusted gross leverage at over 4.0x over the next two years, but risks are partly offset by JSWS's healthy EBITDAR margin, which should stay at over 20 per cent to be well above the median for 'BB' rated steel companies,"" it said.

4,2018-03-03,JSW,"KOLKATA: US president Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports is a concern but will have a bigger impact on China and Europe than on India, the government said. The surprise move may not have any immediate adverse fallout but is likely to pose some problems in the long run for Indian steel companies that have been focusing on exports to expand their market base and beat sluggish demand at home.

While the short to medium-term impact of the US decision will be limited, the tariffs are likely to stay for an “unlimited period,” which, experts say, is more worrying in the long term.

“Two percent of our (steel) exports is to the US, so the dent may not be as big on us as it will be to China or the European Union. But the logic to put tariff under 232 is weird and hence our concerns,” steel secretary Aruna Sharma told ET. Citing steel imports as a threat to national security and “using that logic for tariff is stretching the issue of security. The anti-dumping duties applicable in India are WTO compliant and prevent dumping but do not curtail steel imports as international business.” She said India’s exports to other countries will go up as a fallout of this move.




Section 232(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, allows the US to investigate if certain imports, or high levels of certain imports, pose a threat to national security.


Exports up 40% till January
It is not clear whether the tariffs would include all imports or target certain countries only. Though the US accounts for only a small portion of total exports, Indian steelmakers have begun to carve out a small but significant market for themselves in certain high-value and critical segments such as pipes and tubes used in oil and gas applications.

“With the steel ministry targeting a sustained export growth of around 6-7% of steel production, the impact will mainly be felt in the long term,” said a metals analyst who didn’t want to be named.

India’s steel exports grew 53% in April-December 2017 to 7.6 million tonnes (mt) from 4.6 mt in the year-earlier period, largely due to the impact of protective measures taken by the government and the global trend of rising prices since June 2017. In the April 2017-January 2018 period, exports rose 40% to 8.2 mt from the year earlier, according to provisional figures from the steel ministry’s Joint Plant Committee.

“India's export is minimal now since anti-dumping and countervailing duties are in place. We have to study what comes in the final orer,” Jayant Acharya, JSW Steel's director (commercial & marketing), said.

Commenting on the Trump administration’s move, Moody's Investors Service said the plan to impose tariffs on steel imports may be credit negative for Asian steel producers but the impact will not prove material.

“The impact of the tariff would be manageable for the Asian steel sector and Moody's-rated steelmakers in the region because exports to the US account for relatively small portions of their total steel production,” Moody’s analyst Sean Hwang said."
5,2018-03-04,JSW,"US President Donald Trump’s proposed policy on steel, of which his country is the planet’s biggest importer, may cause a supply glut in India, with shipments originally bound for Washington likely to end up at seaports of the world’s fastest-expanding major economy if they can’t hurdle across the American tariff walls.

To ensure that the current cycle of recovery at the country’s largest makers of the alloy is unaffected, New Delhi may need to relook at the anti-dumping charges. The minimum import prices for steel products introduced last year are way below the current market rates, and may prove ineffective in margin protection for local producers.

Domestic steel prices are about 5% lower. India is a net exporter of steel, with net outbound shipments of around 3 MT. It was a net importer two years ago before the government introduced the protective measures.

Without any government support, that status is under threat. The minimum prices introduced last year will not help as the cost and demand supply scenario has changed. For instance, reference minimum import price for HR Coil is $489 per ton but domestic as well as foreign players are selling in the range of $630-$700 per ton. 



The margin that the price of $489 offered last year is not the same at present due to the rise in raw material prices. Coking coal prices, for instance, have more than doubled, and iron ore prices have increased by about 80%.

The US secretary of commerce has recommended a global tariff of at least 24% on all steel imports and at least 53% on imports from 12 countries — Brazil, China, India, Russia, Korea, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Egypt and Turkey. With 35 MT (million tons), US is the biggest steel importer.

To be sure, US accounts for only 2% of the total exports from India. But experts are concerned that supplies earlier bound to the US may be dumped in expanding markets such as India, especially from suppliers such as Korea, Russia and Japan.

This may also impact the improving demand-supply scenario. The domestic steel industry has grown at 4.5% in the first nine months of FY18 as compared to a mere 3% in FY17.



Thanks to this and buoyant export markets to date, domestic steel prices have been on an uptrend since December 2017.

JSW Steel, which derives about a fifth of its sales from exports, may be affected. Tata Steel’s European operations will also be under pressure.

Other steel companies such as SAIL, Tata Steel India and Jindal Steel and Power may not be affected as the majority of their sales are in the Indian markets."
6,2018-03-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices saw a soft start on Monday as metal shares felt the heat, faced with US President Donald Trump's threat to impose duties on steel and aluminium import. 

The BSE Sensex fell 221.60 points, or 0.65 per cent, to 33,825.34. The Nifty50 was down 77.40 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 10,380.95. Both escaped Friday's global selloff because it was a public holiday.

11,2018-03-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Continued selling by foreign investors amid global trade war fears hit domestic stock market, as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty50 fell for the fourth straight day on Monday.

Global cues soured after the US President Donald Trump proposed hefty duties on import of aluminium and steel last week.

Market sentiment also took a hit after India’s Service activity contracted in February for the first time since November, as rising price pressures led to a decline in new businesses orders, a private survey showed on Monday. 

The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index fell from 51.7 in January to 47.8 in February, its lowest level since August, PTI reported.

Only eight out of 50 stocks in the Nifty50 index managed to settle in the green. 

“Market traded under pressure after the gap-down start. However, marginal bounce in the latter half pared some losses. It was the fear of possible trade war, after the US President announced to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, rattled global markets, including ours. Besides, the report that FPIs have pulled out more than 11,000 crore from the equity market in February further weighed on sentiment,” said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

The resolution plan submitted jointly by JSW Steel and AION Capital was the only offer that Monnet Ispat and Energy received by December 23 -- the last date for submission of the bids for the company.

The JSW-AION offer has been approved and the lenders have sent it for legal vetting the fate of which is likely to be decided within 15 days, the source said.

Monnet Ispat & Energy was the first stressed company to get resolution plans from prospective bidders. It was among the 12 NPAs referred by the Reserve Bank of India for insolvency proceedings. The company owes more than Rs 10,000 crore to its lenders.

As per the rules, the entire insolvency process has to end within 270 days. Priority should be 180 days and if not cleared another 90-day time can be sought.

17,2018-03-06,JSW,"KOLKATA: Moody's Investors Service has upgraded JSW Steel Limited's corporate family rating (CFR) and senior unsecured bond rating to Ba2 from Ba3 on hopes of improved sales driven by growing domestic demand. 

""The upgrade to Ba2 reflects our expectation that JSW will continue to show improving credit metrics,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, vice president, Moody's said. ""JSW's likely better results will be due to the benign operating environment, and higher steel sales from the company's brownfield expansion, catering to India's growing steel demand."" The ratings outlook is stable as it “factors in Moody's expectation that JSW will maintain a cautious approach towards evaluating capacity expansions or potential acquisitions,” it said.

Moody's expects that India's steel consumption will continue to grow in the range of 5.5%-6.5%, on the back of the government push for infrastructure projects, construction — including affordable housing — power transmission and railway investments, as well as improving demand from the automotive sector.

The global ratings agency said JSW's revenue is likely show a mid-single digit increase over the next 12-18 months, and its profitability — as measured by EBITDA margins — will stay at 20%-22%, even as raw material prices increase. ""Indian steel producers are consolidating their operations, with five stressed assets — that account for an estimated 17% of the country's crude steel capacity — likely to find suitable buyers within the next 12 months,"" Chaubal who is also Moody's Lead Analyst for JSW, said adding :""Such a situation augurs well for large established players such as JSW.""

Rising domestic demand, a wide slate of long and flat products, and an increasing proportion of value-added products will help JSW in preserving its market share in India, the report said. “While these factors, along with a favorable pricing environment, will improve the company's earnings growth, capital expenditure on a five million tonne per annum brownfield expansion at JSW's Dolvi plant will likely lead to a prolonged negative free cash flow situation,” it added.

Looking ahead, Moody's says that JSW's product mix demonstrates a higher proportion of value-added products versus its steel manufacturing peers in India, which should preserve EBITDA/tonne at Rs 8,500-Rs 9,000. The impact on JSW of the US Commerce Department's imposition of a 25% tariff to curb steel imports will be limited, given the company's relatively modest exposure to the US, which constituted less than 3% of the company’s total exports for April-December 2017.

Even as India's steel consumption levels continue to rise, Moody's expects anti-dumping duties on steel imports to insulate Indian steel producers such as JSW from any plausible dumping of surplus steel. “JSW's rating reflects the company's large scale, strong market share in West and South India, and competitive conversion costs,” it added."

13,2018-03-06,JSW,"Mumbai: The BSE Metal index was the worst performer among BSE sector indices on Monday as sentiment turned weak on US President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that he would impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium products. The BSE Metal index ended down 3.3 per cent at 14,534.31 on Monday — the lowest closing since December 22 last year. However, brokerages see limited impact on the Indian steel sector as India’s exports to the US are miniscule.


EDELWEISS SECURITIES
Edelweiss said that the popular perception is that China will be the worst affected by the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium and there will be a cascading effect across all countries including India. The brokerage said it differs in its view as bulk of the US primary aluminium and steel imports are from Canada, and exports from China and India are focused on Asia. There could be near-term stress on domestic stocks due to global pricing pressure and trade flow shifts, but the long-term impact is expected to be marginal, said Edelweiss.


KOTAK INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES
The institutional brokerage firm said that the US trade protection measures will lead to temporary disruption in few regional markets as new trade channels that will open to cater to supplies left behind from being exported to the US. However, it believes the extent of steel-mill or aluminum smelter restarts in the US will not be meaningful to disrupt the outlook on global aluminum and steel over the medium to longer term. The brokerage has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Vedanta and Hindalco Industries, and reiterated ‘add’ rating on JSW Steel.




Brokerages on Steel Sector


ICICI BANK
The bank said that even as a trade war is unlikely to be the outcome of the move by the US, global supply chains will go through sharp changes. The tariff hike by US is unlikely to have a major immediate impact on Indian exports as the country’s steel exports to the US are miniscule, said ICICI Bank. Around 1-2 per cent of US steel imports by volume are accounted for by India. The impact on India may be minimum, but possible retaliatory stances by other countries will vitiate the trade atmosphere, said ICICI Bank.


MORGAN STANLEY
The direct impact of the potential restrictions by the US on Indian imports is likely to be limited as Indian steel exports to the US represent less than 1 per cent of India’s production and 4 per cent of India’s steel exports, said Morgan Stanley. The firm said that the key thing to watch would be the rising risk of counter measures from other countries which may trigger trade issues and lead to pressure on steel and aluminium prices outside the US. With safeguard duty for steel in place and domestic steel prices being at a discount to global steel prices on import parity, a potential increase in steel imports into India is unlikely, said Morgan Stanley."
12,2018-03-06,JSW,"MUMBAI: The stock market resumed its decline on Monday as investors fretted about the prospect of a global trade war sparked off by the US’ unilateral decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The development, which overshadowed the optimism over Bharatiya Janata Party’s strong show in the North-East state elections, drove the Nifty down to its lowest level since December 15 while the Sensex closed at the lowest since February 20.

Asian markets were weak as investors continued to shift to safer assets such as the Japanese Yen and gold.

The Sensex fell 300.16 points, or 0.88 per cent, to close at 33746.78 while the Nifty ended down 99.50 points, or 0.95 per cent, at 10358.85. Volatility spiked with the India VIX rising 9.4 per cent to 15.39.

On Thursday evening, US President Donald Trump’s warning of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports sparked off worries about retaliation from trade partners and sent global markets reeling. Since Indian markets were shut on Friday for Holi, investors could not react to the trade war fears.

“Indian markets are playing catch-up with other markets which fell on Friday,” said Andrew Holland, CEO of Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies. “Markets are worried what China and the European Union will do, whether they will retaliate.”


Metal Stocks Melt

Tata Motors was the worst performer on the Sensex, ending down 5 per cent at Rs 352.15. Other laggards included Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Reliance Industries, Coal India, Yes Bank and Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, which ended down 2-3 per cent.

The BSE Metal index fell the most among sectoral indices on the exchange. The index ended down 3.3 per cent at 14534.31points. NMDC, Nalco, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, and Hindalco Industries declined 4.3-5.8 per cent.

With Monday’s fall, the Sensex and Nifty have dropped about 6 per cent since February. BSE’s midcap index too has shed 6 per cent during the period while the smallcap index declined 4.4 per cent. Concernover a global trade war is the latest in a series of factors that have roiled Indian markets. The selloff began with the rise in US bond yield on expectations of a strong recovery in the world’s largest economy.

“While Fed Reserve chairman has said the Fed will gradually hike interest rates, he said that some headwinds have become tailwinds for the US economy, which could mean bigger or more rate increases going ahead. I expect volatility across asset classes in the next few months,” said Holland. The concerns led to the Sensex posting its worst monthly performance in two years in February, led by FII selling.

24,2018-03-08,JSW,"CLSA believes auctions in iron ore and bauxite could pick up pace ahead of the expiry of many private non-captive leases in March 2020. 

The 2015 amendment to the Indian mining laws not only paved the way for auctioning new mines, but also stipulated that existing leases expire in a limited timeframe and these mines subsequently be auctioned, said CLSA. 

The brokerage said that the last two years have seen the highest auctioning activity in limestone reserves, but limited for iron ore and hardly any for bauxite. The brokerage added that Odisha’s focus on raising bauxite production via a state-owned agency should improve mineral supply in the state. 

""JSW Steel (BUY) and Vedanta (BUY) lack captive resources and could benefit the most from higher resource integration, although value accretion from any captive mines would depend on the competitive intensity in auctions,"" said CLSA."
26,2018-03-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: A consortium of lenders including State Bank of India (SBI) has approved the sale of bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel to Tata Steel, pending the outcome of a legal challenge by Liberty House whose bid was rejected. Bhushan Power owes about ₹49,200 crore to the lenders.

Lenders have given an informal consent to go ahead with negotiations with Tatas for Bhushan Power — even as it is facing litigation at the bankruptcy court — at a closed-door meeting held among senior bank officials at the corporate office of State Bank of India, said two senior bank officials who did not want to be named.

“During the meeting SBI urged lenders to get all their clarifications from the resolution professional and get approvals from the boards for the Bhushan Power,” said a senior bank official.

Tata Steel has also emerged as the higher bidder for Bhushan Steel. Bhushan Power and Steel was put on block on February 8. The resolution professional received bids from JSW and Tata Steel. Tata Steel offered ₹24,500 crore while JSW Steel offered ₹11,500 crore.

Liberty House on Thursday submitted before the NCLT that Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) rejected its bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel without even opening the seal of its offer. On February 20, Liberty House had submitted a bid for Bhushan Power which was rejected by lenders on the grounds that the bid had come after the deadline. Liberty House on February 26 moved the bankruptcy court with a plea that their resolution plan should be considered by the resolution professional.

Liberty House now claims that its offer was higher than that offered by Tata Steel and the counsel has argued that it got confused between the deadline of Bhushan Power and Bhushan Steel."
27,2018-03-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: Like the US, India too need to impose duties on import of steel, according to steel magnate Sajjan Jindal.

In a series of tweets, Jindal said that the steel industry is a very strategically important industry for a developing nation like India. 

""What @realDonaldTrump has done in the US is an important and positive step towards safeguarding this industry,"" he said.

""It is important for our policy makers to understand what countries like China,Korea and Japan are doing. Japan's steel consumption is about 60 MTPA. They produce 110-120. They export about 50% of their produce. But they never buy anything imported,"" he further added.

In another tweet, Jindal said that China has a surplus production of about 15%,which they use to disrupt the steel industry world over by dumping cheap quality steel. ""What @POTUS has done is something our policy makers should replicate. Infact Steel should be excluded from all FTAs."" 

@POTUS is the official twitter handle of the President of the United States. 

Last month also, Jindal had sent out a series of tweets asking the Indian government to replicate the US in imposing duties on steel imports. 

Donald Trump announced last week his decision to impose 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% tariff on imported aluminium into the US. Even though a formal order is yet to be signed, countries that export to UK are fuming over the announcement. 

As ET had reported earlier, with only a 2% of total steel exports to the US, India does not have much cause to worry over the tariff which will be more detrimental to China and Europe. However, the duties are likely to pose some problems in the long run for Indian steel companies that have been focusing on exports to expand their market base to beat sluggish demand at home. 

JSW Steel achieved its highest ever export sales of 3.80 million tonnes in 2016-17, an increase of 153% over the previous year. 

According to a report by the Joint plant Committee, India's imports of finished steel fell by 36% to 7.4 million tonnes in 2016-17 while exports jumped 102% to 8.2 MT. By December, 2017, imports fell to 6.8 MT. China, South Korea and Japan are the three largest exporters of steel to India. 

Aluminium imports on the other hand touched 1.8 milion tonnes in 2016-17, up by 5% from the previous year. 

The government of India had notified in February, 2016 that it had imposed Minimum Import Price (MIP) on steel ranging from $341 to $752 per tonne on 173 steel products. MIP is a measure to protect domestic steel producers by way of imposing a minimum price that importers have to pay while buying steel from abroad. However, MIP can be gradually phased out as and when the situation seems conducive. 

Later in 2016, it had also extended safeguard duty on steel imports until March 2018 to protect the domestic steel industry from cheap imports from China. Starting from 20% till September, 2016, it said the duty will be brought down to 10% by March, 2018."
28,2018-03-09,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The creditors' panel will next week declare the highest preferred bidder for acquiring the assets of Bhushan Power and Steel amid the resolution process for the debt-laden firm being marred by controversy, sources said. 

""The Committee of Creditors (CoC) will meet on March 14 to evaluate the criteria and declare the H1 bidder for Bhushan Power and Steel,"" a banker privy to the development said. 

 UK-based Liberty House has moved NCLT to direct creditors and resolution professional (RP) to consider its bid offer to acquire the company as it was rejected by Creditors Committee. 

 ""The lenders which met on March 8 decided to go ahead with the entire process (resolution process of Bhushan Power) . When the judgement of NCLT comes then they (the lenders) will take a call accordingly,"" said another source close to the development. 

 When contacted, RP Mahender Kumar Khandelwal declined to comment on the issue. 

 Liberty House on March 9 presented its argument before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The next hearing of NCLT is scheduled for Tuesday in which resolution professional will respond. 

 The RP for the debt-laden firm earlier said that the resolution plan for Bhushan Power and Steel, facing insolvency proceedings is likely to be finalised this month. 

 With the CoC last moth rejecting the bid of Liberty House to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, Tata Steel and JSW Steel are now in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm. 

 Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders. 

The source had said that while Tata Steel offered Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders as upfront amount and Rs 7,200 crore for operations of Bhushan, JSW made an offer of Rs 11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs 2,000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm. 

 Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by RBI for NCLT proceedings. 

The insolvency process was filed by SBI, the lead banker of the consortium of lenders, in the case of Bhushan Steel while a similar plea was filed by Punjab National Bank against Bhushan Power and Steel."
29,2018-03-11,JSW,"Equity benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty slipped over 2 per cent last week on sustained selling by foreign institutional investors amid subdued global cues. 

Concerns over possible global trade war after US President Donald Trump's proposal to raise import tariff on certain metals and lingering worries over the domestic banking sector further eroded investor wealth during the week.

The 50-share NSE Nifty index shed 232 points, or 2.21 per cent, to 10,226 for the week ended March 9 from 10,458 on March 1. BSE Sensex tumbled 740 points, or 2.17 per cent, to 33,307 from 34,046 during the same period.

Top loser on NSE

During the week, GTL Infra lowered its revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, forecast by 12 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, for the year ending March 2018, hurt by the impact of Aircel filing for bankruptcy, which would reduce tenancies by half from its earlier estimate given in December 2017.


Stocks that went against the wind
As many as 10 stocks on NSE surged over 20 per cent in last five sessions despite weak broader markets.

Metal stocks tumbled after the US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 10 per cent and 25 per cent on imports of steel and aluminium, respectively, on March 8. Jindal Steel, Tata Steel and JSW Steel tanked up to 11 per cent during the week.


@ fresh all-time lows

30,2018-03-11,JSW,"In our previous daily note last Friday, we had mentioned about the importance of the Nifty moving past the 10,275-10,300 zone to confirm a temporary base. The market remained tentative all though Friday’s session and the benchmark Nifty50 struggled to move past the 10,275-10,300 range and saw retracement once it tested those levels.

The index ended the day with a modest loss of 15.80 points, or 0.15 per cent. While we enter a fresh week, Monday’s trade is likely to see a stable and strong opening ensured by strong global markets. Having said that, the likely strong opening will see the market open above the 10,275-10,300 zone. However, it would be once again critical to see if the market sustains and maintains itself above those levels.

In all likelihood, we will see market defend those levels.

Nifty will see the 10,300 and 10,365 levels pose as immediate resistance on Monday. Supports should come in at 10,210 and 10,140 levels. The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 36.4385 and it remains neutral against the price showing no divergence. It is seen taking a pattern support as well.




The daily MACD remains bearish as it trades below the signal line. No significant formations were observed on candles.

Pattern analysis highlights the credibility of the support that is provided by 200-DMA. The Nifty50 tested this level twice during last week and each time it did so, it has defended it as well. In the immediate short term, we believe this level will stay defended and will not see Nifty50 breach this level in the immediate short term.

Overall, as mentioned, despite a stable and strong opening which is likely on Monday, sustenance above those levels and capitalizing on such possibly strong opening will remain key thing to watch for. Moving past 10,275-10,300 zone will get the market back into the rectangle trading channel that it has formed after the recent corrective decline. If this happens, we expect the market to advance towards its next logical resistance of 100-DMA, which stands at 10452. Though cautious, but positive outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen being added in counters like IDFC Bank, TV18 Broadcast, Ashok Leyland, JSW Steel, RPower, Infibeam, Capital First, Dabur, ITC and Torrent Pharma.

""The company is contemplating issuing of debt instruments in the form of US dollar denominated senior notes, subject to market conditions,"" JSW Steel said in a BSE filing.

The company said a preliminary offering circular has been prepared and shall be made available to the prospective investors in relation to the contemplated issue of notes.

""The notes will not be offered or sold in India,"" it added.

In May last year, the board of directors of JSW Steel had approved to raise long-term funds through the issuance of non-convertible foreign currency/rupee-denominated senior unsecured fixed rate bonds up to USD 1 billion in one or more tranches, in the international market.

Shares of the company were trading 1.36 per cent higher at Rs 295.15 on BSE."
32,2018-03-12,JSW,"Kolkata: Moody's has assigned a Ba2 rating to JSW Steel proposed senior unsecured bonds. The rating outlook is stable.

The bond rating is the same as JSW's Ba2 corporate family rating (CFR) and the Ba2 rating on the company's existing senior unsecured notes.

Moody's said JSW's Ba2 CFR reflects the company's large scale, strong market shares in West and South India, and competitive conversion costs, with the last factor supported by the company's wide range of furnace technologies and the coastal locations of its operations.

The proposed bonds will rank pari-passu to the company's $500 million senior unsecured bonds maturing in November 2019 and the $500 million senior unsecured bonds maturing in April 2022. 

As at December 2017, JSW's secured debt constituted 53% of total debt, down from 71% in March 2014. With the proposed bond issuance, Moody's expects that the proportion of secured debt to total debt will fall further."

Following this, the creditors' meeting that was supposed to be held on Wednesday has been cancelled until a final order for the case comes about. Another hearing is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. 

Easing the pressure on the deadline for the resolution to take place, justice MM Kumar also said that the number of days spent on legislation will not be counted as part of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) and will be deducted from the 270-days that the resolution professional gets to decide on the fate of a stressed asset. 

""The matter is subjudice and we cannot comment on this,"" said a spokesperson of Liberty House. 

 Lenders were represented by Ramji Srinivasan while the RP was represented by Arun Kathpalia. 

The judge has said that until it listens to all sides of the matter, it cannot pass an order. Tata Steel, which has emerged as the highest bidder for the asset, defeating JSW Steel by a significant margin, is scheduled to plead its case on Thursday. Tata Steel was also supposed to revert to the lenders regarding its revised offer conditions in the meeting on Wednesday. It has offered Rs 24,500 crore for the asset upon a condition that the lenders buy the entire equity of the two subsidiaries of Bhushan Power and Steel , namely Nova Iron & Steel and Ambey Steel & Power. However, lenders are not comfortable with the condition and had asked the steel company to revisit its terms. 

Liberty House which had submitted a bid after the February 8 deadline had argued last week that the creditors had rejected the bid without even opening it and that the bid should at least be opened to be considered.

Essar Steel 

Total Debt: Rs 49,000 crore 


Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017


Where it stands now: Locked in a battle between Arcelor Mittal and Russia’s Numetal


What is the issue: Both bidders are questioning each other’s eligibility on the basis of the revised Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which bars promoters or related parties of defaulted firms to bid if they had not cleared dues. Ravi Ruia’s son Rewant Ruia is associated with Numetal and rival ArcelorMittal promoter Lakshmi Mittal is associated with defaulter Uttam Galva.


Bhushan Steel

Total Debt: Rs 44,000 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017


Where it stands now: Tata Steel has emerged the top bidder outsmarting JSW Steel offering Rs 34,800 crore as upfront payment against Rs 29,700 crore offered by JSW.


What is the issue: The deal was thought to be final until late last week when Larsen & Toubro (L&T) moved the NCLT seeking ‘higher priority’ in repayment of dues owed by Bhushan Steel. It owes Rs 900 crore to L&T.


Electrosteel Steels

Total Debt: Rs 13,000 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017


Where it stands now: New Delhi based Renaissance Steel has questioned bids by Tata Steel and Vedanta alleging that both are guilty of criminal misconduct, so be barred from bidding.


What is the issue: Section 29A (d) of the IBC, prohibits bidding by entities or their subsidiaries that have been convicted for an offence punishable for more than two years. Renaissance Steel has claimed that subsidiaries of both Tata Steel and Vedanta have been convicted in the UK and Zambia, respectively.


Amtek Auto

Total Debt: Rs 12,722 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017


Where it stands now: UK based Liberty House has declared itself the winner in the bid but there has been no final word from bankers. Liberty House and US-based hedge fund Deccan Value Investors were the final bidders for the asset.


What is the issue: Liberty House’s green metal strategy involves recycling of scrap metal, instead of producing it from scratch. However while the company has declared itself as a winner it is unclear as of what price its willing to pay.


Bhushan Power & Steel

Total Debt: Rs 49,200 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017


Where it stands now: UK based Liberty House Group has challenged the rejection of its bid by the resolution professional which were received after deadline.

Alok Industries

Total Debt: Rs 29,000 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017


Where it stands now: JM Asset Reconstruction Company is the lone bidder for the company after initial interest from four including Kotak Mahindra and Edelweiss. This is the second bidding process for the fully integrated textile unit.


What is the issue: Bankers are worried bid may be too low, even lower than the liquidation value. But many believe that at least real estate holdings and some attractive business segments should lead to banks demanding higher bids.


Monnet Ispat

Total Debt: Rs 10,237 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017


Where it stands now: The JSW Steel-AION Capital was the only bid that came for Monnet Ispat and Energy. The bid was for Rs 2,450 crore to the lenders along with an equity funding of Rs 1,050 crore.


What is the issue: The consortium will hold 75% in the company while 18% will be held by lenders and 3% by the existing promoters. Final approval is still pending as lenders are seeking legal opinion to make sure that the bid is in order.


Lanco Infra

Total Debt: Rs 45,000 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: August 2017


Where it stands now: Four companies about whom little is known have submitted bids for the Hyderabad based Lanco Infratech with interests in power and infrastructure projects. Little known companies like OPG Group, Prem Energy, Goyal Group and Diva Group have bid for the company.


What is the issue: Bids by little known companies and suspect financial strength have stoked concerns among the lenders, so no decision yet.


Jaypee Infratech

Total Debt: Rs 8,000 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017


Where it stands now: JSW Group is the highest bidder among six, including Adani group, Jieyang Zhonguci of China, Deutsche Bank, Sudhir Walia-promoted Suraksha ARC, and parent Jaiprakash Asso.


What is the issue: JSW Group has offered Rs 9,914 crore as a one-time payment to lenders but has refused to settle claims of 32,000 home buyers, farmers and any penalty imposed by Rera (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act, 2016).


ABG Shipyard

Total Debt: Rs 16,000 crore


Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017


Where it stands now: UK based Liberty House, Mahindra & Mahindra and the Mistry family controlled Shapoorji Pallonji Group were the three bidders in October last. Now only Liberty House is said to be the remaining bidder.


What is the issue: It is unclear as to what exactly is the offer from Liberty House. Bids were in the range of Rs 4,000 crore and lenders are yet to take a decision on whether to offer the company at such a steep discount."
35,2018-03-14,JSW,"MUMBAI: India should be wary of taking lessons from the Trumpian style of steel economics as well as the Chinese style of state-sponsored steel capitalists as both of them are toxic to the global steel economy, Atanu Mukherjee, president, MN Dastur & Company said on Wednesday. 

Mukherjee who presides over the engineering services consultancy that has been associated with the setting up of many steel plants in India, including Tata Steel's Jamshedpur plant, was referring to the recent imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in the US by president Donald Trump. 

""We must stand tall and be wary of taking any lessons from the Trumpian style of steel economics or the Chinese style of state-sponsored capitalism,"" Mukherjee said addressing the gathering at the International Metal and Foundry Expo that kicked off on Wednesday. ""Trumpian trade jingoism is likely to cause US more than 200,000 jobs and has the potential to cause a trade war where the entire world will be worse-off,"" he said. 

Also referring to the Chinese way of making and selling steel, Mukherjee said that Chinese style steel capitalism ""de-stabilises the entire world with humongous excess capacity that leads to predatory dumping and countries putting up steel trade walls that disturb the markets for steel"". This has been happening for the last ten years, he said. 

Mukherjee also pointed out to the untapped strength that India possesses in the area of steel-making and selling. Among the points that he listed as a steel expert that could propel the country towards global steelmaking excellence, Mukherjee said the country has the potential to earn an excess of $80-100 EBITDA per tonne of steel if it takes care of a few aspects like getting flexibility in their plants which makes incremental capacity addition cost-effective, improving productivity, as well as taking advantage of its 7,000 km coastline for transportation of raw materials and finished goods. 

Donald Trump announced a few days back that it will be imposing an import tariff of 25% on steel as well as 10% on aluminium as it is hurting domestic producers and is dangerous to the national security that makes use of such metals. This move has given rise to fears that it could trigger a global trade war as countries that are hurt by Trump's move may resort to retaliation. 

Steel magnate Sajjan Jindal who chairs JSW Steel has reponded by asking the Indian government to replicate US in the imposition of tariffs to protect its own steel producers."

39,2018-03-19,JSW,"MUMBAI: Lenders led by State Bank of India are likely to seek another round of bids for Essar Steel after the resolution professional (RP) concluded that both offers — by ArcelorMittal and Numetal — may not be valid under the current Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), said two senior bank officials who did not want to be named.

“The committee of creditors (CoC) will meet on Wednesday to discuss the option of going for a second round of bidding for Essar Steel,” said one of them. In all likelihood, lenders will set April 2 as the last date for submitting binding bids afresh.

The resolution professional (RP), Satish Gupta, backed by Alvarez and Marsal, told lenders recently that both bids may not be eligible, said the people cited above. Over the weekend, legal advisers led by Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas finalised their decision for a rebid, said people aware of the matter.

“He has thus suggested that the CoC should consider a proposal to invite bids from those applicants that submitted expressions of interest earlier but did not submit binding bids,” said one of the sources. The resolution professional didn’t tell lenders which of the two bidders made the higher offer.

The resolution professional did not respond to ET’s queries. Senior bank officials declined to speak to ET on the matter. Vedanta Resources, Tata Steel, Nippon Steel, Numetal and ArcelorMittal are the five entities that submitted expressions of interest for Essar Steel, which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings after failing to repay Rs 49,000 crore to lenders.


Agencies
The resolution professional told lenders that both bids didn’t adhere to Section 29 A of the IBC.

This provision bans promoters of defaulting companies from bidding for stressed assets unless they clear dues owed by defaulting companies. Both ArcelorMittal and Numetal have said their bids are compliant with the rules.

ArcelorMittal recently sold its 29% stake in bankrupt Uttam Galva Steel to the Miglani family for Re 1 per share to meet the eligibility clause under Section 29 A.

“However, at the time of submitting the bid, its name was still in the list of promoters of Uttam Galva with the stock exchanges,” said one of the persons. “This is a technical issue but legal experts believe it has to be rectified for the company to be eligible.”

ArcelorMittal exited Uttam Galva and another defaulter KSS Petron days before submitting the resolution plan for Essar Steel on February 12. The company had already received approvals from the ministry of corporate affairs, filed the necessary MGT10 documents and the share transfer back to the promoters of Uttam Galva, the Miglani family, was completed, before the bids went in. “But on a hyper-technical ground, the legal advisors have sought to disqualify them,” said one of the people cited above.

Numetal is a consortium led by Russia’s VTB Capital that includes the Aurora Trust owned by Rewant Ruia, which has a 25% stake. He is a member of the Ruia family that’s the promoter of Essar Steel. Numetal has said that it’s open to making changes in the consortium if Aurora’s inclusion isn’t in line with the rules.


EXTERNAL ADVICE
While ArcelorMittal sought the legal advice of senior lawyer Harish Salve to vet its eligibility, Numetal had roped in Janak Dwarkadas. The resolution professional and his legal advisors are believed to have consulted Darius Khambata, former advocate general, Maharashtra, on the eligibility criterion.

A fresh auction will enable Arcelor-Mittal and Numetal to revise their bids in line with Section 29 A of IBC. To be sure, the resolution process will have to concluded soon. The 270-day timeframe within which the insolvency exercise has to be completed ends on April 28. After this, Essar Steel will have to be liquidated if a resolution plan hasn’t been agreed upon. Soon after submitting its offer for Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal announced a tieup with Nippon Steel of Japan on the bid. It is unclear if the two will submit a joint bid in the second round. However, only those that have filed expressions of interest can rebid for Essar Steel, which will keep large corporates like JSW Steel out of the race.

Bankers are hoping that potential bidders will draw comfort from the Delhi HC ordering a stay on the sale of a stake in Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure (OSPI) by a fund owned by Srei Infrastructure to Numetal.

OSPI carries raw materials to the Essar Steel plant and not having control of the pipeline could increase transportation costs by Rs 3,000 crore annually for Essar Steel’s eventual acquirer.

But some have sounded a warning about the potential cost of delays. “You already have two aggressive bids. A rebid may impact the valuations. If the objective is to maximise value for the lenders, this may be a counterproductive step. Also, this goes against the highest bidder,” said an official in the know.

Initially, the lawyers had recommended a rebid involving just Numetal and ArcelorMittal."
41,2018-03-20,JSW,"The metal pack is a bundle of nerves these days. Softness in Chinese ores, subdued global demand and the spectre of a full-scale trade war are giving investors the blues.

In fact, the selling in metal counters has intensified of late. So much so that it has wiped off nearly Rs 27,500 crore investor wealth in the just past four trading sessions. Market capitalisation of the BSE Metal pack narrowed to Rs 7.12 lakh crore on March 19, from Rs 7.39 lakh crore on March 13.

All components of the index, barring Nalco, lost up to 9 per cent during March 13-19. Nalco firmed up 5.65 per cent though. Tata Steel burnt its fingers the most, plunging 8.48 per cent, followed by Coal India, JSW Steel, NMDC, SAIL and Vedanta. JSPL and Hindustan Zinc declined over 3 per cent each. 

Market capitalisation of Coal India and Vedanta went down Rs 14,308 crore and Rs 4,962 crore, respectively, during the same period. JSW Steel, Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco, NMDC and Steel Authority of India witnessed an erosion of up to Rs 4,800 crore in their market capitalisation in the past four trading sessions.

A subdued demand of base metals is mainly at work. Chinese iron ore slipped to its lowest level on Monday since November 2017 as high inventory levels and a weak domestic steel market weighed on prices. Worries over the potential trade war between the US and China and frustration over US President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs too played spoilsport, hurting investor risk appetite.

During an interaction with ETNow, Deepak Jasani, Head, Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said, “The recent reversal in the metal prices has to do with the possibility of trade wars across the globe. In case, it materialises in a big way with all countries trying to put in barriers in terms of import duties or otherwise, then yes, the entire metal pack could go down. It will also result in a global recession kind of a scenario and I do not know whether the developed countries can afford to have a recession at this point of time. But till this fear is out of the way, metals could underperform for some more time and then probably take it forward from there.”

He added: “But given the fact that the economies globally have made some sort of a bottom last year and have started to see faster growth, metals could come back in favour after one or two quarters once this uncertainty is out of the way.”

The BSE Metal index was down 0.35 per cent at 13,503 at around 10.10 am (IST)."

44,2018-03-21,JSW,"A modestly positive opening to the trade is expected once again, but it would be imperative for the market to move past the 200-DMA mark, which stands at 10,168. Longer the market stays below 200-DMA, more vulnerable it will remain to selling.

The Nifty50 failed to sustain above the 200-DMA levels on Wednesday, despite a strong and sustainable pullback. The intraday gains fizzled out and the market came off significantly from the high point of the day.

 After great volatility, Nifty ended the day with a modest gain of 30.90 points or 0.31 per cent. The Nifty has resisted to 200-day moving average (DMA) on a closing basis after breaching that level a day before.

 This level will continue to pose a threat to the Nifty in the immediate short term.



 Going into trade on Thursday, expect a similar behaviour from the market. A modestly positive opening to the trade is expected once again, but it would be imperative for the market to move past the 200-DMA mark, which stands at 10,168. Longer the market stays below 200-DMA, more vulnerable it will remain to selling.

 Thursday will see the levels of 10,170 and 10,245 playing out as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports come in at 10,040 and 9,980 zones.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 38.0574, and it remains neutral showing no divergence to the price. The daily MACD continues to remain bearish, while trading below its signal line. No significant formations were seen on the candles. Going by the pattern analysis, it is seen that the Nifty did breach its 200-DMA levels on a closing basis a day before, but stayed within its filters.

 A pullback was attempted, but it resisted at the 200-DMA, which it had marginally breached in the previous session. Overall, the Nifty still continues to remain on tenterhooks on expected lines.

 It would be important for the market to move past and sustain above the 200-DMA at the earliest to form a temporary bottom once again. Staying below the 200-DMA for long will make market vulnerable.

 However, the oversold nature of important oscillators on both, daily and weekly charts, point towards larger chances of a technical pullback.

 While remaining moderate on the overall positions, continuance of a cautious outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh longs were seen being added in stocks like JSW Steel, DLF, PFC, RPower, Bharti Airtel, REC, ITC, NTPC, Ashok Leyland, Marico, ONGC, Reliance Capital and Reliance Industries.

43,2018-03-21,JSW,"MUMBAI: In what could further delay the resolution of Essar Steel that owes over Rs 45,000 crore to lenders, the SBI-led consortium of creditors today rejected the bids by Numetal, an SPV floated by Russian lender VTB Bank and Rewant Ruia, and ArcelorMittal,finding them ineligible under the IBC laws that debar related parties from bidding.

The decision to reject both the bids was taken at a meeting of the committee of creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel here today, a banking source said, adding however, they have voted to allow a second round of bidding for the nearly crippled 10-million tonne-asset at Hazira in Gujarat.

""They (Numetal and ArcelorMittal) were found to be ineligible under Section 29 A of the amended IBC. They did not fall under the satisfactory criterion that the defaulting promoters' link should not be there or connected persons should not be there in the new company that is bidding,"" a banking source told PTI here.

Numetal and ArcelorMittal were the only two bidders for Essar Steel which owe the banks over Rs 45,000 crore. These companies have put up their bids on February 12 but have since been battling with each other amidst questions about their very eligibility to bid.

Even though the Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal has teamed up with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp to bid for Essar Steel, it has been found ineligible for its joint venture with Uttam Galva, which is at the NCLT awaiting resolution now, and Numetal's bid was done in by the fact that one of the promoters of the special purpose vehicle is Rewant Ruia, the son of an Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia, one of the original promoters of Essar Steel.

Bankers, however said if these companies delinked their connection from the promoters or standardise their loans they can bid again in the second round of bidding.
The lenders have set an April 2 deadline for the second round of bidding for Essar Steel that owes over Rs 45,000 crore to over 30 banks and other creditors. But this is unlikely to yield the desired results as biggies like Tata Steel, the Anil Aggrawal-led Vedanta and JSW Steel have reportedly decided against bidding for Essar Steel.

The shareholders of the Mauritius-based Numetal, a special purpose vehicle that focuses on steel and infra space along with manufacturing, are VTB Capital, the PE arm of the Russian state-owned lender VTB Bank and Aurora Trusts in which Rewant Ruia is a beneficiary and owns 25 per cent.

The other promoters include the Russian steel and engineering major TyazhPromExports (TPE) and Indo International, a Dubai-based metals trading firm promoted by an NRI. VTB Capital owns majority in Numetal.

Bids of these firms were evaluated by resolution professional Satish Kumar Gupta, along with risk advisory Grant Thornton and law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.

The rejection comes a day after Numetal moved the Ahmedabad NCLT seeking to declare its eligibility, as it apprehended that all the full facts it submitted to the RP were not assessed properly.

Earlier in the day, Numetal in a statement had said it had filed an application the Ahemdabad bench of NCLT to declare its elegibility as it ""apprehends that full facts submitted by it for eligibility to submit a resolution plan have not been appropriately assessed by the RP.""

An industry observer said following the rejection of its bid, Numetal may ask Rewant Ruia to exit the firm, something that the company was anyway ready to do.

""If public perception is a challenge because of the presence of Rewant Ruia in Numetal or his minority investment in the company, we are ready to change that,"" Antoine Chemali, a senior advisor at Numetal Mauritius, had told PTI last week.
""We've already spoken to him (Rewant) and are ready to do whatever it takes us to win the Essar Steel bid. We, the rest of the shareholders, are ready to buy out his minority stake from Numetal,"" Chemali added.

But he was quick to point out that Rewant did not have any say in the management of Numetal or enjoyed a board position. And an Essar Group official also told PTI that Rewant had resigned from the Essar Steel way back in 2012, and thus in no way was related to the Essar Steel promoters now.


It can be noted that both Numetal and ArcelorMittal had threatened to challenge NCLT and RP in higher courts if their bids were rejected, forcing government to recently hint that it was amenable to make more changes to Section 29 of the IBC Act to redefine ""connected/related parties"" to exclude only original promoters who are defaulters from bidding for an asset that has gone to kaput and went to the bankruptcy court.

The move is to distinguish between the promoters of defaulting companies that don't have a managerial role from those who also manage the stressed assets.

As per media reports, the corporate affairs ministry is considering two amendments to change the definition of ""connected people"" as per the IBC Code. Now, a promoter or investor in a defaulter is not eligible to participate in the auction of stressed assets referred to NCLT.

As per the IBC code, bids should be presented to the committee of creditors at least a month before the deadline, which in the case of Essar Steel is April 29.

The Mittals have also reportedly offered to pay 50 per cent of its dues to lenders so that it becomes eligible to bid, something the new Section 29 A allows."
45,2018-03-22,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel is keen to participate in the rebidding process for Essar Steel.

The Essar bidding is poised to be the biggest in the current round of auction of stressed steel assets and is likely to involve anywhere between Rs 45,000-50,000 crore.

The Sajjan Jindal company reportedly sent a letter to Satish Gupta, the resolution professional for Essar Steel backed by Alvarez and Marsal, a few days ago expressing its interest to bid for Essar Steel.

A top source in the JSW Group confirmed the move but refused to share details or comment on the development.

However, a source associated with the group said the company is exploring every possible option to join the race for Essar.

“We are looking at various possibilities including joining a consortium to help us in the bid,” the person said. Incidentally, JSW Steel has been an enthusiastic bidder for a number of stressed steel assets.

It emerged as the sole bidder and is set to acquire Monnet Ispat with a resolution plan worth Rs 3,750 crore.

It, however, lost out in the race for Bhushan Steel, a company it was very interested in, to Tata Steel.

While JSW bid Rs 29,700 crore for Bhushan Steel, Tata Steel’s bid was much higher at around Rs 35,000 crore.

In case of Bhushan Power and Steel, JSW was pipped to the post by Tata Steel which bid Rs 24,5000 crore against JSW’s bid of Rs 13,000 crore."
46,2018-03-23,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: The number of crorepati senior executives in India Inc has increased nearly threefold in the past two years. The number of senior executives of BSE200 companies who earned more than Rs 1 crore in remuneration in FY17 rose to 1,172 compared with 422 in FY15, reveals data from Capitaline and annual reports.

Two key factors have contributed to this growth: first, large companies paid better remuneration to the senior management.

Secondly, more executives from midcap companies found a place in the sample as profits soared.

There are nearly five crorepati employees per company in the BSE200 group with an average compensation of Rs 5.5 crore.

They have paid nearly Rs 5,000 crore in compensation to executives in the past fiscal, or 1.1% of the total net profit.



The amount of compensation to senior executives receiving more than Rs 1 crore salary grew 47% every year between FY15 and FY17, while the profit of the BSE200 companies rose by 8%.

HDFC Bank, India’s largest bank by market capitalisation, had the largest number of senior executives (105) earning more than `1 crore, followed by TCS (91) and Bharti Airtel (82). The bank’s net profit grew by 19.5% annually in the past two fiscals.

In the manufacturing sector, companies such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Bharat Forge increased the count of the executives in the sample. In FY17, every fourth crorepati executive was from the manufacturing sector compared with one in 10 about two years ago.

Senior executives in the sample include Srikantan Moorthy, head of engineering global services at Infosys (Rs 3.2 cr), Jalaj Dani, president, supply chain, at Asian Paints (RS 3 cr), Amarpreet Singh Anand, VP, United Spirits (Rs 2.1 cr), and Dheeraj Arora, VP, modern trade, at HUL (Rs 2.1 cr).

There was also a rise in the number of crorepati executives at midcap companies, such as Kajaria Ceramics and Bata India. The number of such executives at Kajaria Ceramics increased to nine in FY17 compared with two in FY15."
47,2018-03-23,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group : Is the correction in the steel stocks overdone?

Shares of leading Indian steel companies such as Tata Steel, SAIL, Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel have fallen by 10-30 per cent from their recent highs following imposition of tariffs in the US and drop in Chinese steel prices.

However, the current valuations of these companies seem to factor in most of the negative signs while ignoring positive developments such as rising domestic demand and firm prices. This may bring these stocks back on investors’ radar.

Domestic steel demand has remained strong. From 4.2 per cent growth in the first eight months of FY18, demand has grown by nearly 6 per cent since December. This has also raised prices.

Analysts expect prices for the March quarter to be higher by 22 per cent and 12 per cent for long and flat products respectively compared with the previous quarter. This may help domestic steel producers to report strong numbers.

Current domestic steel prices are still at 2-3 per cent discount to import parity prices even though this has fallen from 7-8 per cent earlier. Steel prices in China, the world’s largest steel exporter are down by 5 per cent in the last one month. But, analysts don’t expect prices to fall even more.

“Sales in China are weak due to the late Chinese New Year holiday and a prolonged China National People’s Congress meeting. The demand is expected to pick up with a rebound in downstream industrial and construction activity,” said Sumangal Nivetia, leading metals analyst with Macquire.

Higher domestic sales volume and softer raw material cost (iron ore and coking coal) prices are expected to support profitability. Analysts expect double digit growth in the profits of the leading steel companies.

Amongst the steel players, Tata Steel and JSW Steel are better placed given their low-cost business models. Their enterprise values are 5.7 and 6.7 times FY19 estimated EBIDTA respectively. These are lower than the last five year averages."

49,2018-03-24,JSW,"KOLKATA: Tata Steel’s acquisition of Bhushan Steel is all but complete, with regulatory approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) left to be obtained.

The deal will mark the successful conclusion of the resolution process for the first of 12 big defaulters that the RBI had asked lenders to refer to the NCLT in June 2017 under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The company said on Friday it had accepted the letter of intent for Bhushan Steel under the corporate insolvency resolution process of the IBC. Earlier, it had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a Rs 35,000-crore offer, paving the way for the acquisition of a five million tonne plant in Odisha with a product basket catering to high-value auto and consumer durable makers.


Growth StrategyTata Steel has beaten rival JSW Steel and a private equity backed group of employees.

“Tata Steel hereby informs that it has been declared as the successful resolution applicant by the committee of creditors of Bhushan Steel,” the company said in a press release. Bhushan Steel owed nearly Rs 56,000 crore to creditors.

The company didn’t respond to ET’s queries seeking details about how it would go about making the acquisition, including its structure.



The move is a key step forward in Tata Steel’s domestic growth strategy under new Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran, a former top executive of the company said. Targeting Bhushan Steel was part of a well-thought-out strategy by the Tata group after assessing Bhushan Steel’s assets such as its mines and the age of its plant, which is relatively new and operational, compared with other stressed steel assets on the block, the person added.

Analysts tracking the sector said they were surprised by Tata Steel’s aggressive offer outbidding that of JSW Steel and one from about 400 Bhushan Steel employees backed by a PE firm. Tata Steel is also lead bidder for Bhushan Power & Steel, another of the dozen companies that RBI had instructed banks to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against.


“Tata Steel will almost double its capacity in India in the next four to five years if it manages to win both Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel and after taking into consideration the second phase of its expansion in Kalinganagar,” ICRA senior vice president Jayanta Roy said.


Debt Restructuring
The Bhushan Steel resolution had its share of drama. At the end of January, Bhushan Steel promoter and vice chairman Neeraj Singal unsuccessfully sought to halt the process by writing to lenders and asking them to consider restructuring the Rs 56,000-crore debt under the sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) mechanism by dividing the debt into sustainable and unsustainable parts with no haircut. The January 29 letter alleged that the company had been wrongly dragged into the IBC process despite the fact that debt restructuring under S4A was close to being decided.

Tata Steel had submitted an expression of interest (EoI) for Essar Steel as well, then said it would partner with Nippon Steel on this but eventually didn’t participate. However, bids are being sought afresh for Essar Steel with all those who submitted EoIs being eligible to try again. Tata Steel didn’t comment on queries regarding its participation in the rebid.

With Tata Steel tipped to enter into a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp of Germany for its European steel business, the focus is clearly back on India. Tata Steel’s domestic capacity is 13 million tonnes, which will be augmented by 5.6 million tonnes with the Bhushan Steel acquisition. Bhushan Steel makes flat products like hot- and cold-rolled coil (HR/CR coils) and galvanised sheets. It also collaborated closely with Sumitomo Corp., now Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. Incidentally, Tata Steel has a 51:49 joint venture with Nippon Steel for automotive steels that has a leading share of that market in India.

On March 7, Tata Steel said it had received a formal communication from the resolution professional of Bhushan Steel that it had been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel."
50,2018-03-25,JSW,"MUMBAI: The National Company Law Tribunal has advanced the hearing on Essar Steel dispute to Tuesday, March 27, from April 4 as the ruling needs to be pronounced before the second round of binding bids takes place.

SSG Capital, Numetal, Arcelor-Mittal, Vedanta Resources, Tata Steel and Nippon are among the six entities that initially showed interest in acquiring the steel company owned by the Ruia family. The resolution professional, Satish Gupta, has set April 2 as the last date for giving binding bids for Essar Steel that owes over Rs 49,000 crore to banks.

Banks led by State Bank of India, last week, voted in favour of inviting bids from six companies which had submitted expressions of interest (EoI) after the resolution professional declared that both the bids — from ArcelorMittal and Numetal — as ineligible.

Numetal moved the Ahmedabad bench of bankrupcy court stating that the structure of their bids be considered eligible for acquiring the distressed company under bankrupcy law.

“The company has sought for an early hearing so that clarity emerges before the date of submission of binding bids,” said a senior official. Last week, 98.5% of lenders by value of loan voted for a second round of bidding by inviting only those who gave expression of interest. In effect, large companies like JSW Steel would not be eligible to give binding bids.




Lenders say that SSG Capital may submit a bid in partnership with a strategic investor or a steel company. ET has reported that Tatas and Vedanta Resources may not be interested in bidding for Essar Steel. Prior to ArcelorMittal’s bid being rejected, Japan’s Nippon Steel has announced that it would partner with ArcelorMittal to acquire Essar Steel if their bid is selected. It is not yet clear if the two will partner for the second round of bidding.

Tata Steel, which had shown interest earlier, is set to acquire Bhushan Steel as well as Bhushan Power — both facing bankrupcy proceedings. Similarly, Vedanta Resources is the likely to be the highest bidder for Electrosteel Steels. Numetal is a consortium led by Russia’s VTB Capital that includes the Aurora Trust owned by Rewant Ruia, which has a 25% stake. He is a member of the Ruia family that’s the promoter of Essar Steel. Promoters of Essar are not eligible to bid unless they repay their dues with banks. In the past, officials from Numetal have said that it’s open to making changes in the consortium if Aurora’s inclusion isn’t in line with the rules. The other partners in the Numetal consortium includes TyazhPromExports (TPE) of Russia and Indo International.

Both the bids of ArcelorMittal and Numetal were rejected on technical grounds and a second round of bidding will enable them to rectify the structure of their proposal so that they are eligible, said the official quoted above."
51,2018-03-26,JSW,"KOLKATA/MUMBAI: Metal companies such as Vedanta, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) have all been raising funds in the past month.

While Vedanta on Friday said it will raise Rs 4,500 crore, a move aimed at regular refinancing, JSPL is raising Rs 1,200 crore by way of qualified institutional placement (QIP) to meet working capital needs and repay long term loans.

The duo joins Tata Steel, which raised Rs 12,800 crore last month through a rights issue to fund capacity expansion at Kalinganagar, barely days after JSW Steel said it would be issuing dollar-denominated senior notes.


 JSPL had initially planned to raise Rs 900 crore with an option to raise up to Rs 1,200 crore, depending on demand. The issue received good response, according to the company, and was oversubscribed 2.2 times even at the higher end of the price band of Rs 233, said an official. The fund raising spree coincides with an upturn in the steel cycle as domestic demand picks up after a gap of almost five to six years. Steel prices too have perked up in tandem, with a 20% jump in last few months alone. With a spate of government projects in affordable housing, power and railways going onstream, India’s large integrated steel producers are gearing up to add capacity.

These plans form an integral part of the ambitious National Steel Policy (NSP), which aims at raising India’s production capacity to 300 million tonne per annum (mtpa) by 2030, up from 100 mtpa at present. The target involves a substantial hike in the country’s per capita consumption of steel to 160 kg from the present low of 65 kg per person, aiming for its highest growth in over a decade.

While this may still be far below the average consumption in developed countries like the US or Japan, which top the steel consumption charts at 235 kg per capita, the NSP has set such an aggressive growth target, perhaps for the first time.

Deepak Sogani, chief financial officer, JSPL, said investors are showing a good appetite in Indian steel firms. “A growing home market, the government steel policy are factors adding to the optimism,” he said, having just returned from a roadshow for JSPL’s QIP.

Insolvency resolution of stressed steel assets in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that will help consolidate the steel sector is being seen as an encouraging trend, as global ratings agency Moody’s said in a recent report.

Tata Steel is close to acquiring the mid-sized Bhushan Steel. More such cases nearing resolution have sent out positive signals to investors, said Sogani, pointing out that reports indicate the 40% capacity share of the unorganised steel sector is set to shrink further.

Most analysts agree that increasing consolidation, domestic demand and improving profitability add to the sector’s attraction. For companies such as JSPL, it may be to fund working capital as they try to improve their capacity utilisation, said Rohit Sadaka, metals analyst, India Ratings. “For others like Vedanta, Tata Steel and JSW Steel, it could also provide them with the cash they would need to pay upfront as part of their bidding for stressed assets.”

The fact that India steelmakers have limited exposure to the US market — at around 2% — also lowers the risk of an adverse impact from the Trump administration’s recent decision to impose steep steel tariffs, Sogani added.

Also, a string of measures taken in the past couple of years, such as minimum import price, anti-dumping and safeguard duties protects India from cheaper imports."
55,2018-03-26,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel is not eligible to participate in the re-bidding process for bankrupt Essar Steel as bankers have decided to allow only those who submitted expressions of interest for the first round of bidding, group chairman Sajjan Jindal said today.

""We wanted to re-enter and give a good competition where bankers could have got more money; but they decided against it so we will not be bidding again,"" Jindal said.

""The committee of creditors told us that we are not eligible to bid for Essar Steel in the second round, as we weren't part of the six companies that put up the EoIs in the first round,"" the head of the largest private sector alloy-maker told reporters.

The 10-million tonne Essar Steel, which owes more than Rs 45,000 crore to over 30 lenders, is the biggest asset on the block right now, and has been thrown open for rebidding after ArcelorMittal and Numetal were found to be ineligible on March 23 on technical grounds.

""We had written to the Essar Steel lenders making a case to enter the bidding process without a partner,"" Jindal further said on the sidelines of a press conference announcing a new facility in Texas with an investment of up to USD 500 million to make steel pipes and plates to serve the large oil and gas industry in the southern US state.

""Unfortunately, the bankers felt that if we were given an opportunity they'd have to advertise it in the newspapers and call for the bids again...people may have to call for the data centre to be opened which would further delay the process,"" Jindal said, adding, ""but we told them we will not wait for all those formalities but will straight away submit the financial proposal. But was turned down.""

While Numetal, floated by the PE arm of the Russian state-run lender VTB which owns the majority and Ravi Ruia's son Rewant with 25 per cent stake, was declared ineligible due to the presence of the Ruia family member as a minority promoter, ArcelorMittal India also met the same fate because of its 29 per cent participation in Uttam Galva Steel which is also under insolvency now.

The Indian arm of the Luxembourg-based steel major, which is the world's largest alloy maker exited Uttam Galva earlier this month and last week had also got the information published by the stock exchanges, the company claimed today.

In fact, Numetal's and ArcelorMittal's bids have been under a cloud after government had in December amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to stop defaulting promoters or their connected parties from bidding for insolvency assets.

Since then both the companies have challenged the bankers and RP's decision at the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT which has advanced the hearing on the pleas on March 27 from April 4.

The rebidding for Essar Steel is now open till April 2 and only the original six are eligible to participate.

Jindal said they didn't participate in the earlier bid because they were busy with the bidding process for Bhushan Steel but were outbid by the Tatas.

On the proposed changes in the IBC code, under which the government plans to further amend Section 29A to allow related parties of defaulters without any management control, to bid for NCLT assets with prospective effect, he said unless the whole law is amended it would be unfair.

""If the whole law is amended to say that a defaulter is allowed to participate, then it's fine. But if the defaulting promoter cures itself by selling shares, then it's a mockery of system,"" Jindal said without naming ArcelorMittal which sold its stake in Uttam Galva during the resolution process.

Meanwhile JSW Steel joint managing director Sheshagiri Rao said they have emerged as the final bidder for Monnet Ispat & Energy, the 270-days resolution process for which will expire in April.

""We are awaiting the final voting by the committee of creditors,"" Rao said."
54,2018-03-26,JSW,"MUMBAI: The JSW Group will invest up to USD 500 million more in its steel pipes and plates facility in Texas, helping it achieve the full 1-million tonne installed capacity of the plant it had bought in 2007 and stop sourcing raw steel from Latin America and India.

The JSW group had bought the then bankrupt Baytown steel asset for USD 810 million in October 2007, and is operating at just about 30 per cent or 3 lakh tonne now.

Since the acquisition, JSW has invested around USD 220 million in working capital and incurred USD 170 million in losses, taking its total exposure to the facility to USD 1.2 billion, JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal said here today.

""The Jindals' investment will go into backward integration and also to create the first melt and manufacture contiguous plates and pipes facility in Texas,"" Texas governor Gregory Abbott told reporters here while signing the investment pact.

Junior Jindal, Prath, who is also a director at the Group and also heads the US operations of JSW Steel, was quick to add the plant since then has almost turned around with cash profit of USD 180 million last year and expressed optimism that it will turnaround fully by 2020.

The plant will serve the oil and gas rich Texas, which is the second largest American state and also the largest exporter from the world's largest economy, Abbott said.

He said the investment over the next two years will create 500 new jobs. The plant already employs 350 people.

The junior Jindal said currently the plant, which runs at 30 per cent of the installed 1-million tonne capacity, sources steel from Brazil, Mexico and India, which will stop completely once the new facility is commissioned as it will sourcing raw steel from within Texas/US itself.

""From India alone, we have been importing 1.5 lakh tonne of raw steel plates. This will come to an end by October 2020 when the second phase of expansion is complete. The first phase will be over by March 2019,"" Parth Jindal said.

Sajjan Jindal said the plant will get USD 3.4 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund on completion of the investment, which is subject to the approval from the environmental protection agency.

The plant will come up at Baytown in the minerals-rich state, around 30 miles from Houston, senior Jindal said.

Parth Jindal also said JSW Steel USA Inc will be rebranded as JSW USA.

When asked about the timing of investment as to whether this was aimed at circumventing the new duties slapped on steel imports by the Donald Trump regimen, Parth parried a direct answer saying, ""this investment is part of our long-term strategy to enhance our US footprint.

""It reiterates our commitment to stay invested and grow in the US market. It also provides us with an opportunity to participate in America's infrastructure development and job creation priorities.""

He further said the decision is also driven by the easy access to natural gas at extremely economical prices and abundant availability of scrap steel in Texas.

He said this investment was in the works for the past 18 months but was delayed due to very low crude prices.

""Since the prices have recovered to reasonable levels now, we thought of speeding up our plans. The Texan oil and gas industry needs 8-mt of steel pipes and plates annually of which almost 25 per cent are met through imports. This market is what we are trying to capture.

""Since the crude prices have moved up there is lot of replacement demand for pipes and plates now in the oil sector,"" the junior Jindal said.

Commenting on the investment, Abbott said, ""This will not only expand the steel mill in Baytown, but will also construct a facility that will use melt-and-manufacture technology thereby enabling the company to supply steel for defence and domestic infrastructure projects.""

""This investment will strengthen our overall partnership and generate more economic activity in Texas, creating up to 500 new jobs as well as provide high-quality steel products to the US,"" the governor added.

Already a USD 150-million investment is underway at the plant to augment its capabilities, which will be completed by March 2020. JSW will invest USD 350 million more to set-up a new hot-end facility to make steel melt and manufacture.

The Baytown facility is already one of the largest steel plates and pipes mills in Texas and serves the energy, petrochemicals, defence and other heavy industries."
53,2018-03-26,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel will not be participating in the rebid for Essar Steel as the company was not part of the initial group that submitted expressions of interest in the first round of bidding, Sajjan Jindal said on Monday after he got a definitive reply from lenders disallowing the company to bid on the same ground. 

Jindal said that because the company was busy with Bhushan Steel which is the prime asset that it had identified to acquire, it did not show an interest in Essar Steel initially, but was willing to re-enter now as it lost Bhushan to Tata Steel.

Lenders to Essar Steel have decided that with only a small window of time available now for the resolution process for the company to end, it would be advisable to invite applications only from those who had submitted EoIs in the first round as they have already had access to the data room for the company. 

""We wanted to re-enter and give a good competition where the creditors could have gotten more money too; but the CoC decided against it so we will not be bidding again,"" chairman of the JSW Group, Sajjan Jindal told reporters on Monday on the sidelines of a press conference organised to announce JSW Steel's investment plans in its US facility. 

Essar Steel which is the biggest asset on the block right now has been thrown open for bidding a second time after the final two bidders- ArcelorMittal and NuMetal were declared ineligible by lenders after evaluating their bids.

Not naming any company, Jindal also said that promoters selling their shares in defaulting companies to become eligible to participate in the bidding process goes against the spirit of the IBC. 

Jindal was hinting at ArcelorMittal exiting Uttam Galva, a NPA itself, to participate in the bidding for Essar. ArcelorMittal has reportedly said that it will participate in the re-bid. 

""If a defaulting promoter tries to cure himself by selling his shares then that is a mockery of the law,"" Jindal said. 

JSW Steel has emerged as the final bidder for Monnet Ispat and Energy, the 270-days resolution process for which will expire in April. The plan is awaiting the final voting by banks, Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel said."
52,2018-03-26,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The Sensex slipped below the crucial 33,000 level and NSE’s Nifty below the psychologically important 10,000 level on Friday, as first signs of emergence of a global trade war roiled equity markets around the world

BSE’s 30-pack tumbled 1.7 per cent during the week gone by while NSE’s Nifty lost 2 per cent.

“The price-wise correction is over for the market; maybe another 100-200 point fall in Nifty is all that we anticipate,” says Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO, Yes Securities.

But the time-wise correction is going to be a lot more painful and individual stocks will keep on moving up and down. So this is going to be a phase which will be terrible for traders, but will be a good time for investors to hold on to stocks and build a portfolio for the long run, he said.


Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver handsome gains over the next three weeks or so.


Sagar Doshi, Technical Analyst, Edelweiss Investment Research


Hexaware | Buy | Target Price: 400 | Stop loss: Rs 360

Out of all sectoral indices, the IT sector is the one which is not participating in the current fall. While the Nifty has made lower lows, the IT index has not yet broken its previous lows of Feb 2018. Out of all the IT stock, midcap firm Hexaware stands strong, with the stock trading just 3 per cent away from its lifetime high. It has also sustained above its 20DMA and is nearing a breakout.


Bajaj Finserv | Buy | Target Price: Rs 5,340 | Stop loss: Rs 4,965

While the market is down 4 per cent in March, this stock is up 5 per cent. Trading in a tapering range and near a trendline breakout, the stock could further continue its outperformance against the market and resume its long-term uptrend. On the longer timeframe chart, the stock is forming a FLAG pattern on a monthly basis.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


NTPC | Buy | Target Price: Rs 187 | Stop loss: Rs 160

This counter appears to have registered a durable bottom at the recent low of Rs 158 hit last February and since then a fresh leg of upswing is in progress. Interestingly, after hitting the said low, it has consolidated in a narrow range for four weeks and then witnessed a sustainable breakout. As long as it sustains above Rs 160 level, one can look for a higher target at Rs 187.


Zee Entertainment | Buy | Target Price: Rs 619 | Stop loss: Rs 547

The way this counter has recoiled after testing its 200-day EMA is suggesting that this counter has bottomed out around Rs 550 level, but can also head to much higher levels in the course of time. In the near term, the Rs 581 level may act as a hiccup but once that level is conquered, it can almost retest its life time highs placed around the Rs 619 level. Positional traders should buy now and on declines in the zone of Rs 560-555.


JSW Steel | Buy | Target Price: Rs 320 | Stop loss: Rs 273

It is very interesting that this counter from the metals pack registered new lifetime high on February 27, when there was turbulence both in the market as well as in the entire metal sector. This is clearly suggesting that this counter has successfully decoupled from the uncertainty related to metals pack and capable of going higher on its own inherent strength, irrespective of market conditions.


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical/ Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities


ICICI Prudential Life Insurance | Buy | Target Price: Rs 400 | Stop loss: Rs 370

This stock has bounced from its support level at Rs 368, which roughly corresponds to the previous intermediate lows, thereby implying a double bottom formation pattern. We also observe that the intense selling seen recently has been reduced in the process, which is encouraging. With the stock on the verge of moving above its 13-day SMA and momentum readings like the 14-day RSI in rising mode and not overbought, we believe the stock has more upside potential.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher


Gujarat State Petronet | Buy | Target price: Rs 204 | Stop loss: Rs 170

This stock recently witnessed a steep correction from the Rs 210 level and has bottomed out at Rs 172 level. The counter has the potential to rise further in the coming days. Chart patterns look attractive and with the RSI indicating a trend reversal from the oversold zone. A buy signal has been triggered to maintain a positive bias. 


Jubilant Life | Buy | Target price: Rs 890 | Stop loss: Rs 780
This stock has taken a support around Rs 780 on two occasions to indicate a strong base at this mark. “We anticipate Jubilant Life to be in the recovery mode from here on and scale further upside targets in the coming days,” said Parekh. Positive candle patterns indicate a positive bias. Also with the RSI turning positive from the oversold zone, the stock is poised for a bounce.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA


GE Power India | Buy | Target Price: Rs 895 | Stop loss: Rs 838

This stock completed its corrective move after testing the high of Rs 1,044. It attempted to find a base in the Rs 810-840 range and is not seen breaking out from this congestion. The prices have ended outside the upper Bollinger Band on the daily chart. The band remains 43 per cent narrower-than-normal and this further increases the chance of a decisive move. MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The RSI is seen breaking out from a formation while marking higher highs. It also shows bullish divergence against the price.


PNB Gilts | Buy | Target Price: Rs 38 | Stop loss: Rs 33.50

This stock has remained in a dominant downtrend for the major part of the previous year. Currently, after testing low of Rs 34, the stock is seen possibly accumulating in the Rs 34-35 zone and might attempt a reversal. A buy signal has emerged over Stochastic with a bullish divergence against the price. MACD remains in continuing buy mode. On the weekly charts, the prices appear to have taken support at the 200-period moving average. The weekly RSI shows a bullish divergence against the price.

58,2018-03-27,JSW,"The much awaited hearing at the NCLT's Ahmedabad bench over the rejection of bids of ArcelorMittal and Numetal in the Essar Steel insolvency resolution process has been deferred till April 4, ET Now reported.

The NCLT bench has asked the parties to file replies by April 2. The next hearing will take place on April 4, ET Now said. 

Both ArcelorMittal and Numetal have moved the NCLT challenging the rejection of their bids for Essar Steel.

While ArcelorMittal's bid was rejected as it held promoter stake in the defaulting firm Uttam Galva, the company has sold its entire stake in Uttam Galva and received a nod from the bourses declassifying it as Uttam Galva's promoter.

The newly introduced section 29(A) in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code bars defaulting promoters from participating in the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP).

Numetal's bid was rejected over concerns that Russian VTB bank -led consortium had Rewant Ruia as one of the shareholders raising concerns that the Ruias will get back the reins of Essar Steel.

On Monday, JSW Steel chairman Sajjan Jindal had said that letting those who have sold promoter stake in defaulting firms enter the bidding process is tantamount to the mockery of the law obliquely referring to the ArcelorMittal's selling of stake in Uttam Galva.

JSW Steel was not allowed by the Committee of Creditors to bid for Essar Steel as it was not one of the parties who had originally submitted the Expression of Interest.

The CoC had rejected both Numetal and ArcelorMittal's bids earlier and called for fresh bidding letting only those who had submitted Expression of Interest to participate."

Top steelmaker plans to triple output at its Texas plant as the U.S. and China trade punches in what may become an extended trade war, sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports of the metal.

The U.S. unit of JSW Steel Ltd. has signed an agreement with the Governor of Texas to consider an investment of as much as $500 million, the Mumbai-based steelmaker said in a statement on Monday. JSW will invest about $150 million to raise capacity at its existing plate and pipe mill complex and spend the rest to set up a new hot metal facility, it said.

“We expect to triple the production, sales and revenue at the facility post the modernization,” Parth Jindal, director of JSW USA, said in Mumbai. The beefed-up unit will help service Mexico and parts of Latin America, besides the U.S., he said. Parth is the son of Sajjan Jindal, chairman of the parent company.

The only Indian steelmaker with a U.S. unit, JSW’s expansion comes after Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, aiming to restrict a flood of cheap foreign supplies that have hurt American mills. President Xi Jinping retaliated as China, the largest producer, announced counter-tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. imports from pork to steel, escalating a trade war that has roiled global markets. For JSW, the charms of the U.S. market have been accentuated by a rebound in crude oil.

“This is the right time to invest in the U.S. economy, and specially in manufacturing of steel,” said Jindal. “Not only will there be a huge replacement of old pipeline infrastructure that was built predominantly in the 1960s and 70s, there are going to be a lot of new pipelines being added.”

The Texas unit of the Indian conglomerate, bought in 2008 just before the financial crisis crippled the U.S economy, currently produces 300,000 metric tons a year and is expected to churn out as much as 1 million tons after the modernization and expansion is completed in 24 months, he said. The entire plate market in Texas is about 8 million tons, Jindal said.

JSW’s shares rallied as much as 3.2 percent and were trading at 294.20 rupees at 3:20 p.m in Mumbai.

“We are keen to make a very big impact in the steel industry,” said Jindal. “We want to bring steel manufacturing back to the U.S.”"
59,2018-03-28,JSW,"MUMBAI: Steel producers may look at increasing prices at home, as macro trends show signs of a global recovery and as they try to extract maximum benefit from pricing in the first quarter before the lax monsoon season sets in.

However, based on historical evidence, this is unlikely to result in any significant increase in the realisations for companies, steel industry experts said. Even with an average price increase of Rs 3,500 per tonne between January and March, average realisation for the last quarter of the current fiscal year is expected to move up only by Rs 1,500 per tonne. This is because of the variance in price hikes and realisations that exist because of the heterogeneous nature of the industry that offers multiple products with pricing trends differing from product to product. A price hike is also due for companies rewriting their earlier contracts that were based on a lower base existed before December 2017.

“We see a broad-based recovery taking place in key markets like the US, Europe, China and Japan that is leading to a growth in steel demand,” Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel, told ET in an interview.

“We’re also seeing a similar possibility of capacity expansion investment similar to what existed in 2001, driven by recovery.”

Goutam Chakraborty, a metals analyst at Emkay Securities, also has a similar view. He expects the industry to see higher demand for the next one-and-a-half years.

In the domestic scenario, demand is being driven by automotive, construction and yellow goods production. JCB, a manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, has increased its production to 7,000 units per month from 4,000-5,000, said an industry executive, pointing to it as an indication of improvement in construction activities that is also pushing up the price of steel bars.

“There is still some steam left in the price hike,” said a senior official at a steel company, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

In fact, companies have been increasing prices by Rs 1,000-1,500 per tonne since December. But with the lag effect of earlier contracts, new contracts, especially with automakers, stand to see an increase in price by almost Rs 6,000 per tonne, the official said.

However, there are global factors that could dampen prices. Globally, prices have come down over the last one month with a fall in the cost of raw materials like iron ore and coking coal. Iron ore prices have fallen to $60 a tonne from around $70, while coking coal has become cheaper at $210 per tonne from $235.

“There is a sentimental softening at the global level even though the Indian scenario looks good,” Chakraborty said.

Another factor that could weigh on steel price is the US decision to impose tariffs on imported steel — exporters may look at fresh markets to dump their produce, hurting prices.

But industry players hope the US to exclude Japan, the European Union and South Korea and other allies from the tariff-based regime — that means steel products from those places will not come to markets like India. However, with the European Commission initiating a safeguard investigation on steel products including from India , market conditions may change.

But there is still time for the investigation to show results, said the industry executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The probe may go on for nine months and shipments may not suffer during that time, he said.

The EU accounted for around 40 per cent of India’s total steel exports so far in this fiscal year."

Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session: 

Motherson Sumi: Auto components major Motherson Sumi Systems is set to acquire Reydel Automotive Group (Reydel) for $201million. This would be the 21st acquisition for the Samvardhana Motherson Group and is aimed to further bolster Motherson’s offerings in the automotive interiors space. The acquisition is intended to enable both companies to capitalise on new opportunities in their existing and new geographies, as well as within each others’ customer portfolios.


Vedanta, JSW Steel: Vedanta Resources and JSW jumped into the fray to buy bankrupt Essar Steel, with the Russian bank VTB roping in the Sajjan Jindal-led steel firm to increase its chances of securing the prized asset in a day of dramatic developments on Monday. The Anil Agarwal-controlled Vedanta made a surprise entry into the race for Essar and will now jostle for capturing control of the firm with ArcelorMittal and the Numetal-JSW consortium, ET reported. VTB is the largest shareholder in Numetal.


Bank of India, Axis Bank and Allahabad Bank: The CBI has questioned senior officials of Bank of India, Axis Bank and Allahabad Bank in connection with its probe in the PNB scam. Agency sources said about five officers in the ranks of general manager and above have been grilled by the agency in the last few days to understand how the Letters of Undertaking and Foreign Letters of Credit issued by PNB in this case were executed vis-a-vis Nirav Modi’s businesses.


Fortis Healthcare: According to reports, the company has sought shareholders' nod for acquisition of assets of RHT Health Trust. Shares of the company on Monday closed at Rs 127.10, up 3 per cent.


DLF: Realty firm DLF has given on lease about 2.25 lakh sq ft of office space in Gurgaon to US-based co-working major WeWork, PTI reported citing sources. Earlier, DLF had also provided around 60,000 sq ft office space on lease to co-working operator Skootr. The demand for co-working space is rising in India due to affordable rents and flexible working options.


Arvind: Textile major Arvind is planning to produce 40 per cent of garments in-house, from 10 per cent at present, as it looks to notch up the turnover of its textile business to Rs 10,000 crore in the next five years. ""Presently, about 10 per cent of our fabrics are made into garments internally. We are targeting to grow this to 40 per cent of our production,” ET reported quoting Aamir Akhtar, chief executive, denims, Arvind.


HAL: State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics on Monday said it has recorded a turnover of over Rs 18,000 crore for the 2017-18 fiscal ended March 31, up just 2.24 per cent year-on-year. HAL had reported a turnover of Rs 17,605 crore in the previous fiscal. The company listed its shares on the bourses last week. On Monday, shares of the company closed at Rs 1,149.45 apiece, up nearly 2 per cent.


BEL: Bharat Electronics (BEL) on Monday said that it's sales turnover touched Rs 10,000 crore-mark for the fiscal 2017-18, registering 13 per cent annual growth. The Navratna company, however, did not disclose provisional or unaudited profit before or after tax posted for the fiscal under review."
1,2018-04-03,JSW,"India’s JSW Steel has entered into an agreement to acquire US-based steel company Acero Junction Holdings weeks after the Trump government proposed higher tariffs for imported steel. The increasing protectionist measures by the US offer an opportunity for US-based steel producers and JSW Steel is taking advantage of its relatively strong balance sheet to ramp up its US presence.

The move will also give JSW a natural hedge for its exports business.

“The acquisition provides a unique opportunity for JSW Steel to establish its presence in the United States and gain deeper access to the North American market,” said a company spokesperson. JSW Steel has been prudent to avoid buying assets at high valuations unlike other peers and has been less aggressive in bidding for Indian steel companies such as Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel. JSW has got an attractive deal with Acero.

At US$ 180 million enterprise value ($81 million debt and $99 million equity) and assuming capital expenditure of another $50 million, the transaction value implied is about $155 EV/tonne, nearly one third of JSW’s recent brownfield expansions and has got a thumps up from the analysts. This company’s stock price closed up 3 per cent on Monday at ?297.

Acero, which has plants in Ohio, primarily owns 1.5 mtpa of EAF (electric arc furnace) based steel-making capacity and a 3 mtpa hot strip mill capacity. The asset is currently under stress and largely non-operational with revenue of just US$44 million in the past 1.5 years. JSW will have to pump in $50 million to restart operations. The company may also consider more investments to increase the steel capacity (Currently 1.5 mtpa) as it as has excess hot strip mill capacity (3 mtpa) but it said this was subject to market dynamics.

Once fully operational, Acero will add 8 per cent to JSW Steel’s current capacity and the downstream hot strip mill business will take the company closer to customers. Though relatively modest, analysts expect the acquisition to add 10-15 per cent of earnings once fully operational which would add ?20 to ?26 per share.

In the past, JSW has made several acquisitions. While the acquisition of Ispat in 2010 was a major success, it has not been able to meaningfully turn around a US-based plate and pipe mills business it acquired in 2007."
5,2018-04-04,JSW,"NEW DELHI: JSW Steel today posted its highest monthly and quarterly crude steel production as of March 31 - 1.52 million tonne (MT) and 4.31 MT, respectively.

""The monthly production of 1.52 MT for March signifies a capacity utilisation of 101 per cent,"" it said. 

The production last month was high as compared to 1.45 MT during the same month in 2016-17. 

The output in January-March stood at at 4.31 MT, up 5 per cent from the production in the year-ago quarter.

3,2018-04-04,JSW,"Sajjan Jindal’s JSW didn’t swap places with Rewant Ruia-connected offshore trust Aurora in the Numetal consortium bidding for Essar Steel, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.

Instead, JSW has come on board Nu Metal & Steel Pvt. Ltd, a drop-down subsidiary of Numetal Mauritius, as an “investor” with a 25 per cent stake, they said. This entity is registered locally and is also known as Nu Metal India. It had been reported that JSW replaced 25 per cent stakeholder Aurora in Numetal.

In fact, JSW’s name is not even mentioned as a resolution applicant, or bidder, in the revised offer, which was submitted on April 2. The company will not have any board representation or management rights either if Numetal wins the bid, said the people cited above.

Numetal Mauritius, the entity that originally submitted the bid competing against ArcelorMiital-Nippon Steel in the first round, had had four principal shareholders--VTB Bank of Russia (40 per cent ), UAE-incorporated Indo International Trading FZCO (25.1 per cent ) Aurora Trust Mauritius (25 per cent ) and Vo Tyazhpromexport (TPE), which owned the residual 9.9 per cent .

Both first-round bids were rejected on the grounds that they were not compliant with Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The provision bans promoters of defaulting companies as well as related parties and connected persons from bidding for stressed assets unless they clear their dues.

For Numetal, Rewant Ruia’s participation was the bone of contention, giving rise to the impression that consortium was a proxy for the promoter family, the Ruias. The remaining three partners therefore bought out Aurora’s stake. VTB remains the single largest shareholder.

Numetal has challenged its disqualification at the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The matter comes up for hearing on Wednesday.

“The reason why JSW is coming in as a step-down subsidiary is because Numetal is confident of winning the case against its disqualification in NCLT. If it gets upheld by the court, then Rewant Ruia and Aurora can make a comeback in Numetal Mauritius. Having JSW in the Mauritius entity would have only complicated the structure,” said an official in the know.

While JSW will own a quarter of Nu Metal India, the remaining 75 per cent will be held via Numetal Mauritius. Both Numetal and JSW spokes persons declined to comment.



Sources close to JSW said the company has followed all relevant requirements for the bid in this IBC competitive process as an investor along with another eligible resolution applicant. "" In pursuance to this strategy, JSW Steel Ltd in the capacity of an investor joined Nu Metal & Steel Pvt Ltd in submitting a binding bid for Essar Steel Ltd, which is under the corporate insolvency resolution process as per the provisions of Insolvency Bankruptcy Code 2016,.” the company said in a statement on Monday. JSW’s presence in the consortium is also expected to erase doubts about Numetal’s ex pertise in steel.

“There is 30 per cent weightage to technical ex pertise in the resolution plan. Unlike VTB which is a bank or the other shareholders who are relatively unknown entities in India, nobody can question the credentials of JSW being the fastest-growing and largest private sector steel maker in the country with a known track record of turning around companies,” said an official involved in the matter. “They joined hands to strengthen the credibility of the bid.” Russian foreign investment rules led to the creation of a two-tiered structure.

One of the sources mentioned above said Russian state-owned entities cannot own more than 49.9 per cent in foreign entities to avoid consolidating these investments in their balance sheet.

Thus, even though Aurora has been bought out by the existing three partners, none of the two Russian entities will have a 50 per cent stake. That’s why Russian energy giant Rosneft bought 49.13 per cent in Essar Oil, while another 49.13 per cent was acquired by Trafigura and Russia’s UCP Investment. Such a structure also helps avoid the US sanctions."
2,2018-04-04,JSW,"ArcelorMittal and its partner Nippon Steel queried the inclusion of Sajjan Jindal’s JSW in the rival Numetal consortium a day after revised bids for Essar Steel were submitted.

“In order to participate in the re-bidding, you had to have submitted an expression of interest in the first round. I don’t believe the current members of Numetal did that,” ArcelorMittal executive V-P Brian Aranha told ET.

JSW replaced Aurora Enterprises Mauritius, a Singapore-based trust of which Rewant Ruia–son of Essar co-founder Ravi Ruia–was the beneficiary.

Thus, the composition of the Numetal consortium that made the offer on April 2 was different from the one that submitted the expression of interest in October, ArcelorMittal said. Under the terms of the request for proposal (RFP), a consortium’s constituents cannot be changed in such a manner, it said.

A Numetal spokesperson rejected this. “It is Numetal Ltd and not Essar Communications or Aurora Enterprises which had submitted the expression of interest (EoI) in response to the advertisement issued by the resolution professional of Essar Steel India Ltd,” he said.



Numetal had to change the shareholding as the original EoI predated amendments that were introduced in November aimed at keeping out promoters of defaulters who didn’t repay dues or their related parties and connected persons, said sources close to the consortium.

Moreover, Aurora had to relinquish its place in favour of JSW as the Numetal bid was ineligible because of its presence.

The RFP gives potential resolution applicants full flexibility to organise their structure prior to submission of bids, said the people cited above. In the case of Essar Steel, the previous bid was cancelled and fresh bids were called. Under these circumstances, there is no restriction on who Numetal brings in as a partner or an investor, they said.

During the first round, a clause was added to the RFP to the effect that a resolution applicant can bring in an investor even after submitting the bid, provided the details of the proposed investor and the investment structure are disclosed in the bid, sources said.

Last month, lenders led by State Bank of India sought fresh offers from all the five entities that had submitted expressions of interest after the resolution professional concluded that the only two offers in the first round—from ArcelorMittal and Numetal—were not compliant with Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

Both ArcelorMittal and Numetal have said their bids were compliant with the rules and have legally challenged their disqualification. ArcelorMittal decided to join forces with Nippon Steel, which had also submitted an EoI, on the Essar Steel bid.

“We are not afraid of competition,” Aranha said. “Whether they are eligible or not is a different question. But we are very confident that no one else matches the industrial track record and standing of ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel. We believe it would be difficult for anyone else in the steel industry to match that.”

JSW’s participation was a “defensive move” to block competition, he said. Moreover, if Numetal wins, it could mean JSW potentially controlling 90% of flat rolled products in key markets of western India, raising possible competition issues. “To achieve the ambitious target of increasing steel production to 300 million tonnes, India needs new players,” Aranha said.

He rejected the contention by minority shareholders in Uttam Galva that ArcelorMittal’s exit from the debt-laden company to be eligible to bid for Essar Steel had violated a “non-disposal undertaking” that it had signed with the State Bank of India.

A JSW spokesperson said: “JSW Steel has always adhered to the law and followed all relevant requirements for our bid in this IBC competitive process as an investor alongwith another eligible Resolution Applicant. We are a strong eligible player to be part of this process. We are happy to be part of this process and contribute to the nation-building effort.”"

8,2018-04-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: Analysts tracking the steel industry are divided in their views on the possibility of JSW Steel attaining monopoly in the western market if its consortium with Nu Metal acquires Essar Steel, explaining that the primary infrastructure alloy is a global commodity for which price benchmarks usually are set overseas.

Last week, ArcelorMittal hit out at JSW Steel alleging that Sajjan Jindal’s firm will control more than 90% of the steel supply in the western market. Analysts that ET spoke to compared the situation with ArcelorMittal’s market share of more than 83% in the cold rolled steel space in Italy after its recent acquisition of Ilva.

JSW Steel already has a 5 MT steel facility at its plant in Dolvi, which it plans to raise to 10 MT by 2020. With 12 MT steel capacity in Vijaynagar in Karnataka, together with Essar Steel’s production capacity of 10 MT, JSW Steel could have a sizeable presence in the South and the West if it were to win the bid.

Although this puts the steel maker in a position of significant strength in the western market, it has to be noted that in the overall Indian market, its dominance will be just about 20% given its entire mix of products. India's present steel capacity is 128 MT.

“The competitive landscape for the steel industry in India will undergo a change due to the change in ownerships of the businesses, reduction in debt levels of the subject assets vis-à-vis non-NCLT cases etc.,” said Anjani Agarwal, global steel leader at EY.

“Regional capacity concentration may be a matter of attention from CCI (Competition Commission of India). However, given the globalised nature of the industry, regional trade dominance, if any, may be very limited in time and impact,” Agarwal said.

According to data examined by ET, ArcelorMittal controls almost 48% of the market in the EU in the hot rolled coiled product space as well as 54% in the cold rolled product space after the acquisition of Ilva. Another analyst said even though steel is a global commodity with prices determined by international benchmarks price, JSW Steel’s control of the western market may give it some price advantage.

With a likely low logistics cost, the company may price its products more competitively."
9,2018-04-09,JSW,"The board of Tata Sons, the holding company of the diversified conglomerate, will discuss the various mergers and acquisitions (M&A) plans of the Tata group, especially with regard to the debt that it will be running up, said two people with direct knowledge of the development.

Directors of Tata Sons, which will provide the primary guarantee for any funding that’s needed, have sought more information from the group’s new M&A team on two key transactions, they said. This includes the divestment of Tata Teleservices’ consumer mobile business to Bharti Airtel and bids to purchase bankrupt Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel under the insolvency resolution process.

The board, aware of the opportunities for acquisitions that could be earning per share accretive in the future, want to be briefed about the debt that will pile up and whether the price is excessive. Tata is expected to assume about Rs 31,000 crore of debt in the Tata Teleservices deal. Tata Steel’s debt could rise to about Rs 90,000 crore if the Bhushan acquisitions go through.

“All the acquisition and merger proposals will be discussed at the board meeting soon,” said one of the two persons cited above. A Tata Sons spokesperson said: “We do not comment on board discussions.” The move comes amid concerns expressed by senior executives of group companies that they haven’t been consulted on M&A negotiations. ET had reported March 24 that some Tata veterans were said to be disgruntled about new appointees under Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran being given too free a hand to build their own teams unlike before.

Some executives referred to the ejection of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons chairman for, among other reasons, not keeping the Tata Trusts in the loop about certain acquisitions. The philanthropic Tata Trusts, run by Ratan Tata, have a controlling stake in Tata Sons.

“There is concern that why have experienced executives been kept out of such big deals and if Cyrus Mistry was criticised for not keeping the Trusts updated on the Welspun deal, how is the Bhushan Steel issue different,” a top executive told ET. “There is a concern among some top brass about a transactional culture coming in where short-term deals do not keep long-term strategy in mind.”



Another worry was the sale of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stock. “Tata Sons’ exposure to the funding of multiple deals when TCS is the only cash cow for the group has got the top brass worried in the Trusts and the Tata Sons board,” said a top official. Incidentally, Chandrasekaran was TCS CEO until he took over as Tata Sons chairman in February 2017.

In March, Tata Sons sold a marginal 1.5% stake in TCS for Rs 9,000 crore, primarily to improve the leverage ratio of the holding company which has been purchasing stakes from group companies as part of untangling the cross-holdings among them. “TCS sale is hardly a recommended sale since it involves selling high price-earnings stocks to fund lower PE ones,”said the person cited above. “The number of rights issues Tata Sons have participated in recently, delay in sorting out the merger of Tata Teleservices with Airtel and sale of fibre assets are also concerns of the board.”

The Tata Sons board has three directors nominated by Tata Trusts with a veto power, while others represent Tata Sons. “In usual circumstances, the decision usually goes to the board of the operating company, but large deals which change debt ceiling or in case an equity issue is needed, Tata Sons need to give a tacit approval,” a former Tata Sons director told ET.

In the Bhushan bankruptcy process Tata Steel has offered an upfront payment of Rs 34,800 crore to lenders, along with a 12.27% in the debt-laden Bhushan Steel. It has also offered to pay salary arrears of 353 workers of Bhushan Steel and ensure continuation of employment. It has offered to pay Rs 24,500 crore for Bhushan Power and Steel against rival JSW Steel’s Rs 11,000 crore. One concern is over whether Tata Steel has offered too high a price.

The board may raise questions over the debt of Tata Steel rising to around Rs 90,000 crore if it acquires the Bhushan companies, though this will increase capacity, add value-added, higher-margin auto steel to the product range and improve operating profit due to better capacity utilisation. The board may also seek details of the purchase offer by American private equity fund TPG Capital for the optic fibre business of Tata Teleservices."

14,2018-04-11,JSW,"MUMBAI: A day after lenders to Monnet Ispat approved JSW Steel's resolution plan almost unanimously, ArcelorMittal said that JSW Steel winning Monnet Ispat is a ""mockery"" as the group is related to the existing promoter of the debt-ridden steel company. 

JSW Steel has however, refuted the remark saying it has been declared as a qualified applicant under section 29A and the allegation is intended to defame the company. 

""@sajjanjindal Interesting what decision is being taken on Monnet today given it’s clear JSW runs afoul of 29A as they are related to the existing promoter….who is making the mockery here?"" read a post by ArcelorMittal on the social media website Twitter, taking a direct jibe at the JSW group chairman Sajjan Jindal who was also tagged in the post. 

It should be noted that the use of the word ""mockery"" in the post is actually a retaliation to what Jindal had said about ArcelorMittal last month at a press conference. 

""If a defaulting promoter tries to cure himself by selling his shares then that is a mockery of the law,"" Jindal had said, hinting at ArcelorMittal's exit from Uttam Galva, a NPA itself, to participate in the bidding for Essar Steel, even though it had refrained from naming any company. 

The CoC of Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited (MIEL) Tuesday approved the resolution plan submitted by Aion Investment-JSW Steel consortium by a 98.97% favourable voting and a letter of intent for the same is expected to arrive on Thursday. 

AM’s post refers to Sajjan Jindal’s sister, Seema Jajodia who is married to Monnet Ispat and Energy’s current promoter Sandeep Jajodia. According to section 29A of the IBC, besides undischarged insolvents, wilful defaulters among others, the clause J of the section also bars persons or entities connected to a person disqualified under the section. 

The issue of JSW Steel’s ineligibility in this regard first came to light when employees of Bhushan Steel red flagged the presence of Seema Jajodia as a promoter of MIEL until September, 2017, hence, JSW Steel’s ineligibility to bid for Bhushan Steel. In a January, 2018 notification to the stock exchanges, MIEL had said that Jajodia had transferred her shares in Monnet on October 24, 2017 through an instrument of gift. 

AM’s post on Wednesday refers to this move as Jindal had also attacked AM on its stake selling in Uttam Galva to become eligible to vote fro Essar Steel. 

The shareholding pattern data for Monnet for March, 2018 does not include the name of Seema Jajodia as part of the promoter group shareholders. 

""JSW Steel has gone through the rigour of scrutiny. After the thorough examination of facts, JSW Steel is declared as qualified resolution applicant as per the provisions of sec 29(A) of Insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 not only in Monnet and in other stressed accounts,” said a statement by JSW Steel. 

“The intention of unfounded allegations may be to defame JSW Steel or probably using insufficient or incorrect interpretation of information to mislead the general public. Jsw steel adheres to highest standards of corporate governance,” the statement added. 

ArcelorMittal and JSW Steel have locked horns over the bidding for Essar Steel where JSW has joined Numetal in bidding while ArcelorMittal is bidding along with Nippon Steel. Vedanta had also emerged as a third bidder in the rebid. 

In an earlier tweet dated April 2, AM had also said that JSW joing Numetal was a ""defensive move"" as they did not want competition."
15,2018-04-12,JSW,"Kolkata/ Mumbai: JSW Steel has strongly refuted ArcelorMittal’s allegation that its winning bid for Monnet Ispat was a “mockery” as JSW Steel and Monnet Ispat promoters are related. Speaking on the day JSW Steel received and accepted the Letter of Intent (LoI) for Monnet Ispat, Seshagiri Rao, joint MD, JSW Steel, said the allegations have “no substance” and dismissed them as “acts of frustration” by ArcelorMittal.

Reacting to AM’s tweet on Wednesday targetted chairman Sajjan Jindal, Rao said that JSW has been declared a qualified resolution applicant. “We do not understand why these issues are being raked up now? The resolution professionals (RP) for both Monnet Ispat and Bhushan Steel have said that JSW Steel is an eligible as a resolution applicant as per the provisions of Section 29(A) of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The RP is vested with the power to examine these issues and the matter has been up for scrutiny and it stood the test of scrutiny,” Rao told ET on Thursday a day after ArcelorMittal said JSW ‘ran afoul of 29A (of IBC) for Monnet Ispat.’ According to section 29A of the IBC, besides undischarged insolvents, wilful defaulters among others, the clause J of the section also bars persons or entities connected to a person disqualified under the section.

“Secondly, JSW has not invested in Monnet, neither has Monnet invest in JSW Steel,” Rao added.

“In case of ArcelorMittal –they held stake Uttam Galva as the investor themselves. Just being connected persons” — Monnet promoter Sandeep Jajodia’s wife, Seema, is the sister of JSW Steel promoter Sajjan Jindal — “does not disqualify a person,” Rao said. “There are a series of details one has to go into and it is not merely a question of only being related. There is no problem in qualifying only on the basis of being related,” he pointed out.

JSW Steel-Aion Investments consortium on Thursday received a letter of intent (LoI) for Monnet Ispat and Energy following the creditors’ 98.97% favourable vote for the company on Tuesday, the company said in a BSE notification. JSW said it has accepted the terms of the LoI and the plan is now awaiting necessary regulatory approvals from NCLT and the Competition Commission of India (CCI)."
16,2018-04-16,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel has refuted ArcelorMittal’s allegations that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was inconsistently applied, allowing the former’s bid on Monnet Ispat while disqualifying the latter from the race to acquire another debt-laden alloymaker Essar Steel.

JSW Steel, India’s leading maker of the primary infrastructure alloy, was declared eligible in its bid for Monnet Ispat, although the association with another bankrupt borrower Uttam Galva apparently caused ArcelorMittal’s first bid for Essar Steel to be rejected. 

A second round of bids was later invited for Essar Steel: Arcelor-Mittal has put in a rebid and JSW Steel has also entered the fray by joining the Numetal consortium.

The debate gains significance since ArcelorMittal has filed an application at the NCLT Ahmedabad against the rejection of its bid for Essar Steel. This week, the NCLT may give its verdict, a decision that could have an impact on the opening of bids for the second round of bidding at Essar Steel. Both ArcelorMittal and Numetal have said their first rounds bids were eligible.

A legal source close to Arcelor-Mittal said that Seema Jajodia, sister of JSW group chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal and an erstwhile promoter of Monnet Ispat, had transferred her shares in Monnet Ispat on October 24, 2017. However her name continued to be among the promoters at the stock exchanges for the quarter ended December 2017. The Monnet Ispat bid was submitted by JSW Steel on December 12, but the revised shareholding was uploaded on the exchanges only on January 27, 2018. JSW qualified for the Monnet bid.

However, ArcelorMittal’s firstround bid for Essar Steel was rejected as stock exchange records showed it remained a promoter of Uttam Galva Steels. While the company sought declassification on February 8 from the stock exchanges before submitting the bid for Essar Steel on February 12, the stock exchange approval came in March.

Listing out the difference in the two cases, JSW Steel joint MD Seshagiri Rao said: “JSW Steel has said that it did not invest in Monnet Ispat. Nor did Monnet invest in JSW shares. However, ArcelorMittal had invested in the shareholding of Uttam Galva by picking up a 29.5% stake and declaring itself as a promoter.”

Second, ArcelorMittal signed a non disclosure undertaking with banks when Uttam Galva sought a loan and as a sponsor of Uttam Galva, it committed to seek prior approval of lenders in case of any transfer of shares. Such a transfer would be allowed if the company did not default on payments to its lenders, Rao said. However, ArcelorMittal went ahead with inter se transfer of shares between promoters in Uttam Galva before putting in its bid for Essar Steel, without the approval of lenders.

Moreover, since Uttam Galva turned a defaulter, this was not permissible under law. The document said: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement and provided no event of default has occurred, each sponsor shall be permitted by the facility agent, to transfer the NDU shares, held by it, to the other sponsors subject always to the sponsors jointly and together (1) legally and beneficially continuing to hold equity shares which are equivalent to at least 51% of the issued share capital of the borrower; and (2) continuing to retain the control over the borrower.”"
17,2018-04-19,JSW,"The Thursday’s session remained extremely rangebound, as the NSE benchmark Nifty oscillated in a 20-point range throughout the day, making no directional headway. The Index gained 39.10 points or 0.37 per cent, but showed no conviction on either side.

As we approach the last trading day of the week, we see Friday’s trade getting off on a quiet note once again. The market is showing a lot of inherent buoyancy, but if we speak about the immediate short term, some consolidation is now getting long overdue.

It would be healthy for the market if it spends some time oscillating in a capped range. This will make the current pullback more healthy, sustainable and potent to scale higher levels.

The Friday’s trade will see the zones of 10,580 and 10,625 acting as resistance levels. Supports have shifted littler lower at 10,510 and 10,465 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 62.8027. While it marked a fresh 14-period high, it remained neutral against the price showing no divergence.

While daily MACD continued to stay bullish, no significant formations were observed on the candles.

Pattern analysis of the daily charts showed that the market is trying to break out from the pattern resistance area. The market is trying to break out from a rectangle formation, which resulted out of a broad trading range.

Overall, it is beyond doubt that the inherent buoyancy in the market is quite visible. However, the current structure on the daily charts looks bit overstretched and possibilities of a profit taking from higher levels cannot be ruled out.

The Nifty PCR (Put to Call ratio), which is at relatively higher levels might restrict the upmoves as well. We strongly advise to refrain from creating shorts as the undercurrent remains bullish. However, with possibilities of market encountering volatile profit taking bouts at higher levels, vigilant protection of profits is advised.

While adopting a very cautious view on the market, all profit taking bouts, if any, should be continued to be used for making select purchases.

Metal stocks outperformed in Thursday’s trade on uptick in global metal prices, with the BSE Metal index surging 4.5% to 14828.33-its highest closing level since March 1.

Hindalco Industries was the best gainer on the metal index, surging 9.1% to Rs 264.75 followed by National Aluminium Company, Vedanta and JSW Steel which rallied 4.3-9.0%.

The BSE Metal index is down 0.7% for the current calendar year 2018, underperforming the benchmark 30-share Sensex which is up 1.1% so far this year.

The rise in Thursday’s session came after aluminium prices hit their highest level in nearly seven years the previous day on growing supply concerns after US sanctions on Rusal. Nickel prices have rallied to over three year highs on growing concerns over US sanctions to Russia.

Edelweiss Securities sees Hindalco Industries as one of the beneficiaries of the surge in aluminium prices. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 325. The brokerage also has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Vedanta with a target price of Rs 425.

“We believe the current upswing in LME Al price is likely to benefit integrated players Hindalco, Alcoa and South32 the most. While risks of potential supply ramp up from China persist, we believe, in the near term, LME Al integrated players and US convertors will outperform,” said Edelweiss in a note dated April 17."

Want to screw up a good law? Just try to make it a great one.

That's what India did last November when it added a number of restrictions on who could bid for assets in a bankruptcy. The idea of the new regulations was to make it hard for errant owners to regain control of businesses without first settling their dues.

But the morality was legal overkill; and that's now evident in the farce that the insolvency of Essar Steel India Ltd. has become.

Rather than helping creditors with the best possible recovery for the $8 billion that's trapped in a 10-million-tons-a-year metals business, the bidding war has disintegrated into a contest to prove rivals ineligible. It'll be unfortunate if India's next steel king is decided not on the wrestling mat -- but via walkovers.

Rival investor groups led by VTB Capital and ArcelorMittal were the two contestants in the first round. But the creditors' committee deemed both buyers to be ineligible, and went for a second round of bids. However, in a surprising twist, the National Company Law Tribunal on Thursday held the second round, in which Vedanta Group and JSW Steel Ltd. had also jumped into the fray, to be invalid. Creditors now have to reconsider the VTB and ArcelorMittal proposals.

Bloomberg

Blame the confusion -- and crucial time wasted in litigation -- on 29A. The section, which the government slipped into the bankruptcy code in November, introduced four layers of ineligibility for potential bidders. That's a delight for losing sides' lawyers trying to trip up the winner, but a frustrating outcome for lenders whose only wish is for a big check quickly from a new owner who knows the steel business.

Now that they're back to reconsidering the original offers, creditors will have to cast a fresh glance at the VTB bid, which is problematic for two reasons. One, the consortium has a minority participation by the billionaire Ruia family, the original controlling shareholder of Essar. Preventing previous owners from making last-ditch attempts to hold on to their prized assets was supposedly the main intention of the government in introducing 29A.

Ruia’s budding buddy also comes with its own baggage. There's no convincing answer as to how a unit of VTB Bank PJSC, a Russian lender whose chairman made it to a US sanctions list this month for worldwide malign activity, could be considered fit to own a major Indian steel business.

Bloomberg

So what has Section 29A really achieved? Well, for one thing, it's become an instrument of virtue signalling. Take Indian steel tycoon Sajjan Jindal's JSW, which stepped in as VTB's second-round partner, replacing the Ruias, just in case the latter were deemed unfit. Rather than telling creditors what they could do for Essar that the other party couldn't, Jindal and ArcelorMittal had a public showdown about their relative piety. 

Whether ArcelorMittal's sale of shares in another nonperforming asset has cured it of ineligibility to bid for Indian stressed assets, or whether Jindal's sister's previous involvement in another bankrupt steel firm makes him less than pure somehow, ought to be irrelevant to resolving Essar's insolvency.

Yet these were precisely the points in a Twitter fight between Jindal and ArcelorMittal. It would provide some comic relief from India's $200 billion bad-loan problem... if New Delhi's bankruptcy law didn't turn the tragedy into such a farce.

The 270-day deadline for resolving Essar's insolvency is set to expire at the end of the month. The tribunal judges on Thursday added another month to the process to compensate for time lost in litigation. 

That's of little consolation to creditors. India's banks have waited for more than a decade for a modern bankruptcy code. Now that it's finally there, an overdose of morality is crippling it.

Essar looks like it's headed for a lengthy day in the courts; in smaller bankruptcies, where there isn't much value left, the lenders aren't even bothering to accept offers lest government agencies accuse them of corruption later. Those businesses, like ABG Shipyard Ltd., may be heading for liquidation. An unnecessary culling in a country that doesn't have enough jobs for its young workforce, and all in the name of purity.

21,2018-04-22,JSW,"The heat in Ballari is merciless. The rays of the sun reflect off the massive outcrop surrounding the city, making it that much more unbearable. But this is the only heat palpable in the former mining hub in northwest Karnataka. With less than a month to voting day, there is no sign of an “election fever”. If it were not for the billboards by the Election Commission urging citizens to fulfil their democratic duty on May 12, one would not guess that a major election is around the corner.

But don’t let the absence of flex boards and buntings fool you. This is the year the Reddy brothers, who were at the centre of a Rs 16,000 crore illegal iron mining and export scam that shook the state in 2011, are attempting a comeback. And their base, Ballari, is a critical part of the mining barons’ carefully crafted plans to return to the centre stage of Karnataka’s political landscape, after seven years of being left out in the cold.

Despite Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah publicly stating earlier this month that the party would have nothing to do with Gali Janardhan Reddy, his elder brother, Somashekhar Reddy, is the party’s candidate for Ballari City. On Friday, the eldest brother, Karunakar Reddy, was given the ticket from Harapanahalli, also in Ballari district.

A Supreme Court stricture on Janardhan, the principal accused in numerous cases of illegal mining, prevents him from being physically present in his home district. But he is still the one pulling the strings, from his camp office 45 km away.

“He is planning everything, how to canvass, how to attract people,” says Somashekhar, just before leaving his palatial residence to complete the nomination formalities. He says that by setting up a base in Molakalmuru in adjoining Chitradurga district, where close aide B Sriramulu is contesting from, his brother would be able to help the adjoining constituencies of Ballari City, Ballari (Rural), Sandur, Kudligi and, of course, Molakalmuru itself.

The candidate selection in the region, too, bears the Reddy stamp. Suresh Babu, the incumbent from Kampli, is Sriramulu’s nephew. The new candidate for Ballari (Rural), Sanna Pakirappa, is Sriramulu’s cousin. The candidates for Hadagli, Hagari Bommanahalli and Sirguppa, all in Ballari, have been reportedly picked by the Reddy camp.

Somashekhar dismisses any differences with the BJP and declines to comment on Shah’s statement distancing the party from his elder brother. “Our party is a national party, and all concerns have to be balanced. Even before my name was announced, I was seeking votes for the BJP,” he says. Somashekhar, accused of bribing a judge presiding over his brother’s bail hearing, exudes confidence about the upcoming political battle against his old foe, incumbent Congress MLA Anil Lad. “There is as much difference between us as between Samsung and Apple,” he quips, while his followers around him break into appreciative chuckles. “Voters have to choose between a hard worker and a lazy man.”

Lad is not unduly perturbed by the charges. On his way to meet 23 corporators as part of campaign efforts, the Congress candidate says Somashekhar needs to explain why he did not contest the 2013 assembly election if he was such a hard worker. “If he is a hardworking candidate, why did he miss that election? Shah has said the party does not want Janardhan Reddy, then why is the party giving a ticket to a member of the same family?”


Tough Contest
The last time the two squared off was in 2008, when the Reddys were at the pinnacle of their prowess. Somashekhar beat Lad by a narrow margin of 1,022 votes in Ballari City. But the fortunes of the Reddy brothers have undergone a dramatic change since 2011 when Santosh Hegde, then Lokayukta of Karnataka, published a report that said they were running a “Republic of Ballari”, with scant regard to the law. In the 2013 election, Lad reclaimed Ballari City by over 18,000 votes, on the back of current Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s successful padayatra, which culminated in the city.

But this election might not be a cakewalk for Lad and the Congress in Ballari, which gave the party five out of the district’s nine seats in 2013. Lad faces anti-incumbency in a city where unemployment, water and power supply are major issues. Though the Supreme Court’s clampdown on mining in the wake of the Lokayukta report has been partially eased, the city is yet to recover.

A mine owner, requesting anonymity, says only around 10 mines are operational, from over 200 a decade ago. He estimates that some 40,000 labourers would have left the city since the days of the mining boom. B Marappan, a mechanic in Ballari City, who earns around Rs 6,000 a month, says the Congress has not done much to improve the lot of the city’s residents.

“Nobody asks us about our problems,” says the 32-year-old, who voted for Lad in the last election but is now considering other options. “We have hardly seen the MLA around.” Somashekhar Reddy, jumping on to a scooter with alacrity and chatting with various residents of Shilpi Nagar, does not impress Papamma, a daily wager. “I’ve been living here for 15 years. No party has done anything for us — we have no proper roads or electricity, and our girls cannot go and relieve themselves safely,” she says.

Mehboob Pasha, district secretary of the Tippers Association, says things are now better than it was in the immediate aftermath of the mining ban. But he has other worries. “I have heard that JSW Steel is planning a 40 km conveyor belt to transport ore from the mines to their plant. If that happens, some 1 lakh people might be out of a job. No politician is willing to support us,” he says. Nor are the employees themselves helping. “They will vote for whoever pays them Rs 1,000, instead of thinking about their long-term interests,” he says, cynically. Allegations of bribing voters are rife in both camps, citing past incidents, but no cases have been registered.

The JD (S) candidate, Hothur Mohammed Iqbal, may also cut into Congress votes, something Somashekhar Reddy is confident of. Iqbal, also from an iron ore mining and export family, had tried for a Congress ticket in 2013. The Bangalore University rank-holder says he is in the fray to win. “Winning is the only factor. I’m not standing for elections solely to defeat anyone,” says Iqbal.


Serial Party Hopping
Muddying the waters further for the citizens of Ballari district is the number of candidates who have switched sides this election.

Anand Singh, a two-time BJP MLA from Vijayanagara in Ballari district, once handpicked by Janardhan Reddy, will be contesting on a Congress ticket this time. Taking him on will be former Congress MLA HR Gaviyappa, who had unsuccessfully contested against him in the previous two elections, on a BJP ticket. Another Reddy associate, B Nagendra, who had won the Kudligi seat twice, will be the Congress candidate from Ballari Rural. The sitting MLA from Ballari Rural, NY Gopalakrishna, joined the BJP on Thursday.

A common factor among the candidates is that, like the Reddy brothers, they too have been accused of being involved in illegal mining and export of iron ore by the Lokayukta. This list includes Lad, who has been arrested by the CBI for supplying illegally mined iron ore, Nagendra and Kampli MLA Suresh Babu, Sriramulu’s nephew. Babu was arrested earlier on charges of bribing a judge to grant bail to Janardhan.

Former Lokayukta Hegde says: “None of the political parties has any moral values when they choose people to contest. It’s a sad state of affairs that they do this and that people accept it.” On Somashekhar’s candidature, Hegde says he was surprised that the BJP gave him a ticket. “He might have been acquitted in court and the government might not have gone in appeal. That only shows the collusion between the present government and the previous chief minister.”

Perturbed by this state of affairs, Tapal Ganesh, a mine owner who had taken on the Reddy brothers, has thrown his hat into the ring. “This year, all the parties have put up corrupt candidates. Siddaramaiah ended his padayatra in Ballari but he hasn’t spoken about the issue after that. And Sriramulu is a proxy for Janardhan Reddy,” says Ganesh, contesting on a JD(U) ticket. 

Despite the turn of events, Ganesh says he still has the satisfaction that his efforts against illegal mining bore fruit. “Janardhan Reddy had announced he wouldn’t stop his mines even for an hour. But now all his mines are closed. And he spent nearly three years in jail.”

The results on May 15 will reveal if the Reddy brothers are once again back in the reckoning. But for the voters of Ballari, it might be a case of the more things change, the more they stay the same.


Edited excerpts from an interview with incumbent Congress MLA Anil Lad

Somashekhar Reddy says voters have an easy choice because he is a hard-working person and you are not. Your response?
I request him to first explain why he did not contest the 2013 elections. If he is a hard-working candidate, why did he miss that election? Why did he form the BSR Congress party? BJP President Amit Shah has said the party does not want Janardhan Reddy. Then why is the party giving a ticket to the same family?


Will the JD(S) candidate cut into the Congress vote bank?
I don’t think so. Last time, too, JD(S) had a candidate from the minority community. He got hardly 16,000 votes. When former CM Kumaraswamy came to Ballari recently, hardly 1,200 people were at the meeting.


What about the CBI cases against you?
The allegation is that someone gave me Rs 2 crore in cash (for iron ore) but that was not taken by me. The trial is going on, we got a bail order. Also, I am just the 18th accused in the case, not the first or second.


What are your priorities for Ballari, if you win the election?
We have two-three major projects planned. There are 25,000 people who don’t have houses in Ballari. Out of that, we have given plots to 10,000 already. The government wanted to build three-storey houses. But people don’t want that. So we have raised the issue with the cabinet to get it rectified. We plan to recycle the 55 million litres per day of water the town uses, so that industry can use it. In two years, a project to ensure 24x7 water supply will be complete.

dited excerpts from an interview with G Somashekhar Reddy, BJP’s candidate from Ballari City

The BJP was trying to keep you at a distance. Why, then, are you contesting on a BJP ticket?There are no such problems. Our party is a national party, so there will be multiple lists. Some names were on the first list, mine was on the second list. Even before my name was announced, I was seeking votes for the BJP.


How will this election against Anil Lad be different?
There is as much difference (between us) as between Samsung and Apple. It is easy for the voter to decide, they just have to choose between a hard-working man and a lazy man. I decided not to contest the last election because of my brother’s ( Janardhan’s) cases.


What about all the cases against you and your brother?
The trial is going on, there is no question of my having given a bribe. It is a false case, 100%.


What about allegations of illegal mining and export?
We were paying income tax and excise duty on everything. As our advocate Ram Jethmalani argued in court, how can what we did be illegal when we paid taxes for everything? We are the only BJP mine owners. All the others are from Congress.


Is your brother Janardhan Reddy still trying for a ticket?
No, he will never try for a ticket. He is just supporting us. He is planning everything, how to canvass, how to attract people.... He is not allowed to enter the district according to court orders, so he is staying 45 km away from Bellary.


Rise, Fall & Rise of Reddy Brothers
The sons of a police constable, Karunakar, Somashekhar and Janardhan Reddy, became synonymous with the illegal mining scandal of Ballari. Their growth and that of their company, Obulapuram Mining Company, was initially fuelled by China’s skyrocketing appetite for iron ore. Aided by the immense wealth they accumulated, they soon turned to shoring up political capital, along with their trusted aide B Sriramulu.

The turning point came in 1999, when the Reddys threw their might behind Sushma Swaraj, who took on Sonia Gandhi in a highprofile election in Ballari. Swaraj lost but the Reddys got more than a foot in the door. In the Yeddyurappa government of 2008, Janardhan was minister for tourism, Karunakar got revenue and Sriramulu, health. Somashekhar, who had won from Ballari City, was made chairman of the Karnataka Milk Federation. Soon, the illegal empire they and other mine owners in the region ran was exposed by Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde and his team.

 The Reddys and Yeddyurappa were forced to resign. Janardhan was an accused in over 60 cases and spent three years in jail. Political pariahs for years, they are back in the game. BJP has given a ticket to Somashekhar to contest from his old seat, Ballari City. Karunakara will contest from Harapanahalli, also in Ballari district. Janardhan is banned by the Supreme Court from entering Ballari district, but he is the strategist. The restoration of the Reddy brothers to Karnataka’s political landscape has begun in right earnest."
22,2018-04-23,JSW,"KOLKATA: Numetal said it would go with the original Essar Steel bid consortium that had Rewant Ruia’s Aurora Enterprises as a stakeholder, while rival ArcelorMittal said it is “evaluating” the order that observed it must repay pending dues in defaulting firms where it had been a promoter to be eligible to bid for stressed assets.

The judge at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also said that a future option could include initiating a new bid process, keeping a window of opportunity open for the likes of JSW Steel and Vedanta that had made their interests known in the second round of bidding.

Thursday’s NCLT order, a copy of which was reviewed by ET, directed the Essar Steel resolution professional (RP) and its Committee of Creditors (CoC) to “revisit/reconsider their decision”—which had earlier declared both bids ineligible – “in light of provisions of section 29(A) read with section 30 (4).”

“Numetal will stick to its original bid and wait for the CoC decision on its eligibility,” a legal source close to Numetal said on Sunday. “In case the CoC has any issue, it can be addressed through Numetal’s proposal to alter the composition of the consortium that was given while submitting the original bid,” the source added.

Numetal, led by Russia’s VTB Bank, had contested that Rewant Ruia is not connected to the default as per the Indian market regulator’s takeover code. Numetal argued that “Rewant Ruia should have been provided an opportunity to rebut such a presumption which was admittedly not provided. The RP has not provided any facts that would establish that Rewant Ruia is acting in concert with his father.” Rewant’s father Ravi Ruia is a co-promoter of Essar Steel, which is facing bankruptcy proceedings.

Interestingly, following the court order, JSW Steel, which had entered the race for Essar by joining the Numetal consortium replacing Aurora in the second round of bidding, said calling a fresh round of bids would be the fair for all parties involved.

Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel, told ET on Sunday: “The Judge’s observation that a fresh round of bids as suggested by RP to the CoC on March 21, with new expressions of interest and a new RFP within a limited time frame…. reiterates our view on this matter. This would also allow lenders to get a better value.”

ArcelorMittal, the other key player in the race for Essar Steel, said that it is “evaluating” the order. A spokesperson said: “We are currently reviewing the order and will comment further in due course as appropriate.”

Legal experts were of the view that the order may have implications for ArcelorMittal as it said: “In order to be eligible, overdue amounts in both the cases of KKS Petron and Uttam Galva Steels should be paid by ArcelorMittal before being eligible to bid as provided in Section 29 (A) itself.” It also observed: “Mere sale of shares and declassification as promoter after companies have gone into default cannot absolve them of responsibility.”

The judge also observed that “the CoC did not follow prescribed procedure to afford reasonable opportunity by making payment of overdue amount in order to remove such disability of the resolution applicant as prescribed under clause (3) of Section 29(A) of IBC and/or make good the disability.”

Industry experts were divided on whether Arcelor’s ‘disability’ was based on the status of its declassification as promoter of Uttam Galva on the date of submission of the Essar bid. In that case, the operative part of the court order would not be about repayment of dues of KSS Petron and Uttam Galva but that the CoC did not give ArcelorMittal an opportunity to “make good its disability.”

A two-member NCLT bench, headed by President Justice M M Kumar, said that Liberty House bid cannot be disqualified only on the ground of being submitted after the deadline of the resolution professional (RP). 

""We hope that CoC takes an appropriate commercial decision as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),"" said NCLT. 

The tribunal's order came over a petition filed by Liberty House, challenging the rejection of its bid by the RP for Bhushan Power and Steel on account of late submission. 

Liberty House had moved the NCLT on February 26 against the rejection. 

The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House's bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm. 

Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel without even opening the seal of its offer.

26,2018-04-23,JSW,"Market displayed signs of classic consolidation, as it failed to sustain at the high point of the day. On expected lines, the higher levels saw some profit taking, as the Nifty pared nearly 50 points from the high point of the day. It ended with a modest gain of 20.65 points or 0.20 per cent.

 If we discount the outperformance of Nifty IT Index, which also came off significantly from the high point of the day, Nifty would have ended with losses.

 As we enter Tuesday’s trade, we expect this consolidation to continue to persist. Though downsides, if any, may be limited, the zones of 10,610-10,640 will continue to pose good resistance to any upmove in the immediate short term.

 Tuesday will see the levels of 10,610 and 10,650 acting as immediate resistance area. On the downsides, the Nifty may find support near 10,540 and 10,510 levels.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 63.8164, and it has marked a fresh 14-period high once again, but remains neutral to the prices showing no divergences.

 Daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. A spinning top, indicative of indecisiveness of the market participants occurred on candles. Apart from this, no major formations were observed.

 Pattern analysis shows that despite evident display of buoyant undercurrent, Nifty has not been able to move past the important pattern resistance area of 10,610-10,640 zones. This is the upper area of the broad trading range Nifty had developed over past couple of months.

 Fresh shorts were also seen being created as the Nifty’s future shed nearly its entire premium. We expect such consolidation to continue to exist in the immediate short term.

 We also expect volatility to persist owing to expiry of the current derivative series. There are high probabilities that market continues to witness profit taking bouts from higher levels. We reiterate to avoid creating any major shorts. It is further advised to continue to utilise volatility and downsides to make select purchases with any downsides or profit taking bouts that the market may offer. While keeping overall positions moderate, cautious view is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh shorts were seen being added in IDFC Bank, JSW Steel, South Indian Bank, DHFL, ITC, Wipro, ICICI Bank, SAIL, DISH TV, ONGC, HDFC, Tata Global and NCC.

27,2018-04-24,JSW,"JSW Steel has sought a fresh round of bidding from the debtladen steel major Essar Steel’s Committee of Creditors (CoC).

JSW’s move comes a day ahead of a crucial CoC meet scheduled on Tuesday. It is significant as it indicates that the Sajjan Jindal company that joined the Russian VTB Bankled Numetal consortium in the second round, is keen to enter the fray for Essar on its own.

In a letter sent to Essar Steel lenders, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank on Sunday evening, JSW Steel said its main contention for seeking new round of bidding rests on maximising value and widening the fray, people with knowledge of the matter said.

What seems to have bolstered JSW is the observation by the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) Ahmedabad judge that a fresh round of bids as suggested by Essar Steel RP to the CoC in a meeting on March 21, with new expressions of interest and a new RFP within a limited time frame would be sound reasonable and legally transparent in light of amendments to Section 29.

Three weeks ago, JSW Steel had approached the RP for Essar Steel before the second round of bids evincing interest to bid. However, the RP did not allow it to bid since the second round of bidding was restricted to those applicants who had submitted expressions of interest in the first round.

“The NCLT judge’s observation reiterates our view on this matter.

Calling a fresh round of bids would also allow lenders to get a better value,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel told ET.

The 270-day period for resolution under IBC rules was due to end on April 29 for Essar Steels. However, it has been stretched by almost a month as the NCLT judge allowed it to be extended by as many days as the matter had been in court between March 20 and April 19, 2018.

The NCLT directed the resolution professional (RP) to place before the CoC the first round of bids from Numetal and ArcelorMittal.

However, it is up to the CoC to give Numetal and ArcelorMittal 30 days to rectify their bids or invite a fresh round of bids.

The CoC is also likely to deliberate on whether ArcelorMittal will be eligible after it got declassified as a promoter in Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.

The NCLT observed that ArcelorMittal will have to pay overdue amounts to lenders on account of Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron to become eligible.

“Mere sale of shares and declassification as promoter after the companies have gone into default cannot absolve them of responsibility,” the NCLT observed."

Brokerage firms Kotak Securities and Sharekhan believe that the telecom major may report losses in Q4 FY18 for the first time in many years. Sharekhan had predicted a net loss of Rs 72 crore during the quarter under review. On the other hand, Kotak Securities projected Airtel to report a consolidated net loss of Rs 380 crore.

Hindalco, Nalco, Vedanta: Aluminium fell more than 8 per cent on Monday on news that the United States has extended the deadline for companies to wind down business with sanctions-hit Russian producer Rusal. Americans engaged with Rusal now have until Oct. 23 to close out their business with the aluminum giant, the US Treasury Department said on Monday in a statement extending the time period. Share prices of Hindalco, Nalco and Vedanta may react to the development. 


Srei Infrastructure: Srei Infrastructure, the highest bidder with an offer of Rs 215 crore for bankrupt Adhunik Alloy, has been disqualified from the bidding process after it was found that the company had a stake in Deccan Chronicle Holdings a firm that defaulted on nearly Rs 4,000 crore. However, the company spokesperson denied it had any stake in the latter. “We have no equity shareholding in Deccan Chronicle,” said a Srei spokesperson.


JSW Steel: JSW Steel has sought a fresh round of bidding from the debtladen steel major Essar Steel’s Committee of Creditors (CoC).

The joint offer by Hero Enterprise Investment Office and the Burman Family Office is among the only two offers being reviewed by an external committee set up last week to help the Fortis board finalise a deal.


Bharti Infratel: Mobile tower firm Bharti Infratel on Monday posted a 2 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 606 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2018, impacted by some telecom operators closing or merging their businesses. The company's net profit for the January-March period of the previous 2016-17 fiscal stood at Rs 597 crore. The revenue of the company for the fourth quarter of 2017-18 was Rs 3,662 crore, 4 per cent higher over the year-ago period.


Reliance Infra: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) on Monday reported a 291 per cent rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March at Rs 160.14 crore on the back of higher revenues. The company had reported a net profit of Rs 40.92 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.


Reliance Naval: Reliance Naval and Engineering Q4 loss widened to Rs 409 crore in March quarter. The company had posted a loss of Rs 139.92 crore in the year-ago period. Standalone total income in January-March 2017-18 dropped sharply to Rs 34.7 crore from Rs 250.8 crore.


Orchid Pharma: Lenders to bankrupt Orchid Pharma have called for a second round of bidding for the drug maker after they found the offer from the only eligible bidder in the first round — Union Quimico Farmacéutica — to be too low, two senior officials said. The resolution professional who is in charge of the management of the Chennai-based company has set April 25 as the fresh date for submitting binding bids for the firm, said the officials who requested not to be named.


RBL Bank: HDFC Securities has initiated coverage on RBL Bank with a ‘buy’ rating and target price of Rs 573. Strategic clarity, tight execution and superlative growth off a low base make RBL Bank attractive for long term investors.


Ashok Leyland: CLSA has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Ashok Leyland and revised target price to Rs 185 from Rs 145. The brokerage has raised FY19-FY20 EPS estimates by 9-10 per cent on higher volumes and sees a strong 23 per cent EPS CAGR over the next years.


HDFC Bank: Edelweiss has maintained ‘buy’ rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,454. HDFC Bank’s core operating profit growth was softer in Q4 due to sharp moderation in loan growth. Best-in-class liability franchise, expansion of rural/semi-urban branches and improvement in productivity owing to digital focus will ensure the bank delivers above industry earnings growth of 25 per cent CAGR over FY18-FY20, and sustains superior return ratios.

Surging US yields and hardening oil prices are instilling a sense of fear among traders. Nifty charts show a fight between the bulls and the bears is on the cards to gain an upper hand. 

That’s where we start the day on Dalal Street, ladies and gentlemen. This is Prachi Sharma, your market jockey, bringing you all the news, views and cues to get you ready for the day ahead.

Singapore Nifty futures traded in the red early this morning, making things hard for Dalal Street. 

Asian stocks traded in the green even as a deluge of US government debt this week and the spectre of inflation and a higher fiscal deficit drove US borrowing costs near four-year highs. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.7 per cent, thanks to fall in the yen. In Australia, the ASX200 climbed 0.39 per cent.

Wall Street struggled for direction in overnight trade, ending the session largely unchanged, as rising bond yields offset earnings optimism. The Dow fell 14 points to 24,449, the S&P 500 edged up while the Nasdaq slipped 0.25 per cent. 

Extending its losing run for the sixth session, the rupee on Monday plummeted by a staggering 36 paise to hit a fresh 13-month low of 66.48 against the dollar. Rising crude oil prices and sustained foreign fund outflows led to subdued forex market sentiment. This was the lowest closing for the home currency since March 10, 2017.

Global oil prices hit their highest since late 2014 on Tuesday, pushed up by expectations of renewed US sanctions against Iran and as OPEC continues withholding supplies amid strong demand. Brent crude futures climbed as high as $75.20, levels not seen since November, 2014. US WTI crude futures were at $68.84 a barrel, up 0.3 per cent. 

In quarterly earnings, Bharti AIrtel, IDFC Bank, ICICI Prudential Life, Oberoi Realty, Persistent, Raymond, TRF, DCM Shriram and GIC Housing Finance will report their numbers during the day. 

Tata Consultancy Services will be in news as the IT firm on Monday became only the second Indian firm after RIL to cross the $100 billion mark in market capitalisation.

33,2018-04-25,JSW,"MUMBAI|KOLKATA: A decision on the resolution of Essar Steel’s bankruptcy remained elusive though the committee of creditors on Tuesday appeared to move towards a third round of bids and grant more time for Numetal and ArcelorMittal to gain eligibility. 

Two people familiar with discussions at the creditors meet on Tuesday said lenders believe it is difficult to ignore the resolution professi 
 onal’s view that Arcelor and Numetal are ineligible to bid for Essar. The lenders found ArcelorMittal’s bid superior though they were not in a position to take a call on it, the two officials who did not want to be identified said. 

Numetal is likely to appeal against a fresh round of bids with the appellate authority if the lenders decide to pursue that course of action. But Numetal’s legal counsel said he would not comment since there is no official communication from the CoC. In an email response to ET, Numetel declined to comment. Arcelor-Mittal too declined comment. 

Lenders are racing against time to complete the transaction within the extended time limit court has granted. Other buyers are also seeking fresh bids. 

JSW Steel sent a letter to the Essar Steel’s committee of creditors on Monday, seeking a new round. Lenders had to resume the process of deliberations regarding Essar Steel after the National Company Law Tribunal threw the ball back in the lenders’ court directing them to consider the first bid by the two instead of going for the second one. 

Arcelor and VTB consortium where Rewant Ruia, a member of the Ruia family is a stake owner, have been in dispute over each other’s eligibility after the government amended the bankruptcy law prohibiting defaulters from bidding for assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court said last week that ArcelorMittal must clear dues of two defaulting companies - Uttam Galva and KSS Petron- to be eligible for bidding while observing that it ‘has not found any illegality in decision of the resolution professional’ in declaring both the applicants - Numetal and ArcelorMittal - ineligible. 

Both bidders moved the bankruptcy court objecting to the decision by resolution professional, Satish Gupta who declared them ineligible under Section 29A which bars defaulters from submitting resolution plan. The court also said the 270-day deadline to resolve the deadlock was extended by a month to May 28 as the dispute delayed the matter. 

While the fight between the two bidders has delayed a decision on Essar Steel resolution, this could establish a procedure for future cases where defaulter promoters would be engaged in bidding for their own assets. 


RP NOT ARBITRARY 
The NCLT observed that “it cannot be said that there is patently illegality in the conclusion of the resolution professional (in declaring both bids ineligible) or that it acted arbitrarily in rejecting the resolution plan by relying on the legal opinion received and believed to be true by him and which were placed before CoC.”"

31,2018-04-25,JSW,"MUMBAI | KOLKATA: Tata Steel, which was so far leading the race in acquiring Bhushan Power & Steel, is contemplating challenging an order passed by the bankruptcy court that directs the resolution professional to consider Liberty’s application, despite it being filed after the deadline. 

Two senior officials, who did not want to be named, said Tata Steel will approach National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on the grounds that it would amount to penalising those who are law observers and reward violators. 

Liberty House had submitted a resolution plan for Bhushan Power & Steel on February 20, although the last day of submitting bids was February 8. When the resolution professional declined to open the bid on grounds that it was submitted after the deadline, Liberty approached the bankruptcy court to question the RP’s decision. 

While Tata Steel is likely to be disappointed with the court’s directive, it has not spoken out against it. When contacted, a Tata Steel spokesperson said he was aware of the matter. Asked whether Tata Steel is planning to appeal against the NCLT order, the official said the company may take a couple of days to firm up its response. 

For Tata Steel, it could be a frustrating experience since the company had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Power with a Rs 24,500-crore offer, outbidding JSW Steel which put in a Rs 13,000- crore bid. Officials agreed the Tata Steel-BPSL scenario is turning out to be somewhat similar to the Binani Cement case, where UltraTech Cement came into the fray after Dalmia Bharat emerged as the highest bidder. 

Incidentally, Tata Steel has already accepted the Letter of Intent (LoI) for Bhushan Steel and, together with BPSL, it was hoping to add almost 8 million tonne capacity that would take it to the top league of the domestic steelmakers, including Steel Authority of India and JSW Steel. 

At the bankruptcy court, the Tata’s had appealed that the applicant (Liberty House) is nothing but a spoiler and a proxy for the debtor whose only objective is to delay and scuttle the resolution process. In their argument, the lenders had alleged that Liberty has deliberately delayed their applications. The resolution professional argued that Liberty’s application is a complete abuse of the process. 

Senior Counsel for RP, Arun Kathpalia also pointed out that Liberty House failed to submit documents required for qualification and there was noncompliance of Section 29 A, and it failed to provide Rs 10 lakh deposit as per the mandate. The Tatas had also stated that allowing Liberty would set a bad precedent in IBC and entertaining such application would penalise the law-abiding participants and reward violators. 

The counsel for creditors argued that allowing the present application would open floodgates for other applications. Liberty had appealed on the ground that the RP had accepted two applications — ArcelorMittal’s and their application — for expression of interest much after the deadline of October 6, which means that deadline was neither sacrosanct nor considered binding. Bhushan Power is among the 12 companies wherein the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed the bank to refer to the bankruptcy court. It faces .`49,264 crore claims from financial creditors. Lenders had received binding offer from JSW Steel and Tata Steel before the deadline on February 8."
30,2018-04-25,JSW,"It is almost a year since RBI referred 12 top borrowers to the NCLT under the new bankruptcy code. Following is a status update on eight of those borrowers, which are inching towards a resolution.


Essar Steel
Total Debt: Rs 49,000 crore Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017
Where it stands now: NCLT ordered committee of creditors (CoC) to consider bids by Numetal and Mittal before allowing others to bid. What is the issue: If creditors decline bids by Numetal and Mittal, mining giant Vedanta could be in the fray.


Amtek Auto
Total Debt: Rs 12,722 crore Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017
Where it stands now: UK-based Liberty House had declared itself the winner, but there are doubts on its eligibility after it came to light that one of its subsidiaries had dues pending before Exim Bank. What is the issue: Liberty House has now paid the dues. So it remains to be seen whether NCLT allows its bid to go through.


Bhushan Steel
Total Debt: Rs 44,000 crore Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017 
Where it stands now: Tata Steel emerges as top bidder after a fierce bidding war, outsmarting JSW Steel. However, the deal not sealed yet. What is the issue: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has moved NCLT seeking ‘higher priority’ in repayment of dues owed by Bhushan Steel. Bhushan Steel owes Rs 900 crore to L&T for supplies of certain capital goods.


Alok Industries
Total Debt: Rs 29,000 crore Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017 
Where it stands now: Employees have moved NCLT to prevent the company from liquidation as 12,000 employees will lose their jobs. What is the issue: Lenders did not find the sole joint bid of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company attractive enough.


Electrosteel 
Total Debt: Rs 13,000 crore Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017 
Where it stands now: Vedanta declared winner by NCLT earlier this week, but failed bidder Renaissance Steel has challenged it. What is the issue: Renaissance is challenging Vedanta’s win under Section 29A (d) of the IBC, a clause that prohibits bidding by entities or their subsidiaries that have been convicted for an offence punishable for more than two years.


Bhushan Power & Steel

Total Debt: Rs 49,200 crore Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017 

Where it stands now: NCLT has directed banks to consider Liberty House’s bid that was initially disallowed because it came in after the deadline. What is the issue: Liberty House bid will now be considered which it claims is higher than that offered by Tata Steel, the current highest bidder shortlisted by lenders.


Monnet Ispat 
Total Debt: Rs 10,237 crore Date of referral to NCLT: June 2017 

Where it stands now: The Aion-JSW Steel consortium’s bid has been approved by CoC, and awaits NCLT approval. What is the issue: ArcelorMittal has alleged that the company is not eligible to bid under section 29(A) as promoter Sandeep Jajodia’s wife Seema Jajodia is JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal’s sister. She has, however, transferred her shareholding in the company before bidding began.


ABG Shipyard

Total Debt: Rs 18,245 crore Date of referral to NCLT: July 2017 Where it stands now: Liberty House has emerged as sole bidder in the fourth consecutive round of bidding called by lenders to the ship-builder, the promoters of which face a wilful defaulter tag. What is the issue: Liberty has paid off its dues to Exim Bank to be eligible for bidding. But lenders are not too happy with offer."
37,2018-04-26,JSW,"MUMBAI: Ahead of the lenders' meeting tomorrow which may ask for fresh bids for the bankrupt Essar Steel's assets, Numetal today approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).Numetal's application at NCLAT is aimed at pre-empting a possible move by the lenders to call for fresh bids as the two bids submitted peg the value of the assets only under 40 per cent of the Rs 45,000 crore that Essar Steel owes to over 30 lenders.The company is majority owned by the Russian state-run lender VTB Bank's private equity arm VTB Capital and Ravi Ruia's son Rewant Ruia-controlled Aurora Trustss, which controls 25 per cent.""We have moved an application at the NCLAT, which will be heard tomorrow,"" a Numetal India official said.The official refused to share details saying the matter is subjudice.The Section 29A (c) of the revised Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) allows a defaulted promoter, if wants to bid for the asset through the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to do so provided he clears the arrears and make the account standardised.Following last Thursday's direction by the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT which had asked the lenders to reconsider the first bids submitted by Numetal and ArcelorMittal on February 12 and reject the second round of bids submitted by them on April 2 along with Vedanta, the bankers had met here on Tuesday but could not take a call as the bids submitted by them were reportedly valued very low.It had also asked the resolution professional (RP) and the lenders to give 30-days time to these bidders to clear their defaulted accounts.According to media reports, ArcelorMittal had quoted higher than Numetal, which still is below the fair value as it quotes only 40 per cent of Rs 45,000 crore due to them from Essar Steel, which runs a 10-million tonne steel plant at Hazira on the west coast of Gujarat.Bankers or the committee of creditors are expected to meet again tomorrow here to decide the next course of action. The bankers are debating whether they should call for a fresh round of bids, which has already evoked interest from JSW Steel in association with Numetal and Vedanta Resources.The first round of bids were rejected by the RP and the lenders, citing technical reasons or ownership issues (promoters of these bidders being related to the original defaulting promoters) leading to the re-bids, which had three bidders - Numetal-JSW, ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel and Vedanta.Numetal was set up only last October by the Ruias - four months after the Essar Steel was sent to the NCLT in Mauritius. Originally, it was floated by various entities led by Aurora Trusts controlled by Rewant Ruia, who is a defaulter in Essar Steel.Later, Rewant sold 75 per cent in the company to the private equity arm of the largest Russian lender VTB Bank (which took over the group's flagship refinery Essar Oil in Vadinar for USD 13 billion last year) and a Russian engineering firm TPE and some other investors.The company claims that Rewant does not enjoy any managerial position but is only an investor. But Aurora Trusts is in turn fully held by Aurora Enterprises, in which the ultimate beneficiary is only Rewant according to the company documents.Numetal had gone public saying that if eligibility was an issue because of Aurora Trusts, they were ready to buy out the Rewant but nothing to that effect has been done yet.What did in the bid by ArcelorMittal, which is the world's largest alloy maker, is that it had a joint venture with Uttam Galva Steel, which is also in the NCLT following a default of around Rs 6,000 crore loan.Following the rejection of their bid by RP on March 21, the Mittals sold their stakes in the Uttam Galva and KSS Petron in slump sales and then joined hands with the Japanese alloy major Nippon to re-bid.But what worked in their favour last Thursday at the NCLT was that the Clause C of the Section 29A of the IBC demands that the RP has to give up to 30 days additional time to the bidders/promoters to make the overdue amount and clear the account as standard.The 270-day period for resolution under the IBC is due to end on April 29. However, this has been extended by a month as the NCLT decided to exclude the period between March 20 and April 19 when the matter had been in court from the resolution period."

35,2018-04-26,JSW,"MUMBAI: The committee of creditors (CoC) for Essar Steel may appeal against the order of the bankruptcy court questioning the lenders’ decision to call a second round of bids and directing them to give existing applicants 30-days to correct the problems in their bids.

Two senior officials, who did not want to be named, said this issue was discussed at a close-door marathon meeting of lenders on Tuesday. But no decision was taken. The move, if it happens, will be prompted by the fact that the lenders are not satisfied with financial bids received from ArcelorMittal and Numetal, the two bidders, two senior officials said. 

The resolution professional rejected on grounds that they were not compliant with Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code that bars defaulters form bidding. Both applicants later moved National Company Law Tribunal challenging the RP’s decision. On Tuesday, the RP had presented, for the first time, the financial bids before the committee of creditors.

Numetal has offered to pay about Rs 19,000 crore while ArcelorMittal has offered `32,000 crore, said two senior officials. “However, if we want better offers we have to expand the scope of bidders by going for a fresh round of bidding and to do this we will have to challenge the order passed by the bankruptcy court,” said one of the person quoted above.

JSW Steel and Vedanta Resources have shown interest in acquiring Essar Steel and this has given hope to lenders that a second round could enhance their gains and lower the haircut. Lenders will meet again on Friday to consider whether to comply with the order or challenge it. The Ahmedabad bench in its written order had said that “committee of creditors’ decision to go for inviting fresh bid may appear prudent but is not legally sound and valid.”

The committee of creditors now have two options — either to follow the court’s order which says that lenders should consider both– Numetal and ArcelorMittal — offers which means they would be forced to negotiate with only these two applicants. Alternatively, they can challenge the order which could give them opportunity for another round.

After the RP had rejected the two bids, the lenders had gone for a second round of bidding wherein RP received three bids which included Numetal in partnership with JSW Steel, ArcelorMittal in partnership with Nippon and Vedanta Resources. However, the court has directed lenders not to open bids of second round until they pass an order."
40,2018-04-27,JSW,"New Delhi: Sanjeev Gupta-led Liberty House Group has sought to trump a bid by Tata Steel to buy bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel, according to people directly briefed on the matter.

The committee of creditors of Bhushan Power and Steel met on Friday to open UK-based Liberty House’s bid for the company at the direction of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The creditors’ panel is yet to fully evaluate the offer’s terms, they said.

Liberty House has offered an upfront payment of Rs 18,500 crore to lenders of Bhushan Power and Steel against an upfront offer of Rs 17,000 crore by Tata Steel, these people said. It has also offered to honour bank guarantees obtained by the steel maker for certain financial commitments as well as a working capital infusion into the company, the quantum of which ETcould not immediately ascertain.

Tata Steel had offered a working capital infusion of Rs 7,500 crore in the company and payouts to employees and operational creditors.

Tata Steel’s offer may still be more attractive if it were to modify certain terms, according to a banker in the know of things, although Liberty’s offer was compelling due to better and more immediate recovery of dues.



A spokesperson for Liberty House said in response to ET's queries, “Yes, our bid was opened today by the CoC and we are looking forward to work with the creditors and resolution professional on the next steps.” Tata Steel didn’t respond to queries. When asked about its interest in Bhushan Power and Steel, Tata Steel had said in January: “As a process, we do assess and evaluate various strategic opportunities for growth. This is an ongoing process in the company.” Mahender Khandelwal, Bhushan Power and Steel’s resolution professional, declined to comment.


LATE ENTRY
Liberty House’s bid had initially been rejected by the committee of creditors led by SBI because it was made after the February 8 deadline for submission of binding offers. Tata Steel had emerged the highest bidder at the time, exceeding an offer by JSW Steel, the only other contender to have submitted a binding offer for the company as ET first reported on February 19.

Liberty House, an outlier, didn’t participate in the process after submitting an initial expression of interest, but later submitted a surprise bid on February 20. After the bid was rejected, the company approached the NCLT in appeal. The tribunal passed an order in its favour on April 23, directing the resolution professional to open the bid.


WHAT NEXT
The committee of creditors will meet again next week to weigh both the offers, though sources did not rule out Tata Steel challenging the decision to allow Liberty House's late bid for the company to be opened in the NCLT. There’s also a possibility of bids being sought afresh, said a person familiar with the matter.

Bhushan Power and Steel is owned by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that owns listed Bhushan Steel, which is also undergoing insolvency proceedings.

The debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel owes a consortium, comprising over two dozen banks, Rs 48,524 crore. Punjab National Bank leads the lenders’ consortium though State Bank of India has disbursed the largest proportion of loans to the company."

41,2018-04-27,JSW,"Lenders of Essar Steel decided on Friday to give first-round bidders ArcelorMittal and the Numetal consortium seven days to revise their bids and comply with eligibility criteria, while Vedanta made a pitch to the banks to consider its offer before negotiating with the other two.

To become eligible, ArcelorMittal will have to repay the dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, two defaulting companies in which it had stakes, while Numetal may need to drop Rewant Ruia’s Aurora Enterprise as a member of the VTB Bank-led consortium and match ArcelorMittal’s price offer.

The committee of creditors decided to give the two bidders more time in keeping with a recent order of the National Company Law Tribunal to ensure that bidders conform to eligibility norms. The committee is also said to have veered around to the view that if both bids are found ineligible, it can approach the NCLT for permission to open a second round of bids. The lenders are expected to ask both bidders to make presentations on their eligibility in a week.

The move by the banks is being “closely watched” by Vedanta, which has emerged as a dark horse in the race for Essar Steel, a person familiar with the development said. Vedanta, which placed a bid in the second round, asked Satish Kumar Gupta of Alvarez Marsal, who is the resolution professional for Essar Steel, to consider its offer.

Earlier this week, JSW Steel had written to the lenders, urging them to call for a fresh round of bids and indicating its interest to make an offer on its own. JSW had bid for Essar Steel in partnership with Numetal in the second round. The lenders have not yet opened the bids received in the second round.

“If Numetal has indeed matched ArcelorMittal’s financial offer, it just shows that their original offer was highly opportunistic,” an official from ArcelorMittal said. “In any case, a bidder can’t just amend its offer after submission if it has discovered it bid too low.”

Alegal source close to Numetal said a change in the consortium has already been effected by dropping Rewant Ruia’s Aurora Enterprise. The source said Numetal was always open towards the need to revise its bid by replacing Ruia’s stake in the consortium to steer clear of the ‘related-party’ tag since Rewant Ruia is the son of Essar co-promoter Ravi Ruia.

Following the change in the consortium, other members VTB Bank, TyazhpromExport and Indo International would pick up the 25% stake held by Aurora. The source also said Numetal would match Arcelor’s offer.

For the time being, speculation on whether the lenders will call a fresh round of bids with new expressions of interest is likely to be put to an end.

Earlier Friday, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal in New Delhi fixed May 17 as the next date of hearing petitions filed by Arcelor and Numetal challenging the eligibility criteria."

0,2018-05-01,JSW,"UK’s Liberty House have turned favourites to acquire bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel after creditors to the company rejected a proposal to initiate rebidding for the steel major. Liberty House, a later bidder for the company, trumped an offer by Tata Steel by Rs. 1500 crores, ET reported on 28 April.

Liberty House’s bid was opened at a meeting of the committee of creditors on Saturday under instructions from the national company law tribunal. It’s offer to make an upfront payment of Rs 18,500 crore to lenders of Bhushan Power trumped an offer by Tata that had committed an upfront payment of Rs. 17,000 crore for the company.

The lenders voted electronically on a proposal initiated by the resolution professional of Bhushan Power to seek their consent for rebidding for the company, to give the Tata’s a chance to revise their offer, as well as JSW, the only other contender that had submitted a binding bid for the company.

The requisite votes to pass the resolution were not received.

Liberty House had also offered to honor bank guarantees obtained by the steel maker for certain financial committments to counterparties as well as a working capital infusion into the comany, the quantum of which ET could not immediately ascertain. 

Tata Steel had offered a working capital infusion of Rs 7,500 crore in the company and pay-outs to employees and operational creditors.

A Tata Steel spokesperson told ET on 18 January in response to queries pertaining to its interest in acquiring Bhushan Power and Steel, ""As a process, we do assess and evaluate various strategic opportunities for growth. This is an ongoing process in the company"". 

A spokesperson for Liberty House said, ""We have been informed today that the bids cannot be revised and the CoC will evaluate the existing offers"".

1,2018-05-02,JSW,"MUMBAI: Lenders to Bhushan Power and Steel have decided against seeking a second round of bids for the bankrupt steel company over concerns that this could lead to offers below the Rs 18,500 crore offered by Liberty House and the process getting mired in litigation, said several officials with knowledge of the matter.

Although Sanjeev Gupta-led Liberty House had submitted its bid days past the deadline for submissions, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had directed lenders to consider the offer. In the vote on Tuesday evening, 45% of the lenders voted against a proposal seeking fresh bids. Under the rules, any proposal needs the backing of at least 75% of lenders by value to be accepted.

Tata Steel and JSW Steel were other two bidders for Bhushan Power and Steel, having submitted offers of Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 11,000 crore, respectively, within the stipulated timeframe. The officials said at least half a dozen lenders that together held a majority share of the loans were against rebidding.

“There are also fears that going for rebidding could lead to another round of litigation, which we want to avoid,” said a senior official.

The lenders will review and evaluate all the three bids and decide on the highest one. As per the terms set by the resolution professional, they will negotiate only with the highest bidder.



“The offer by Tatas even as it is lower in terms of financial bid appears superior to other two bidders,” said a senior official. “Liberty’s payout is higher for lenders while Tata’s payment to operational creditors is more than that proposed by Liberty.”

The lenders had reviewed Liberty’s offer last week.

“Some lenders were of the view that there should be a second round with Liberty’s offer as the floor price,” said one of the officials cited above. “If lenders receive bids below the floor price, the steel company could be awarded to Liberty. However, this was not agreed up by all lenders.”

Bhushan Power is among the 12 companies that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed banks to refer to bankruptcy court in June last year. It faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore from financial creditors.

The committee of creditors of Bhushan Power and Steel met last week to open UK-based Liberty House’s bid at NCLT’s direction.

THE OFFERS Liberty House has offered to honour bank guarantees obtained by the steel maker for certain financial commitments as well as a working capital infusion into the company, ET reported on April 28. Tata Steel had offered a working capital infusion of Rs 7,500 crore and payouts to employees and operational creditors. 

Tata Steel’s offer may still be more attractive if it were to modify certain terms, according to a banker in the know of things, although Liberty’s offer was compelling due to better and more immediate recovery of dues, ET had reported. Liberty House’s bid had initially been rejected by the committee of creditors because it was made after the February 8 deadline for submission of binding offers.

Tata Steel had emerged the highest bidder at the time, exceeding an offer by JSW Steel, the only other contender to have submitted a binding offer for the company as ET first reported on February 19.

Liberty House, an outlier, didn’t participate in the process after submitting an initial expression of interest, but later submitted a surprise bid on February 20. After the bid was rejected, the company approached NCLT in appeal.

The tribunal passed an order in its favour on April 23, directing the resolution professional to open the bid.

Bhushan Power and Steel is owned by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that owns listed Bhushan Steel, which is also undergoing insolvency proceedings."

10,2018-05-07,JSW,"The domestic equity market on Monday made a buoyant start to the week. The market opened on expected lines with modest gains and traded in a range in the first half of the session. We saw further strength coming in in the second half of the day.

The benchmark Index Nifty50 finally ended the day with a decent gain of 97.25 points or 0.92 per cent. The market has resumed its upmove after a brief corrective spell after testing the immediate past high level of 10,784.

As we approach Tuesday’s trade, we see the upbeat sentiment persisting. The market is likely to enjoy a positive start to the day. That said, market still face chances of consolidation at higher levels, and 10,784 will remain important level to watch for.

Market is still expected to face resistance at these levels in the immediate short term. The levels of 10,765 and 10,790 will act as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports will come in at 10,675 and 10,630 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 63.5806 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish, while trading above its signal line.

Pattern analysis reveals that after achieving a breakout from the broad rectangle zone, the Nifty suffered a classical throwback and suffered a minor corrective decline. After a brief consolidation, Nifty has resumed its upmove. Key would be to see if it faces resistance once again at 10,784 levels.
Overall, a modestly positive, but quiet start is expected in the trade on Tuesday. It is advised not to attempt to create shorts at higher levels. We will continue to see stock specific performance. The undercurrent remains very much buoyant. The levels of 10,784 will be important to be watched as the market may face resistance at higher levels.

Even if some resistance is found at higher levels, the market will see more consolidation once again in a given range than outright correction. We continue recommend making stock specific purchases with any decline that the market offers.

While continuing to guard profits at higher levels, neutral to positive outlook is advised for the day.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen being added in Federal Bank, Nalco, Exide Industries, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, Reliance Naval, Power Grid, PFC, Hind Petro, YES Bank and Titan.

Liberty House submitted a bid for Bhushan Power & Steel on February 20, well past the deadline for making binding offers for the company. The bid was initially rejected by the creditors but was eventually opened under directions from the NCLT on April 23.

Tata Steel submitted its offer for the company on February 8, in adherence to the timelines. Its offer at that time exceeded that of JSW Steel, the only other bidder to have submitted a bid for the company, by a significant margin.

Tata Steel’s bid provided for upfront payments of Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders and a working capital infusion of Rs 7,000 crore, ET had reported in February.

Liberty House’s bid, opened by the committee of creditors of Bhushan Power and Steel on April 27, was higher than Tata Steel’s by Rs 1,500 crore — it offered an upfront payments of Rs 18,500 crore to creditors.



The counsel for Tata Steel, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, had made arguments in the NCLT stating that Liberty House had an unfair opportunity as it was privy to details of the bids by Tata and the other bidders at the time it submitted a late bid.

Singhvi declined comment when contacted on Tata Steel’s appeal. A spokesperson for Tata Steel didn’t respond to ET’s queries until press time Tuesday.

Bhushan Power & Steel is promoted by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that owns Bhushan Steel, which is also undergoing insolvency proceedings.

Tata Steel has emerged the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel in a tightly fought contest where it beat a bid by rival JSW Steel by a much smaller margin than it did in the case of Bhushan Power.

It has already wrapped up financing arrangements for its acquisition of Bhushan Steel.

Bhushan Power owes a consortium comprising over two dozen banks Rs 48,524 crore. Punjab National Bank leads the consortium though State Bank of India is the main lender to the company."

NCLAT said the committee of creditors could consider the resolution plans submitted by both Liberty House and Tata Steel. It noted that the final decision could only be implemented with its consent. The resolution plan selected by the committee will have to be submitted in a sealed cover to the NCLAT.

The resolution plans have to be assessed ""qualitatively"", the NCLAT said. This means just bidding for a higher amount is not the only factor that will make a bid better, according to people in the know of the matter. The lenders will have to consider a combination of factors including payouts to operational creditors and employees."

17,2018-05-13,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Neither Karnataka election jitters nor simmering oil prices globally could dampen the spirits of the bulls last week, as the domestic shares posted their biggest weekly gain in five weeks.

Upbeat quarterly earnings and soft US inflation data acted as catalysts to increase investors’ risk appetite on Dalal Street during the week gone by.

On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex gained 290 points to settle at 35,535, while NSE’s 50-share Nifty pack reclaimed the crucial 10,800 level to end at 10,806, up 90 points or 0.84 per cent. On a weekly basis, the indices gained 1.77 per cent each.

The outcome of Karnataka assembly elections will set the market tone. A majority win for the Modi led-Bharatiya Janata Party will increase investors’ confidence and the market could move towards a new high, said Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities.

However, any setback may force the Modi government to turn populist and go slow on bold reform measures, Jain added.


Let's take a look at the key events/developments that could influence investors' sentiment in the coming week: -


Karnataka poll outcome: A lot will depend on the outcome of the assembly elections, as it will set the tone for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Voting for Karnataka elections, which took place on Saturday, saw around 70 per cent turnout. Exit polls suggested a fractured mandate, but were split over whether the Congress or the BJP will emerge the single largest. However, no one seems to be winning.

""The elections are crucial for the incumbent Congress as well as the BJP in the run up to the federal elections in May 2019. Opinion polls suggest a hung state assembly (nearly 95-95-40 seat split between BJP-Congress-JDS (a regional party),"" foreign brokerage CLSA said in a note. If the BJP ends up forming the government, market sentiment would improve but that could be the local peak, it said. The verdict for Karnataka elections will be out on May 15, 2018.


Next batch of Q4 earnings: Corporate earnings will continue to be one of the key market drivers. Hindustan Unilever, Bombay Dyeing and Abbott India are some of the notable names that are slated to release their Q4 earnings on May 14. Lupin, Punjab National Bank, Britannia, Reliance Communications and Syndicate Bank are expected to unveil their numbers on May 15, Tuesday, while Hindalco Industries, ITC, JSW Steel, Muthoot Finance and Tata Steel will announce theirs on Wednesday and JK Tyre and Voltas on May 17. Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, Dalmia Bharat and Den Networks are scheduled to release their results on May 18, Friday.


Macro data: India’s industrial output expanded at its slowest in five months in March, pulled down by slow growth in mining and contraction in the production of key items such as hand tools, gold jewellery, paper and readymade garments. The index of industrial production (IIP) rose 4.4 per cent from a year ago, data issued by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) showed. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February 2018. For the full year 2017-18, industrial production grew 4.3 per cent, compared with 4.6 per cent in 2016-17. The consumer price inflation (CPI) and wholesale price inflation (WPI) prints for April 2018 will be out on Monday, May 14. CPI and WPI stood at 4.28 per cent and 2.47 per cent, respectively, in March 2018.


Tech charts show upside potential: The Nifty50 on Friday breached a strong hurdle at the 10,784 level on a closing basis to reclaim the 10,800 mark. In the process, it formed a bullish candle on daily and weekly charts, suggesting bulls are in the commanding position. Nifty needs to hold above 10,785 zones to extend its move towards 10,888 and 10,950 levels, Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said, adding that supports for the index at 10,725 and 10,680 levels.

""We are of the opinion that 10,610 levels for current month remains crucial support for the indices,"" says Anita Gandhi, Whole Time Director at Arihant Capital Markets. Hence, as long as Nifty holds the mentioned level, there is a high probability that the index may test 10,897, 10,949 and 11,009 levels in a couple of weeks, Gandhi adds.


Cement stocks may hog limelight: According to a Reuters report, the government is planning to propose nationwide ban on petroleum coke to comply with a Supreme Court request as part of a long-running case to clean the country’s air. An oil refinery by-product, petroleum coke, or petcoke, is used as a fuel because of its higher energy content than coal, but it releases larger amounts of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, which can cause lung disease and acid rain. Shares of cement companies which use petcoke as feedstock, and petcoke producers may hog limelight when trading resumes on Monday. Local producers of petcoke include IndianOil, Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp.


Keep an eye on PSBs: Four state-owned lenders – Canara Bank, Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank and Dena Bank – on Friday reported a combined net loss of Rs 11,729 crore ($1.74 billion) for March quarter due to a jump in bad-loan provisions, following a tightening of central bank rules. Indian banks, already burdened by a near-record Rs 9.5 lakh crore of bad loans as of last year, were expected to report a further rise in NPAs in the March quarter after the central bank withdrew half a dozen loan-restructuring schemes and tightened some rules in February. Shares of the banks may react when market opens on Monday.


Crude oil prices: Crude prices fell in a see-saw session on Friday, retreating after early gains as it looked likely that US allies would push to maintain a deal with Iran, which could keep that country’s crude exports on global markets, Reuters reported. However, the prices remained just below multi-year highs, with Brent on track for a weekly 2.8 per cent gain and US crude a 1.2 per cent weekly rise. Tarun Satsangi, Head of Research for Commodities and Forex at Globe Commodities, says oil prices could touch $80 a barrel in medium term on Iran chaos.

Last week, US President Donald Trump decided to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. If oil prices rise to fresh peaks, it will disturb the math of global economy, including India."

India’s new bankruptcy law is being bogged down by bitter court room disputes that include the likes of ArcelorMittal and the Tata Group -- jeopardizing the law’s promise of time-bound resolution in a country famous for its sluggish legal system.

None of the 12 large debtor companies that the central bank forced into bankruptcy court in June have been sold yet. The National Company Law Tribunal or NCLT, in charge of the process, has extended a 270-day deadline enshrined in the law for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. and Essar Steel India Ltd. by excluding the days under litigation. Others may follow as the courts are inundated with appeals from founders, administrators, lenders and bidders.

The successful resolution of about $210 billion in stressed loans is crucial to Prime Minister Narendra Modi efforts to clean-up the balance sheets of state-run banks, which hold nearly 90 percent of impaired assets. The first 12 large cases are being closely watched to gauge whether India can hasten the pace of bad-loan recovery, which the World Bank puts at 4.3 years, ranking the nation at 103 for resolving insolvency.

“Discretionary extensions run the risk of setting a dangerous precedent, driving a hole through the very integrity of the code,” said Ran Chakrabarti, a New Delhi-based finance lawyer and partner at IndusLaw. Should the courts water down the 270-day period, “we’re back to square one, and any hope of a swift liquidation process and an efficient recycling of capital -- the very point of any insolvency law -- will go out of the window.”

In what was seen as an initial success for the law, Electrosteel Steels Ltd. was awarded to billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. The hurrah was short-lived as the process has now been stalled by a court order following an appeal by a rival bidder.

The company tribunal has repeatedly postponed a verdict on a bid for Monnet Ispat & Power Ltd. by JSW Steel Ltd. and Apollo Global Management LLC-backed Aion Capital Partners. Tata Steel Ltd. is waiting on final approval for its purchase of Bhushan Steel Ltd., even as it appeals an order allowing a late bid by Liberty House Group for Bhushan Power. ArcelorMittal and a VTB Capital-backed consortium are in court over Essar Steel.

Beyond the 12, the fight for Binani Cement Ltd. is also emerging as a test case, with a consortium backed by Bain Capital Credit slugging it out with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd. While the former had the winning bid under the bankruptcy process, Birla’s company made a late counteroffer and then signed an agreement with Binani’s founders to buy the asset. The matter has been taken to an appellate tribunal and the nation’s supreme court before being referred back to the lenders’ committee.

“If in nine months you can’t get a resolution done then you’ve failed the law,” said Shardul S. Shroff, executive chairman of law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., which represents one of the Binani suitors. “The battle for victory is not the end game for resolution plan, reviving the company is. Therefore, tribunal should avoid getting caught up by challenges and attempts by losing bidders to somehow or the other get back into the game.”"

25,2018-05-15,JSW,"KOLKATA: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday approved Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL), clearing the deck for the bankrupt mill’s acquisition by India’s oldest maker of the primary infrastructure alloy.

The NCLT also dismissed a plea filed by the employees of Bhushan Steel opposing Tata Steel's bid. It also rejected another petition by engineering and construction major L&T, an operational creditor to Bhushan Steel: L&T had sought priority in repayment of debt in the resolution process.

In a late evening statement Tata Steel said as per the terms of approved Resolution Plan, Bamnipal Steel Limited (`BNPL'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Tata Steel, will initially subscribe to 72.65% equity share capital of BSL at face value i.e. at Rs 2 per share, for an aggregate amount of Rs.158.89 crore. 

""The financial creditors shall receive a total consideration of Rs 35,200 crores for the settlement of the existing financial debt of BSL,"" Tata Steel said. It will be funded through a combination of equity and inter-corporate loans, of which upto Rs 9,000 crore loans have an option of conversion into equity shares of BSL. The Resolution Plan also requires financial creditors to invoke pledge on existing equity shares of BSL.



""As per the approved Resolution Plan, BNPL shall be classified as the 'promoter' of BSL, and the existing promoters shall be de-classified as 'promoters' of BSL for the purposes of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,"" the statement added. The NCLT nod will be a shot in the arm for Tata Steel which has been allegedly facing challenges on the ground in its efforts to assert control over BSL’s main plant at Dhenkanal in Odisha.

On March 23, Tata Steel said it had accepted the letter of intent for Bhushan Steel under the corporate insolvency resolution process of the IBC after the Committee of Creditors (CoC) for BSL accepted its bid. Earlier, it had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a Rs 35,200-crore offer, paving the way for the acquisition of a five million tonne plant in Odisha with a product basket catering to high-value auto and consumer durable makers.

In the race for BSL, Tata Steel had edged past JSW Steel and a private equity backed group of 400-odd Bhushan Steel employees. On March 7, Tata Steel said it had received a formal communication from the resolution professional of Bhushan Steel that it had been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel.

Following NCLT approval the only other nod that is awaited is from the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Bhushan Steel owes nearly Rs 56,000 crore to its lenders.

Acquisition of BSL will be a key element in Tata Steel's domestic growth strategy under new Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran. With Tata Steel tipped to enter into a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp of Germany for its European steel business, the focus is clearly back on growth in India.

Tata Steel’s domestic steel capacity, now at 13 million tonnes, is poised to be augmented by 5.6 million tonnes with the Bhushan Steel acquisition. Bhushan Steel makes flat products like hot- and cold-rolled coil (HR/CR coils) and galvanised sheets.

The resolution process for BSL, which was referred to NCLT in July 2017, has had its share of challenges. At the end of January, BSL promoter and vice chairman Neeraj Singhal had sought to halt the process by writing to lenders and asking them to consider restructuring the company’s debt under the sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) mechanism by dividing the debt into sustainable and unsustainable parts, with no haircut."
29,2018-05-15,JSW,"MUMBAI: Billionaire Lakshmi Mittal’s ArcelorMittal has cut a cheque of Rs 7,000 crore to clear the dues of its associate companies and to make itself eligible by law to bid for bankrupt Essar Steel. Rival bidder Numetal, which has one of the Ruia family members as a stakeholder, is challenging the banks’ direction to pay up, said three people familiar with the action.

“ArcelorMittal has parked the money in connection with the overdues of two defaulting companies — Uttam Galva and KSS Petron — in the escrow account of the London branch of State Bank of India,” said a banker who didn’t want to be identified.

The lenders had given Numetal and ArcelorMittal one week to clear the dues which ended on Tuesday.

A core committee of lenders of Essar Steel met the executives of the companies in Mumbai after ArcelorMittal’s payment was credited to the SBI account.

“Both the bidders were given an opportunity to present their case on compliance under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code since the one-week deadline is over,” said the person quoted above.




Numetal Hearing on May 17
Under Section 29A of IBC , defaulting companies are not eligible to submit resolution plan for companies facing bankruptcy.

Of the Rs 7,000 crore, around Rs 6,000 crore is to regularise loans of Uttam Galva and the balance is for KSS Petron, said those people. The overdues of Numetal is expected to be around Rs 40,000 crore to regularise loan accounts related to Ravi Ruia, founder promoter of Essar Steel.

Banks have made a claim on Numetal on grounds that Rewant Ruia, one of the partners in the VTB-led consortium, is son of Essar promoter Ravi Ruia and is therefore seen as a connected party.

In an email response, officials of ArcelorMittal confirmed the payments. “ArcelorMittal maintains that its offer for Essar Steel, submitted on February 12, is and always has been eligible. Any offer to pay any outstanding loans of companies where we only had a passive stake with no management or governance role, would be made without prejudice to demonstrate the seriousness of our commitment to India and Essar Steel.”

Numetal has objected to the lenders’ claim to regularise the loans linked to Ravi Ruia and have approached National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

Numetal is now arguing for the second bid to be considered by the lenders where it would be at an advantage over its rival ArcelorMittal. The tribunal will hear its case on May 17. It has appealed against the lenders’ decision to demand that Numatel should pay up dues to be eligible for bidding in bankruptcy process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Numetal said that none of its shareholders have any overdue loans with any Indian lender without getting into the specifics of its appeal to consider the second round of bidding.

Satish Gupta, the resolution professional, had declared both the bids received in the first round ineligible, following which a second round of bidding was conducted in early April. Vedanta Resources, Numetal in partnership with JSW Steel, and ArcelorMittal in partnership with Nippon had bid in the second round.

At that time, Numetal moved the bankruptcy court against lenders’ decision to go for second round pleading that they are eligible in the first round itself and that the bids received in second round should not be opened until the court decides on the matter."

21,2018-05-15,JSW,"Numetal, a prominent bidder for the bankrupt Essar Steel, has done a U-turn on its stance on the need for a second bid by asking the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to consider the second round where it would have an advantage over rivals, two people familiar with the development said.

The Russian bank VTB-backed Numetal wants the first round of bids to be scrapped and the lenders to consider bids submitted in second round. It is appealing against lenders’ decision to demand that both the bidders in the first round –Numetal and ArcelorMittal – pay up dues to be eligible for bidding in bankruptcy process.

“At the same time, Numetal has also pleaded that the tribunal could order lenders to consider applications received in the second round of bidding which would establish their eligibility,” said one of the persons cited above who did not want to be identified.

No Loans Overdue, Says Numetal


NCLAT will hear the matter on May 17.
Numetal said that none of its shareholders have any overdue loans with any Indian lender without getting into the specifics of its appeal to consider the second round of bidding. “Neither Numetal nor its shareholders have any loans overdue with any creditors in India. Aurora, which had minority shareholder interest with 25% equity in Numetal, neither had management role nor any right to directorship in the company. Neither Aurora nor its beneficiary has any loan irregularities with Indian lenders and banks. In any event, Numetal’s other shareholders have already bought out Aurora’s shareholding in the company. Numetal has pleaded before NCLAT on its eligibility and the matter has been posted for hearing on May 17,” the company said.



The Resolution Professional had declared both bids received in the first round ineligible, following which a second round of bidding was conducted in early April. Vedanta Resources, Numetal in partnership with JSW Steel, and ArcelorMittal in partnership with Nippon had bid in the second round.

At that time, Numetal had moved the bankruptcy court against lenders’ decision to go for a second round, pleading that they were eligible in the first round itself and that the bids received in second round should not be opened until the court decides on the matter.

“Numetal has dropped Rewant Ruia-owned Aurora Trust in the second round (when they bid on April 2) while there were no changes in case of ArcelorMittal.

Although LN Mittal’s name was dropped as promoter of defaulting companies, dues were not paid as tribunal order came subsequently (April 20). This makes Numetal’s case stronger in the second round,” said the official quoted above.

In response to Numetal’s first plea, the tribunal ordered lenders last month to give both bidders time to be eligible and declared the second round invalid.

Banks led by State Bank of India have written to both the bidders — Numetal and Arcelor-Mittal — that to be eligible under section 29A which bars defaulters from bidding for distressed assets, they should clear dues of defaulting companies connected to them. It is estimated that Numetal would have to pay close to Rs 40,000 crore to clear dues of many companies including Essar Steel’s while ArcelorMittal will have to pay Rs 7,000 crore to clear overdues of KSS Petron and Uttam Galva Steels.

In case of Numetal, lenders had specifically proposed that since Rewant Ruia is connected to Ravi Ruia, the company has to regularise dues of defaulting companies linked to Ravi Ruia."
32,2018-05-16,JSW,"The domestic equity market ended on a flat note on Tuesday as uncertainty over government formation in Karnataka hit market sentiment.

While the Nifty50 settled almost flat at 10,801, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled downward crossovers on 50 counters on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Among the stocks that witnessed downward crossovers in Tuesday’s session were Punjab National Bank, ITC, HDFC Standard Life, Bank of India, Arvind, Tata Chemicals, KPIT Technologies, Exide Industries, Engineers India and Adani Transmission.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bearish crossovers included Snowman Logistics, Central Bank, Kalpataru Power, Info Edge, Dalmia Bharat, Lux Industries and Lumax Industries.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward trend or vice-versa.




However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers on 24 counters on Tuesday, signalling opportunities to buy these stocks ahead of a new price spike.

The stocks included JSW Steel, Power Grid, JBM Auto, V-Mart Retail, Sadbhav Engineering, VST Industries, and Somany Ceramics.



The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 12.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, down at 35543.94 on Tuesday.

On further movement of the Nifty index, Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said as long as Nifty holds above the 10,785 level, it can extend its move towards 10,888 and then 10,950 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,725 and then 10,680 levels.”

India VIX moved down 6.89 per cent to 13.2625 in the previous trading session.

A close look at the chart of Tata Motors stock showed whenever the MACD line has crossed below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa.

Shares of the company closed 2 per cent down at Rs 324 on May 14."
33,2018-05-16,JSW,"After a major spurt in the wake of the Modi-led BJP’s strong showing in Karnataka elections, the domestic equity market has slipped into depression as the power equation changed in the final outcome, bringing in uncertainty grew over government formation in the state. Sustained foreign fund outflows amid a free fall in the rupee only added to the woes.

After a 400-point rally that had brought the Sensex very close to its all-time high levels, the 30-pack closed 21 points down on Tuesday and tanked another 200 points on Wednesday to trade around the 35,343 mark in morning trade on Wednesday.

But market veterans said it had nothing to do with the Karnataka cliffhanger. “I don’t think markets will care who will form government in Karnataka, as the BJP performed well,” Saurabh Mukherjea, Chief Executive Officer, Ambit Capital.

He said the market’s focus has already shifted to economic fundamentals. A couple of headwinds including a falling rupee, rising fuel prices as well as a spike in inflation are some of the macro factors that may dampen market sentiment in the near term. 

“Market will now focus on day-to-day grind of yields, currency, inflation,” Mukherjea said in an interaction with ETNow. 

Politics will be off the radar for some time, as next set of elections is due only in December. However, it will be important to track the unity of opposition in the runup to the 2019 elections, he said.

CLSA says fundamentals on the macro front as well as corporate earnings so far do not appear exciting. However, it is an ideal time to increase weight in consumption as the BJP has regained some political momentum by becoming the largest party in Karnataka.

The Global brokerage firm has added Zee and Dr Lal Pathlabs to its model portfolio. Country’s largest lender SBI is no more a part of CLSA’s model portfolio. It has also increased weightage on M&M and HDFC Bank, and reduced it on RIL and JSW Steel. 

The BJP on Tuesday emerged the single largest party in Karnataka, but fell nine seats short of a simple majority. The Congress used the ‘hung’ status of the verdict to cobble up a post-poll alliance with the third-placed JD(S) to keep the saffron party out of power.

In final count, the BJP bagged 104 seats, a gain of 64 from the last election, while the Congress notched up 78, a loss of 44 seats, though its vote share was nearly two percentage points more than that of the saffron party. The JD(S) secured 37 seats, down by three from its previous tally. Elections were held for 222 seats on May 12, while polling for the remaining two will be held later.

UBS told ETMarkets that market sentiments have taken a beating on the back of macro concerns. But a significant correction is not imminent as long as inflows are strong.

But the brokerage advised investors not to get in or buy at these levels, saying there will be better opportunities later this year. “In the base case scenario, Nifty may touch 10,500 by December 2018. One should watch the unity of opposition ahead of 2019 elections,” it said.

Midcaps and smallcaps are already struggling on Dalal Street. The BSE Midcap as well Smallcap indices have tanked nearly 12 per cent each from their respective highs hit in January, whereas benchmark BSE Sensex is just 2 per cent away from its January high.

“You have rising input cost pressure, and smaller companies tend to struggle in such a climate as they do not have the pricing power to deal with higher cost of raw material. Operating margin pressure is clearing building up for smallcaps and midcaps,” said Mukherjea.

He said Sebi’s rule change that bars largecap funds from putting too much money in smallcaps is hurting the category. “We will see sustained pressure on operating margins in smallcaps and midcaps this year,” Mukherjea said.

The rupee is proving to be another headache. The domestic currency breached the 68-level against the dollar for the first time since January 2017. 

“We need to increase allocation to largecaps for this financial year because of higher volatility that we expect. For the midcaps, the valuation premium to the broad index has increased substantially. Some of the largecaps like Infosys, HUL and a couple of private banks have come out with very good earnings numbers. So the focus has started shifting from midcaps to largecaps,” Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice President for PCG Research, Kotak Securities, told ETNow in a chat

Zarbade is advising his clients to have a higher share of largecaps in their portfolio and focus on those midcaps where there is good earnings growth visibility like some of the infrastructure names such as Dilip Buildcon, and agri-equipment companies like Escorts."

35,2018-05-16,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Speedy resolution of Tata Steel's takeover of Bhushan Steel has positive implications for resolving other stressed assets in the Indian banking system, S&P Global Ratings said today.

More than Rs 1 trillion (USD 15 billion equivalent) of steel assets are up for auction. This is the leading edge of an estimated Rs 9 trillion bad loan burden at Indian banks, it said.

""The speedy resolution of Tata Steel Ltd.'s takeover of Bhushan Steel Ltd. affirms India's fledgling bankruptcy law and has positive implications for resolving other stressed assets in the Indian banking system,"" S&P said in a statement.

Under the Bankruptcy Law, Indian banks have forced a number of defaulted steel mills to bankruptcy court. The law provides for resolution of bankruptcy cases within 270 days.

Tata Steel will pay upfront Rs 35,200 crore (USD 5.4 billion equivalent) to take over Bhushan, making this the biggest asset sale yet to be processed through India's new bankruptcy courts.

The case was resolved in just 10 months and closed yesterday when a court approved Tata's bid and dismissed claims from other creditors.

S&P Global Ratings said a time-bound resolution is a positive development for India's business environment. The previous open-ended resolution framework allowed vested interests to perpetually delay bankruptcy proceedings, it said.

""In our view, the Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India have enforced the new code by creating new dedicated bankruptcy courts with the power and resources to achieve timely rulings,"" S&P said.

The RBI's ongoing pressure on banks to recognise and resolve problem assets will lead to enhanced accountability and long-term sustainability of the banking sector, said the US-based rating agency.

For the steel industry, consolidation is a long-term positive. Large metal companies such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel Ltd., Vedanta Resources PLC, and ArcelorMittal have emerged as key bidders for the debt-ridden steel assets in the last few months.

""The planned acquisitions, if successful, would strengthen the market positions of Tata Steel and JSW Steel, whereas Vedanta could end up diversifying its commodities portfolio,"" S&P said.

Tata Steel has the financial capacity to spend up to Rs 70,000 crore (on an enterprise-value basis, and including Bhushan Steel) on stressed assets without hurting its credit profile, it said.

""However, Essar Steel will be too large to fit Vedanta's limited iron ore capacity and may lead to weakening of financial ratios if the proposed acquisition goes through,"" S&P said.

With the resolution of Bhushan Steel, the focus will now shift to other pending cases (such as Electrosteel Steels, Essar Steel, Monnet Ispat) where a timely resolution would bolster the credibility of the new legal framework,"" S&P said."

36,2018-05-17,JSW,"MUMBAI: Lenders of Essar Steel have approached the bankruptcy court seeking clarity on whether depositing money in the escrow account of lead banks would make ArcelorMittal an eligible bidder for the bankrupt steel company, two officials, who did not want to be identified, told ET.

ArcelorMittal deposited Rs 7,000 crore in the London branch of State Bank of India on Tuesday as payment to regularise the loans of two defaulting companies — Uttam Galva and KSS Petron — wherein the bidder has equity stake. This move to regularise the account follows a condition set by lenders that bidders should be compliant to Section 29A— which bars defaulters from bidding.

“Although the money has been deposited, the lenders would want it be endorsed by the adjudicating authority that the regularising of the loan by parking it is an escrow account would make ArcelorMittal an eligible bidder,” said a bank official quoted above. Lenders have moved National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

The resolution professional Satish Gupta had given both applications, Russian VTB-led Numetal and ArcelorMittal, seven days to regularise accounts of companies that are connected to them. The seven-day timeframe ended on Tuesday evening following which the lenders heard from officials of both Numetal and ArcelorMittal on how they would qualify themselves as potential bidders.

Numetal, which is a joint venture between VTB Bank and Rewant Ruia, son of Ravi Ruia, the founder promoter of Essar Steel, has moved NCLAT objecting to the lenders’ condition to regularise dues linked to Ravi Ruia. NCLAT will hear Numetal’s case on May 17. Numetal said that none of its shareholders have any overdue loans with any Indian lender without getting into the specifics of its appeal to consider the second round of bidding. “Post the presentation made by two bidders, the lenders held a meeting where they debated on whether parking money in escrow would make an applicant eligible,” said a bank executive aware of the development.

Initially, the RP had declared both bids ineligible as they were not compliant to Section 29A following which the bidders appealed to the bankruptcy court to reconsider their eligibility.

In a ruling, the court directed the lenders to decide on the eligibility of bidders rather than relying on the RP, and asked banks to give bidders time to cure disabilities and declared the second round of bids invalid. ArcelorMittal in partnership with Nippon, Numetal in partnership with JSW Steel and Vedanta had bid in the second round.

“Money transferred in the escrow account of SBI is on the presumption that lenders would classify them as an eligible bidder. But the fact is that payment of dues is one of the condition to be eligible,” point out a lender.

Lenders also want clarity on when the accounts of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron can be classified as regular accounts since Uttam Galva is referred to the bankruptcy court, though the case is yet to be admitted. If a settlement is reached between the applicants (lenders) and the company, the case can be withdrawn before it is admitted."

42,2018-05-17,JSW,"VTB-led Numetal, a prominent bidder for Essar Steel, has disclosed that they have made a bid of Rs 37,000 crore in the second round of bidding for the bankrupt steel company while pleading that the court should order the lenders to scrap the first round. In the first round, Numetal had offered Rs 19,000 crore while ArcelorMittal made a bid of Rs 32,000 crore for the company.

The disclosure was made even as the bankruptcy court declared the second round invalid and directed the resolution professional not to open those bids. In the second round, Numetal dropped Rewant Ruia, son of Ravi Ruia, promoters of Essar Steel, and replaced him with JSW Steel.

The disclosure was part of the argument that Numetal made to the higher bench of bankruptcy court, stating that they were being unfairly asked to regularise dues of companies related to Ravi Ruia. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) will hear the matter on May 22.

The higher bid is likely to cheer lenders who are looking at a lower haircut for Essar Steel, which has dues of over Rs 49,000 crore. According to a person present at the court hearing, ArcelorMittal’s legal representative said that while Numetal has offered to pay Rs 7,000 crore in second round, they (Numetal) have to actually pay Rs 42,000 crore to become eligible. 

The resolution professional Satish Gupta had declared both the bids received in the first round ineligible, following which a second round of bidding was conducted in early April. Vedanta Resources, Numetal in partnership with JSW Steel, and ArcelorMittal in tie-up with Nippon had bid in the second round.

At that time, Numetal had moved the bankruptcy court against lenders’ decision to go for the second round, pleading that they were eligible in the first round itself and that the bids received in second round should not be opened until the court decides on the matter. In response to Numetal’s first plea, the tribunal last month ordered lenders to give both bidders time to comply with IBC norms and declared the second round invalid.

Numetal was rejected on the grounds that Rewant Ruia, one of the partners in the VTB-led consortium, is the son of Essar promoter Ravi Ruia and is, therefore, seen as a connected party. While ArcelorMittal was rejected due to its connection with two defaulting companies Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.

Banks led by State Bank of India have written to both the bidders — Numetal and ArcelorMittal — that they should clear dues of defaulting companies connected to them in order to be eligible. It is estimated that Numetal would have to pay close to Rs 40,000 crore to clear dues of many companies including that of Essar Steel, while ArcelorMittal will have to pay Rs 7,000 crore to clear overdues of KSS Petron and Uttam Galva Steels. 

While ArcelorMittal has already parked Rs 7,000 crore in an escrow account of SBI’s London branch, Numetal has raised objection to lenders’ condition, stating that Ravi Ruia is not connected to them."

45,2018-05-18,JSW,"MUMBAI: After losing Ilva to ArcelorMittal, homegrown steelmaker JSW Steel on Friday finalised the deal to acquire Italy's second-largest steel plant Aferpi from the Algerian Cevital for Rs 441 crore in a move that will give the company a foothold in the Italian and European market. 

Originally owned by Russian steel company Severstal, the 2 MT steelmaker has 2,000 employees and specialises in making long products, especially steel used in rails and railways products. The acquisition will help the Sajjan Jindalled company to expand its reach in the specialised steel market, especially in automobiles. 

“JSW Steel Italy has entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 17.05.2018 with Cevitaly S.r.l for acquisition of 100% shares of Aferpi S.p.A, Piombino Logistics S.p.A and 69.27% of the share capital of GSI Lucchini S.p.A for a cash consideration of 55 million euros on a cash free debt free basis,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing on Friday. The transaction is subject to closing adjustments including for working capital for the three respective divisions that are located in Piombino in Tuscany province in Italy. 

Piombino Logistics (PL) manages the logistics infrastructure of Piombino's port area that will help JSW Steel in supplying billets from India to Aferpi via its upstream facilities in the country. GSI produces forged steel balls used in grinding mills that is majorly used in mining. 

The cash transaction is proposed to be funded through a combination of internal accruals and debt at Aferpi, PL and GSI, the company said. 

The acquisition will be a redemption for India's largest steel company which had tried buy the asset back in 2014, but was pipped by Algeria's largest privately-held conglomerate, Cevital. According to Platts, the Italian government started ""severing ties between Aferpi (former Lucchini) and Cevitaly"" at the end of last year when the latter failed to provide a new comprehensive industrial plan and industrial partner for Aferpi. 

JSW Steel also has long term plans to set up electric arc furnace there to provide for the raw materials and reduce dependence on material sourced from India. 

The announcement by JSW Steel comes at a time when it has almost acquired Monnet Ispat and Energy in India and pit itself yet again against ArcelorMittal by joining Russian Numetal to acquire Essar Steel. 


Apart from bidding for stressed assets at home, the 18MT Indian steelmaker has been strengthening its position abroad. This announcement will follow the company's investment of close to $500 million in March in its plate and pipes mill facility in the US as well as backward integration to stop dependence on steel from India."

49,2018-05-22,JSW,"Indian equity market ended its 5-day losing streak on Tuesday and ended the session with modest gains. The NSE benchmark Nifty closed 20 points or 0.19 per cent higher at 10,536.70.

 As expected, the Nifty continued to see resistance at the 100-DMA mark of 10,538 for the entire session. The index also did achieve some stability on expected lines.

 Wednesday’s session is likely to remain on the similar lines. We expect a quiet to modestly positive start to the trade. At the same time the levels of 10,538, which is the 100-DMA of the Nifty, will continue to remain a critical level to watch for in the immediate short term.

 The index will be important for the market to open and sustain above 10,538 to attempt any pullback. Wednesday will see the levels of 10,550 and 10,615 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,510 and 10,460 zones.



 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 43.6255, and it remains neutral showing no divergences against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line.

 If we look at pattern analysis, the 50-DMA still trades below the 100-DMA mark. This means that the Nifty is under very short term sideways movement and has lost upward momentum over the past couple of weeks.

 The zone of 10,460-10,538 is likely to remain an extremely important support over the coming days.

 Overall, Nifty appears oversold on some of the oscillators. Further, Nifty has attempted to stabilise on the expected lines. F&O data also suggest some likely technical pullback happening. We also expect some continuation of the short covering in the broader market as well, while quality stocks will continue to see modest purchases being made.

We recommend a cautiously positive view on the market, while continuing to keep overall exposures into check.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Shorts covering was seen in stocks like JSW Steel, IDFC Bank, Ashok Leyland, NCC, TV18 Broadcast, Tata Motors, Syndicate Bank, Federal Bank, Dish TV, PTC, ICICI Prulife, NHPC and Tata Global.

The country had produced 8.22 MT during the same month a year ago, the Joint Plant Committee (JPC) said in a report. 

""During April 2018, crude steel production was at 8.59 MT, a growth of 4.4 per cent over April 2017,"" it said. 

SAIL, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), Tata Steel , Essar Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd together produced 5.01 MT during April. This was 6.7 per cent more compared to 4.7 MT the six players had produced in April 2017, the report said. 

""The rest 3.57 MT came from other producers, showing a growth of 1.4 per cent over April 2017,"" it added. 

During April 2018, the output of hot metal was at 5.80 MT as compared to 5.38 MT during the year-ago month. While 4.83 MT was produced by the six companies, the rest 0.96 MT came from other producers. 

Output of pig iron rose 1.9 per cent to 0.80 MT from 0.78 MT in April 2017. 

According to World Steel Organisation (worldsteel), India outstripped Japan to become the second largest steel producer as its steel output grew 3.43 per cent to 8.43 MT in February against 8.29 MT of the latter.

India has set a target of producing 300 MT crude steel by 2030 with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore. In this regard, the Cabinet last year approved the National Steel Policy (NSP).

The BSE Metal index closed the day with a loss of 3.93 per cent, emerging as the top loser among sectoral indices.

Shares of Tata Steel plunged a day after it said it would raise Rs 16,500 crore through debt instruments to fund Rs 32,500 crore acquisition of Bhushan Steel.

Shares of Vedanta plunged after at least nine people were killed in the southern state of Tamil Nadu when police fired at violent protesters calling for the closure of a copper smelter run by parent Vedanta Resources Plc, Reuters reported.

Shares of State Bank of India, Tech Mahindra, Cipla, UPL, Larsen & Toubro and NTPC emerged as the top Nifty gainers of Wednesday's session.

53,2018-05-24,JSW,"Though the market was expected to find some stability, the Nifty traded contrary to expectations on Thursday. After making a tepid start and losing ground in the initial trade, the index rebounded sharply and nearly tested the 100-DMA. The index ended with a gain of 83.50 points or 0.80 per cent.

On technical parameters, the Nifty has defended the 50-DMA levels on closing basis, which stood at 10,471.60.

For Friday, we expect this attempt of a pullback to continue. However, the 100-DMA level of 10,538 still remains a concern, as Nifty isn’t completely out of the woods as yet. Friday is likely to see the levels of 10,538 and 10,595 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports came in lower at 10,470 and 10,380 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 44.16 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. It has started to narrow its trajectory. On the candles, a strong bullish candle emerged. It has emerged near the support area of 50-DMA, and therefore it holds some significance.

The pattern analysis throws up an interesting picture. The 50-DMA rules below 100-DMA level and this indicates likely continuation of short-term weakness. The Nifty has pulled back from near the 50-DMA and this has validated 50-DMA as support for the immediate short term. However, it has still resisted to the 100-DMA mark, which stands at 10,538.



Overall, the level of 10,538, which is the 100-DMA, has come into play again.

Though a quiet start is expected and some followup move may still be seen, the Nifty can still find resistance at 100-DMA levels. Any fresh sustainable upmove shall occur only after the Nifty moves past and closes above this level. Until this happen, theoretically speaking, the market remains susceptible to selling pressure at higher levels.

55,2018-05-27,JSW,"The Indian equity market continued its upsurge for the second day in a row on Friday, as the Nifty50 advanced gains and ended the day 91.30 points or 0.87 per cent higher. Though select buying was evident in specific stocks, bulk of the rise came from short covering.

What was technically important was that the Nifty50 has validated the 50-DMA as its support at close and also moved past and closed above the 100-DMA level, which now stands at 10,539.

As we enter the expiry week of the current derivative series, we expect a quiet opening on Monday and expect Nifty to advance to the short-term 20-DMA, which stands at 10,668. The 50-pack may encounter multiple pattern resistances there.

The 10,660 and 10,695 levels may act as immediate resistance levels for Nifty, while supports may come in at 10,540 and 10,480 levels.


In the event of any minor correction, the 100-DMA level may act as support at close.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 50.6063 and it remained neutral showing no divergence from price. The daily MACD remained bearish as it traded below the signal line. However, it is seen narrowing its trajectory. Apart from a white body that occurred, no significant formations were observed on the candles.

Pattern analysis of Nifty revealed the index was within striking distance of its short-term 20-DMA, which also happens to be an important pattern resistance area for the market. There are chances that the market shall stall its rise there and see some consolidation in a narrow range.

Overall, with a quiet opening to trade expected on Monday, we expect the session to remain rangebound in nature. We expect minor gains in the market in general, while the upward move may get stalled for a short while near the short-term 20-DMA.

In the event of any minor correction, the 100-DMA level may act as support at close. We recommend refraining from shorts and continue modest stock-specific purchases. A positive but cautious view is advised for the day.

We expect the trade to remain dominated with rollover activities and highly stock as well as sector specific action.

We once again expect a quiet opening to the Wednesday’s trade. There are chances that the market may continue to exhibit sluggish behaviour with consolidation continuing. Still it is likely to have limited downsides with the zones of 10,580-10,600 acting as important pattern supports. We expect the levels of 10,650 and 10,710 to act as immediate resistance for Nifty. Supports may come in at 10,600 and 10,550 zones.




The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 51.8694, and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD still remains bearish. However, it is seen narrowing its trajectory and in absence of any major downsides, this indicator might see positive crossover.

On candles, a small engulfing bearish candle has occurred. Even though this candle is very small, it can temporarily stall an ongoing upmove. The pattern analysis show the major pattern supports of 10,580-10,600 may come into play once again.

In the event of a continued consolidation, these levels are expected to act as support in the immediate short term. Overall, in absence of any major triggers, we may see some consolidation continuing in the market. This activity is also likely to have very limited downsides, if any.

We expect the zones of 10,580-10,600 acting as important pattern supports. Any further dip may see the Nifty testing its 100-DMA level once again. We reiterate to continue to make select purchases while continuing to vigilantly protect profits at higher levels.

57,2018-05-29,JSW,"MUMBAI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal will on Tuesday hear lenders who pleaded that cases related to Essar Steel be heard at the earliest. On May 22, the appellate tribunal ruled that it would hear appeals filed by Numetal and ArcelorMittal — the two bidders of Essar Steel — from July 23 on daily basis.

The lenders appealed for an early hearing on the ground that delay in hearing by two months will result in financial losses for them.

The company was admitted to the bankruptcy court on August 2 last year, and lenders said if the hearing begins on July 23 it will easily drag on for a few months.

SBI filed the petition to expedite the case on behalf of the lenders.

The 270-day deadline for Essar ended on April 28 but the court extended it to May 28 and now the hearing is further delayed to July 23.

“Such delays would make it difficult for banks to plan their capital requirements and earnings since the estimated period of recovery is being postponed to the next quarter,” pointed out a senior bank official who did not want to be identified.

Essar Steel has outstanding dues of Rs 49,000 crore.

Numetal pleaded the lenders proposition that they be paid close to `42,000 crore to be eligible as a bidder for Essar is unfair. They also appealed that the banks should consider it an eligible bidder in the first round itself while also suggesting that the court direct the RP to open the second round of bids. VTB in partnership with JSW Steel, ArcelorMittal with Nippon and Vedanta were the three bidders in the second round.

In the past, the Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal had declared the second round invalid and directed the RP to give both VTN-led Numetal and ArcelorMittal time to cure the disability. Legal experts say the court ruling implies that both should be given a chance to repay dues to be eligible.

ArcelorMittal deposited Rs 7,000 crore in the escrow account of SBI’s London branch to repay loans of two defaulting companies — Uttam Galva and KSS Petron— that are connected to LN Mittal. This payment is subject to the condition that only they should be declared eligible bidders.

Lenders had sought NCLAT’s opinion on the matter which too is clubbed with Numetal’s plea and scheduled for hearing on July 23.

In a hearing on May 22, NCLAT said that the RP should “ensure that the company remains on-going and if so necessary will take assistance of the (suspended) board of directors."

The Nifty50 index opened flat on Tuesday, but failed to hold above the 10,700 mark and wiped out its entire gains of the previous session.

It formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern on daily scale as it covered the entire movement of the last candle and closed below the opening price of previous session. The overall price setup suggests rangebound move with limited upside as well as downside. So it will have support at the 10,550 level to consolidate between 10,550 and 10,735 levels over the next few sessions.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was intact at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,600, while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by 10,700.

Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices, while significant Call writing was seen at 10,700 and then 10,650 levels, which restricted the upside. Options data suggested a trading range between 10,550 and 10,750 levels.

India VIX remained flattish to close at 13.12 level. A lower VIX level even after a fall in the market suggests that the decline would get bought into again.

Bank Nifty failed to hold above 26,500 and remained under pressure for most part of the session. It formed a Bearish Belt Hold Candle on daily scale and negated the formation of higher highs and lows after three sessions. As long as it holds above 26,250, it could witness an upward move towards 26,500 and then 26,750 levels, while on declines major support is seen near 26,100 and 26,000 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a 0.57 per cent loss at 10,618. Long buildup was seen in M&M, Tata Power, GAIL, HCL Tech, Dabur, Idea, JSW Steel and BHEL while shorts were seen in Havells, M&M Financials, Coal India, Glenmark, Bharti Infratel and ZEE.

Numetal had moved the tribunal saying that it is unfair for lenders to demand Rs 42000 crore from them to be classified as eligible bidder for Essar Steel. They also appealed that the banks should consider them eligible bidder in the first round itself while suggesting that the court directs the resolution professional (RP) to open the second round of bids wherein they have offered Rs 37000 crore.

62,2018-05-30,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel and Vedanta have expressed an interest to acquire the specialty steel business of Usha Martin, a sale fetching a maximum of ?5,000 crore that will help the Kolkata-based company pare its debt, two people aware of the development told ET.

The valuation of the business is being pegged between Rs 3,500 and Rs 5,000 crore. According to a source who did not wish to be named, both companies have been given the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) while they explore various aspects of the acquisition of the 1 MT specialty steel plant in Jamshedpur.

“JSW Steel is in advanced talks to buy the specialty steel business,” said a person aware of the developments. “This will be part of the company’s strategy to acquire small distressed businesses in India, the UK and the US and turning them around without stretching the balance sheet.” JSW Steel is also looking at another steel plant in Europe after it recently acquired Aferpi in Italy.

An MoU is an information docket prepared by investment bankers and contains all the terms and details of a potential deal.

On the other hand, Vedanta, with its vast iron ore reserves, has been trying to enter the steelmaking business to add value to the resource that is a key raw material for steel. It has successfully bid for the debt-ridden Electrosteel Steels that has come on the block under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The creditors have approved of the plan but the company is fighting a legal battle in NCLAT where a fellow bidder Renaissance Steel has challenged its eligibility under section 29(A) of the code.

A JSW Steel official declined to comment while an email sent to Vedanta remained unanswered until print time.

The query mailed to Usha Martin was dubbed as “speculatory in nature” by CFO Rohit Nanda.

Usha Martin had a total debt of Rs 3,723 crore on its books at the end of March 2018 and reported net loss in all quarters of the last fiscal except for the March quarter when it came back into the black with a net profit of Rs 12.6 crore, reports Bloomberg.

Its specialty steel business consists of a fully-integrated steel plant with captive iron ore and coal mines and produces wire rods and bars that feeds the company’s wire rope business as well as finds use in forging applications, automobiles and engineering industries. It contributes to two thirds of the company’s revenue. For 2017-18, the consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 4,768 crore.

Rajeev Jhawar, MD of Usha Martin, had last year said it was looking at selling either its wire rope or steel business to pare debt. Jhawar has also been involved in a legal tussle with uncle Basant Jhawar and cousin Prashant Jhawar, who have said Rajeev orchestrated their dismissal from the company last year apart from indulging in financial irregularities. They had moved the NCLT Kolkata and the Calcutta High Court in February.

Domestic steelmakers are churning their production and acquisition strategies to make the most of an anticipated high demand growth that the world will be witnessing with India leading the pack after China. According to World Steel Association, there will be a 1.8% demand growth for steel globally in 2018 while Indian steel is set to grow at 5.5%.

“Usha Martin will help JSW Steel access a highly niche market of specialty steel business while for Vedanta it is a good opportunity to convert its iron ore into an end product to save the iron ore mines as mandated by the state authorities in Odisha,” said Goutam Chakraborty, metals analyst at Emkay Securities. On the growing trend of consolidation in the steel market and a possible concern of a handful of players controlling supply and prices, he said since steel is a global commodity, the price will always be governed by international benchmarks."

1,2018-06-02,JSW,"KOLKATA/MUMBAI: The US decision to impose a tariff of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU, revoking the temporary exemption, is likely to impact metal stocks like JSW Steel, JSPL, Tata Steel, Hindalco which have exposure to export markets in the US and Europe.

“We believe that there would be short-term pressure on metal stocks due to uncertainty around material flow (particularly steel) and retaliatory measures by the affected regions,” Edelweiss Research said in its latest report.

The report said steel is more vulnerable than aluminium as concerns persist on around 18 million tonne (mt) of imports by the US (almost the entire incremental global demand) getting diverted elsewhere.

“This is likely to reduce export attractiveness of Indian steel companies, particularly JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) that might have to compete against the material diverted from the US,” Edelweiss Research analyst Amit A Dixit said in the report. While JSW Steel and JSPL, for which exports comprise almost 20 per cent of sales volume, might see pressure on pricing and volume, Tata Steel might also see pressure in its European operations to the extent of US exports, he added.

Among aluminium companies, Edelweiss said it believes Hindalco would be able to pass on the price hikes, while Vedanta should also be able to maintain its export sales given that the trade flow disruption is expected to be lower in case of aluminium.

The issue of safeguarding steel exports to the US by Tata Steel’s unit in the Netherlands amid Washington’s decision to impose tariff on this sector in Europe was discussed during a recent meeting between Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi in a bid to protect mutual interest."

11,2018-06-07,JSW,"HYDERABAD: The Odisha government today said it is inviting SAIL-ArcelorMittal JV to set up an automotive grade steel plant in the state as ample land was available there.

Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) recently responding to the state's request wrote a letter to Odisha Principal Industry Secretary Sanjeev Chopra, saying they would keep the eastern state in mind while zeroing in on the location for the proposed steel plant.

""They (SAIL-Mittal JV) are examining various locations. And the ball is in their court. Once they express interest, land is also available.""

""Ample land is available in Rourkela. I am sure in case they are interested they can do it very fast here. There is no issues of land acquisition also,"" Chopra told PTI here.

SAIL has a steel plant in Rourkela with 4.5 million tonnes of Hot Metal and 4.2 Million Tonnes of Crude Steel per annum capacity.

SAIL and ArcelorMittal had in May, 2015 entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore the possibility of setting up an auto-grade steel manufacturing facility under a joint venture in India.

The proposed JV will construct a cold rolling mill and other downstream finishing facilities in India, touted as one of the fastest-growing automotive markets in the world with production expected to double between 2014 and 2020, from 3.6 million units to 7.3 million units.

In May last year, an inter ministerial group (IMG) had reviewed the progress of MoU that aims to set up an estimated Rs 5,000-crore joint venture (JV) plant to produce auto-grade steel in the country.

Replying to a query, the official said Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel has given a proposal for the land given up by Korean steel giant Posco, for setting up a steel plant and the Odisha government is clearing the file for allocation of the land.

""JSW has given a proposal. So land is going to be assessed. The recommendation has gone to IDCO (Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation) which will be allotting the land.""

""Some formalities need to be completed for getting forest clearances which was earlier in the name of Posco. They should be able to do the groundbreaking in this calendar year,"" Chopra said.

The official was in the city for a roadshow for the upcoming ""Make in Odisha Conclave 2018.""

Seeking investments into Odisha, Chopra said currently the state has about 1.21 lakh acres of land bank for industrial development."

14,2018-06-08,JSW,"Citigroup has a neutral call on Steel Authority of India (SAIL) Ltd. with a target price of Rs 83.0 . The current market price of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) Ltd. is Rs 81.75 Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Steel Authority of India (SAIL) Ltd. price can reach defined target. 

 Steel Authority of India (SAIL) Ltd., incorporated in 1973, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 34056.18 crore.



Investment rationale by Citi
 
Upgrade to Neutral (from Sell) — 1) 4Q18 EBITDA/t was the highest since FY11; we think steel spreads could sustain: better than expected China steel demand,continuing supply limits, falling inventories. 2) SAIL’s mgmt is targeting 28% volume growth in FY19. While that maybe a stretch, we expect strong volumes for SAIL asTata Steel (TSL) and JSW Steel are operating at 90%+ utilization and pending ramp up of assets under IBC proceedings. 3) We expect Net D/EBITDA to fall from 9x in FY18 to 3x by FY20E. SAIL trades at 5.3x Sep19E EV/EBITDA (on our ahead of consensus est) vs. global peers at ~5x, and seems to be discounting most positives, hence not a Buy. Prefer Tata Steel. 

 
TP Rs83 (vs. Rs50) — We raise FY19E/20E EBITDA by 26%/25% on potentially higher steel prices. But cut multiple to 5.5x Sep19E EV/EBITDA (vs. 6x Mar19E), now at a premium to global peers at 5x (vs inline with global peers earlier) as global multiples have de-rated. It is at a discount to TSL’s target multiple of 6x.

 
Citi's Take on 4Q — Adj EBITDA came in at Rs26bn vs. a loss of Rs2.6bn last year – realizations (+24% yoy) and volumes (+8% yoy). EBITDA beat estimates on lowercosts and better pricing. EBITDA/t $104 vs. negative $11 last year; $57 in 3Q. 

 
Mgmt expects EBITDA/t to expand — 4Q adj EBITDA/t was Rs7,000 vs. Rs3,800 in 3Q. Steel realizations rose by Rs5,000 (~12%) vs. 3Q. Mgmt expects EBITDA/t to expand with 1QFY19 steel prices likely to be higher by Rs2,000/t vs. 4Q and costs likely to be lower due to better manpower costs + efficiencies.


 SAIL to gain market share in FY19E — Capacity expansion from 12.5mt to 20mt is almost complete. FY18 vols rose 7% to 14mt; mgmt expects 18mt in FY19 (sharper acceleration in 2H), close to rated production in two years. FY18 mix: flats 55%, longs 33%, semis 12%; post expansion: flats 47%, longs 41%, semis 12%. 

 
Employee costs (16%) could fall — Mgmt expects headcount to fall in FY19 by ~5k (current 77k). Wage revision was due in Jan17; but DPE guidelines prevent a revision currently. Earliest revision should be in Jan20 if profitable in FY19/FY20."

The upcoming G7 meeting is firmly on investors' radar. Plus, the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore on June 12 is making them play with care. 

What is eating away their confidence, however, is the US slapping tariffs on a wide range of imports from allies like the EU and Canada.

Avanti Feeds
Shrimp exporter Avanti Feeds rallied 18 per cent during the week to June 8. The scrip jumped to Rs 1,825.60 on Friday, from Rs 1,543.40 on June 1. 

Managing Director Indra Kumar told ETNow that shrimp demand has normalised and the company has order for the next 6 months. That apparently sparked a turnaround in fortunes. 

“We are not worried about margins and the business is doing pretty good. There is nothing to worry about the business side. Correction in shrimp prices has caused demand to go up,” Kumar held. 


Top gainers 
Himachal Futuristic Communications (up 19.68 per cent), Avanti Feeds (18.29 per cent), Unitech (17.19 per cent), Allahabad Bank (15 per cent) and Caplin Point Labs (11.78 per cent) stole the show. They stood among top gainers in the BSE 500 index this week.


Top losers

Sectoral update
The BSE Healthcare index jumped 3.70 per cent for the week ended Friday. Metal (up 2.58 per cent), oil (2.13 per cent), IT (1.73 per cent) and technology (1.66 per cent) had a good story to tell.

Jindal Steel and Power
Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) rallied over 6 per cent to Rs 240.80 on June 8 against Rs 227 on June 1. 

The company tweeted, “JSPL produced 6.86 mn dmt of pellet in 2017-18, up by 6 per cent from 6.46 mn dmt in 2016-17. During Q4 FY18, production of pellets increased by 15 per cent YoY to 1.84 mt and the company achieved external sales of pellets of 0.74 mt.”


Sugar stocks waver
Sugar stocks settled the week on a mixed note even as the Cabinet okayed a Rs 8,000 crore bailout package for mills, which is seen to benefit 5 crore sugarcane farmers. 

The government fixed minimum selling price for sugar at Rs 29 per kg. The average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg. That's below cost of production. 

For the week ended June 8, Bajaj Hindusthan declined 2.71 per cent, followed by Balrampur Chini (down 6.43 per cent) and EID Parry (3.73 per cent). Shree Renuka Sugars settled 0.63 per cent higher at Rs 16.10 for the week."

19,2018-06-11,JSW,"KOLKATA: The Usha Martin board, which met in Delhi on Monday, formally decided to initiate the sale of its steel business to achieve the objective of deleveraging the company’s Rs 3,700-crore debt burden. The board created a six-member committee of independent directors to help evaluate proposals for sale of its steel business. This is likely to include bids from Tata Steel and JSW Steel who are believed to shown interest to acquire Usha Martin’s one million tonne per annum steels business in Jamshedpur. It has been entrusted with the task of appointing investment bankers and consultants and advisors to help evaluate the proposals and oversee the sale.

For UML which decided to cut down its debt by looking at sale of its wire ropes business a year and half back, this marks a shift in strategy. Listing out the reasons for this, a top source close to the developments said: “With a turnaround in the steel business cycle, there has been a considerable improvement in the valuation of steel assets. UML's steel unit too has performed better. The board thus decided to move ahead and explore the sale of UML’s steel business to help reduce the debt.” In FY18, UML's losses narrowed to Rs 282 crore from Rs 354 crore a year earlier, as revenues rose 24% to Rs 4,038 crore against Rs 3,246 crore a year earlier. 

The move was also prompted by slow progress in the wire ropes sale initiative. “Also, since wire ropes is a global business and has historically been UML’s mainstay--- the company started off in the 1960s as a wire ropes maker--- the board felt it would be appropriate to retain it for the time being and instead scout for buyers for the steel unit,” the source added. The sale of the steel unit which makes automotive steel, forging quality and speciality steels, would include the company’s captive power unit and its coal and iron ore mines, the source added. 

In a notification to the stock exchanges soon after the meeting got over, Usha Martin said: “The actual sale of the business will only be undertaken after due consideration and by following due process of law by obtaining appropriate approvals from the board, regulators, shareholders and lenders.” The UML scrip rose 4.61% to close at Rs 29.50 on the BSE on Monday."
23,2018-06-12,JSW,"Indian market managed to post decent gains on Tuesday despite witnessing high volatility during the session. The NSE benchmark Nifty rose by 55.90 points or 0.52 per cent.

However, it was the second day in a row when the market resisted the 10,820-10,850 levels. After resisting this crucial zone for the entire session, the Nifty closed very close the 10,850-mark.

 The Wednesday’s session opening will be crucial. After the brief consolidation in the 10,820-10,850 zones, if Nifty wants to see any meaningful upmove, it will have to move past the 10,850-mark and stay above that.

 The longer the market remains below this critical mark, higher will be the chances of it consolidating for some more time. Wednesday will see the levels of 10,850 and 10,930 acting as important resistance. Supports may come in at 10,780 and 10,735 zones.



 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 62.3188 and it has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish. The RSI does not show any divergence against the price, but it is seen breaking out of a pattern resistance.

 The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on the candles. Going by the pattern analysis, Nifty still holds the falling trend line that joins 11,179-mark to its subsequent lower tops.

 The Nifty will have to move past the 10850 level and remain above that to resume any meaningful upmove.

 Overall, with Nifty still continuing to resist the 10,820-10,850 zones, it has shown inclination to move past this zone. F&O data suggest short covering and also fresh longs were seen being added.

 Though it remains slightly overstretched on the daily charts, the Nifty has demonstrated underlying strength and shows inclination to breakout from the current resistance area.

 We recommend continuing remaining highly stock-specific while making purchases and extremely vigilant at higher levels unless a meaningful breakout is achieved.

Trump-Kim Summit Starts with a Handshake
The dollar jumped to a 3-week top on Tuesday while Asian shares started cautiously as investors were hopeful of a positive outcome from a highly anticipated U.S.-Korea summit, which could set the stage for ending a nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula. President Donald Trump shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un kicking off a historic summit on Tuesday between two adversaries that only last year had seemed at the brink of nuclear war. Their meeting at a luxury hotel in Singapore, marks the first face-to-face encounter between a US president and a leader of North Korea. 


Govt May Pay Cos’ Share of ESI for New Recruits
In a bid to enable job creation in the formal sector, the labour ministry is considering paying the employers’ share towards the health insurance scheme under the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) for all new recruits.

CPI May Jump to 4-mth High
India's retail inflation jumped further in May to a four-month high, primarily driven by a surge in energy prices, according to a Reuters poll of economists, suggesting more policy tightening from the central bank is coming. The poll of more than 30 economists taken June 4-8 showed annual consumer price inflation likely increased to 4.83% last month, the highest since January and above April's 4.58%. If that predicted pace is realised, May will be the seventh month in a row with inflation higher than the RBI's medium-term target of 4%. 


Custodians to Shield Retail Investors?

Defaulting brokers and vanishing share portfolios have prompted the Securities & Exchanges Board of India (Sebi) to consider ways to protect the interests of retail investors who are often at the mercy of unscrupulous brokers misusing clients’ shares without consent. The capital market regulator is considering the introduction of custodians for retail investors — akin to intermediaries for foreign portfolio investors — that will manage the back-end operations of investors after a trade is done, reports ET. Sebi plans to tighten rules for trading settlement and introduce custodians for retail investors and ensure that brokers do not misuse clients’ accounts and sell their shares without nod unless the client has defaulted. 



Draft Norms to Modify Loan System for Large Borrowers 

The Reserve Bank has come out with draft guidelines on loan system for delivery of bank credit to improve discipline among larger borrowers enjoying working capital facility from the banking system.

For borrowers having aggregate fund based working capital limit of Rs 150 crore and above from the banking system, a minimum level of 'loan component' of 40% shall be effective from October 1, 2018 .


Real Estate Gets Rs 20,000-cr BlowThe implementation of a new accounting standard from this fiscal will force listed real estate companies to write back profits made over the past few years from all projects that are not complete. Under IND-AS 115, in line with international norms, listed real estate companies will have to write back about Rs 20,000 crore from their net worth in the current fiscal itself. This would happen in the first quarter on a retrospective basis and would lead to a hit on the net worth and lead to a temporary spike in companies’ debt-equity ratio.”

24,2018-06-13,JSW,"Kolkata | New Delhi: Liberty House, a late entrant in the race for Bhushan Power & Steel, has sought a week to firm up commitments from its bankers to back its financial bid for the bankrupt company.

At a 12-hour meeting of the committee of creditors (CoC) on Monday where bidders Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Liberty House made presentations, it was also decided that PwC would be asked to conduct Section 29A compliance.

Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code disallows people connected to defaulting promoters/companies from bidding for stressed assets. The creditors are tipped to rank all three resolution plans based on technical and financial parameters by next week, people familiar with the developments said.

Liberty House has offered an upfront payment of Rs 18,500 crore for Bhushan Power & Steel, exceeding Tata Steel’s bid by Rs 1,500 crore, ET reported in its edition dated April 28.

Before Liberty joined the fray, Tata Steel was said to be the frontrunner with a Rs 17,000 crore offer, which also provided for infusion of working capital worth Rs 7,500 crore into Bhushan Power.

A Tata Steel spokesperson said on Tuesday: “We have not received any communication about our bid from the CoC.”

Tata Steel has approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against the decision of the National Company Law Tribunal to allow Liberty House’s belated bid for the company.

Liberty’s bid, submitted past the February 8, 2018, deadline for binding offers, was initially rejected by the CoC. However, it was opened after Liberty appealed against the decision in the NCLT.

Bhushan Power, one of the top 12 defaulters, owes some Rs 48,500 crore to its lenders and was admitted to the NCLT in June 2017. “We have put in a bid and we remain committed to it,” a JSW spokesperson said. The JSW Group is said to have offered a total of Rs 17,000 crore.

The lenders will declare the highest bidder based on a combination of technical and financial scores at a meeting scheduled next week.

The decision of the lenders will be submitted in a sealed envelope to NCLAT, according to its May 9 directive allowing Tata Steel’s appeal against Liberty’s delayed bid while continuing resolution proceedings for the company."
25,2018-06-13,JSW,"Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says if one really has a long-term view, one can hold on to two tier IT names even at this point of time. Joshi was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:


What is your view on Sun Pharma now that it has got the EIR (Establishment Inspection Report) for the Halol facility? Would there be a limited upside? Analysts have already pencilled in this clearance in their FY19 estimates and the stock is already up 15% in the last three days.
If one really goes by the transcript and the conference call post Q4 numbers, the management did indicate a double digit revenue growth for the company in the second half. So a lot of analysts on the street have already pencilled in a double digit revenue growth for Sun Pharma. But the speciality pipeline that Sun Pharma possesses and its monetisation is going to be extremely critical in terms of overall earnings estimates for FY20 as well. 

They have got a slew of speciality launches lined up. There is Yonsa, along with other speciality chemical drugs, which can do well in terms of both the exclusivity period and the kind of pricing that they can enjoy. The pricing pressures which led to earnings downgrades, the issues related to Halol did have a bearing on the stock but the earnings for FY19 at least is well captured in the price. 

Looking beyond FY19, if one assumes that all these monetisations would have a positive impact, the shareholders would probably hold on. This is the time to hold on because the clearance gives far greater visibility FY20 onwards.


How do you view TCS’s buyback plan? 
In terms of core dynamics, it is not going to create a huge amount of euphoria and add a premium to the current price. The improvement in ROE is a given. A lot of top tier managements have indicated plans to distribute the extra cash flow either in the form of dividends or buybacks. 

It is going to be in terms of their core performance and specifically revenue growth that they are able to generate in dollar and constant currency terms which the TCS management has guided for pretty decently. We have maintained a positive view on the stock but one does not necessarily need to play out on this buyback. If one really has a long-term view, one can hold on to two tier IT names even at this point of time.


What are you making of Jio’s new data plan and do you think the market is showing a a bit of a sentimental tilt towards Reliance today?
A couple of quarters back, we were probably talking about the down trading in ARPUs coming to an end. But, intense competition with relation to pricing is still continuing. The Jio quest for winning over the subscriber and revenue market shares continues. They have probably gained a tad but Bharti and Idea have managed to hold their ground in terms of subscriber base. 

Though the number of telecom players have shrunk to 4-5 including the state-owned BSNL, cash flows remain a constraint for the incumbents. The capex plans that they have announced, the kind of operating expenses that they have got on their balance sheets, is not going to allow free cash flows. 

The sentiment is positive even Reliance’s core business is probably on the right track. The results of their exploration plans with BP, can be looked at a few quarters down the line. RIL is something that I remain positive about. A clear disclaimer, I own this stock.


We have been talking about the move in some of the metal stocks over the last few weeks but of late, that trade has taken a back seat. Is there any momentum left in the run for the major metal stocks?
You have to bifurcate the metal space between ferrous and the non-ferrous. The inherent demand for steel still remains extremely buoyant. Product prices actually are moving up and is going to abet the earnings for a lot of steel companies. 

Steel makers domestically still look good in terms of realisation and growth coming through. Though input costs have moved up sharply over the past few quarters both in terms of iron ore and coking coal, you are seeing some cooloff happening on that front. 

The EBITDA per tonne should also probably start moving northwards for these companies. It is a clear case of operating leverage with volume offtake happening at a very decent pace and margin stabilising giving an effect to the return on capital employed.

Players like JSW Steel should probably still be held on in terms of valuation from an FY19 perspective on an EV/EBITDA basis. The inherent trends look extremely strong. For NALCO, the prices of alumina have gone through the roof and even after the internal captive consumption for its aluminium production, the prices are looking reasonably stable at this point of time. It can substantially improve earnings as well.

Vedanta as a play in terms of its integrated operations and cash rich balance sheet and the dividend payout, looks like a reasonable bet within the metal universe over the medium term.


What is happening within the larger IT basket? What are the some of the midcap IT names that you are betting on?
In the past, we have liked Cyient and Mindtree. The growth in terms of dollar revenues as well as their margins held on pretty well. The kind of price movement that you have seen in both these stocks has been quite exemplary. At this point of time, within the midcap IT basket, Nucleus software is something that we will continue to pursue and like.

With more emphasis being laid on cloud, a lot of the NBFC companies are coming in for their licensing requirements in relation to cloud computing. Nucleus probably has an edge out there. The overall dynamics on their balance sheet, what can come through in terms of intrinsic cash flows over the next few quarters and years can be quite substantial. In terms of margin profile and earnings estimates, we remain extremely sanguine on what the company can actually deliver over the next few quarters. Nucleus Software at this point of time within the midcap IT basket will be our top pick.


Infy is completing 25 years since listing. How do you now look at the Infy versus TCS story?
Over the last few quarters, TCS has outperformed Infosys in terms of volume growth that it has delivered both in terms of the dollar growth as well as a better margin profile. Further, the kind of segmental performance that TCS has delivered, has also been quite exemplary compared to Infosys. 

Infosys has struggled in terms of client mining following management transition that it went through and the investments that were required a few quarters and years down the line for digital innovations. All those efforts have now started bearing fruits specifically on the digital front.

TCS had advantage over Infosys in terms of having a lot of emphasis on the core sectors and effectively having their utilisation levels getting propped up and execution patterns improving along with client deal wins improving across sub sectors. That should improve the dynamics in terms of how the overall performance over the next few quarters can be. 

Otherwise, the dynamics remain same and the cash flows that both Infy and TCS throw out are quite substantial. The payouts in terms of dividends are going to be substantially higher and consistent with what they have actually announced. 

As Infosys starts delivering, the gap with TCS will start narrowing down. Overall, it is going to be a decent show from the top tier IT companies.


What would be some of your top midcap high conviction ideas ahead of trade?
 LT Foods is something that I probably like on declines at this point of time and what you have probably seen in terms of their market share dominance. They have got 22% market share in the domestic market. Their brand Royal is very well known in North American markets. Daawat is how it is known as in the domestic markets. They have got a well entrenched distribution networks 1,40,000 retail outlets covering more than 2 lakh towns. They have also got 3,000-odd wholesalers. They cater to speciality hotels and restaurants with 50% share in that front. They have also tied up with a Japanese company for creating rice-based snacks which can really do well over the next few quarters. 

In terms of financials, our own expectations are a top line growth of 12% odd and a bottom line growth of 17% odd. The margin dip that you saw in Q4 were more or less in terms of investments that have done in the European and the US subsidiaries. The higher depreciation amount should steadily start coming down as utilisation level starts coming through as fixed cost absorption starts happening more effectively. 

Margins stability at 10.5%-11% and the ROE expansion would probably lead us to believe that an EPS of Rs 6 can be delivered by FY20 so the valuation basis I think looks extremely attractive at this point of time."

27,2018-06-13,JSW,"Usha Martin’s decision to put its 1-million tonne steel unit on the block has attracted at least four large suitors.

Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Group has jumped into the fray while the Pune-based Kalyani group joined the race with Tata Steel and JSW Steel also pursuing plans to acquire the Jamshedpur-based facility.

Usha Martin is looking to sell the unit to clear debt of Rs. 3,700 crore. It hopes to get non-binding offers in the next two-three weeks, managing director Rajeev Jhawar told ET. “We have formally set off the sale process for the steel unit following the recent board decision on this. We haven’t received any offer as yet but there are quite a few players who are interested in the unit,” Jhawar said.

He refused to name the interested players.

For Tata Steel, the Usha Martin steel unit is literally in its backyard. Jhawar has already met Tata Steel executives and is believed to have also contacted Sanjeev Gupta of the Liberty group last week. While Usha Martin is a lucrative option for JSW Steel, which is keen to have presence in the East, the Kalyani group could look to further consolidate its position in the domestic market with the buy.

A top source said while talks between Usha Martin and potential buyers have been taking place at an informal level, “some of those interested, including JSW officials, have visited also visited the UML facilities”."
28,2018-06-14,JSW,"In Wednesday’s session, Nifty made a half-hearted attempt to move past the 10,850 mark, which has been posing critical resistance to the index. In a session that remained largely rangebound and capped on the upside, the 50-pack came off from the high point of the day and settled with minor gains of 13.85 points, or 0.13 per cent.

We expect a quiet start to Thursday’s session, but just like the previous session, the 10,850 level and Nifty’s behaviour vis-à-vis this level needs to be watched. Nifty will have to move past this level in a convincing manner for any meaningful upward move to occur.

If it faces resistance at higher levels just like it happened in the previous session, it is likely to be pushed into some more consolidation.

The 10,890 and 10,945 levels will be immediate resistance for Nifty50 on Thursday, while supports will come in lower at 10,810 and 10,760 levels.




The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 63.0384 and it has reached its highest value in last 14 days, which is a bullish signal. It does not show any divergence from price. The daily MACD remains bullish even as it trades above the signal line. Apart from the black body that occurred on the candles, no significant formations were seen.

Going by pattern analysis, Nifty is making attempts to move past the pattern resistance that exists in form of falling trend line that emerges from 11,170 and subsequently joins the falling tops.

F&O data and lead indicators exhibit strong undercurrent and buoyant intent of the market. There are chances that though we might see some corrective swings given the current structure of the markets, but eventually Nifty is likely to move past the 10,850 mark, which has been posing important pattern resistance to the market.

We are also likely to see some volatility in trade and the session is likely to remain rangebound with limited downsides and underlying buoyant intent.

One should continue to guard profits at higher levels, but selective purchases may be made.

29,2018-06-14,JSW,"Bankrupt Monnet Power appears headed to liquidation with no bidder turning up on the final day to submit bids for expression of interest, which also raises questions about faith in the administration’s ability to resolve the stress in the sector, said two people familiar with the matter.

The Resolution Professional has called for a meeting with the Committee of Creditors on June. 19 to evaluate options which include going for another round of bidding, or wait for government’s action on transfer of dud loans to a bad bank, said those people who did not want to be identified.

Lenders from ICICI Bank to Axis Bank to the state-run Central Bank of India and others stare at a huge loss in the account. Monnet Power has received claims of Rs 7,652 crores to lenders, operational creditors and employees. Claims form lenders stands at Rs 5892 crore 

Monnet Power is an 88 percent subsidiary of Monnet Ispat, a steel producer which is also in receivership. The parent metals producer is being sold to JSW Steel which in partnership with private fund AION promised to pay Rs 3750 crore of Monnet Ispat’s Rs 10,300 crore.

The failure to attract bidders for Monnet Power also showcases how a delay in decision making by lenders could erode value of an asset sharply. Couple of year ago, JSW Energy had offered to acquire Monnet Power after it showed initial signs of distress due to cost overrun. But the deal was not conclusive since lenders were not willing to take a haircut following which JSW Energy dropped the plan to acquire it.



Thereafter lenders made several attempts to revive the company. Lenders led by IDFC Bank had swapped part of their debt for equity in 2016 in the hope that they would sell the equity to a new promoter and recover their money. The other lender of Monnet Power includes Bank of India, Axis bank, ICICI Bank, Corporation Bank, Dena Bank and Central Bank of India.

The development comes at a time when SBI is looking at resolution for 11 large distressed power companies. As per the proposal the unsustainable debt of the company would be swapped into equity and housed with another entity such as NTPC. Subsequently, once the project is complete lenders will sell their stake to interested parties. With no one showing interest in acquiring Monnet Power there is little hope that there would be buyers for other power companies identified by lenders under the SBI Samadhan scheme.

Worried about the distress in power sector, the Allahabad High Court ruled that a power company can’t be taken to bankruptcy court for not repaying loans unless it has been declared a wilful defaulter. According to the Association of Power Producers, about 70,000 MW of generation capacity faces the threat of liquidation due to the new RBI norms."

33,2018-06-15,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel has completed the acquisition of majority shares in the US-based steel plant Acero Junction Holdings for $80.85 million (approx Rs 550 crore) the company said in a notification to the stock exchange on Thursday. 

The company has acquired 83% of the shares of the the steel company in Ohio and the remaining 17% is in the process of transfer to the company on making the balance payments, JSW Steel said. After the closing adjustments take place, the enterprise value of the transaction will be $182.41 million (Rs 1,240 crore). JSW Steel will also take on Acero's debt of $101.56 million (close to Rs 690 crore). 

The acquisition will give the company a manufacturing presence. This has been the company's second major move in the US market; with another one being the investment of $500 million at its existing plates and pipe mills facility in Baytown, Texas to fully backward integrate it as well as increase its capacity utilisation to its full capacity of 1 MT. 

A month ago, the company also bought Italian steelmaker Aferpi for Rs 440 crore that will give the company a foothold in the European market after it earlier lost Ilva to ArcelorMittal. 

Back home, apart from Monnet ispat and Energy JSW Steel's plans to acquire distressed assets brought to sale under the newly constituted bankruptcy law have not met with much success. Bhushan Steel has been taken over by Tata Steel already while in Bhushan Power and Steel is still battling it out in the courts for acquisition between Tata Steel and Liberty House. 

Monnet Ispat and Energy is awaiting final nod from the National Company law Tribunal. JSW Steel is also in the fray to acquire Kolkata-based Usha Martin's specialty steel business with others like Tata Steel, Liberty House and Kalyani Steel."
32,2018-06-15,JSW,"JSW Infrastructure, the port operating arm of the JSW Group, aims to spend Rs 5,100 crore for capacity expansion till 2020, by which time it also aims for its maiden public issue of shares, its CEO said in a recent interview.


The company had in 2015 charted a five-year capex plan of Rs 10,000 crore. That was later optimised to Rs 8,800 crore of which it has already spent Rs 3,700 crore BVJK Sharma told ET.

The money will be spent in more than doubling its total annual cargo handling capacity to 200 million tons from 75 million tons.

Sharma said the ports business aims to end this financial year with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of Rs800 crore but with the group company expansions and resultant increase in business, may triple it to Rs2,400 crore by 2020. He also said the company aims to reach 70% utilisation levels at its faciltities, up from 40% now. These two benchmarks will make it IPO ready by December 2020, he added.

“In line with the other businesses of the group and the growth plans of steel, energy, cement, we are working with them to see how best we can provide logistics support to our own verticals..and then offer capacity to non-group players and sweat the assets that we create,” said Sharma. The company currently has three operating terminals: at Jaigarh and Dharamtar, Maharashtra and in Goa. The capacity at Jaigarh port will be doubled to 80 million tons, while the berth at Goa will be increased to 15 million tons. The Amba riverbed that has the Dharamtar port near JSW Steel’s Dolvi plant will be dredged to allow bigger vessels. There is also a fresh 50 million ton facility coming up at Paradip, Odisha which will spur the company’s third-party revenue.

The company is also looking at setting up a port city in Jaigarh, a dry port in Kolhapur and is looking at sites for greenfield ports in Odisha, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

Sharma said half of the planned capex will come from internal accruals while the remainder will be funded via debt.

The company’s plans closely follow its group companies’ expansion trajectory as most of its cargo—about 90%— comes from captive sources.

The group’s flagship venture - JSW Steel in May said it has a capital expenditure plan of Rs 44,000 crore by the end of March 2020, increasing the number from the earlier earmarked Rs 26,800 crore. It now aims to reach a production capacity of about 25 million tons in the next two years, up from its earlier aimed capacity of 23 million tons.

JSW Cement recently said it plans to increase production capacity in West Bengal to 3.6 million tons from 2.4 million tons besides setting up a captive power plant in the same location.

JSW Energy in May announced an increased capex plan of Rs 6,500 crore for its new electric vehicle venture.

Sharma however said that the new facilities at Jaigarh and Paradip will boost third party cargo for the ports. The company aims to have a 60:40 split between captive cargo and third party cargo in the next few years, up from the current split of 90:10."
31,2018-06-15,JSW,"Mumbai: Hong Kongheadquartered firm CLSA said the record low equity risk premium and the gap between earnings yield and the bond yields are making it cautious on the Indian equity market.

“The Nifty’s 8 per cent move off its Mar ’18 (2018) lows has come amidst rising bond yields. While the PE (price to earnings) has not touched a new high since then, the other relative value indicators — gap between earnings yield and bond yield and the risk premium are flashing red,” said CLSA.

The firm said the 10-year bond yield is unlikely to cool off this time around given the recent rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India, weak fiscal situation and a worsening inflation outlook. The 10-year benchmark bond yield breached 8 per cent recently—for the first time since December 2014.

A price-to-earnings multiple correction remains a strong possibility, said CLSA.

The firm added that the gap between bond yield and earnings yield is at a near record high at 2.2 per cent but history suggests that such gaps do not sustain.


BULLISH ON HEALTHCAREHealthcare is now an overweight sector in the portfolio and is now showing signs of investor sentiment bottoming out, said CLSA.

“Indian pharma sales in the US have stabilised sequentially and the commentary on pricing pressure has been improving. Valuations are reasonable in the sector,” said CLSA.

The firm has included Sun Pharmaceutical Industries in its model portfolio with a weightage of 2 percentage points and removed JSW Steel.

CLSA that the drug maker’s earnings have bottomed out in the financial year ended March with specialty monetisation underway and USFDA compliance problem behind it with the resolution of Halol plant issue. The firm, which has a ‘buy’ rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of ?600, expects the company’s recurring earnings to double over FY18 and FY20."
35,2018-06-18,JSW,"State-owned miner NMDC and Karnataka’s steelmakers are at odds over the pricing of iron ore produced in the state.

NMDC has cut production in Karnataka after companies, including JSW Steel which buys 90% of its output, stopped purchases at the state’s iron ore e-auctions.

JSW Steel has opted to buy the ore from Odisha, where it is cheaper. As a result, NMDC has been able to sell only 25% of its output through e-auctions in the state this financial year.

The miner is expected to approach the Supreme Court to seek permission to sell its output outside the state. JSW Steel, the biggest consumer of iron ore from NMDC in Karnataka, said the miner should lower its price, which is about Rs 2,000 per tonne higher than Odisha iron ore, instead of asking the Supreme Court to allow it export.

“Pricing has to be competitive and market dynamics have to come into play,” Seshagiri Rao, joint MD at JSW Steel, told ET.

Even though the steelmaker is sourcing from Odisha, freight charges push up the final cost of the mineral."

41,2018-06-20,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: The highly-leveraged balance sheets of Indian companies, which caused concern among investors and deterred fresh capital infusion over the past few years, are gradually showing signs of recovery. The net debt of India Inc relative to the operating profit before depreciation (net debt/EBITDA ratio) was at a four year low in FY18.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s analysis of the BSE500 companies excluding banks, finance and software companies, net Debt-EBIDTA ratio fell to 2.5 in FY18 from 3.3 in FY15. This was largely due to higher increase in the EBITDA compared with the increase in debt.

The ratio of net debt (total debt less cash and equivalents) and EBITDA is widely used to measure the debt paying ability of a company. A ratio below three is considered healthy. The total debt of the sample increased 8 per cent to Rs 20.2 lakh crore. During the same period, EBITDA increased by 35 per cent to Rs 8.04 lakh crore.

The deleveraging was mainly driven by the improved earnings of the commodity companies, thanks to the reversal in the global commodity prices. This is also expected to revive the capex cycle.

The net debt-EBITDA ratio of the BSE500 metals and mining companies in FY18 was less than one compared with 3.7 in FY16. Thanks to improved earnings, all major metal and mining companies including Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel and Hindalco have given a strong capex guidance (including expansion through acquisitions) over the last one year. These companies together are expected to incur capex of over Rs 70,000 crore in FY19.

Similar trends are observed in other heavily-indebted industries such as real estate where the ratio fell to 4.6 from 6.2 three years ago; for textiles, the ratio dropped to 2.6 from 2.9 and for the power companies, it was marginally down to five from 5.4 by a similar comparison.

The only sector which has seen increased debt concerns is the telecom sector. Major contributors to this include Reliance communications followed by Idea."

The company had in March announced plans to pump in $500 million to modernise its Texas unit. The latest announcement thus takes JSW’s overall investment blueprint for the US market, to produce American melt and manufactured steel, to up to US$ 1 billion. The proposed investment will be made in two phases at its Ohio steel manufacturing facility, an official statement on Friday said. In phase one, JSW will revamp & restart the electric arc furnace and the slab caster, and modernize the hot strip mill. The proposed investment including the cost of acquisition, is expected to be approximately US$250 million. In phase two, depending upon the economic viability & prevailing market conditions, JSW will evaluate the possibility of adding another electric arc furnace as well as additional manufacturing equipment at the hot strip mill to make the Ohio facility a fully integrated unit with 3 MTPA capacity. The proposed investment in phase two could be in the range of up to US$250 million, subject to feasibility studies & necessary approvals.

The Nifty50 index managed to hold its support at the 10,700 level and headed towards a fresh weekly high of 10,837 on Friday. It formed a Bullish Engulfing pattern on the daily scale, as it covered all the losses of last session and closed above 10,800.

The index visited the entire trading range of the week in just one session, led by strong momentum in last hour of trade. On the weekly chart, the index formed a Doji candle similar to the Bullish Pin Bar, as it closed near its weekly open with a long lower shadow.

Pattern analysis suggests the decline got bought into and now Nifty has to continue to hold above 10,770 and 10,835 levels to extend its move towards 10,888 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside, the 10,700 level is likely to act as a major support.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at strike price 10,700 followed by 10,600 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900. There was significant Put writing at 10,700 and 10,800 levels, while Call unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. Options data suggested a shift in trading range between 10,750 and 10,920 levels.

India VIX fell 3.43 per cent to 12.02 level.

Bank Nifty witnessed strong momentum in last hour of the session and saw a highest close in 14 sessions above its multiple hurdle at 26,750. It formed a strong Bullish candle and needs to hold above 26,750 to extend its move towards 27,000 and then 27,150 – 27,200 zone, while supports are seen at 26,250 level.

50,2018-06-23,JSW,"JSW Steel is building a captive power plant at Salem. The industrial steam turbine being set up needed oil sealing rings, a seemingly small component but a crucial one for the running of the unit. JSW Group’s procurement team made inquiries from their usual suppliers and were told that in a best case scenario, they could manufacture the oil sealing rings in 4-6 months.

This was a typical situation faced often by the industry where delay in sourcing of a small components often lead to derailing commissioning timeline. But something different happened this time. “We were looking at options to compress time and Siemens offered to make the same component for us through 3D printing,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at JSW Steel. “We told them to do it and they delivered it in a matter of days. We tried it as an experiment and we were successful,” he told ET.

3D printing, or additive manufacturing — the process of building three-dimensional solid objects from a digital design using additive methods — has yet to pick up in the country but experts see significant potential. “The market for 3D printing in industry is latent and is hard to define. It is not a market where the product is ready for commercial purposes; it is pretty much in the development stage,” said Prashant Jain, country division lead - power generation services division, at Siemens India.




“Right now, the technology is used more for developing pilots but going forward more and more parts will be printed for machineries in plants; even those which are obsolete and the customer is looking for components to replace them,” he said. Market research company 6Wresearch has projected Indian 3D printer market to be worth $79 million, or about Rs 535 crore, by 2021, driven by domestic production, low cost of manufacturing, and increasing penetration across various applications, along with ‘Make-in-India’ initiative.

The global market for 3D printing is seen growing to $20 billion by 2020, which will still be only a fraction of the entire tooling market at the time. Global consultants McKinsey believes the overall economic impact created by additive manufacturing (AM) could be much higher, reaching $100 billion to $250 billion by 2025, if adoption across industries continues at today’s rate. Most of that potential will come from the aerospace and defence, automotive, medical, and consumer goods industries.


THE TECHNOLOGY
3D printing, or additive manufacturing (AM), could be a game changer. The technology “prints” or assembles a three dimensional object layer by layer, where each layer is like a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the object being made. An energy source like laser or electron beam is used with materials such as metal, polymer or resin in a regulated environment to convert a 3D design into object, one micro layer at a time.

The traditional methods of manufacturing are based on subtractive manufacturing, which entails cutting out and hollowing out a piece of metal or polymer, and are, therefore, restricted by the tools available, while a 3D printer has the flexibility of manufacturing several types of designs.

“AM can be used for mass customisation; for instance, a customer would be able to buy shoes that are perfect fit and customised for him and not just a best fit,” said Ajay Parikh, business head at Wipro3D. “The technology also gives flexibility and ability to make complex geometry that allows designer to keep experimenting with designs. Today, if you are making jet engine components for a company, you don’t have to commit to a design as the only option. The freedom and speed in AM can help alter the design in the next engine, and you can come up with functionally better designs,” he said. Wipro3D focuses on metal-based AM.


BIG BOYS VS STARTUPS
Technology majors such as Siemens, Wipro and HP Inc, among others, have spotted the opportunity in this space in India. HP launched its 3D printing solutions in the country earlier this year, almost a year after its international foray, and is eyeing collaborations with the government to expand the scope of business.

Wipro3D launched its state-of-the-art solution and experience centre for metal 3D printing in Bengaluru in March. Startups, too, have entered the market, primarily by offering 3D printing services such as designing, prototyping and other related services, often collaborating with some bigger players. These companies are catering to several industries like healthcare, jewellery, automotive and consumer products.


ROAD AHEAD
Challenges are largely the same for big companies and startups. “We started our company in 2013 and being one of the first company to even talk about this technology, we thought that in five years we could be selling few hundred thousand machines,” said Arvind Nadig, cofounder of Brahma3, which launched the country’s first locally made 3D printer. “But the awareness in the market is really low. It is not easy to set up in India because investments are not coming by as volumes are still low,” he said. However, despite the challenges, Nadig is bullish as there is good traction from defence and education sectors.

All the sector executives ET spoke to said they have to invest a lot of time and effort to convince potential customers about the reliability of the technology, strength of the product, and the overall financial benefit — even if the product cost is higher, the delivery time is shorter. JSW is impressed with the technology as a customer. “We are now looking at this technology seriously,” said Rao who is also the group chief financial officer at JSW Group. “We are planning to check with suppliers at the time of placing the order for machinery itself if it is possible to use 3D printing for some components which can give a savings in time,” he said."
51,2018-06-24,JSW,"After trading initially in the red in the first half of the session and with modest gains after that, the Indian equity market saw a sharp upsurge in the last hour of the trade on Friday. The benchmark index Nifty50 saw a sharp upmove and finally ended the day gaining 80.75 points or 0.75 per cent. This was mainly led by short covering as the Nifty futures ended with premium and with shedding of net open interest.

As we approach Monday and also the beginning of the expiry week of the current derivative series, the opening levels and the behavior of the Nifty vis-à-vis the level of 10,850 continues to remain very critically important. Sooner the Nifty moves past this level, larger will be the chances of a sustainable up move in coming days. 

Any drift or failure to move past this level for too long will make the Nifty vulnerable once again to volatility and profit taking bouts.

The levels of 10,850 and 10,895 will act as important resistance levels for Monday. Supports come in at 10,780 and 10,740 zones.



The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 57.5545. It remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The Daily MACD still remains bearish while trading below its signal line. No significant formation was observed on Candles.

If we have a look at pattern analysis, Nifty is still in a broad symmetrical triangle formation and is moving further into the apex. Also, in the process, it is continuing to vehemently resist to the falling trend line which joins the high of 11,170 with the subsequent lower tops.

Overall, if we analyze the broader picture, Nifty did not correct significantly whenever it met with a pattern resistance. Instead, it chose to consolidate in a capped range with some amount of volatility ingrained in it. We may see this behavior of the Nifty as its underlying strength. However, until a resistance is breached on the upside, it gets little speculative to anticipate a breakout unless few indicators point towards such anticipated breakouts. We still advice to exercise caution and keep exposures at modest levels. Shorts should be avoided and major directional call can be taken if the Nifty moves past and closes above 10,850-mark with conviction.

55,2018-06-26,JSW,"India’s competitive steel leader-board is led by the Tatas and the JSW Group. In their midst, Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is often described as a producer with a high cost base. But it could surprise the Street by its positive performance in the coming two years.

SAIL’s operating profits in the latest quarter were the highest in the last seven years and the management has guided for an aggressive 28 per cent production growth, along with margin expansions, for the current year.

After the recent completion of its capex cycle, albeit after a five-year delay, the steel producer now is in a sweet spot to capitalise on the improving demand supply situation. While demand is expected to grow at 7-8 per cent , other large players such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel are operating at around 90 per cent of capacity.

Steel imports, especially from China, are also on the way down due to improving global demand and government measures. With an increased capacity of 21MT, and industry supply limitations, the management has guided that production would be at 18MT in FY19 (with acceleration in the second half) against 14MT in FY17.

Concerns over high costs, which include higher staff expenses vis-à-vis the industry, are also receding. Around 5,000 employees should retire in the coming year, and a similar number next year. This is expected to bring down staff costs by 13 per cent in the next two years.

Employee expense to sales at 15 per cent in FY18 was almost twice that of the industry average. SAIL also has its own iron ore mines, giving it an edge over peers in an improving demand scenario. For coking coal, it depends on imported coking coal (70 per cent ) and remaining from Coal India, prices of which have remained range bound for the last one year.

In the March quarter, SAIL did an adjusted EBIDTA per tonne of Rs7,000 against Rs 3,800 in the preceding quarter. This was the highest since FY11, thanks to a ramp up in production and firm steel prices. This is expected to inch higher, given further ramp up in production and higher steel realisations. Steel prices in the current quarter are 4per cent higher than the March quarter.



SAIL could Surprise Street

Also, with the capex cycle over, SAIL’s debt has peaked. With improving earnings, debt and interest outgo should reduce drastically in the coming two years from Rs 42,000 crore in the end of FY18.

At the current price of Rs 81, SAIL’s stock does not reflect the positives, as the Street is sceptical of such aggressive ramp up in production. Analysts are building in a ramp up of only 2 MT against 4 MT as guided by the management. But if the management delivers on what it has said, the stock could surprise positively.

Based on management’s production guidance and an average EBIDTA per tonne of Rs8,000 for FY19 (could further improve to Rs8,500- Rs9,000 in FY20), the company’s stock is trading at 5.6 times FY19 estimated EV/EBIDTA. This is much cheaper than other players that trade at 7 to 8 times. In the past, SAIL’s stock has also traded in the band of EV to EBIDTA of 8 to 10 times."
59,2018-06-27,JSW,"MUMBAI: Indian steelmakers are unlikely to feel the pinch of the recent double whammy inflicted on them by the safeguard investigation by European Commission and the US higher import tariffs, thanks largely to a spurt in the domestic demand for the alloy.

The ripple effect of the safeguard investigation on steel ordered by the European Commission has reduced Indian steel exports to Europe since March.

With steel demand picking up, Indian steel producers are replenishing inventories to meet rising local demand, giving them an option to mitigate the loss in exports to the US and the EU, as Indian steel loses its value proposition after the imposition of higher import levies.

The US, under the Trump administration startled the world in March by imposing a 25 per cent tariff on import of steel into the country, thus provoking the European Commission, that manages day to day business for the European Union, to order its own safeguard investigation on steel products to counter any dumping that may come from steel exporters to the US looking for new markets.

Since then, Indian steel exports to the EU have declined by 25 per cent according to industry experts. The investigation is supposed to pan over nine months from March but caution has already set in.

“Initiation of safeguard measures has slowed down exports to the EU as people have turned cautious in buying and selling,” said Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel.

“However, domestic demand has been buoyant which is why the industry has been re-orienting produce to feed the domestic demand,” Acharya added.

Essar Steel, which exports about 25,000 tonne steel per month to Europe, has also seen its exports to the EU decline by 10 per cent since the safeguard investigation, said Ranjan Dhar, chief marketing officer at Essar Steel, but said rising domestic demand has managed to offset the decline in exports.

Cushion Steel Makers

While US accounts for only 2 per cent of India’s steel exports with Indian exports to the US increasing by 16 per cent between 2011 and 2017 , according to data by European Commission, imports of iron and steel from India into the EU make up for 7.5 per cent of all products imported.

“With most steel producing countries adopting trade protection policies to support their domestic producers, an export dependent strategy is no more viable for Indian steel producers’ said Anjani Agrawal, Global Steel Leader, EY. “Indian producers will rather focus on value added products to substitute imports and also develop new applications to expand domestic demand” Agrawal said, adding that an expanding domestic market will yield better margins than competing with low cost producers like Russia, China etc. in the commodity part of their business.

Steel demand is on the rise powered by the growth in the automobile industry as well as infrastructure spending by the government feeding it. While the first few months of the current fiscal year have been good, monsoon is typically a lax season for steel with construction work coming to a halt. However, flat products that are used in automobiles and consumer durables will keep the steel mills running.

Reduction in exports was noticed for the last 4-5 months. According to Joint Plant Committee (JPC) the institution, which collects data on the Indian iron and steel industry, finished steel exports fell 30 per cent from 6.16 MT in January to about 4.30 MT in May this year. During the same period, consumption increased 9 per cent from 7.63 MT to 8.33 MT."
63,2018-06-27,JSW,"JSW Steel today announced plans to invest Rs 7,500 crore until March 2020 to increase the production capacity at its Vijayanagar facility in Karnataka to 13 million tonnes per annum (mtpa).

The plant, which currently has a 12-mtpa capacity, is the largest single-location steel manufacturing unit in India, the company claimed in a release.

""We plan to expand the steel manufacturing capacity of the Vijayanagar unit in Karnataka to 13 mtpa by FY20,"" the release said, adding, the capacity expansion and project upgrades will entail a capital investment of Rs 7,500 crore until March 2020.

JSW Steel said its current project to revamp and upgrade capacity of blast furnace-3 at the Vijayanagar plant is on track, which will improve hot metal availability.

It will also modify and enhance capacity of its steel melting shop, the flat and long products mills, along with allied facilities to utilise this additional hot metal.

The company also plans to set-up a 1.5-mtpa coke oven plant in Karnataka to bridge the current and expected gaps in coke availability, which is likely to be commissioned by March 2020, according to the release.

It expects the coke oven unit to provide significant cost savings over the long term.

62,2018-06-27,JSW,"By Swansy Afonso and Bhuma Shrivastava

India’s top steelmaker JSW Steel Ltd. says it’s scouting for more deals in the U.S. and Europe to expand its global footprint, betting that vibrant growth will underpin demand in overseas markets and complement a boom at home that’s seen the mill ramp up local output.

“What is driving us is that, inherently, we find it is an interesting opportunity because the U.S. economy is doing well” and the investment cycle looks positive, Joint Managing Director Seshagiri Rao said in an interview. After meeting half its target for 10 million tons of capacity overseas, the steelmaker is now looking to buy more facilities, Rao said in Mumbai.

While the global industry has been roiled this year by tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on some flows of steel into the world’s top economy, mills are still enjoying benign conditions. Worldwide production hit a record in May as capacity utilization climbed, according to the World Steel Association. Against that backdrop, Mumbai-based JSW has been busy: after announcing a move to triple output at its Texas plant, it snapped up another U.S. facility in Ohio, taking total planned investment in the country to $1 billion.

For Rao, the commercial lure isn’t dependent on the trade moves, which he said are transitory. “The U.S. economy -- notwithstanding the trade remedial measures which the U.S. government has taken -- is quite buoyant, demand is picking up,” he said on Tuesday. “It is not because tariffs were introduced in the U.S. or somewhere else, that is why we wanted to invest.”


Bloomberg
Still, Ritesh Shah, an analyst at Investec Capital Services Ltd., said JSW’s decisions were sound in the context of the curbs. “It does make sense to have manufacturing bases in U.S. and Europe in an increasingly protectionist world,” said Shah. “One, it gives JSW Steel access to markets which would otherwise be difficult to get into. Secondly, it ensures you are closer to your customers.”

JSW Steel shares have soared more than 60 percent over the past year, aided by record output and profit. To meet local demand, the company plans a $6 billion capacity expansion in India. In May, it made an acquisition in Italy, and it has another purchase awaiting approval from India’s company law tribunal.

As part of its trade agenda, Trump imposed a tariff of 25 percent on imported steel aiming to restrict a flood of cheap foreign supplies. While that’s helped to trigger some plant restarts, it’s alienated trading partners, and may spur tit-for-tat moves, with Canada now said to be is preparing its own measures.

JSW’s decision to plow more funds into Ohio caught the attention of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, one the key architects in the administration for its moves on steel as well as potential curbs on a host of other items. In a tweet, Ross lauded the “investments made in the great state of Ohio.”

U.S. Production
U.S. steel output has been picking up. Production in March topped 7.3 million tons, the highest monthly total since late 2014, according to World Steel Association data. The economy is about to enter the 10th year of expansion, and growth may reach 4 percent this quarter, the fastest since 2014.

In Europe, ArcelorMittal is selling assets in Italy, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Romania and Macedonia to meet regulatory requirements enabling the world’s top producer to take over Italy’s Ilva SpA, for which a JSW-led consortium had also bid. Rao denied reports the company may make an offer for Arcelor’s Galati plant in Romania, while declining to comment on the others.

JSW Steel produced 15.8 million tons of crude steel in the year to March 31, up 26 percent from a year ago. The company has said it plans to boost capacity by more than a third to about 25 million tons a year by March 2020.

“If someone is spending a billion dollars for a million ton, we spend only $500 million,” Rao said. “On capital-allocation side, if we are cautious -- whether I invest in U.S. or Europe -- then my returns always remain accretive not withstanding the cycles,” he said."
61,2018-06-27,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel has said it will increase the annual steel manufacturing capacity at its Vijayanagar Works to 13 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by March 2020. The capacity expansion and upgrade projects will entail a capital investment of Rs 7,500 crore until March 2020, an official statement said

At 12 mtpa currently, JSW Vijayanagar Works is the largest single location steel manufacturing unit in the country. The expansion project at JSW Vijayanagar Works includes the company’s current project to revamp and upgrade capacity of Blast Furnace-3 which will improve hot metal availability. The company will also modify and enhance capacity of its Steel Melting Shop, the flat and long products mills, along with allied facilities to utilize this additional hot metal. 

With these projects targeted to be completed by March 2020, the crude steel capacity of JSW Vijayanagar Works unit will increase to 13mtpa, an official statement said.

66,2018-06-28,JSW,"Here’s a lowdown on top macro triggers that may move market on Thursday. This report was compiled from agency feeds.



India-US Ties Strike A Wrong Chord

India and US ties touched a new low on Wednesday following Washington's decision to postpone 2+2 (Foreign + Defence Ministers dialogue) scheduled for July 6 after Delhi reportedly refused to toe the Trump administration's line on cutting down on all oil supplies from the Persian Gulf country. This was the second time that USA has postponed the dialogue with India. US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday it was important India cut its dependence on Iranian oil and said the United States would work to allow India to use an Iranian port as corridor to Afghanistan. Indo-US ties are also being tested over defence supplies from Russia including S-400 missile defence system and impending sanctions if India went ahead with the purchase. 


Oil Prices Rally
Oil prices rallied on Wednesday, with the US benchmark settling at its highest since 2014 as domestic crude supplies notched their biggest weekly drop of the year so far. Traders also showed concerns over US threats to sanction countries that don’t stop importing oil from Iran by November 4. In India, the Cabinet has raised the price of ethanol that state oil firms purchase, and approved setting up of new strategic petroleum reserves in Odisha and Karnataka. 


Rupee Hovers Near 19-month Low


 The rupee slipped to a 19-month low on Wednesday, hit by higher oil prices and trade war concerns that could spark another bout of capital outflows for Asia’s third-largest economy. It fell to 68.67 the lowest level since November 30, 2016 before erasing losses to close at 68.63 against the dollar. The Reserve Bank of India is said to have intervened to stop the local unit’s sharp fall against the dollar. It is estimated to have sold dollars about $700-800 million through state-owned banks, dealers said. 



Govt No to Bad Bank Idea

The government has rejected the idea of a bad bank and is at best lukewarm to an asset reconstruction company (ARC) that will take over state-run banks’ toxic loans as it’s not keen on diverting more of taxpayers’ money toward their resolution in this manner. The government thinks the resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) can tackle the bigger bad loans and there are multiple ARCs already functioning in the country.



Trade War Bonanza?



 In a strategic move, China plans to reduce tariffs on more than 8,500 goods, including chemicals, farm products and metals from India and some other Asian countries. The move is seen as a part of its ongoing trade war with the US. Most items are those on which Beijing has slapped higher tariffs when they are imported from the US. Meanwhile, renewed uncertainty regarding the US stance on Chinese investments in American technology companies, roiled the US markets on Wednesday.




Rs 2000-cr GST Evasion in 2 Months
The GST investigation wing has detected tax evasion of over Rs 2,000 crore in two months, and data analysis reveals that only 1% of over 1.11 crore registered businesses pay 80% of the taxes. CBIC member John Joseph said alike small businesses who are making mistakes while filing GST returns, multinationals and big corporates too have slip-ups.

Indian companies are bracing for a possible flood of steel imports should the U.S. and China follow through on their threats about a trade war.

Duties imposed by the U.S. would trigger “trade diversion” from other steel makers, who would then dump their products in India, said Bhaskar Chatterjee, secretary general at Indian Steel Association, in an email. As much as 80 million tons of steel -- or 17 percent of global exports, based on World Steel Association data -- could be diverted to markets such as India, according to Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the country’s top mill, JSW Steel Ltd.

The comments highlight the uncertainties surrounding global trade ahead of July 6, when President Donald Trump’s tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to kick in, a move that China has vowed to retaliate against. India stands out as an attractive destination because it’s the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The country has also much riding on the health of its steel industry because it’s expected to overtake Japan as the world’s second-largest steel-producing nation as soon as this year.

Other steelmakers have voiced concerns about a looming trade war.

Thyssenkrupp AG’s Italian unit said it will take a $220 million sales hit if the European Union doesn’t take measures.

Through the Thyssenkrupp deal, the Tatas are the latest to leave their imprint on the industry in the continent where LN Mittal, Sajjan Jindal, and Liberty House’s Sanjeev Gupta have previously shopped for giant mills making the primary infrastructure alloy.

ArcelorMittal previously acquired the 10-million tonne Ilva, a troubled Italian steelmaker. In May this year, Jindal acquired the 2-MTPA Aferpi, Italy’s second largest steelmaker, with plans to make it bigger. Gupta of Liberty House has also been making acquisitions in France and in the UK. With tariff walls being raised, steelmakers are trying to scale these duty structures by buying into advanced markets in Europe, driven by their improved understanding of the steel market over the past decade.

June has been a good month for Indians buying into Europe’s steel industry. It was in June 2006 that Lakshmi Mittal acquired Luxembourg-based Arcelor in a $33-billion deal. Combining it with Mittal Steel, it went on to become the world’s largest steel company, ArcelorMittal. It is exactly 12 years later that Tata Steel forged a 50:50 joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG of Germany. Two of Europe’s largest steel companies now have Indian owners and are under desi control.

“This is a very positive step for Indian entrepreneurship. Indian steel entrepreneurs have acquired the required competence and expertise to run global businesses. Steel is a global commodity and in this business, India is now the second largest producer. They have matured and they now have the confidence to deal in the global arena,” Anjani Agrawal, global steel leader, E&Y said. Corporate watchers say globally there are mainly two buyers of industrial assets, the Indians or the Chinese. And, it is the Indians who are moving quickly ahead of the Chinese to acquire steel assets in Europe.

“Any large player would be aware and evaluate options for growth, which include opportunities in India and also elsewhere in the world in the form of stressed assets,” Agrawal added. He cited the example of LN Mittal, who was among the first to display Indian entrepreneurial skills in turning around struggling steel businesses globally. With Ilva, Mittal has proved that his appetite for good assets remains the same.

Industry experts believe Indians are ideally placed to ride the current wave of consolidation sweeping across Europe’s steel industry. Elsewhere in the world, the Chinese are cutting down production by closing polluting old mills, while the US steel industry has been grappling with low productivity and production cuts. The US has only recently started looking at revamping and adding new facilities, which includes an investment of $1 billion in two units in the US from JSW Steel: The investments even prompted a tweet from US president Trump.

It is also linked to a fundamental change in the cost structure of the steel industry. “Steel is no longer a local industry like it used to be even a decade back. It is now a globally competitive industry,” said Tridibesh Mukherjee, former deputy MD of Tata Steel. The cost dynamics in the industry have undergone a complete change since 2008 when raw materials accounted for 30% of cost in 2008 with internal costs having a 70% share. Now, raw materials take up 70% of production costs while internal costs account for less than 30%. And, there is little room to play around with the 30% share. This is prompting Indians to look at Europe as a manufacturing base.

“Take Jaguar-Land Rover, for instance. Indians have shown remarkable entrepreneurial skills in manufacturing, unlike the Chinese who have focused on achieving number one status in manufacturing at home,” he added. Investing in Europe makes sense for Indians who remain net exporters of steel since demand has not grown in step with capacity. “With trade barriers and tariff walls coming up in Europe and elsewhere there is need to protect the market. This can only be done by investing internally,” said Malay Mukherjee, one of the key lieutenants who helped build LN Mittal’s global steel empire.

“So large Indian steelmakers are now buying into these export markets.” Also, buying into brownfield European steel assets is considerably less expensive compared to putting up a green-field steel plant in India due to delays in land acquisition and approvals. “If a 2-million tonne plant can be bought at $50 million, a similar size capacity would require an investment of nearly $2 billion in India without counting the delays,” Malay Mukherjee said. The other advantage is access to technology and advanced products like high-tensile steels in consumer sectors like automobiles.

With India emerging as an auto manufacturing hub, this technology can be very useful for Indian steelmakers, given the new norms in auto manufacturing. Thyssenkrupp’s value added steels portfolio is among the best in grade particularly in automotives, and is preferred by nationalistic German automakers like Mercedes and BMW. A lot of that learning will eventually come to India. After all, as Tridibesh Mukherjee pointed out: “A merger is not about the hardware alone. It is also about the people and the software.”"

4,2018-07-04,JSW,"Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, tells ET Now that consumption pattern improves in a year when monsoon is good and there are large MSP hikes. Discretionary spending improves, specifically in terms of rural and semi-urban economies.Edited excerpts: 


Prem Watsa of Fairfax Financial Holdings has expressed confidence that if the PSU banks were to be privatised, he would be very keen to take them over. What is your view on these banks?
There are two aspects: one, in terms of the core fundamentals for these banks and the regulatory changes that we are witnessing in terms of asset resolutions. Second element is valuations. What we have seen over the last so many quarters in terms of first the IBC coming through; the next proposal has just come through in terms of an AMC. A large number of public sector banks are still reeling under pressure both in terms of recognition of quality on their balance sheet and at the same time a large part of the public sector banks are coming under the PCA rule. 

Credit growth for these banks is going to be very difficult. At the same time, the balance sheet expansion and the capital adequacy ratios probably are not the right elements for a lot of these banks, specifically in the midcap and smallcap universe. 

Again, asset quality pressures and the provisioning can continue. There is obviously provisioning related to NCLT. Valuations are obviously very cheap. On a price to book parameter, you take the biggest name right from SBI to the smallest banks and the valuations continue to be extremely cheap compared to their private sector counterparts. The inherent risk and the headwinds that the markets perceive that these banks can still go through over the next two to three quarters to say the least, still leaves a bias towards the private sector banks. 

Large retail private sector banks like HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Bank are growing their balance sheets very strongly. Even on the asset quality side, a large part of their recognition in terms of corporate retail lending banks have probably improved. So, the retail lending has improved, the corporate stress has largely got recognised and though price to book might be little bit expensive, the bias stays towards the private side at this point of time.


The Cabinet cleared the MSP hikes today. Investment wise, is this of material significance?
 Markets have been gearing up on expectations of large MSP hikes. At the same time, there are concerns that if the hikes are substantial, what kind of an impact will that have on inflation and in terms of controlling of the fiscal deficit. Those are two things that the exchequer needs to probably balance or counter balance.

But a large element in terms of MSP hikes going through and the assumption that the monsoons are equally good this fiscal is predicted. The consumption patterns will definitely improve. Historically, in a year where monsoons are doing better along with expectations of larger MSP hikes, discretionary spending obviously improves, specifically in terms of the rural and the semi-urban economies. 

Having said that, the government’s spending programme in terms of rural infrastructure and rural consumption is expected to grow multi-fold as that is going to get front loaded as well. So, rural themes or rural discretionary spending patterns are going to determine a lot of volume growth in consumer staples among FMCG companies. You are probably going to see a spike in autos and even paint and cement consumption will go up because kutcha houses will start becoming more pucca in terms of cement outlook. Asbestos sheet plays actually are doing well. There are a whole host of plays that can actually do well along with the usual plays of agrochemicals and anything related to farm and farm equipment.


Do you like the metals pack even now after the rally or would you rather book profits given what is expected of commodity prices in the near term? 
It was a fabulous year for metal companies, both ferrous as well as non-ferrous in the year gone by. The threat of trade wars is driving LME prices lower. In that sense the expectations of dumping of a lot of Chinese stuff worldwide ex-US is probably causing that amount of pain. From an immediate near-term perspective, the kind of headwinds these metal companies might face can be very profound. 

Having said that, the steel players which are domestically driven at this point of time still are in a very good position. The numbers through our channel checks still suggest that they are holding up in terms of expectations of volumes sustaining for the steel companies. The input costs obviously had an impact on EBITDA and the EBITDA per tonne which they reported in the last two quarters. 

But a large part of the impact of the input cost is probably stabilising now on expectations of passing that through to consumers. The volume growth and realisations growth should give leverage on their balance sheets and EBITDA multiples. The demand outlook still looks extremely robust. 

JSW Steel, Tata Steel still are hold for us. A contra bet can be Steel Authority because a large part of their capex is behind them. What they have reported in terms of their bottom line losses can easily reverse as the leverage element gets played on their balance sheet. The number of semis on their product list is also reducing. The products mix is improving and that can give earnings upgrade as well. So, Tata Steel can be a contra bet with the long-term perspective.


Do you believe there is merit in adding further weightage to IT as well as pharmaceuticals in your portfolio right now?
The upward movement has been quite stupendous for both these sectors but a large element in terms of where the markets find safety at this point of time remains in these two sectors. The other element in terms of pharma specifically is a lot of concerns that were raised in terms of USFDA and pricing pressures that has probably played out in terms of earnings downgrades. A lot of resolution has actually started coming through and a lot of these companies have invested very heavily on R&D for creating niche pipelines.

The niche speciality pipeline is something which is going to differentiate the larger pharma players from the smaller ones. So the niche players are obviously going to still have the earnings benefit over the next few quarters. Obviously. the earnings trickle down in terms of upgrades, will start happening from the second half because the first half will still be a little bit patchy in terms of reported numbers as well as margins which can still get squeezed because of pricing issues. 

But as these drugs start getting approvals over the next few quarters, earnings should show a steady improvement. Sun Pharma for example had already indicated in their concall a double digit revenue growth. The resolution of their issue with Halol facility is obviously going to propel earnings growth. You are probably seeing other players including Lupin, Cipla having a very strong pipeline. Even Aurobindo Pharma has a strong injectable pipeline. 

Select pharma names obviously look attractive from a long-term perspective. For IT in general, my own sense is that the kind of earnings growth that one really expects in dollar and constant currency terms will show a gradual improvement because BFSI has been the laggard for the sector. As discretionary spending patterns start improving, BFSI will start contributing more meaningfully. 

The EBIT margins have stabilised and so has the attrition levels. Utilisations are going up, the onsite offshore mix probably improving for these players. Though the element of wage hikes in Q1-Q2 cannot be ruled out, the second half in my opinion can be equally strong. 

Select players within top tier IT space and even some niche midcap players probably look attractive but the logic here has to be to buy in a staggered manner because the run up has been quite sharp."

6,2018-07-05,JSW,"Locked in a direct fight to acquire Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal today sought disqualification of Russia's VTB Capital-backed NuMetal Ltd, alleging that the firm was acting in concert with delinquent promoters of Essar group but the NCLAT hearing the case did not agree to its contention.

When first bids for loan defaulter Essar Steel were called in February, Rewant owned 25 per cent in Mauritius-based investment vehicle NuMetal. VTB Group bought out Aurora Trust to cure its ineligibility as bankruptcy rules disqualify owners of distressed assets from bidding for those assets in the insolvency process.

At a hearing before a two-member bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for ArcelorMittal, said ""NuMetal and Rewant Ruia are alter ego of each other. They both are the same.""

He alleged that the two are acting in concert with each other.

The NCLAT bench posed several probing questions, including whether a company can be considered to be an alter-ego of its shareholder - especially when such minority shareholder is neither in management or control of the company (NuMetal).

It observed that question of disqualification of NuMetal on the ground that one of its minority shareholders is related to promoters of Essar requires substantiation based on law.

The NCLAT also observed that allegations of NuMetal acting in concert with the promoters of ESIL cannot be based on general analysis and needs be substantiated with legal grounds in accordance with law.

The NCLAT is hearing cross-petitions filed by NuMetal and ArcelorMittal challenging each other's eligibility to bid for Essar Steel which is being auctioned after the company defaulted on payment of Rs 51,800 crore loans to lenders.

NuMetal wants ArcelorMittal disqualified because it was the promoter of loan defaulting companies, Uttam Galva Steel and KKS Petron. The world's largest steelmaker says it has paid Rs 7,000 crore of loans of Uttam Galva Steel to cure its ineligibility.

Arguments before the NCLAT today remained inconclusive and hearing would resume on July 9.

""Today's argument was about why ArcelorMittal believes NuMetal should be ineligible...,"" a spokesperson of ArcelorMittal told over the phone.

The counsel in his argument said there is a connection between all three and Section 29 A of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC) does not allow connected parties to bid for any stresses asset, the person said.

The NCLAT had on May 22 ordered status quo on insolvency of Essar Steel for two months as it admitted petitions of Numetal and ArcelorMittal over the bidding eligibility.

ArcelorMittal and NuMetal put in a second round of bid in April after the first round of bids were opined to be invalid due to the delinquent promoter connection.

In the second round, NuMetal says it has offered over Rs 37,000 crore for Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal is, however, opposed the opening of the second round of bids and sought only the first round of bids to be considered.

In the second round of bidding, mining baron Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources joined the race. JSW Steel joined NuMetal in place of Rewant for the bid."

8,2018-07-08,JSW,"The session on Friday remained much rangebound wherein the Nifty oscillated in the 40-point range. It remained in much capped range and gave up some of its gains in the last hour of the trade. The index settled the Friday’s day with modest gains of 22.90 points or 0.21 per cent.

The significant behavior of the markets throughout the previous week was resilience towards few pockets of global weakness. Another important factor to take note of was the attempts of the Nifty to move past the all critical 10,800-10,850 zones.

As we approach fresh week beginning Monday, we expect a flat to modestly positive start to the trade. The Nifty has ended just below the falling trend line pattern area resistance and the opening levels and the intraday trajectory that the markets form after opening will be very crucial to watch for.

Monday will see the levels of 10,800 and 10,850 posing stiff resistance on the upside. Supports come in at 10750 and 10710 zones.

The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 53.7656 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The Daily MACD still remain bearish while trading below its signal line. No significant formation was observed on Candles.

On the pattern analysis front, the Nifty has almost failed the downward breach that it saw from a large symmetrical triangle formation. It has shown a sharp pullback inside the formation. Presently it resists once again to the falling trend line that initiates itself form the high of 11,170 and joins the subsequent lower tops.

Overall, the set remains resilient as the Nifty currently trades above all its moving averages. It presently resists to the falling trend line pattern resistance and it would be important for the Nifty to move past and close above the 10,800-10,850 zones for a resumption of a meaningful upmove. The lead indicators remain within a pattern and are seen forming higher bottoms. Minor corrective moves, if any, should be used to make select purchases while continuing to protect profits at higher levels.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Resilient technical set up is observed in stocks like Reliance, Ashok Leyland, BEL, Hindalco, BHEL, BPCL, JSW Steel, DLF, RECLTD, L&TFH, and PFC.

10,2018-07-10,JSW,"Mumbai: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries and steel products manufacturer JSW Steel are likely to enter the benchmark Nifty index in place of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Lupin in the upcoming index rebalancing, analysts said.

The exchange may come out with its list of inclusions and exclusions in the latter half of August and these stocks may be included in the Nifty from the October series, said ICICIdirect in a note.

As per the guidelines, a stock may be replaced in an index in case of compulsory changes like corporate actions and delisting. The stock having largest free float market capitalisation and satisfying other requirements related to liquidity, turnover and free float will be considered for inclusion in this scenario.

A change is also made when there is a better candidate for inclusion. The stock which is included in the index should have market capitalisation which is 1.5 times the market cap of the stock which is excluded.



“Britannia will have close to 0.5 per cent weightage on introduction in the Nifty. Britannia is most likely to replace HPCL as it exceeds HPCL’s current free float market cap by 1.5 times,” said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICIdirect. The retail brokerage said that either JSW or Godrej Consumer Products are likely to replace Lupin in the Nifty.

According to the guidelines, a maximum of 10 per cent of the index size may be changed in a calendar year, which means a maximum of five stocks can be replaced among the 50 stocks. As three changes have already been made in the last rebalancing, only two changes are expected in the upcoming rebalancing.

“JSW Steel and Britannia are likely to be added in the Nifty index. Exit is likely for HPCL as its free float market cap has come down,” said Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal. “Sentimental buying can come in as funds which use index as benchmark will come in,” said Taparia.

There is also a chance that Lupin may not be excluded from the index given the recent spurt in pharmaceutical sector stocks.

The Nifty Pharma index has risen 17.8 per cent from its 52-week low of 7,900.35 was hit on May 23.

12,2018-07-10,JSW,"Mumbai: Metal and mining stocks rallied on Monday as copper prices surged in global commodity markets. Riding on the rally, the BSE Metal index gained 1.3 per cent, compared with just 0.8 per cent gain of Sensex.

But stock performance of metal companies is expected to remain muted despite attractive valuations, given the twin overhang of trade brawls and a strengthening dollar, said analysts.

Shares of Vedanta gained 3.14 per cent while Jindal Steel and Hindustan Zinc rose 2.5 per cent each. National Aluminium, SAIL, JSW Steel and Hindalco gained between 1 per cent and 2 per cent on Monday.



Copper prices bounced back strongly on Monday after crashing nearly $1,000 a metric tonne since touching a four-year high on June 7 due to an escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the US and China.

Analysts believe that ferrous companies are on a stronger wicket on the earnings front led by a favourable domestic supplydemand balance, but they still anticipate headwinds due to the trade wars and a strong greenback.

“Valuations of metal stocks are likely to remain under pressure, given the twin overhang of trade brawls and a strengthening USD index,” said Amit Dixit, analyst, Edelweiss Securities.

“We expect ferrous companies to outpace non-ferrous players on earnings growth for the first time in nine quarters as global steel spreads remain at a record high, and domestic steel consumption in April-May grew 8.5 per cent YoY though India became a net importer for the first time since December 2016,” he said.

The BSE Metal index has grossly underperformed so far this year with a negative return of 15 per cent, compared with Sensex’s 6 per cent gain. Non-ferrous companies faced headwinds on the cost front, particularly coal, crude derivatives and alumina, whereas price growth in base metals showed signs of flattening out.

However, favourable steel prices in both domestic and international markets have resulted in an improvement in profitability for steel players, said analysts.

“Given the ongoing insolvency resolution process of five steel companies which are likely to result in substantial haircuts for lenders, debt levels of the steel industry are expected to decline in FY2019, which coupled with better operating cash flows, is expected to result in an improvement in coverage ratios for the industry in FY 2019 and FY 2020,” said Jayanta Roy, analyst, ICRA Ltd.

The two appealed to lenders that they were eligible to bid for the company following a tribunal order in another case which held that the amended Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code prohibits promoters is applicable only to cases that were filed after the amendment and not before. In effect, the law is prospective and not retrospective.

Since the resolution for Bhushan Power was finalised before the government amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the promoters demanded their bid be considered. Lenders will submit in sealed envelope the highest bidder to the tribunal and voting will be done following a ruling from the tribunal, said those people who did not want to be identified.

Liberty House in the meanwhile moved the higher bench of bankruptcy court demanding information on bidding process. The tribunal will hear the matter on July 12. 

Tata’s won the bid for the company at Rs 17,500 crore even though it was lower than the Rs. 18,500 crores from Liberty since the financial backing provided by the Tatas gave comfort to lenders. JSW Steel made a bid of Rs 13,000 crore.

Singal’s had pleaded that the lenders should give them an opportunity to submit a plan following an order passed by M K Shrawat that the law banning defaulting promoters to bid for their own company not be applicable in cases filed before November 23- when the amendments were made in the IBC.

In an insolvency case of Wig Associates, the tribunal ruled that “...any amendment to a statute affecting the legal rights of an individual must be presumed to be prospective unless it is made expressly or is impliedly retrospective.”

Banks led by Punjab National Bank had referred the company to bankruptcy court after they failed to repay dues of around Rs 49,200 crore."

The big bright spot for U.S. coal miners is located halfway around the world.

India almost tripled its imports of the rock from America in the first quarter from a year earlier, helping fuel its fast-growing economy and making it the largest foreign buyer of U.S. coal, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The South Asian nation is extending a lifeline to U.S. miners who are struggling to find buyers at home as cheap natural gas and renewable energy continue to force coal-fired power plants into retirement. Miners are increasingly relying on overseas sales to maintain -- or at least slow the decline in -- production levels.


Bloomberg
The U.S. may export 104 million tons of coal in 2018, up 7.2 percent from a year ago, the EIA forecast in its July Short-Term Energy Outlook published Tuesday. Through April, India had brought in almost 7 million tons, approaching a fifth of all U.S. exports of the fossil fuel. The next largest customers included South Korea, Japan, Brazil and the Netherlands.

India’s appetite for foreign coal is increasing at a time when the country’s own production of thermal coal is struggling to keep up with the fast-growing demand from its power sector, according to the EIA. What’s more, it’ll probably drive most of the global growth in metallurgical coal demand in coming years as India tries to meet ambitious steel-capacity goals, Mark Levin, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities LLC, said in a note Tuesday.

Both situations present opportunities for U.S. miners. Last year, India imported 7.54 million tons of U.S. thermal coal -- which is burned by power plants -- and 3.92 million tons of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking. Through April, those thermal coal imports had more than doubled, and the met coal imports increased 75 percent, according to Andrew Cosgrove of Bloomberg Intelligence.

In particular, India’s efforts to curb the use of petroleum coke as a fuel have created an opening for thermal coal from Northern Appalachia, Cosgrove said.

“Thermal coal imports from the U.S. are increasingly making sense for Indian users,” said Bharat Rohra, chief executive officer of Jindal Power, citing the high heat content and low levels of ash in some U.S. coal. “These two properties make it economical for use in blending with Indian coal.”

Meanwhile, Indian steel companies are looking to reduce their dependence on Australian metallurgical coal, according to Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the country’s top mill, JSW Steel Ltd.

The good times, however, may not last forever.

India has laid out ambitious plans to cut out all imports of thermal coal. That would require increasing the nation’s reliance on local coal supplies and a shift toward renewable energy. Even so, it probably won’t achieve that goal by 2020, Michelle Leung of Bloomberg Intelligence said in a note Tuesday."
16,2018-07-12,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Steel and aluminium companies will likely post better sequential performance in the June quarter, led primarily by metal prices. This could lead to a technical bounceback in the stocks of Tata Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, Hindalco and Nalco, which have seen sharp corrections over the past few months due to global concerns over punitive tariffs.

Domestic steel prices in the quarter were up 3-4 per cent, helped by a weak rupee and higher demand. Local demand for steel in April and May climbed 8.5 per cent on-year. Realisation for exporters will also be higher due to the depreciation of the rupee, which has been among the biggest losers against the dollar this year.

Cost pressures, meanwhile, moderated. After the sharp increase in March, coking coal costs fell 15 per cent sequentially, while iron ore prices declined 2 per cent. However, the total benefit of lower raw material costs will not be visible in the June-quarter performance due to the inventory lag effect, with plants using materials on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The September quarter will show the full effects of lower input costs.

Against this backdrop, analysts expect Tata Steel’s operating profit or EBIDTA to jump 10 per cent over the March quarter and 45 per cent over the year-ago period. Jindal Steel should deliver 8 per cent EBIDTA growth on a sequential basis and 70 per cent y-o-y. In case of JSW Steel, analysts expect a 3 per cent sequential growth and 80 per cent y-o-y growth in EBIDTA, driven by higher realisations, which should help offset the seasonality impact of tapering demand.



Aluminium makers Hindalco and Nalco are also expected to deliver better numbers, given 5 per cent higher sequential prices of the metal. Furthermore, the 25 per cent rise in alumina prices in the quarter that faced supply bottlenecks should help both producers, which have the benefit of backward integration.

Hindalco’s Indian operations, which include aluminium and alumina production, should deliver 20 per cent sequential EBIDTA growth, driven by higher realisations and lower hedging costs. State-run Nalco, which sells two-thirds of the alumina it produces (the remaining used for internal aluminium production), will be the biggest beneficiary of the sharp rise in alumina prices. Analysts expect the company to deliver a 40 per cent sequential increase in EBIDTA.

Stocks of these companies have seen a correction over the past few months: They now trade at the lower range of their three-year average EV by EBIDTA multiples, the metric used in the valuation of metal companies. EV, or enterprise value, includes market capitalization and net debt."

22,2018-07-16,JSW,"Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group has adopted a twin strategy of adding scale and creating a brand image among consumers. It aims to buy distressed steel assets in India and abroad to add scale and to drive-in the brand into consumer households, it plans to launch electric vehicles, group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao told ET.

The group’s steel company, JSW Steel plans to invest ₹40,000 crore over the next three years to increase its capacity to 25 million tonnes from 18 million tonnes now.

“India will be our mainstay. The country’s capacity will rise from 130 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes by 2020 and we would like to maintain our current market share of 16-20%, therefore, the ₹40,000 crore capital expenditure on organic growth,” Rao said.

The company is scouting for acquisition opportunities in India and abroad as many distressed assets are on the block and offer value buy.

In India, the company bid for four distressed assets and managed to succeed in the race for one — Monnet Ispat.

It is looking for more opportunities even in standalone manufacturing units. The bargain buying hunt is also going on overseas.

“We so far rely on our Indian facilities to service other markets. The kind of critical environment we have right now, everything is moving towards protectionism, so it will be better if we have manufacturing base in these markets. But the industry is cyclical and we will acquire units only if we can run them efficiently and they are profitable even if the cycle changes,” Rao said.

US president Donald Trump has imposed a 25% import tariff on steel and owning local units there will reduce the impact on JSW for which the country is a big market. “To set up a capacity of one million tonne steel you spend one billion dollars. But we have acquired a company abroad of capacity three million tonne for $ 500 million. Capital wise, this was a very good investment and we are looking for more opportunities,” Rao said.

The group’s utility is not planning any new investments in the power sector till the fundamental issues of the sector are resolved. But the business is generating cash and therefore, the company has decided to diversify into manufacturing electric vehicles, a decision that surprised the market.

“We are a reasonably big group with a turnover of ₹85,000 crores as of last year but how many people in India know of JSW? We are not well known because we don’t have any consumer products. If a customer walks into a store to buy TMT steel, he asks for Tata Steel as he knows the brand, even though my brand is equally good or maybe even better. We needed brand presence and chose the EV business for that,” he said.

Rao said there are also synergies between the new business of EV and its traditional steel business and is upbeat about the growth potential globally.

India’s biggest challenge is that electric vehicle prices continue to be high due to expensive battery cost and infrastructure to support these is almost non-existent. Apart from Mahindra & Mahindra, which already sells electric vehicles in the market, local players Maruti and Tata, including international players are eyeing this clean energy personal transportation space in India."
19,2018-07-16,JSW,"Several stocks generate excess returns compared to their benchmark indices. The most consistent among the outperformers also have the ability to generate wealth over the long term. 

So, we have identified stocks that have outperformed the benchmark BSE Sensex for most of the trading days over the last three years. We restricted our study to BSE 500 stocks and calculated their daily returns from 29 June 2015 to 29 June 2018. We also calculated the daily returns of BSE Sensex for the same period. 

We then considered each stock from our universe of 500 stocks and looked for trading days on which the stock outperformed the Sensex. After that we added all the trading days on which a stock outperformed the Sensex, and calculated the outperformance of the stock in percentage terms. 

For instance, IndusInd Bank outperformed the BSE Sensex on 395 trading days out of 745 trading days in the past three years, so its outperformance stands at 53%. We repeated the exercise for each of the 500 stocks and then sorted them in descending order on the basis of their outperformance.


Outperformers analysts are bullish on
The average 3-year return of these consistent outperformers is a whopping 178% compared to the BSE500’s 34.2%.
 *Number of trading days the stock has outperformed the BSE Sensex in past three years. Operating profit (including other income) and PAT growth is y-o-y. Absolute returns as on 29 Jun 2018. Source: ACE Equity and Bloomberg

After analysing point-to-point returns of the selected stocks, we found that the top 10% delivered an average return of 143% between 29 June 2015 and 29 June 2018. The BSE500 returned 34.2% during the same period. These top 10% stocks delivered 25% point-to-point average returns between 29 June 2017 and 29 June 2018, while the BSE500 generated 10.6% returns during the same period. 

So, in the past one and three years, the top 10% of the outperforming stocks have generated a premium of 2.4-times and 4.2-times respectively compared to the benchmark index. These stocks have not only consistently outperformed the BSE Sensex but also score highly on their fundamental attributes.

The unaudited results for 2017-18 show that the top 10% of the stocks have delivered year-on-year aggregate operating and net profit growth of 15% and 12% respectively. Comparatively, aggregate operating and net profits of BSE500 were 8.1% and 2% respectively for the same period. Our study shows that the analysis of stock performance with respect to market benchmarks could help investors identify medium to long-term outperformers.


 Let us look at the five stocks from our top 10% list that have got the highest buy recommendations from analysts.


1. IndusInd BankIt’s a new generation private sector bank with more than 1,000 branches and around 1,800 ATMs spread across the country. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the bank’s profit growth will be supported by robust revenue momentum, driven by strong loan growth and healthy expansion in net interest margins. The bank’s loan growth is likely to strengthen further in the June 2018 quarter and its asset quality will continue to be among the best in the industry.


2. Britannia IndustriesIndia’s leading food company, Britannia manufactures bakery and dairy products. According to a research report by KR Choksey, the company is likely to grow faster than the market due to the management’s efforts on new innovative products in the premium segment, improvement in distribution channel, focus on capturing new markets and increasing penetration in the rural areas. Steps to mitigate the impact of inflation on raw material prices will help improve Ebitda and profit after tax margins by 2019-20.


3. Dalmia BharatThis cement manufacturer has an annual installed capacity of 25 million tonnes. Sustained improvement in variable cost parameters, rising market share across regions, increasing scale of premium brands, discipline in capex and debt repayment, and organisational restructuring will be future growth drivers, says a research report by Antique Stock Broking.


4. JSW SteelProducer and distributer of iron and steel products, JSW Steel has a capacity of 18 million tonnes per annum. The company has invested $1 billion in the US. According to a research report by ICICI Direct, JSW Steel will benefit from its expansion, given the stringent trade measures announced by the US to support its domestic steel industry.


5. Asian PaintsThe company’s product portfolio comprises paints, water proofing material, wall coverings and adhesives. According to a research report by JP Morgan, healthy domestic demand aided by rural recovery, improved overseas operations, extensive distribution reach and product innovations offers positive revenue growth outlook in 2018-19."
20,2018-07-16,JSW,"If you have a strong conviction on a stock but are worried about the gestation period, investing may not be your cup of tea. Maybe, you should trade!

Some 10 stocks from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) took 20 years for gestation, but have delivered up to 2,619 times return in this period. They were penny stocks back then; five are part of the elite Nifty50 club today. They are Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UPL, Lupin and Titan Company.

Others which made their investors millionaires included Bajaj Finance, Shree Cement, Gruh Finance, JSW Steel and Ashiana Housing.

No, it has not been a steep climb for any of them. UPL, Titan, and JSW Steel tested investors’ nerves for several quarters or even years before they took off. 

That’s what you face on the path to richness. 

Ian Cassel, a well-known microcap investor, said in a recent tweet: “Every multibagger will have long periods (even years) of stagnation, as fundamentals backfill, old shareholders get bored, and new shareholders enter.”

So how long is it, really?

UPL remained in the Rs 3-8 range all through 1998-2003; Titan traded in the Rs 2-4 range around the same time. The former is at Rs 637, today and latter at Rs 832.

Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied 2,61,772 per cent from Rs 10.70 on July 12 in 1998 to Rs 28,020 on July 12, 2018. The company has no debt on its books and continues to redeploy cash for further expansion and product innovation.

Data available with Ace Equity showed Eicher’s net profit swelled to Rs 1,712.90 crore for the year ended March 2018 from Rs 23.50 crore reported for FY01. Net sales soared over 20 times during this period. 

An investment of Rs 55,000 in Eicher Motors shares in 1998 would have become over Rs 14 crore today. 

Kotak Mahindra Bank is the second biggest gainer on the list, up 1,29,337 per cent from Rs 1.10 in July 1998 to Rs 1,394 at last Friday’s close. Net profit of the lender multiplied over 50 times to Rs 4,084.30 crore for the year ended FY18. In comparison, shares of HDFC Bank rallied 16,022 per cent from Rs 13.40 to Rs 2165 in the same period.

Brokerage Sharekhan says Kotak Mahindra Bank is among a handful of banks that have been able to maintain strong asset quality in sharp contrast to most banking peers that have become fraught with challenges. Kotak Bank is well positioned to capture incremental market share in the advances market.

“With PSU banks hobbled with non-performing assets (NPA) and capital-related issues, private banks (such as Kotak Bank) have a great opportunity to grab market share and gain access to attractive clientele,” the brokerage said in a report.

UPL has multiplied investor wealth by 647 times in last 20 years. The scrip jumped from Rs 0.90 on July 13, 1998 to Rs 582.70 on July 12, 2018. Net sales and net profit have soared manifold in the same period.

UPL is engaged in the crop protection business, comprising agrochemicals, industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and specialty chemicals.

HDFC Securities in an April report said UPL’s long-term prospects remained positive led by its focus on branding and launch of innovative products, maintaining geographical presence and catering to major crops.

It has increased its share in the global agrochemical market (4 per cent in CY16 against 3 per cent in CY14), and improving Innovation Turnover Index, which rose to 19 per cent in FY18 from 15 per cent in FY17. The company has been investing consistently in backward as well as forward integration, resulting in better cost management.

Shares of pharma major Lupin have rallied 46,370 per cent to Rs 885.30 from Rs 1.90 on July 13, 1998, while Titan has soared 35,415 per cent to Rs 808.90 from Rs 2.30 during the same period. 

Lupin’s profit has jumped from just Rs 2.90 crore in FY2000 to Rs 1,344 for the financial year ended March 2018. It is the market leader in 51 out of the 158 products it sells in the US generic market. As many as 109 of its products feature among the top three in the US generic market.

Lupin plans to launch around 30 new products in the US during FY19. With 163 ANDAs pending approval by USFDA, Lupin is poised for good growth, according to Centrum Broking. The management has guided an EBIDTA margin of 19-21 per cent and single digit decline in revenues for US generic business in FY19.

Titan’s bottomline has soared to over Rs 1,150 crore in FY18 from Rs 25 crore in FY05, while top line has grown 15 times.

The previous financial year turned out to be a robust one for the company, with the jewellery division delivering healthy expansion in bottomline and topline. Revenues for the jewellery division grew 25 per cent YoY to Rs 13,257 crore.

Recent regulatory changes such as demonetisation and GST have led to market share gains for the company, while its enhanced focus on wedding and high value studded jewellery and favourable gold exchange policy has also helped grow topline. The management remains upbeat on the growth outlook for the jewellery division with plans to grow revenues at a compounding rate of 20 per cent till FY23. 

The size of India’s jewellery industry is pegged at Rs 2,50,000 crore, of which Titan’s Tanishq brand has just 5 per cent market share. This provides immense opportunity to enhance market share, going forward."

24,2018-07-18,JSW,"MUMBAI: The appellate bankruptcy court on Tuesday barred lenders from voting for the highest bidder for Bhushan Power, following a plea from Liberty House that a transparent process was not being followed by lenders. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal will hear lenders’ response on the matter on Wednesday, but the stay on voting will be in force till July 20.

The ruling came just before the company’s committee of creditors was to vote for an offer made by Tata Steel for the bankruptcy steelmaker. Liberty House and JSW Steel were the other two entities that had submitted resolution plans for Bhushan Power.

Lenders see the ruling as a major setback and also a U-turn taken by the tribunal, particularly because last week it had directed lenders to go ahead with the resolution process despite objections being raised by UK-based Liberty House. The ‘to and fro’ from the adjudicating authority has disappointed several lenders who were looking at a quick resolution to recover their dues as they were seeing a sharp rise in their bad loans.

Lenders were to begin voting for Bhushan Power on Tuesday and conclude it by Wednesday evening.

Liberty House in a plea said it had submitted all documents and information sought by the lenders, yet its offer was not considered. The company also said it was fully compliant with Section 29(A) of the bankruptcy law — it bars defaulters from submitting a resolution plan unless they repaid their dues."
25,2018-07-18,JSW,"The Supreme Court
on Tuesday passed an order that prevents the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against taking any final decision on bids for the debt-stricken Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL).

BPSL promoter Sanjay Singal had filed a petition against “a lacuna in valuation of the company,” a member of his legal team him told ET. Mahesh Agarwal, who represented Singal, said against a fair value of Rs 25,000 crore that has been fixed for BPSL, bids have come in below this threshold. NCLT has received bids from Tata Steel and UK-based Liberty House for Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 18,500 crore, respectively.

Both potential buyers have also offered to invest an additional Rs 7,000 crore in the operations of the company. BPSL was referred to the NCLT last year after it had piled up debt worth Rs 47,000 crore.

After 
Tuesday’s hearing, the Supreme Court passed an order saying “the bids will not be finalised by the National Company Law Tribunal without leave of this court.” A battery of top advocates, including, Mukul Rohatgi, K V Vishwanathan, Mahesh Agarwal, Rishi Agrawala, Arvind Kumar Gupta, Karan Luthra, Himanshu Satija, Vishnu Tallapragada and E C Agarwala, represented Singal.

In a related development, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) 
on Tuesday stayed a lenders' meeting to vote on a resolution plan submitted for BPSL by Tata Steel after operational creditors of BPSL approached the appellate tribunal. Operational creditors alleged that they have not been allowed to represent their case at the Committee of Creditors (CoC) meeting. The lenders, who are a part of the company's CoC, were to meet 
on Tuesday.

There are about 1,700 operational creditors of BPSL who are seeking their dues. The NCLAT has called for a hearing on 
July 20. It has also asked Liberty House to present eligibility related compliance under Clause 29A of the Insolvency and Bankrupcty Code.

Earlier, lenders had rejected the resolution plan for BPSL submitted by Liberty House after the bid deadline was over. Tata Steel and JSW Steel were among the bidders who had already submitted resolution plans for BPSL with offers of Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively."
26,2018-07-18,JSW,"Indian equity market witnessed highly volatile session on Wednesday. The Nifty oscillated in a wide 90-point range. Although the benchmark index ended the day losing just 27.60 points or 0.25 per cent, it was the broader market that witnessed much more pain.

Along with broader indices, auto and metal pack remained one of the worst performers.

As we approach Thursday, we need to approach market with extreme caution. One thing that remains evident is that the market remain structurally intact, there is no breakdown of any kind on the charts. However, the way volatility has crept in with the persisting pain in the broader market, the consolidation may remain quite difficult and painful as there have been exaggerated moves in the broader market.

Thursday will see the levels of 11,030 and 11,080 to work out as immediate resistance levels while supports can be expected at 10,950 and 10,910 zones.



The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Chart is 60.7125. It continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. The Daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on Candles.

If we look at pattern analysis, it continues to remain evident that market is consolidating post breakout above the falling trend line pattern resistance. From the present structure, it is expected that it will be a while before the market attempts to test its previous highs.

One important point to note is that the market ended above upper Bollinger band post its breakout. What we are witnessing is a typical temporary pullback inside the bands which otherwise signal strong possibility of continuation of breakout. 

We expect consolidation to continue but inherent undercurrent continues to remain intact. We also expect volatility to persist and therefore recommend staying away from creating major exposures. However, shorts may be avoided, and each lower level may be used for making very select purchases. High degree of caution is advised for the day.

29,2018-07-19,JSW,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal on Thursday approved the Aion-JSW Steel resolution plan for Monnet Ispat and Energy ""with modifications"" a year after it was admitted to the bankruptcy court for defaulting on debt of Rs 10,000 crore.

The plan for the 1.5 million tonne steel maker based in Chattisgarh was approved by a bench presided by BSV Prakash Kumar and Ravi Kumar Duraisamy with a modification that the coal mine Gare Palma IV/7 will not be included in the liquidation value of the company as the agreement for the mine had been cancelled by the coal ministry. The detailed order is expected by Monday. 

""The plan is approved with modifications that the coal mine will not be included,"" said Justice BSV Prakash Kumar as he pronounced his order at the end of a long hearing during which he heard (and dismissed) a set of fresh pleas related to the resolution plan.

The judge also made the consortium sign an undertaking that a proposed capital reduction plan will not entail elimination of (minority) shareholders going forward. As cited in the court, the resolution plan aims to restructure the capital of the company where the number of shares held by shareholders of the company will be reduced to one-third, which could pose a danger of elimination of shareholders holding small quantities of the company's total shares.

The undertaking follows last week's development when the consortium had agreed to pay an additional Rs 25 crore to the operational creditors of the distressed steel company after the tribunal pointed out that there was nothing for small companies in the initial offer of Rs 2,850 crore. The new offer now stands at Rs 2,875 crore with an additional Rs 1,000 crore pledged as equity and working capital requirements.

The private equity fund-steel major consortium will hold 75% of the equity in the company out of which Aion Capital will have a 70% share with JSW Steel controlling 30%. The lenders stake will be 18%. The consortium was the sole bidder for Monnet which will see lenders losing 75% of the total loans given out of which the State Bank of India had the maximum exposure.

In the hearing on Thursday, the judge also dismissed a plea by an unsecured financial creditor Deutsche Bank that wanted to be treated at par with the unsecured operational creditors who will now be getting Rs 25 crore on a pro rata basis. The counsel for Deutsche Bank argued that the company owes Rs 151 crore to the bank out of which it is getting back only 2.58% of its total exposure (Rs 3.9 crore) and hence it should also get the benefit of the additional Rs 25 crore that the consortium will be paying.

Justice Kumar said this does not amount to a violation of rights as the bank is part of the committee of creditors and had given its assent to the original plan whereas the small operational creditors were absent from all decision making.

The approval makes Monnet Ispat the third steel company to have gotten the go-ahead for resolution in RBI's list of the top 12 defaulters. The other two companies that have crossed over to a new management are Bhushan Steel in favour of the Tata Steel and Electrosteel Steels going to the Vedanta group."
28,2018-07-19,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Market experts are cautioning investors about unfavourable risk-reward on most smallcap counters, but retail investors are still venturing out to catch the falling knife. Or, that is what shareholding data for the past two quarters seems to be suggesting.

Retail interest remained high on the buzzing stocks in the first six months of the ongoing calendar, even as select stocks fell between 30 per cent and 70 per cent.

One such stock is Ruchi Soya. Individual investors holding shares worth up to Rs 2 lakh hiked stake in this debt-ridden company to 23.7 per cent at the end of June quarter from 15.1 per cent at the end of March quarter and 13.8 per cent at the end of December quarter. This happened even as the stock slipped some 47 per cent so far this calendar. The company is up for sale and Adani Wilmar, which sells cooking oil under the Fortune brand, and Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali are in the fray to acquire the largest edible oil manufacturer.

The stock is looking oversold on the charts. There has been extreme pain and this is when selling peaks if one were to go by textbook definition.

Monnet Ispat & Energy, another debt-ridden company which is likely to be acquired by a consortium of AION Capital and JSW Steel under a debt resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

Retail investors increased stake in the company to 16.7 per cent at the end of June quarter from 16.4 per cent at the end of March quarter and 8.7 per cent at the end of December quarter. The scrip is down 70 per cent on a year-to-date basis.

HCC has seen retail investors raise stake to 24.1 per cent at the end of June quarter from 21.2 per cent at the end of March quarter and 18 per cent at the end of December quarter. This company has reportedly expressed its inability to give any timeframe for the resolution of Lavasa debt. This stock is down 75 per cent.

Other troubled companies such Reliance Naval and Manpasand Beverages and depressed stocks such as Thirumalai Chemicals, Granules India and Arrow Greentech, which had performed well in the past, too have seen strong retail interest in recent times.

There are some 137 companies in the BSE smallcap index, where retail investors have increased their stake by between 100 basis points to 1,000 basis points in the first six months, data available with database Ace Equity suggests. 

Small investors raised exposure to these smallcaps even as HNIs turned cautious and the entire space went through a painful correction all through past six months.

“HNIs who invest in stocks directly are fearful that midcap and smallcap stocks could come down a lot and may not recover anytime soon. The Nifty50 is back near its highest levels, and the recent rally has been narrow led by few heavyweights such as HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries,"" said Rishi Kohli, CIO & MD at ProAlpha Systematic Capital.

He said the mood of HNIs is unenthusiastic. “They are investing in AIF funds, which are long-short as these have been sold as replacements for debt funds. So a lot of money has moved from liquid funds and bank FDs to the long-short AIFs,” Kohli said.





What to look at in smallcaps?Hiren Ved of Alchemy Capital Management believes if there are businesses that may be at an inflexion point over the next two-three years and there could be profit growth, that is where the opportunity is.

“We are looking at those opportunities where stocks have not done well but the businesses have great balance sheets, no leverage and free cash flow and the business is turning,” Ved said.

Ved said there are several stocks which have not gone anywhere in last three to four years, which means they have either been flat or ignored."

31,2018-07-20,JSW,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) today gave a go-ahead to the lenders' meeting of debt-ridden Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL), directing it to finalise a bid for the company. 

 Vacating its earlier stay, the appellate tribunal has directed the committee of creditors (CoC) of the company to consider the resolution plans submitted by three firms -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel. 

 NCLAT has also directed the CoC to call all the three bidders, along with operational creditors and suspended board of directors, in the meeting. 

 ""The CoC would call for urgent meeting to take the resolution plan for discussion and approval,"" said a two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya. 

 He further said, ""Resolution professional (RP), after consulting CoC, will invite operational creditors and all three resolution applicants will remain present on the date of consideration of the resolution plan."" 

 The suspended board of director are also allowed to attend the meetings in which resolution plan will be considered by CoC, NCLAT said in its orders. 

 Earlier, on July 17, NCLAT had stayed the meeting of CoC when they were going to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder (H1) for BPSL. 

 ""The best of the three plans, which are in consonance with section 30(2) and are viable, feasible and acceptable to majority of CoC be voted on the same or subsequent date to approve,"" said NCLAT. 

 It further said, ""The CoC may also indicate the second best plan (H2) so that in future the adjudicating authority can approve in case of any problems with the first resolution plan."" 

 The appellate tribunal further said that CoC will place selected resolution plan before adjudicating authority, which may approve it, but they will not give effect without prior approval of this tribunal (NCLAT). 

 Today, during the proceedings of the appellate tribunal, RP tendered an unconditional apology. However, NCLAT said it would hear it whenever the date comes. 

 The appellate tribunal has directed to list the matter on August 1 for next hearing. 

 During the last hearing on July 17, NCLAT had pulled up the RP of the company, Mahendra Kumar Khandelwal, for not following its previous orders to allow the representatives of operational creditors to attend the meeting. 

 It had said that it would consider whether contempt of court proceedings should be initiated against the RP in the next hearing, which was today. 

 In the last hearing, operational creditors of the company had alleged that their representatives were not allowed to attend the CoC meeting. 

 Moreover, Liberty House, a resolution applicant has alleged that information was not supplied about the meeting and on July 11 RP gave a 19-page checklist seeking the company's compliance on 29 A of Insovency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). 

 Earlier, the company's lenders had rejected the resolution plan submitted by Liberty House citing delay, following which the UK-based group had moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). 

 The NCLT had on April 23 directed BPSL's lenders, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House. 

 This order was later challenged by Tata Steel, another resolution applicant of BPSL, before NCLAT -- the appellate tribunal."
32,2018-07-21,JSW,"Markets turned out to be extremely volatile this week, taking even the experts by surprise on which way the market is heading. Corporate numbers were not appreciated even after delivering robust set of numbers, which is a cause of worry. 

HUL posted a staggering 19 per cent PAT growth, but the stock was down 7.6 per cent, post results. Mahindra CIE, JK Tyres and Mindtree had all delivered great set of numbers, but still the stock prices were hammered. This throws an important signal that the upside is limited at least in the near term. 

Although markets are likely to touch new highs to test the strength of the bulls, it seems more likely that they would recede from the highs and make a failed top, given the internal weakness. 

The sentiment is low, which comes from the fact that IPOs are getting below-average response. However, all that is going to change when HDFC AMC comes out with its IPO next week at an attractive value proposition. 

Any euphoric response to such an IPO could possibly mark the top in the Nifty. We do recommend subscribe HDFC AMC from a long-term investing perspective. 


Events of the week:The government is planning a breakthrough policy decision which will decrease the logistic costs for the economy, which is currently as high as 16% compared with the global average of 10 per cent to 12 per cent. The plan is to allow truckers to increase the load factor by 20-25 per cent. 

This may lead to a slowdown in CV sales and therefore, some companies may be impacted. But it is good for the long-term competitiveness of the economy. 


Technical Outlook:
The Nifty is likely to touch previous highs after a small consolidation phase. Still, the indicators have not reached overbought levels that make a strong case for the NSE benchmark touching 11,170 levels in the short term. 

Momentum is intact, which should allow the Nifty to test higher levels. Given that the breadth of the broader market is weak, there is every likelihood that higher levels will not sustain. Traders should buy with today’s low as a stop. 




Expectations for the week:Since the Parliament sessions are going on, some amount of political conundrum could drive market volatility. It is expected that reforms agenda will get accelerated, which would be a positive for the markets in general. 

Investors must maintain a cautious stance, as the year ahead is heavily clouded by political drama. Contra bets in metals, realty and housing finance companies -- which are heavily beaten down -- can be good bets, going forward. 

Quarterly earnings of a few companies such as ACC, Asian Paints, Ambuja Cement, Indiabulls Ventures, Hero MotoCorp, JSW Steel would be important to watch. 

In general, investors should now adopt a wait and watch policy before taking fresh investment positions. The Nifty50 closed the week marginally down by 0.07 per cent to close at 11,010.20."
33,2018-07-22,JSW,"The stock market on Friday ended on a positive note with the NSE benchmark Nifty gaining 53.10 points or 0.48 per cent. The stocks remained flat on a weekly basis, and the Nifty remained within a congestion zone, which it created after breaking out above the falling trend line pattern resistance area. Broader markets too remained positive.

As we approach the fresh week, we expect a positive start to the trade. The no-confidence motion going in favour of ruling BJP government will remove volatility to some extend and give some positive fillip to the market. However, we expect the market to remain under positive consolidation for some time before it resumes the upmove and retest previous highs.

Monday is likely to see the levels of 11,065 and 11,150 working out as immediate resistance area for the Nifty. Supports are expected to come in at 11,950 and 11,910 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stood at 61.7819, and it continues to remain neutral showing no divergence to the price. The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on the candles.



If we have a look at the pattern analysis, it is evident that the Nifty broke out above the falling trend line pattern resistance. After the breakout the Nifty is currently seen taking a breather and is again consolidating in a capped range. In the process, it is seen creating a ‘flag-like’ formation. Such formations act as continuation patterns in most cases.

Overall, we recommend continuing to approach the market with a positive bias. Consolidation after an upmove is a sign of strength and as of now Nifty has shown no signs of any impending major downside turns.

The present structure of the market is more likely to favour the buy-on-declines approach than sell-on-rally strategy. High specific and stock specific purchases may be made at every opportunity while continuing to vigilantly protect profits at every up move.


Stocks to watch: Technically resilient setup was observed in stocks of Glaxo Consumer, Relaxo, Berger Paints, Bharat Electronics, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, JSW Steel, Indiabulls Real Estate, Motherson Sumi and RBL Bank.

36,2018-07-24,JSW,"Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Equity Advisory, Motilal Oswal Securities, says he is expecting around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. He was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Do you believe UPL’s acquisition of Arysta Lifescience is going to be value accretive and the synergy realisation can provide a significant upside even after yesterday’s upmove in the stock?
UPL has a fantastic track record of acquiring overseas companies in last 20-25 years. They made 20-odd acquisitions in so many years. With Arysta, it will be increasing $3 billion worth of debt on UPL’s special purpose vehicle and that would be a dilution. Net debt to equity will go higher. How they will be able to service the debt, the interest cost on the debt is something needs to be watched.

There will be a bit of postponement. It will be there for the earnings over FY20-FY21. It is very much priced in and it is not going to be value accretive at this point in time for next one-one and a half years.


Talking about the big earnings which the market is going to be reacting to and besides ACC’s good numbers, one wonders what went wrong with United Spirits? How to explain that kind of muted volume growth?
There was high expectation that post highway ban, there would again be a significant jump in the quarter, but the premiumisation is not working well. The Prestige and other brands have shown a very tepid growth and the cost has also gone up significantly.

EBITDA has improved but margin is not improving and the EBITDA margin and the profit margin both are very much flattish. Topline is growing but bottom line is growing a little less -- 10% to 15%. Plus, the earnings volatility is such that it is unpredictable whether one quarter will be a good enough to show traction for profitability in FY19 or FY20 or any other financial year. It is just a flipflop kind of an earning trajectory. They are still struggling with trying to rationalise operations again the regulatory actions.


What could we expect from Asian Paints today given that it is the leader in the paints segment? It is the go-to story when it comes to paint stocks and the fact that the market is betting big on the segment especially after the GST rates are being cut?
Asian Paints has 60% odd market share in the paint industry. It is a dominant player. This quarter, Asian Paints could see a 10-15% kind of a growth. Crude volatility, which is a raw material margin, needs to be watched out for. Crude has now retraced back from 80 to odd 72-73 odd. That gives some kind of a breather for rest of the financial year. We expect around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. That means it can show further growth also.


In the metal story, do you think Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta are buys even at the current levels?
Currency headwinds are almost there for the metal sector but trade war between the two elephants is showing a worrisome sign for these companies. Prices are declining day by day. Realisation will get hit for at least next one to two quarters and that is visible from here. Plus, we believe that the metal companies have done their capacity expansion to the fullest. Now there is not much of a scope there but if demand declines, then bad days will start for them. 

It is not a linear growth for metal stocks at any point in time throughout the year. With 100% capacity expansion, if demand slows down and price realisation is down, then they will have to suffer. However, with Hindalco, there is a different story. They have acquired Aleris and that is a different ball game. One can enter the stocks at around 8% to 10% correction. Even JSW Steel or Hindalco or Vedanta will provide a good opportunity in the longer term.


What is your perspective on mid-tier cement names? Cement is more of a regional play and if names like ACC are doing well, one can only extrapolate that some of the smaller companies will also see traction in their earnings. Would you agree?
I would say even UltraTech Cement has delivered in line with expectation. ACC is beyond comparison because traditionally, it is a very old plant and has had limited capacity expansion. Now the premium segment is picking up in ACC and so it is not comparable with others.

Irrespective of ACC cost per tonne has been reduced, the other cost has gone down and EBITDA has improved slightly, that does not mean that other midcap company which we are talking about is going to be performing better. It is a different ballgame for ACC at this point in time. We believe volume growth will be tepid enough. There will be 6% to 7% average volume growth for all the companies.

In midcaps, Birla Corp is something which needs to be watched out for in terms of results and ongoing for next one-one and a half year, the stock has corrected significantly and Reliance Cement which was the recent acquisition of one-one and a half year back, is running at 80% capacity. There are high chances that the stock can react to the positivity for next one-one and a half year. But it would be an investment perspective and not for trading. So for midcaps, almost 5% to 7% volume growth will be there in this quarterly numbers.


Beside earnings, this week is very critical in terms of a Nifty earnings composition. L&T, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Industries will report their numbers. Which ones are you looking out for and what is your expectation thereof?
This week, the result to watch out for would be ITC. We have to see where are its growth numbers and how the food and the non-cigarette business is shaping up. It can surprise positively rather than negative. 

In Hero MotoCorp, again a price war is taking place at the domestic level with Bajaj. The entry level segment will again be dampening the sentiment. It is not something which would be exciting.

Reliance needs to be watched to see how the margin will come up for this quarter and whether it has taken anything out of the crude advantage. On EBITDA front plus, Jio is doing very well and the retail needs to be watched. Maruti is our favourite."

38,2018-07-24,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel will merge recently-acquired distressed asset Monnet Ispat & Energy with the company, chairman Sajjan Jindal said on Tuesday, adding that he hopes to turn it around in a year.

Speaking to reporters after addressing shareholders at the annual general meeting, Jindal said JSW Steel will be looking at acquiring coking coal mines over time, though raw material security is not a core focus area at present.

""We will eventually merge Monnet Ispat into JSW Steel and use the JSW brand,"" Jindal said. “Our past experience has been that we normally turn around (an asset) within one year and we hope that should happen (here, too).""

In 2010, when JSW Steel acquired a stressed Ispat Industries, he had given a similar promise of turning the business around in one year.

Last Friday, the insolvency tribunal approved the Aion Capital-JSW Steel resolution plan for the 1.5-million-tonne Monnet Ispat and Energy for which the company has offered around Rs 3,875 crore including Rs 1,000 crore as equity and working capital.

Jindal's plan of merging the distressed asset into the company is different from rivals Tata Steel and Vedanta's plans for Bhushan Steel and Electrosteel Steels, respectively.

While Bhushan Steel will be acquired by Bamnipal Steel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel; Vedanta will acquire a controlling stake in Electrosteel via its fully owned unit, Vedanta Star.

JSW has charted an elaborate expansion plan for the Indian market according to which it will be spending Rs 45,000 crore over the next three years to take capacity to 25 million tonnes from the current 18 million tonnes, along with investments planned for downstream capacity additions.

In the past year, it announced investment of $1 billion in the US for the backward integration of existing plates and pipe mills facility in Texas as well as in buying Ohiobased steel plant, Acero Junction Holdings. It also acquired Italian steelmaker Aferpi for Rs 441 crore.

Jindal, however, said focus is on India, which is a ""high growth market"". The overseas acquisitions are to serve customers in those countries that have put protectionist measures like antidumping duties in place, he said.

Jindal also hinted at JSW Energy entering a joint venture for battery storage under his electric vehicle plan."

 The Nifty50 index continued its positive momentum and headed towards the 11,143 level on Tuesday. It recently surpassed the immediate hurdle at 11,080 and saw the highest-ever daily close. 

The index formed a bullish candle and managed to hold above the breakout zone. Now, it has to hold above 11,080 to extend its gains towards a lifetime time high of 11,171 and then 11,200 levels, while on the downside, immediate supports are seen at 11,050 and then 11,000 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,000, followed by 10,900, while maximum Call OI was at 11,200, followed by 11,100. There was significant Put writing at 11,100 whereas Call unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices while there was fresh Call writing at 11,200 and 11,250 levels. The option band shifted its trading range to a higher band between 11,050 and 11,200 levels.

DIIs buy stocks worth Rs 513 crore 
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 104 crore worth of domestic stocks on Tuesday, provisional data available with BSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 513 crore, data suggested."
44,2018-07-26,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Foreign capital rushing out of companies is well known. But there are some that have bucked the trend. 

Domestic money capped the downside in markets when foreigners were busy selling their holdings in the June quarter. Escalating trade tension and macroeconomic concerns forced foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to sell shares worth of more than Rs 20,000 crore during April-June whereas mutual fund houses pumped in more than Rs 35,000 crore during the same period.

Data available with Ace Equity showed that mutual fund houses increased their stake in close to 260 companies on the BSE500 index in the June quarter. Of these, 66 firms also managed to attract foreign money. Does this make a case to zero in on these companies?

Together, mutual fund (MF) houses as well as FIIs raised their stake in such firms across sectors, including auto ancillary, select public as well as private banks, cement, chemicals, graphite electrode majors, IT, pharma and power.

Considering the robust outlook for graphite electrode, both MFs and FIIs increased their holdings in Graphite India and HEG Ltd. 

Management of Graphite India in its annual report talked about higher demand for graphite electrode in 2017, which is expected to sustain and grow, going forward. Jefferies maintained ‘Buy’ on the company with a target price of Rs 1,275.

There were a lot of concerns over China adding graphite electrode (GE) capacities that will lead to decline in GE realisations. However, Jefferies in a report said management of HEG does not see competition coming from Chinese players.

Among largecaps, mutual funds increased their holdings in Reliance Industries to 3.28 per cent in the June quarter against 2.80 per cent in the March quarter. FIIs too hiked their exposure to 24.53 per cent, from 24.46 per cent, during the same period. Shares of the company rallied 9 per cent in April-June. 



Global brokerages recently maintained their positive stance on the oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance after the company’s 41st annual general meeting. 

Morgan Stanley believes that RIL’s focus to capitalise on last six years’ investments should help in raising return on equity. It also estimated that the company’s return on capital employed (RoCE) can rise 400 basis points to 12.40 per cent by FY20. The brokerage house maintained ‘Overweight’ on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,241.

Mahindra & Mahindra, Sun Pharmaceuticals and Oil India stood among other largecaps where fund houses and FIIs upped their stake during the quarter gone by.

Hiren Ved of Alchemy Capital Management in an interaction with ETNow said, “Rural demand is picking up and we will continue to see a lot of money and credit being pumped through the bottom of the pyramid, which will lead to very good demand trends for the consumer companies.” 

He further said pharma still has headwinds, but can give good opportunity in the next six months. 

In the pharmaceutical space, Cadila Healthcare, Cipla and Pfizer also emerged as their favourite during the quarter.

On a sectoral basis, Ambuja Cements, Heidelberg Cement, Orient Cement and Star Cement stood out among cement players where MFs and FIIs showed interest. Axis Bank and Canara Bank also managed to attract institutional investors during April-June period.

Canara Bank on July 25 posted an 11.88 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 281.49 crore for the quarter ended June against Rs 251.60 crore in the same quarter last year. Asset quality of the lender also improved. The lender suffered a net loss of Rs 4,859.77 crore in the sequential quarter ended March 2018.

Midcap as well as smallcap IT firms, including Larsen & Toubro Infotech, Mphasis, NIIT Technologies, Sonata Software and Zensar Technologies, attracted domestic as well as foreign inflows.

NIIT Technologies recently reported a 67.4 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 85.8 crore for the three months to June, driven by growth across segments like banking and financial services (BFS) and insurance. It had registered a net profit of Rs 51.3 crore in the year-ago period.

The company reported a better than expected Q1 on revenue growth and order intake though margin execution was a bit lower than our expectations, according to ICICIdirect. The brokerage house has ‘Add’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,121.

Plastic product player Nilkamal too was on their buying list during the quarter. FIIs took their stake to 3.61 per cent from 3.45 per cent while MFs increased their holding to 12.33 per cent from 11.10 per cent.

Carborundum Universal, Monsanto, Nalco, Jamna Auto, Minda Corp, Exide Industries, VST Industries, Oberoi Realty, L&T Technology Services, Manappuram Finance, Godrej Consumer, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, ICIC Prudential Life Insurance Company, JSW Steel, Tata Metaliks, Himachal Futuristic Communications and TVS Srichakra were other players in which foreign institutional investors as well as mutual funds upped their stake in the June quarter.

Edelweiss Securities is bullish on L&T Technology Services (LTTS). The brokerage house said LTTS yet again posted a strong performance with Q1 FY19 USD revenue growing 4 per cent QoQ (beating Street’s estimate of 2.9%) and EBITDA margin expanding 150bps QoQ to 17 per cent. Because of the company’s high-growth potential, Edelweiss retained ‘Buy’ on LTTS with a target price of Rs 1,725."

42,2018-07-26,JSW,"MUMBAI: Domestic steel major JSW Steel's consolidated net profit jumped by 275 per cent to Rs 2,339 crore in the June quarter on strong demand and higher steel prices in the domestic market. 

The company had clocked Rs 624 crore net profit during the same period last year. 

""Following strong demand and rising international prices, the domestic steel prices also went up during the quarter. As a result, the company recorded revenue from operations of Rs 20,519 crore in Q1 FY19, registering a growth of 25 per cent,"" JSW Steel joint managing director Seshagiri Rao told reporters here. 

The country witnessed a 9.2 per cent year-on-year growth in domestic steel demand for the first quarter led by robust government spend on infrastructure and strong consumer demand. Consequently, the company strategically increased domestic sales by 27 per cent YoY, which aided consolidated sales volumes increasing by 11 per cent to 3.76 million tonne. 

The company's sales to the strategic automotive segment also increased by 57 per cent and sales of value added and special products rose by 6 per cent in the June quarter, Rao said, adding that the company's overseas subsidiaries also performed well. 

Its net debt increased by Rs 1,070 crore during the June quarter due to a Rs 865 crore mark-to-market impact of rupee depreciation, Rao added. 

The company said as part of backward integration, it has commenced operations of two iron ore mines and hopes to start operations in three more mines. It is awaiting for the auction of 'C' category mines in next six months period. 

Commenting on its strategic acquisitions, Rao said, the resolution plan submitted by the consortium of JSW Steel and Aion Investments for acquisition of Monnet Ispat has been approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) with certain modifications and the written order is still awaited. 

The company completed the acquisition of 100 per cent stake in Acero Junction Holdings at Ohio in the US. The work to commence production is underway and the company plans to start operations by October, Rao said.

Commenting on outlook, Rao said that the escalating trade tensions pose risks in the growth outlook. 

The domestic steel demand in the June quarter grew at a healthy rate of 9.2 per cent, however, imports surged by 15 per cent, according to him. 

Rao said the steel industry is concerned over rising imports and falling exports. 

""Post the imposition of Section 232 in the US and suo moto safeguard measures announces by the EU, we have started witnessing diversion of steel imports from surplus countries into India,"" Rao said, adding that the government needs to impose trade remedial measures in a timely manner. 

The company's stock ended 0.52 per cent lower at Rs 316.65 apiece on the BSE today, against 0.09 per cent increase in the benchmark."
49,2018-07-27,JSW,"An expected improvement in capacity utilisation rates in the steel sector, would result in an better operating profitability during FY19, a report said. 

""The operational performance of key sector participants to remain strong in the remainder of FY19, in view of a robust steel consumption demand, aided by government spending on infrastructure and housing and a modest recovery in private capex cycle,"" India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in its report here. 

A likely improvement in capacity utilisation rates would result in an improvement in operating profitability, due to better absorption of fixed cost, amid steady sales realisations during FY19, Ind-Ra said. 

Among the leading steel players, JSW Steel (JSWL) and Tata Steel (TSL) EBITDA per tonne remains higher and less volatile compared to those of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam (RINL) through the cycle, due to strong operational efficiencies and better techno-economic parameters with the lowest specific energy consumption and coke rate per tonnes. 

TSL's and JSWL's value addition remains higher than that of SAIL and RINL due to their strong portfolio of branded and special products along with a product mix skewed towards flats, thus their realisation per tonne remains higher. While TSL benefits from its highly vertically integrated domestic operations with captive mining operations, JSWL stands out with the highest employee productivity among the players under study. 

Despite TSL being a low cost domestic producer, its profitability is impacted by its weak European operations, due to which JSWL has higher EBITDA per tonne, the report said. 

Ind-Ra expects EBITDA per tonnes of players SAIL and RINL to improve over FY19-20, supported by the operating leverage benefits with production ramp-up and focus on operational improvements through raw material cost optimisation, manpower rationalisation and enhanced techno-economic parameters. 

Ind-Ra has also reviewed its long-term ratings on the steel companies during March-July 2018. While the rating outlook on JSWL was revised to stable from negative, the agency has maintained a negative outlook on RINL. 

It has also maintained TSL's rating on Rating Watch Evolving (RWE), and assigned ratings to Bamnipal Steel Ltd, a TSL subsidiary established to acquire Bhushan Steel, it said."
48,2018-07-27,JSW,"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) expects the operational performance of key domestic steel players to remain strong in the remainder of FY19, led by robust steel consumption demand, government spending on infrastructure and housing and a modest recovery in private capex cycle. A likely improvement in capacity utilisation rates would result in an improvement in operating profitability, due to better absorption of fixed cost, amid steady sales realisations during FY19, the agency said in 'Steel Portfolio Review FY19,' its latest report on the sector.

With change in sector outlook Ind-Ra has reviewed its long-term ratings on JSW Steel Limited (JSWL), Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) and Tata Steel Limited (TSL) during March-July 2018. While the rating outlook on JSWL was revised to Stable from Negative, the agency has maintained a Negative outlook on RINL. It has also maintained TSL’s rating on Rating Watch Evolving (RWE), and assigned ratings to Bamnipal Steel Ltd, a TSL subsidiary established to acquire Bhushan Steel Limited. 

It said the year FY19 will be a one of sector consolidation with revival of stressed steel assets in a conclusive environment. The agency expects the flat steel segment, in particular hot rolled coils (HRC), to get consolidated among top four domestic steel producers. 

Among structural strengths it listed out China’s continuing capacity rationalisation efforts that are likely to help moderate the global oversupply situation. Operating margins would improve in the near term, benefiting from operating leverage with higher volumes as well as to some extent from the expected softening in coking coal prices, partly countered by inventory losses and steady steel prices on back of a strong demand. Increasing protectionism in global steel trade could pose risk to export margins it said though exposure to exports is limited to around 10% of available capacity. Further, the Indian steel industry continues to enjoy protection from cheap imports under the anti-dumping duty, it added."
46,2018-07-27,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel and AION Investments Private II will invest Rs 875 crore in Milloret Steel Limited (MSL), a special purpose vehicle owned by the consortium, as part of the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for debt-ridden Monnet Ispat & Energy Limited (MIEL) to fund working capital, capex and payment of financial creditors of the company.

JSW Steel will also provide Rs 125 crore as working capital advance to MIEL under the corporate insolvency resolution process cleared by the latter’s Committee of Creditors.

The consortium has also arranged for a term loan for MIEL to allow payment of amounts due to financial creditors in step with the resolution plan, an official statement issued by JSW Steel on Thursday said.

Earlier this week, the NCLT Mumbai bench had issued an order approving a resolution plan for MIEL submitted by JSW Steel-AION. The plan involves payment of Rs 2,457 crore to secured financial creditors of MIEL, with Rs 215.20 as the amount of admitted debt held by the assenting creditors of MIEL and converted into equity shares of MIEL at face value of Rs 10 per share.

Another Rs 219.92 crore will be payable to assenting financial creditors of MIEL upon conversion of the balance admitted dent into Optionally Convertible Preference Shares (OCPS) of MIEL and purchase of such OCPS by MSL. Additionally, an aggregate amount of Rs 25 crore shall be paid to certain identified operational creditors of MIEL over a period of one year commencing from July 24, 2018 in lieu of admitted debt held by them.

On implementation of the resolution plan, the shareholders of MSL will become the new promoters and acquire control over MIEL under the restructuring proposal laid out in the plan. This involves conversion of part of admitted debt into equity shares of MIEL and after conversion of debt, a reduction in MIEL’s share capital (non-promoter holding) to approximately 33.06% of its original value together with extinguishment of the company’s preference share capital and equity share capital held by the existing promoters of MIEL.

After the capital reduction, MSL will be merged with MIEL.

After the merger of MSL with MIEL, MIEL will issue one equity share and one compulsorily convertible preference share (CCPS) of face value Rs 10 each, respectively, for each equity share and CCPS of face value Rs 10 held in MSL.

Accordingly, upon implementation of the resolution plan, consortium members will own 74.29% in equity capital of MIEL. The other shareholders of MIEL, including the financial creditors holding shares, will continue to hold the balance equity of 25.71% of MIEL equity share capital. The consortium will also hold CCPS aggregating to Rs 525.98 crore in MIEL."
47,2018-07-27,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The metal pack was trading among the top sectoral gainers on NSE in Friday's trade.

The Nifty Metal index was trading 2.16 per cent up at 3,305 around 02:25 pm, buoyed by gains in most components, including Jindal Steel & Power (up 4.12 per cent) and JSW Steel (up 3.79 per cent).

Hindalco Industries (up 3.58 per cent), Tata Steel (up 3.29 per cent), Steel Authority of India (SAIL) (up 2.71 per cent), NMDC (up 1.76 per cent), Vedanta (up 1.43 per cent), APL Apollo Tubes (up 1.23 per cent) and Hindustan Copper (up 1.03 per cent) too were trading with decent gains.

Shares of Hindustan Zinc (up 0.70 per cent), Nalco (up 0.64 per cent) and MOIL (up 0.47 per cent) were in the green.

Meanwhile, Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (down 1.72 per cent) and Coal India (down 0.72 per cent) were incurring losses around that time.

ITC, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and HDFC were keeping the bourses aloft. Broadly positive global cues and sustained buying in most sectors were the major factors behind the rally in equity benchmarks. 

The NSE Nifty50 index was up 97 points at 11,264, while the BSE Sensex was up 313 points at 37,298. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 37 were trading in the green, while 13 were in the red. 

ITC, Indian Oil Corporation, Tata Motors, Hindalco Industries and Tata Steel were the key drivers of the rally in Nifty."
51,2018-07-28,JSW,"The domestic equity market witnessed a euphoric rally, albeit a fractured one, in recent times, making everyone envy about not owning largecap stocks. Typically, this is called the Fifth Wave in terms of Elliott Wave theory, when there is a large divergence in the market breadth. Factually, only 54 per cent of the total stocks are trading above their 200 DMAs, which is the second lowest in a decade post the 2008 top, when 52 per cent of the total stocks traded above their 200 DMAs.

This further confirms the Fifth Wave theory. Many stocks did not participate in the rally and lagged the broader market; whether these laggards will move up eventually is a big question now. But by the time the Fifth Wave ends, majority of the laggards would have again gone south. One should, therefore, trade in the laggards with stop losses, as this seems to be the most sensible strategy in the current situation.

Some companies posted stellar numbers this week, with JSW Steel delivering 275 per cent profit growth aided by strong demand, ITC clocking a robust 10 per cent PAT growth after weak results over the past few quarters, Biocon showing strong growth at 47% and Colgate Palmolive delivering a strong bottomline growth at 39 per cent. These quarterly numbers were key triggers for the market to touch new highs this week.


Events of the Week:
Hindalco’s acquisition of Aleris at about $2.6 billion was the talk of the town this week. It might look rosy at first glance, but when you look at it closely, such high debt levels in a commodity-type business are always risky. Similar large ticket acquisitions such as Tata Steel’s acquisition of Bhushan Steel and UPL’s acquisition of Arysta LifeScience are all highly risky investments.

Investors should remain cautious and not forget that similar hype during the Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy acquisition and what happened to them post-merger.


Technical OutlookThe Nifty50 has broken all resistance levels and is in a new price territory. The movement should last unless it reverses; if the Nifty50 slips below 11,100, then it shall be a major reversal for the entire market. But till such times, the bulls should remain long and buy on decline. The Nifty IT index has lost its upward velocity and is, therefore, beginning to enter a corrective phase. Traders should focus on stock-specific movements. For buy positions, stop loss should be placed below 11,100 for capital protection.

Expectations for the Week
The third bimonthly monetary policy may do nothing to change the mood of the market next week. This time around, interest rates are expected to remain the same given that inflation is under control and US interest rates are range-bound.

The buoyancy in the market is expected to remain for some more time aided by encouraging corporate numbers, which will justify high valuations. At this euphoric stage, investors must avoid sectors such as IT, FMCG, cyclical commodity and private sector banks for some time, as they are trading at high valuations.

50,2018-07-28,JSW,"MUMBAI: Lenders have decided to call fresh bids for bankrupt Bhushan Power & Steel after one of the bidders JSW Steel revised its offer up by 60% this week to Rs 18,000 crore, two senior officials who did not want to be named said.

JSW’s offer is higher than that of Tata Steel which had emerged as a preferred bidder over second-placed rival Liberty House. The Tata group made an offer worth Rs 17,000 crore while JSW Steel offered Rs 11,000 crore on February 12, the last day for submission of bids. Liberty House which made its bid 12 days after the deadline offered Rs 18,500 crore.

“The resolution professional (RP) has received revised offer from JSW Steel. There was heated discussion on this at a three hour meeting among lenders today. Finally it decided to invite revised financial bid from all applicants by Tuesday,” one of the officials quoted above said. “Lenders decided to go for a second round of bidding on the grounds that they have not yet voted for the higher bidder, so there is a scope to call for fresh bids,” he added. JSW Steel told ET that it did not want to comment on the matter.

Last month, committee of creditors disqualified Liberty House after it failed to provide critical information on funding arrangement despite repeated reminders. The Tata group thus emerged as preferred bidder while JSW’s bid was not considered since it was too low. The new, revised JSW offer comes when Tata Steel had moved the courts questioning Liberty’s late offer. The bankruptcy court ruled in Liberty’s favour saying that that lenders should consider the bid despite the late submission.

A recent spat between the consortium led by Dalmia Bharat and UltraTech Cement for Binani Cements shows that lenders have considered revised offers after the deadline in the past. After losing out to Dalmia Bharat, UltraTech Cement improved its offer substantially and moved the bankruptcy court when lenders declined to accept it. The court decided in UltraTech’s favour and its bid was later approved by all lenders when rival Dalmia declined to up its price.

Bhushan Power & Steel is among the 12 large defaulters that RBI had directed banks to refer to the bankruptcy court. It faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore from financial creditors."
52,2018-07-29,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a terrific run last week, as it scaled fresh lifetime high. However, only select largecaps lifted the equities higher while broader market continued to struggle.

A better-than-expected quarterly numbers from companies, including ITC, Colgate-Palmolive, JSW Steel, YES Bank, Biocon and Dr Reddy's nudged the bulls to take big strides, lifting frontline indices to fresh milestones. Other factors that compelled investors to fall for equities included reduction in GST rates on over 100 items, FIIs buying again and positive global cues.

On a weekly basis, the BSE Sensex gained 840 points, or 2.3 per cent, while the 50-share pack surged 268 points, or 2.4 per cent.

Going ahead, it's going to be a policy week as many major central banks are going to declare their monetary policy. 

Here’s an in-depth look at these and other factors that are likely to steer market this week - 


RBI's rate-setting meetingThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to meet during July 30 to August 1 for the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2018-2019. The six-member monetary policy committee of the central bank headed by Governor Urjit Patel in June meet bit the bullet and hiked the repo rate – the short-term lending rate – by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.

Speculations are rife that the bank will hike interest rates for second time on Wednesday as inflation risks mount. 


Next batch of quarterly earningsCorporate earnings will continue to dominate the Street's proceedings in the coming week. Among notable names, Axis Bank, HDFC, Idea Cellular, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Shree Cement are slated to declare their June quarter results on Monday. Bank of India, Dabur India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Motors and Vedanta will announce theirs on Tuesday. Indiabulls Housing Finance and Marico are expected to unveil their report cards on Thursday. Nestle India and Titan Company will declare theirs on Friday.


US Fed meetUS Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed had hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point in June and indicated that two more increases are likely this year. The move pushed the funds rate target to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.


BoJ and BoEBank of Japan (BoJ) will unveil its interest rate decision on Tuesday. According to a report by Reuters, it might be doing some ‘jinarashi’ i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. BoJ had left its key short-term interest rate unchanged at -0.1 per cent at its June 2018 meeting.

This apart, Bank of England (BoE) will declare its interest rate decision on Thursday. Governor Mark Carney is looking to throw off his “unreliable boyfriend” tag and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 per cent, reports Reuters. BoE left its key bank rate on hold at 0.5 per cent on 21 June 2018.


Auto stocks in focusAutomakers will start releasing their sales numbers for July from Wednesday. Auto firms including cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, reported a higher double-digit growth in sales in June. Auto major Maruti Suzuki India posted a robust growth of 44 per cent in the domestic sales with 1.34 lakh units in June as compared with 93,057 units the same period last fiscal.


TCNS Clothing listingShares of TCNS Clothing will get listed on BSE and NSE on Monday. The initial public offer (IPO) of the women's apparel maker was subscribed 5.27 times during its IPO. The Rs 1,125 crore public offer received bids for 5,79,79,780 shares against the total issue size of 1,09,99,828.


What tech chart sayThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a bullish candle similar to the 'Bullish Marubozu' pattern on the daily and weekly scales. Friday's opening gap remains unfilled, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. “A long bull on the daily time frame chart and a similar candle on the weekly chart indicate strength in the upward move. The weekly momentum oscillator is signalling strengthening of the upside momentum in the Nifty50,” the expert said.


US jobs dataUnited States non farm payrolls data for July will be unveiled on Friday. The country added another 213,000 jobs in June, although the unemployment rate rose to 4 per cent, according to a report by CNBC. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected a nonfarm payrolls gain of 195,000 and the jobless rate to hold steady at 3.8 per cent, which had been tied for the lowest since 1969, the report added."
56,2018-07-30,JSW,"Tata Steel has written a letter to the lenders of debt-laden Bhushan Power & Steel alleging that rebid process has violated the NCLAT order and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), sources said today. The committee of creditors (CoC) has asked the BPSL bidders, including Tata Steel and JSW Steel, to submit their final bids by tomorrow morning to acquire assets of the debt-ridden firm. 

""CoC in its meeting held a few days back had given time till tomorrow morning to the bidders to come up with revised financial offers,"" a source said. 

According to the sources privy to the development, Tata Steel in its letter has alleged that the CoC was not following legal process as per the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal order. 

Tata Steel spokesperson said that the company has ""no comment to offer"". 

When contacted, Resolution Professional (RP) Mahender Kumar Khandelwal declined to comment on the development. 

On July 20, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) gave a go-ahead to the lenders' meeting of debt-ridden Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL), directing it to finalise a bid for the company. 

Sajjan Jindal's has revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore. 

Tata Steel's offer stands at Rs 17,000 crore. 

Bhushan Power and Steel owes about ₹45,000 crore to its lenders. 

Vacating its earlier stay, the appellate tribunal had this month directed the committee of creditors of the company to consider the resolution plans submitted by three firms -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel. 

NCLAT had also directed the CoC to call all the three bidders, along with operational creditors and suspended board of directors, in the meeting. 

The CoC will call for urgent meeting to take the resolution plan for discussion and approval, a two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya had said. 

Earlier, on July 17, NCLAT had stayed the meeting of CoC when they were going to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder (H1) for BPSL. 

Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by RBI for NCLT proceedings."
55,2018-07-30,JSW,"MUMBAI: UK-based GFG Alliance which will soon be making its foray into the Indian auto components and steel markets has appointed former Vedanta and Reliance Infrastructure CEO Mahendra Singh Mehta to head its India operations.

This follows the approvals granted by the insolvency tribunal to group company Liberty House to acquire two distressed assets, namely Amtek Auto and Adhunik Metaliks under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. 

GFG, whose business spans metal manufacturing, engineering, energy, financial services and property will also soon unveil the executive lead teams in India for each of its business divisions drawing senior professionals from across industries. 

Mehta has more than thirty six years of experience in operations, strategy and business turnaround in sectors spanning steel, non-ferrous metals, mining, power generation and distribution, infrastructure and cement.

The metals and manufacturing major that has turned around many stressed steel companies in the UK and Australia also plans to announce an advisory board for GFG India. The board will provide governance and strategic advice to the group and its executives in the country. 

""Following GFG’s successes in so many other parts of the world, I am very excited to bring our pioneering business model to my own motherland and I’m confident that the appointment of Mr Mehta and many other respected senior executives and advisors will enable us to establish a significant base in India capable of sustained long term growth,"" executive chairman of the GFG Alliance, Sanjeev Gupta said in a release. 

Gupta's Liberty House has also put in a bid for Bhushan Power and Steel along with Tata Steel and with JSW Steel revising its initial bid last week. The final verdict on the asset is still awaited."
54,2018-07-30,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel’s decision to make a revised offer has cheered lenders who are hoping that they will see lower haircuts while resolving the Bhushan Power and Steel case, the company that is facing bankruptcy proceedings.

The move comes at a time when the two other bidders — Tata Steel and Liberty House — are involved in a legal tussle to acquire the steel company.

Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel has revised its offer by 60 per cent, from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore. Tata Steel’s offer stands at Rs 17,000 crore, while that of Liberty House is at Rs 18,500 crore.

Tata Steel has moved the bankruptcy court, arguing that Liberty’s bid be declared invalid since they made their offer 12 days after the deadline, while Liberty House has claimed that lenders have not followed a transparent process in selecting the highest bidder.

Following JSW Steel’s revised bid, lenders have called for fresh financial bids from all three applicants by Tuesday morning.

“With steel companies in demand, we expect aggressive bids from the three applicants. This will reduce haircuts that banks may have taken otherwise,” said a bank CEO who did not wish to be identified.

Haircut is the amount of loan that banks would write off to settle a non-performing loan.

“The only worry is the possibility of either of the two bidders moving the tribunal questioning the lenders’ decision to invite fresh bids,” he said.

These worries stem from the fact that lenders had declared Tata Steel as the highest bidder although a voting in favour has yet not taken place.

Tata Steel was declared H1, or the highest bidder, while JSW Steel was H2, or the second higher bidder, and Liberty House stood third, lenders told ET.

Liberty House, which made the highest offer, was disqualified since it failed to furnish critical information on its funding arrangement to acquire Bhushan Power within a given timeframe, despite repeated reminders.

The Sanjay Singal-promoted Bhushan Power and Steel faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore. The offer of Rs 17,000 crore to lenders from Tatas would imply 66 per cent haircut for lenders.



ET could not verify the details of JSW Steel’s offer in terms of payment to lenders and operational creditors, but lenders are hoping that their offer to be better than the other two bidders.

The fair value of the Bhushan Power is pegged at Rs 24,000 crore. Meanwhile, for Bhushan Steel, which was acquired by the Tatas, lenders took a haircut of 37 per cent.

In case of Electrosteel Steels, which is acquired by Vedanta, the haircut was around 50 per cent. Haircut was the highest at 75 per cent in case of Monnet Ispat, which was acquired by JSW Steel."

0,2018-08-01,JSW,"MUMBAI: Lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel have received only one revised bid –– from JSW Steel –– for the bankrupt company as the other two suitors — Tata Steel and Liberty House — have not amended the offers they previously made, two senior officials with knowledge of the matter said.

JSW has revised its bid even as the higher bankruptcy court has directed lenders not to open bids received in the second round and instead evaluate those filed in the first round. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal has directed lenders to submit to it in sealed covers the bids they received.

JSW Steel, which had offered Rs 11,000 crore in the first round, increased the offer by more than 60% to Rs 18,000 crore on Thursday evening. After JSW made the revised offer, lenders decided to invite a fresh round of financial bids from the three applicants by Tuesday morning.




“Only JSW Steel has given a revised bid. The resolution professional will submit this bid to the tribunal tomorrow (Wednesday),” said a senior official.

Tata Steel, meanwhile, moved the appellate tribunal claiming that the lenders’ move was not in line with the insolvency and bankruptcy code.

In the first round which closed on February 8, Tata Steel had offered Rs 17,000 crore. Liberty House made an Rs 18,500 crore bid 12 days after the deadline.

Lenders had earlier declared Tata Steel as H1, or the highest bidder, and JSW Steel as H2. Liberty House was disqualified as it failed to furnish critical information about funding arrangement within the given timeframe. Sanjay Singal-promoted Bhushan Power & Steel faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore.

Lenders claim that since they had not yet voted in favour of any company, they are justified in inviting fresh bids. Tatas, on the other hand, is of the view that since lenders had declared the company the H1 bidder and began negotiations with it, calling for revised bids was violation of the bankruptcy law."

2,2018-08-02,JSW,"MUMBAI: A higher bench of the bankruptcy court on Wednesday directed lenders to invite fresh bids for Bhushan Power & Steel in a move aimed to maximise the recoveries of stressed loans.

Lenders have been asked to invite bids from the three applicants –– Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Liberty House –– by Monday.

The ruling comes in response to a plea from Tata Steel that banks have violated bankruptcy norms. National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya has asked lenders to seek revised bids and submit it in a sealed envelope. The next hearing is scheduled for August 17.

After lenders declared Tata Steel as highest bidder for Bhushan Power, lenders received a revised offer JSW Steel last Thursday. Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel revised its offer by over 60% from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore.

The revised offer prompted lenders to give all applicants a second chance to revise offers by Tuesday. Only JSW Steel gave a revised offer, while other two applicants refrained . Although the tribunal has asked lenders to invite fresh bids, there is a possibility of Tatas moving Supreme Court against the NCLAT’s order.

Tatas had objected to a late bid by Liberty which came 12 days after the deadline and they again moved the court when banks decided to go for a second round of bids. In the first round which closed on February 8, Tata Steel had offered Rs 17,000 crore. Liberty House had made an Rs 18,500-crore bid 12 days after the deadline. Lenders were forced to consider Liberty’s offer although it came after the deadline following a directive by NCLAT. Lenders had earlier declared Tata Steel as H1, or the highest bidder, and JSW Steel H2.

Liberty was disqualified by lenders as it failed to furnish critical information on funding arrangement within a given timeframe.

Most lenders hope that the applicants would bid aggressively to acquire Bhushan Power & Steel to bring down losses for banks.

If lenders accept the original offer from Tatas, they would have to take a haircut of 66%. Haircut is the amount of loans that lenders have to write off to settle a loan."

5,2018-08-06,JSW,"MUMBAI: The higher bench of the bankruptcy court has extended the deadline for applicants to submit revised debt resolution plans for Bhushan Power & Steel under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code by a week to August 13.

National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday directed all the three bidders — Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Liberty House — to submit unconditional bids to the court in a sealed envelope on or before next Monday.

The decision means that the revised bids will be opened after the Supreme Court hears a Tata Steel appeal challenging NCLAT’s order that permitted the resolution professional (RP) for Bhushan Power & Steel to accept revised bids. The top court is scheduled to hear the plea on August 10.

The next hearing of NCLAT is scheduled for August 17.

In the first round of bidding, which closed on February 8, Tata Steel had offered Rs 17,000 crore and JSW Steel offered Rs 11,000 crore. Liberty House had made Rs 18,500-crore bid 12 days after the deadline. Lenders were forced to consider Liberty’s offer following a directive by NCLAT.

Early last month, lenders declared Tata Steel as H1, or the highest bidder, and JSW Steel H2, while disqualifying Liberty that had failed to furnish critical information about funding arrangement within the stipulated timeframe. On July 27, JSW Steel revised their offer by 60% to rs 18000 crore following which lenders decided to invite revised bids from all applicants. But Tata's objected to this proposal. 

On August 1, the higher bench of bankruptcy court allowed lenders to accept revised bids after JSW Steel revised its offer by 60% to Rs 18,000 crore from Rs 11,000 crore.

This prompted Tata Steel to move the Supreme Court.

According to lenders, the revised offer from JSW Steel changed the entire matrix. While they are hopeful on lower haircut, the resolution might be delayed further due to litigations.

Sanjay Singal-promoted Bhushan Power & Steel is among the 12 companies that the Reserve bank of India (RBI) had directed banks to refer to the bankruptcy court. It faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore from financial creditors.

Of the 12 accounts referred to the bankruptcy court a year ago, only in two cases — Bhushan Steel and Electrosteel Steels — banks have received the settlement amount.

7,2018-08-08,JSW,"As June quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark amid mixed reviews, 27 BSE500 companies have reported doubling of net profit on a year-on-year basis.

Some of them had a poor base from the after-effect from demonetisation. Data showed some 250 of BSE500 companies have released their quarterly number as of August 7, logging a combined 10 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 90,025 crore.

As many as 25 of them have together reported a 320 per cent jump in profit. 

For instance, Intellect Design Arena posted Rs 43.50 crore profit for June quarter, clocking a 5,500 per cent rise over Rs 0.70 crore reported for the same quarter last year. Net sales swelled 24 per cent YoY. The stock is up over 21 per cent since the beginning of this financial year.

Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Intellect Design with a target price of Rs 265. “Order traction is intact, as backlogs grew 14 per cent QoQ to Rs 1,190 crore. The company added four large deals in Q1, including a large Rs 100 crore deal from a European Bank, indicating improved business traction even in an advanced market,” Emkay said in a report.

Ceat is next on the list, having posted 4,346 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 72 crore against Rs 1.60 crore in the same period last year. BASF India and Emami reported 3,496 per cent and 2,463 per cent YoY rise in Q1 profits.

Reliance Securities is bullish on Ceat with a price target of Rs 1,750.

“Coat’s operating performance should improve further in the ensuing quarters with a likely improvement in volume and product mix. The company’s new products like Milaze X3 and Puncture safe tyre have received good response and would help it gain market share. Its improving brand image and network expansion would help grow volumes,” the brokerage said in a note.

The stock is also looking attractive after the recent fall in share price, it said.

Emkay has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Emami with a 12-month price target of Rs 610. “We expect Emami to deliver sales and earnings CAGR of 16 per cent and 20 per cent over FY18-20E, but certain downside risks remain,” Emkay said in a report.

Among others, Dr Reddy’s, Tata Power, Chennai Petroleum Corporation and Prism Johnson posted YoY quarterly profit growth of between 300 per cent and 650 per cent, while net sales expanded between 4 per cent and 13 per cent during the quarter. 

Others like JSW Steel, Oberoi Realty, Glaxosmithkline Pharma, Ashok Leyland, Heidelberg Cement and Jubilant Food have also logged profit growth of between 200 and 300 per cent YoY. Oberoi Realty posted more than 200 per cent jump in sales during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Oberoi Realty with a price target of Rs 616. “We remain positive on Oberoi Realty due to its strong balance sheet with ample room for leveraging to buy new land and strong brand equity, which helps it command premium pricing and enter into JD/JV/DM contracts,” the brokerage said.

Among others, BSE500 index companies like Bharat Financial Inclusion, Apollo Tyre, Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Mahindra CIE Automotive, Atul Ltd, Gateway Distriparks, Tejas Networks, Jindal Stainless, Network 18 Media, IFB Industries, Phillips Carbon Black and L&T Technology Services posted profit growth in excess of 100 per cent for the quarter.

Global research firm CGS-CIMB is positive on Bank of Baroda (BOB) with a price target of Rs 220.

“BOB is still among the best placed public sector lenders, with strong capital ratios and improving loan growth, and we expect asset quality to improve from here on. A revival in net interest margins as low yield loans are substituted with higher yield loans and emphasis on quality loan growth are positives, which will improve profitability. We cut our FY19/20F earnings forecasts by 13.5 per cent/11.7 per cent to reflect higher ageing related NPL provisions. We value BOB at 1.2 times FY20F P/BV, based on a sustainable ROE of 11.4 per cent. A prolonged NPL cycle is a risk,” it said in a report.

Sterlite Technologies, General Insurance Corporation, Indiabulls Ventuers, Supreme Petrochem, Mahindra Lifespace, BHEL and Escorts saw profit growth in excess of 90 per cent during the quarter."
10,2018-08-09,JSW,"Market continued with its upmove and reported yet another closing high, as the NSE benchmark Nifty ended with a gain of 20.70 points or 0.18 per cent.

The index has continued with its unabated rally, but off late the range has been getting narrower.

Thursday’s trade also saw the Nifty trading in a narrow 25-point range throughout the session. The volumes too have been either lower-than-average or heavily stock-specific in nature.

The upcoming session is likely to see a subdued start to the trade. In event of any uptick that may be seen in the initial trade, there are probabilities of the Nifty facing retracement from higher levels.

Friday may continue to see the levels of 11,495 and 11,530 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in lower at 11,410 and 11,330 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 74.4825 and it continued to trade in the overbought territory. Apart from a black body that emerged on the candles, no major formations were seen.


ETMarkets.com
Pattern analysis showed that the Nifty continued with its upmove post breaking above the 11,170-11,175 zones. At present, it trades overbought and stares at some imminent consolidation from the higher levels.

Overall, despite the buoyant structure and the unabated upmoves, if we speak of immediate short-term horizon, some retracement from higher levels is overdue.

Given the overbought nature on the charts, Nifty is staring at imminent retracement from the higher levels with each upmove. It is also important to note that though downsides, if any, may not be much, but volatility tend to increase during such corrective bouts that result into broader consolidation.

We recommend staying away from aggressive purchases and refrain from chasing the momentum blindly.

We recommend taking the market very cautiously and continue to maintain highly stock-specific approach for the day.

11,2018-08-10,JSW,"By Anirban Nag

India’s economic activity is picking up, boosted by a long-awaited recovery in consumption that’s helped cut down slack in the economy and underpinned sales of everything from cars to housing.

Almost 60 percent of gross domestic product comes from private spending, according to estimates from New York-based CEIC Data Co., with the pick-up helping to fuel growth of more than 7 percent this year, making India the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Yet the performance isn’t uniform across all industries, with the banking and power sectors facing distress and global trade tensions clouding the outlook for exports.


Here’s a detailed look at which sectors are ticking and those that are ailing:


The Leaders

Automobiles
The auto industry is on a strong footing. While demand is broad-based across markets, rural India appears to be doing particularly well, which is reflected in sales of two-wheelers and tractors. Companies such as Maruti Suzuki and Ashok Leyland are taking advantage of stronger demand by passing on higher prices to consumers.



“Rural India appears to be doing particularly well, which is reflected in strong growth in the two-wheeler and tractor industry,” analysts led by Hitesh Goel at Kotak Institutional Equities said.


Oil and Gas
If the automotive sector is doing well, can oil be far behind? India’s energy appetite is surging, courtesy of its expanding middle-class and unrelenting demand to power a growing fleet of trucks, cars and motorbikes. The government’s push for cleaner air by encouraging the use of cooking gas is driving refiners and attracting global majors such as Saudi Arabian Oil Co. to Rosneft PJSC.



However, an over-dependence on imports makes the nation vulnerable to a sustained spike in oil prices that can chip away at demand.


Consumer Goods
Another bright spot is the sector for fast-moving consumer goods, which is ranked as the fourth-largest in the economy by think-tank India Brand Equity Foundation. It’s recovered well from the demand-disruptive and chaotic introduction of a consumption tax last year. Analysts see additional support for the sector coming from higher wages for millions of government workers as well as expectations of a recovery in farming due to higher guaranteed prices for some crops and a pick-up in public spending ahead of elections.




Steel and Cement
The steel industry, which contributes almost 2 percent to GDP, has been reaping the benefits of increasing local demand and higher prices. Tata Steel Ltd.’s sales during April through June climbed 8 percent year-on-year driven by automotive and special products’ demand, while JSW Steel Ltd. clocked a 11 percent growth in group sales. That’s on top of steel consumption already rising to the highest in at least five years in the year ended March, according to data from the Steel Ministry.


Bloomberg
Exports have, however, been declining this year because of protectionist measures taken by key consuming countries to protect local manufacturing.

Cement manufacturers are facing a more uneven recovery as rising input prices eats into profit margins. Nevertheless, higher government spending to build infrastructure and affordable housing in the run-up to next year’s elections should underpin demand.


Aviation
This is one sector that’s continued to see double-digit traffic and capacity growth, as more people take to flying and carriers expand their fleet. But India is also the most price-sensitive of the world’s large airline markets, and an oil price rally is a risk to growth.


Bloomberg
“Low oil prices which helped stimulate air-travel demand will now act as a drag on industry profitability and will slow capacity additions,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Rahul Kapoor wrote in a note. “We remain long-term positive but see near-term headwinds,” he said.


The Stragglers

Banking
While demand for bank loans is growing from a year ago, the industry’s gross bad-loan ratio may increase to 12.2 percent in the fiscal year through March 2019 -- the highest in almost two decades -- from 11.6 percent last year, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India. The deterioration in asset quality is eroding capital buffers at the lenders and curtailing their ability to take on financing for large projects.


Bloomberg

What Our Economists Say...
“Nearly one in every six rupees of credit advanced by public-sector banks has already turned sour. As interest rates rise, debt burdens may prove to be too much for firms on the edge -- creating more bad debt in the year ahead.”

--Abhishek Gupta, India economist, Bloomberg Economics

Power
The industry is another big laggard and a cause of headaches for bankers and policy makers. It’s plagued by fuel shortages and companies face difficulties securing long-term supply contracts with the country’s money-losing electricity distributors. Nearly 40 percent of coal-fired power generation capacity is lying unused.


Bloomberg
Loans totaling at least $38 billion are at risk of being written-off in the power sector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates. The sector is also reeling from the 2014 court-ordered loss of coal mining permits, as well as financing and cash-flow concerns that make revival difficult."
12,2018-08-10,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Most metal & mining stocks were suffering losses in Friday's trading session, keeping the sectoral index down. 

The BSE Metal index was trading 0.96 per cent down at 13,157 around 12:55 pm.

Jindal Steel & Power (down 3.64 per cent) was the top loser of the pack. Shares of the private steelmaker fell despite, as per PTI, it reported Rs 109.89 crore consolidated net profit for the June quarter.

The company had incurred Rs 421.43 crore loss during the same quarter a year ago, Jindal Steel and Power said in a BSE filing. 

Steel Authority of India (SAIL) (down 1.74 per cent), Vedanta (down 1.54 per cent), Nalco (down 1.45 per cent) and Coal India (down 1.29 per cent) too were incurring losses. 

JSW Steel (down 0.63 per cent), Tata Steel (down 0.46 per cent), Hindustan Zinc (down 0.42 per cent) and Hindalco Industries (down 0.40 per cent) fell up to half-a-per cent.

NMDC (up 0.70 per cent) was the only stock that was up around that time. 

Weak global cues hit market sentiment after lingering trade war worries made Asian stocks suffer, following a new round of US sanctions on Russia.

The BSE Sensex was 100 points at 37,924, while the NSE Nifty50 index was down 28 points at 11,443. 

ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, HDFC and State Bank of India were among the top drag on Sensex index."
13,2018-08-11,JSW,"Pharmaceutical major Lupin could see selling to the tune of ₹210 crore by exchange traded funds if it is excluded from the benchmark Nifty in the upcoming index review, said institutional brokerage ICICI Securities.

 JSW Steel, which is the most likely candidate to replace Lupin in the index could witness buying worth ₹360 crore by ETFs upon inclusion in the Nifty, said the brokerage.

 An index fund is a mutual fund which tries to mirror a market index as closely as possible by investing in all the stocks that comprise that index in proportions which is equal to the weightage of those stocks in the index. Any inclusion or exclusion, therefore, is likely to have a corresponding impact on the stock.

“Active funds wanting to align their holdings with benchmark indices could further add to the buy/sell momentum,” said ICICI Securities.

Lupin’s exit could also have an impact on the sector’s weightage in the index. The pharmaceutical sector, which has been losing weight in the Nifty due to decline in free float market capitalisation as a result of underperformance, could see its weightage dip to levels last seen post the Lehman crisis after Lupin’s exclusion, said ICICI Securities.

“Lupin’s exit comes after the exit of Aurobindo Pharma in the previous reconstitution in April 2018 and will result in pharma sector weight dipping to 2.7% in the NIFTY50. The drop of 430 bps (basis points) weight of pharma in the index since its March 2015 high of 7% is the highest across sectors in that period,” said ICICI Securities.

The analysis by the brokerage on float market capitalisations and weight calculations are based on free float market capitalisations at the end of July while the actual weightages in the reconstituted Nifty index would be based on August-end free float market capitalisations.

The index reshuffle will come into effect from September 28 and the announcement could come between now and September 1.

The index could also become marginally cheaper, to 20.53 times on a forward price-to-earnings basis from 20.69 times, as the likely new entrant in the index has a much lower price-toearnings ratio compared to the stock which is likely to exit, said ICICI Securities.

The situation would have been different if Britannia Industries were to be included in the index as the stock has a higher P/E and higher return on equity which would have increased the multiple of the index rather than decrease it.

However, the brokerage said that Britannia’s average free float market capitalisation in the six months to July is lower than JSW Steel’s, which is why the biscuit maker is likely to miss out on entry into the Nifty, said the brokerage."
14,2018-08-13,JSW,"Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, India Infoline, tells ET Now that top midcap idea would be the consumption plays like Havells, Voltas. 
  
  
  Edited excerpts:

Do you think there is a strong case for a re-rating in SBI after its numbers?
Any decline should be a buying opportunity. In the last two weeks, corporate banks have taken the lead from the front and whether it is Axis or ICICI. SBI numbers were well in line. They have done all the provisioning which was to be done over a year in one quarter. Mr Rajnish Kumar is a standout performer and he has guided for at least a Rs 50,000- crore write back in the next two to three quarters. I would buy any decline. If the stock price gets closer to Rs 285, start adding it in your portfolio. Bond yields have peaked and inflation and rates may maintain status quo for some time. SBI would definitely be a buy on all declines.


While a constrictive price action is visible in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India, there is no real evidence of credit growth. The fact that NPAs are coming down is great news. But what about the basic business? Banks are in the business of lending and the lending cycle has really not picked up.
That is the market expectation. Consumption and retail credit are strong points and private capex is going to be the next. The only obstacle is what would be the election volatility? Corporate results and macros are very positive. Whether it is IIP numbers, bond yields or overall GDP, it is telling us that most of the pessimism is behind us. Most of the banks have cleaned their balance sheets and now they are on the cusp of lending more. 

As for recapitalisation. SBI already has enough capital. It is just not retail or mortgage lending but the whole gamut of corporate expansion on private capex which is going to pick up. And markets are always forward looking. If you had to be a foreign fund manager and you were underweight India, the first thing you will do is catch liquid names. 

So ICICI, Axis banks stand out and the consumption part has always been expensive. It is going to be at a premium to the broader market that banks are going to take on the expectation that the next two quarters could surprise you on the upside on credit expansion and earnings could catch up over a period of time.


Would you say Hindalco and Tata Steel are the outliers within the commodities space?
Correct. It is Hindalco and on the ferrous side, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and SAIL are the outstanding plays. The idea is to buy the weakness in these stocks. Seven-ten days back, Hindalco was available at Rs 195 and that was when you had to go for the kill. Aleris was the buyout. Novelis is performing better than ever. It is the best historical quarter they have had and that tells us that they are the best plays on the global outlook. 

If they are doing an acquisition at this cycle which is just about to be peaking, then they can still see a lot of visibility on commodities for the next three-four-five years. I am extremely bullish on the commodity pattern and any decline in Hindalco, Tata Steel or a JSW, should be a buying opportunity. While Hindalco provided a buying opportunity at Rs 195, for Ashok Leyland, it is Rs 104 because of the axle norms and so on. That stock is again being an outperformer.


What is your top idea from the midcap space?
My top idea would be the consumption plays like Havells, Voltas, which have been outperformers. However, my dark horse sector continues to be power. We have been bullish on Adani Power from 22 levels. Now they have got the gas licenses. We think that could be a dark horse. CG power is something which we very much are bullish on from the Rs 58 level and we like some of the power financers. So, 74 and 95 is where we have been bullish on PFC. In REC, we still see a 30% upside.

Everyone, six months back was overweight on China and not highlighting the issues related to the trade balance. Now, what you have actually seen in EM selloff on currency is also the weakness in the offshore Chinese yuan. We have been an outperformer but we do not want to pat our backs. We will continue to see enlarged flows from the next quarter and this weakness in rupee will also be short-lived. So, the underlying mantra remains buy India on any fall because that could be an outperformer in 2019."

16,2018-08-13,JSW,"Tata Steel has submitted a revised bid for Bhushan Power & Steel on Monday evening after the Supreme Court rejected their plea to stay a directive from higher bankruptcy court which last week allowed lenders to accept fresh bids from all applicants.

It is not known how much Tata's have offered in the revised bid. They had earlier offered Rs 17000 crore to lenders. 

The committee of creditors will review all the three offers on Tuesday and inform the higher bench of bankruptcy court about preferred bidder on August 16. 

Soon after lenders informed Tata Steel that they are higher bidder for Bhushan Power, JSW Steel gave a revised offer of RS 18000 crore to the resolution professional. JSW Steel had earlier offered Rs 11000 crore was declared second higher bidder. 

On receiving JSW Steel offer lenders decided to invite all three applicants to submit a revised bid. In response to this, Tata's moved the higher bankruptcy court - NCLAT National Company Law Appelate Tribunal - which permitted lenders to accept revised bids. Tata's moved the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order, who also refused to stay the order.

JSW Steel had initially offered Rs 11,000 crore in the first round closed on February 8. In the last week of July, in an unsolicited move, it revised the bid to Rs 18,000 crore, soon after the lenders informed Tata Steel that it was the top bidder after the first round.




JSW Steel’s latest offer is 77% higher than its original bid. If Bhushan Power’s lenders accept the bid, it will result in a lower haircut.

But it will still be less than half the Rs 49,264 crore the company owes to financial creditors. Haircut is the amount that lenders have to forgo to settle a non-performing loan “At a marathon meeting held on Tuesday, lenders reviewed the bids received from the three bidders. The evaluation of the bids and ranking of bids are yet to be done,” said a lender representative who attended the meeting. “Based on the evaluation matrix and the offer received, it appears that JSW Steel could emerge as the highest bidder if the court allows lenders to accept revised offers,” he added.

In the first round, JSW Steel was declared the second highest bidder, with lenders disqualifying Liberty House since it failed to provide critical information about funding the takeover of the bankrupt company. After JSW Steel made a revised bid on July 27, lenders decided to give the other two applicants — Tata Steel and Liberty — an opportunity to revise their offers as well. But Tata Steel approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, the appellate court on bankruptcy cases, opposing the lenders move. The NCLAT ordered lenders to accept revised bids and asked them to submit those to the court on August 17. Tata Steel then moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the NCLAT order, but the top court too ruled in favour of lenders accepting revisedbids."

22,2018-08-17,JSW,"Kolkata: Speciality steels and wire rope maker Usha Martin has bounced back into the black in the first quarter of the current financial year with a standalone net profit of Rs 19 crore against a loss of Rs 98 crore in the year-ago period, driven by improved realisations and strong domestic demand.

The turnaround came even as the Kolkata-based company continued to hold discussions on sale of its steel business with potential buyers such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Liberty House and Kalyani Steels to pare its Rs 3,700-crore debt.

Standalone revenue increased to Rs 1,219.86 crore in the quarter to June, up 30.3% from Rs 936 crore a year ago, while total EBITDA shot up 120.8% and 94.1% year-on-year on standalone and consolidated basis respectively.

“Our performance in wire ropes and in steel during the quarter was better than last year mainly due to better realisation and strong market demand. Barring oil and gas sector, the domestic market is also seeing good traction for wire ropes, particularly from mining and infrastructure,” Usha Martin CFO Rohit Nanda said.

He said that although the company saw cost pressure building up during the quarter, as input prices went up, it was able to pass on the price hike due to buoyant demand.

While the company’s wire ropes business improved significantly during 2017-18 from the previous year, a revival in its steel business has helped boost margins in recent quarters. Sale of wire ropes went up 13% during the quarter to 15,162 tonnes, from 13,376 tonnes a year ago. Exports totalled 7,345 tonnes, up from 5,513 tonnes in the year-ago period, with a 48.4% share of output. However, domestic wire rope sales were marginally lower at 7,817 tonnes, from 7,863 tonnes.

Both wire ropes and speciality steels, barring large diameter ropes used in oil sector, have been seeing capacity utilisation levels of 80-90%, according to the company, and the trend is expected to continue. The company makes speciality wires and wire ropes used in elevators, mining, and oil and gas sectors, and has a one million tonne steel plant that makes speciality steels.

However, the company’s performance in the ongoing July-September quarter is likely to be muted mainly on account of the monsoon, which traditionally affects steel demand. Therefore, it is planning a regular maintenance shutdown of its blast furnace during this period. 

The company hopes its performance will pick up in the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal and help maintain a steady growth momentum.

Nanda said there is “good interest” in the steel business from potential buyers who are conducting “due diligence” and the process is on regarding potential sale of the business. However, he declined to comment on a time frame within which the company hopes to conclude the deliberations."
23,2018-08-18,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: When a clutch of foreign investors recently voted against the reappointment of Deepak Parekh, one of the senior-most persons in the corporate and financial world, for “over-boarding” — or, presence in boards of more than 6 companies — many, probably including Parekh and his team, were stunned, even outraged. First, corporate India has no law against “over-boarding”; second, does it really make a difference?

But there aren’t many who are on the same boat with Parekh. Among the non-executive chairmen in the list of BSE100 companies — the universe of Indian listed entities that primarily interest the foreign portfolio investors — only Kumar Mangalam Birla and Harsh Mariwala have presence in boards of more than 5 companies.

Do they have to grapple with a similar predicament as Parekh?

Harsh Mariwala (similar to Parekh) is non-executive chairman of Marico and Kaya (both group companies), and is on the boards of L&T Finance Holdings, Zensar Technologies, Aster DM Healthcare, JSW Steel and Thermax. In contrast, Birla is director only on the boards of his group companies.

While Birla declined to respond to queries from ET, Mariwala spelt out his views that possibly echoes the belief among corporates.

“I endorse the view that multiple directorships beyond a reasonable limit may pose challenges to a director in allocating sufficient time to the companies, thus hindering his ability to play an effective role. In light of which the Kotak Committee on corporate governance recommended a limit of seven listed companies for a director to hold positions in and the same has been enforced by Sebi through its recent amendments to the listing regulations. While global views on this differ as they treat a director having more than 5 public directorships as overboarded versus 7 public directorships which is the limit in India, investors need to give due regard to some of the factors like the capability of the individual serving the board, his contribution to the company, the needs of the board on which he serves and the depth and quality of executive leadership, when they (the investors) are insinuated with such views from the proxy firms,” said Mariwala, founder and chairman of Marico.



According to him, the law in India has already put many checks and balances in place to ensure that each director fulfils his fiduciary responsibility.

Birla and Mariwala each serve on boards of nine and seven publicly-listed companies, respectively. FPI holding in companies such as Idea Cellular, Grasim Industries, Ultratech Cement, Hindalco and Marico is more than 20%.

ISS, the global proxy advisory firm, had voted against Parekh’s re-appointment on ‘over-boarding’ concern since he served on boards of more than six listed firms. Explaining the reason for voting against the re-appointment of Parekh, ISS has mentioned in its voting recommendation report: ‘investors may be concerned whether directors are able to fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities when they are serving on a large number of boards, as in this case. While the demands of each board will vary, and the capacity of each person will vary, holding the equivalent of more than six directorships with publicly-listed companies may make it challenging for a director to devote adequate time to the affairs of each company’. None of the chairmen of companies from the S&P 100 and FTSE 100 indices serve on more than four and six listed companies, respectively.

These checks, said Mariwala, take various forms — public disclosure of attendance of directors, limit on his membership in board committees, board evaluation, recommendation of re-appointment based on the outcome of evaluation, succession planning, provisions on disqualification of directors, etc.

“Merely, a number on directorships may not necessarily hinder the capability of a director in fulfilling his duties but one has to evaluate the ends and means of a board before deciding if a person can be boarded or not to be boarded, else, it may go on to deprive a company from retaining a good leadership/independent directorship,” he said.

However, he agrees that corporates should take a cue from this to strengthen their disclosures as regards to matters like appointment or re-appointment of directors for investors as well as proxy advisory firms to take pragmatic views on such matters.

While the global norms consider more than six companies to be over-boarding, the Sebi regulations notified in May this year have a slightly higher threshold for individuals having board memberships in listed firms.

The newly notified Sebi (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 limits the number of directorship of a person to eight listed entities with effect from April 1, 2019 and not more than seven listed entities with effect from April 1, 2020."

25,2018-08-22,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Tuesday’s session saw the markets trading in a capped range and showing all signs of a probable consolidation. Though a positive bias came to the fore, the upmoves continued to remain limited. The benchmark Nifty50 ended the day logging a modest gain of 19.15 points, or 0.17 per cent. While getting mildly overbought on the Daily Chart as well, the markets continued to overextend itself on higher timeframe charts as well.

We will approach Thursday’s trade after a trading holiday and we will have world markets to catch up with. The global environment remains stable and this may once again lead us to see a stable opening on Thursday. 

However, the analysis continues to remain on similar lines and we recommend a high degree of caution as we now deal with and chase the marginal upmoves the markets are giving while remaining overextended.

The Thursday’s trade is likely to see the levels of 11,585 and 11,620 acting as immediate resistance levels. Supports come in lower at 11,540 and 11,470 zones.



The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Charts is 70.5727 and now trades in mildly overbought territory. RSI continues to show bearish divergence against the price. Daily MACD too remains bearish as it trades below its signal line. 

On the Candles, a spinning top occurred. It also resembled a not-so-classic long lower shadow, but in any case, it may potentially halt the current upmove. However, this needs confirmation on the following bar.
This is the time when we continue to chase the momentum on the higher side, but do it now with great degree of caution. Blind chase of momentum may see traders getting caught unawares if a corrective bout is encountered at higher levels.

The Nifty, despite remaining secularly bullish, also stares at a possible minor corrective bout at higher levels. We recommend keeping positions extremely selective and moderate and guard profits vigilantly at higher levels. Though shorts may be avoided and dips, if any, may be used for making purchases, approach to the markets should be kept highly stock specific and selective. Cautious view is advised for the day.

26,2018-08-23,JSW,"By Vrishti Beniwal and P R SanjaiFrom Mercedes-Benz AG to Unilever, companies in India are finding power to pass on higher costs to consumers, a sign that demand in the world’s fastest-growing major economy is well-entrenched.

After the twin shocks of a cash ban in 2016 and the chaotic introduction of a consumption tax last year, India’s economic recovery is gaining momentum. Businesses are taking advantage of the solid demand to raise prices, lifting profits, but also fanning inflation at a time of higher oil prices and a currency slump.

More than 1,200 manufacturing firms -- both small and large -- polled by the Reserve Bank of India reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices. The central bank raised interest rate twice since June to the highest in two years to curb price pressures and support the rupee amid a sell-off in emerging market currencies.

The stronger growth outlook has underpinned a 13 percent gain this year in India’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index to a record high, making it Asia’s best-performer. “There is a sense that the economy has come out of the difficult phase,” Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College in London, said, referring to the pick up in manufacturing activity as consumer confidence improves. The decision of companies to raise prices “seem to be reflecting this underlying reality,” he said.


Bloomberg
Here’s a look at sectors that have got their pricing mojo back and others on the cusp of rediscovering it:


Automobiles
With double-digit growth in monthly vehicle sales for most of the year so far, companies including Suzuki Motor Corp.’s India unit, Ashok Leyland Ltd. and Mercedes-Benz are raising prices. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. increased prices last week by up to 6,100 rupees a unit ($88) across models citing higher commodity prices, distribution costs and adverse foreign exchange rates. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. also plans to hike prices by up to 2 percent from August.


Steel
A surge in global steel prices has given Indian steelmakers, including JSW Steel Ltd., Tata Steel Ltd., and Steel Authority of India Ltd. the ability to raise product prices by 8 percent to 10 percent this year. China’s curbs on steel output, global trade protection measures and robust domestic demand will keep prices firm going forward. Steel futures in Shanghai were at the highest in seven years on Tuesday.


Consumer Goods
Fast-moving consumer goods, which is ranked as the fourth-largest sector in the economy by think-tank India Brand Equity Foundation, is a bright spot in terms of demand. That’s given companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the local unit of Unilever, room to raise prices in some goods.

Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., a homegrown FMCG company, has already increased prices of some products and plans more in hair colors, toiletries and air fresheners with the impact likely to be reflected from this quarter. Dabur India Ltd. has hinted at a 3 percent to 4 percent price increase in product prices to mitigate inflationary pressure.


Bloomberg

Cement
It’s a mixed bag for cement manufacturers. Rising input costs are squeezing profit margins of cement makers and the monsoon season is a dampener, but higher government spending on building houses for the poor ahead of elections could jack up sales.

“While the demand momentum is healthy, rising supplies have not resulted in a significant increase in the cement prices,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president and group head at ICRA Ltd., the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service.

What Our Economists Say... Besides the cost-push shock arising from elevated oil prices, companies are also facing a rising cost of borrowing -- be it bank credit or corporate bond issuance. Looking ahead, the cost-push shock is already on its way out with oil prices now stabilizing at current levels of under $75 per barrel. Also, growth is likely to lose support of favorable base effects going ahead. Inflation has already started surprising to the downside.


Aviation
Some businesses aren’t in a position to pass on costs. Airlines haven’t increased fares despite higher fuel costs and a double-digit growth in passenger traffic. InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which operates IndiGo, the budget carrier with almost two-fifths of India’s domestic market, reported a 97 percent drop in its quarterly profit.

Current fare levels are “not sustainable,” yet IndiGo has “no choice” but to keep offering them amid an intense pricing war, Chairman Rahul Bhatia told analysts in July. Debt-ridden Jet Airways India Ltd. has postponed announcement of its first-quarter results as a budget-flight boom crimps margins of full-service carriers."

At the meet, a leading biennial international event for industry professionals, he is poised to discuss current challenges faced the industry with global leaders and captains of the domestic steel Industry. 

Platforms like MMMM 2018 provide a timely opportunity for stakeholders to promote their products, technologies and services, Bhaskar Chatterjee, Secretary General, Indian Steel Association said. This is particularly true at a time when passage of two important policies by the steel ministry -- National Steel Policy 2017 and Policy on Preference to Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products – have brought to the fore concerns like, enhancing raw material security, fostering R&D activities, reducing import dependency and promoting fair international trade.

T V Narendran Tata Steel CEO said the steel sector has been witnessing a positive growth and this trend will continue with improving economic activities across the world. While minerals and metals sector currently contribute around 4.5% of GDP, this is expected to go up in the years ahead in view of the National Steel policy target of achieving a production of 300 million tonne per annum by 2030, he added.

With the US government maintaining anti-dumping duties on steel bars from India but scrapping it for Japan, Spain, and Brazil recently, MMMM 2018 will offer a good opportunity for all stakeholders to meet, interact and network with entrepreneurs, consultants, editors, senior government officials, decision makers and industry leaders,” Sanjeev Batra, Director- ITEI said. There will be a special session on Recycling and Lithium-ion batteries at the meet, which is likely to receive over 12,000 trade visitors and over 1,000 foreign investors and participants from across the globe.

31,2018-08-27,JSW,"Resurgent Power Ventures, a company backed by the Tata Group and ICICI Ventures, has submitted what may be a better offer for Prayagraj Power Generation Company than JSW Energy’s bid, even though they both appear to be the same at about Rs 6,000 crore.

JSW Energy’s offer is laced with conditions that make it less attractive, said two senior bank officials who did not want to be identified.

While Resurgent Power’s bid involves upfront cash of Rs 6,000 crore to acquire Prayagraj Power and equity for the lenders, JSW Energy’s offer works out to about Rs 3,800 crore with equity.

The bank officials told ET that JSW Energy has set a condition that all tax liabilities arising from the transaction would have to be deducted from its offer of Rs 5,940 crore.

Following JSW Energy’s offer, the lenders appointed consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess the tax liabilities of Prayagraj Power. PwC indicated the tax liability could be as high as Rs 2,200 crore, making JSW Energy’s offer effectively Rs 3,740 crore.

Resurgent Power is a fund with focus on power projects. JSW Energy operates 4,543 MW of thermal, hydel and solar power generation capacity in India and seeks to achieve 10,000 MW by 2020, according to the company website. The company is controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal.

Originally, Resurgent Power had submitted an expression of interest for Prayagraj Power, without a binding bid. Soon after JSW Energy emerged as the highest bidder, Resurgent countered with an offer of Rs 6,000 crore in upfront cash.

The Tata Group and JSW Energy are also in the race to acquire Bhushan Power & Steel, where JSW Steel improved its offer by 60% after lenders declared the Tatas as the highest bidder.

Probably in reference to the battle for Bhushan Power, Resurgent is pitching its offer on the grounds that there have been instances under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code where lenders have accepted a revised bid even after an entity was declared the highest bidder. Since the resolution of Prayagraj Power is in line with the IBC model, it is binding on the lenders to consider Resurgent’s offer, they have conveyed to the lenders.

Lenders keen on maximising their recovery are in favour of accepting Resurgent’s offer, the bank officials said. Taking up the Resurgent offer means the lenders will have to forgo less than 50% of the Rs 11,000 crore borrowed by Prayagraj from a group of 17 entities led by State Bank of India. The amount foregone would be 66% in case of JSW Energy.

The lenders currently hold an over 89% stake in Prayagraj Power, which operates a 1,980 MW thermal power plant near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. The remainder stake is held by Jaiprakash Associates, the original promoter of the company.

The lenders are racing to find a resolution for the stressed asset by the end of this month to prevent it from being referred to the bankruptcy courts.

They acquired a majority stake in the company on converting their debt into equity under a strategic debt restructuring scheme. Under the scheme, the lenders have to find a buyer for their stake in 18 months. However, even after repeated attempts over the past two years, the lenders were unable clinch a deal"
35,2018-08-28,JSW,"MUMBAI: Domestic steelmakers are set to increase prices from next month as a historical currency erosion drives up costs of imported raw material.

The increase is also the result of attempts by manufacturers to plug the gap between domestic and international steel prices. Currently, Indian steel prices are at a 5-8% discount to the prevailing rate overseas.

“The currency impact is playing out in the import of coking coal, international purchases as well as on imported fuel, which is having an indirect effect by way of logistics costs going up,” said Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel. “In view of this, we are looking at raising prices over the next two months. Longer term and quarterly auto contracts with renegotiated terms will come into effect from October.”

The price of imported coking coal, a key raw material in steelmaking, has increased 14% since June (on a year-on-year basis). Prices of graphite electrodes, including those that are imported, have increased 16%. Prices of iron ore, largely produced domestically, have gone up 11% and iron ore fines prices by merchant miners in Odisha rose by Rs 900 per tonne.

The industry expects a price rise of Rs 1,500 per tonne for both hot rolled coils in flat products as well as downstream products. For long products, the increase may be more.

Ranjan Dhar, chief marketing officer at Essar Steel, said this may affect the second-quarter earnings of steel companies. “After stellar first-quarter results for steel companies, the second quarter may lack the same lustre because of the cost-push inflation,” Dhar said.

The increase follows a depression in prices attributed to seasonality on account of the monsoon season, when construction slows down. Additionally, steel traders that engage in arbitrage imported almost 120,000 tonnes of steel, which put downward pressure on prices, and the increases will be from that level.

“The traders imported at a loss and have depressed prices. There should be a more symbiotic relationship between mills and traders for the objective of ‘Make in India’ to succeed,” Dhar said.

The situation in China, the world’s biggest steel producer, has been stable, preventing volatility in prices.

“For the last six to seven months, there has not been much fluctuation in China steel prices, which is expected to sustain with the mill closures happening mostly in the unorganised steel sector,” said Goutam Chakraborty, an analyst for metals at Emkay Securities. “With demand coming from infrastructure also holding, there is a case for the price hike.”

Chakraborty added that the level of imports by India has also gone up, supported by domestic demand."

Jani prefers stocks in the private banking space and feel that they will outperform their PSU peers. Stocks such as HDFC Bank and RBL Bank remain among preferred picks. He also believes that market will continue to be volatile in the short term on the back of global fund inflows and general elections in 2019. “Any correction should be used by investors to add quality companies,” Jani said.

Rupee touched a fresh record lowThe rupee touched its fresh record low of 70.60 against the US dollar on strong demand for the greenback. Sustained demand for US dollars from banks and importers and higher crude oil prices aggravated rupee's woes. Trade deficit- mostly because of India's unrelenting demand for oil- is a major reason behind rupee's fall. A widening trade deficit is dragging the rupee down as more imports require India to buy more foreign currencies. 


RBI flags inflation risks, fiscal woesIn its annual report for 2017-18, RBI warned that the headline inflation might face upside risks over the rest of the year while real GDP growth for 2018-19 was to increase to 7.4 per cent from 6.7 per cent previously. Also, A worsening global trade environment as a result of protectionist policies may impinge on external demand, while elevated crude oil prices and the strengthening of domestic demand is seen to push up the import bill, the report added. 


PSBs move up as govt pushes merger planThe government has directed RBI to prepare a list of candidates for the merger among 21 government-controlled lenders, Bloomberg reported. The move is aimed at strengthening cash-strapped PSBs that are reeling under mounting NPA. Shares of Bank of Baroda (up 2.40 per cent), Punjab National Bank (1.57 per cent) and State Bank of India (1.58 per cent) clocked decent gains. 


JSW Steel boosts BSE Metal packShares of JSW Steel surged 8.97 per cent as the steelmaker was picked to replace Lupin on the Nifty50 index from September 28.

The stock, which got listed on the bourses in July 2003, has rallied over 5,400 per cent in last 15 years. One major milestone for the stock was its entry into the elite Nifty50 club in 2004.

Over the years, the representation in Nifty50 has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy: new sectors have evolved, while some have lost relative importance in the New India,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market experts are looking bullish on most of the above-mentioned stocks. Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) with a target price of Rs 10,805. The automaker expects double-digit growth in FY19, driven by continued strength in rural markets. The company remains fully committed to launching fully electric vehicles in India in 2020, supported by access to technology from Toyota. In the interim, it will launch a strong hybrid vehicle. Shares of Maruti Suzuki traded at Rs 9,413 on Wednesday.

Country’s biggest IT major Tata Consultancy Services is among the preferred picks of brokerage Sharekhan. TCS recently reported higher-than-expected margin performance in Q1FY19, while Infosys and HCL Tech delivered on expected lines, according to Sharekhan.

BofAML recently upgraded Tech Mahindra to ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ and raised the target price to Rs 800 from Rs 600 earlier. “We expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 per cent over FY18-21. Such growth to provide more qualitative stock rally,” the brokerage said.

Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 475. “The strong cargo growth story remains intact, driven by inclusion of new ports (Ennore in FY19, Vizhinjam in FY20) and growth in logistics business. We also expect strong cash flows in FY19 and beyond, with capex peaking out and operations stabilising across assets. We view the current price as an excellent opportunity to own a superior cash-generating asset portfolio,” it said.

Motilal Oswal also has ‘buy’ ratings on Bajaj Auto, Coal India, NTPC and Power Grid."

51,2018-08-30,JSW,"Shares of JSW Steel could rise as much as 13 per cent in the near term given the likely buying by index funds due to its inclusion in the benchmark Nifty from September 28, said analysts. Continuous rollover of long positions in JSW Steel futures over the past few derivatives series shows traders are bullish on the stock.

Shares of JSW Steel ended up 9 per cent at Rs 399 on the BSE on Wednesday after hitting a lifetime high of Rs 405.40 during the session due the Nifty inclusion news. The stock marked its biggest one-day gain in five years on Wednesday. The total traded quantity of 1.5 crore shares was nearly 16 times its two-week average traded quantity of shares, according to BSE.

Derivative analysts said traders are continuously carrying forward long positions in JSW Steel. The inclusion in the index was expected for some time, and that is also likely to have driven interest in the stock in the last few months.

“For the past four series we have seen good rollover of long positions, which suggests upside. Index funds are likely to buy the stock as it is a newcomer in the index,” said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICIdirect. “One can buy the stock near Rs 380. Traders have started writing Rs 380 put option strike. The stock can move up to Rs 450,” said Gupta.

Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal said the stock is likely to stay above Rs 375 and can rise to Rs 425-Rs 430 level.

Analysts tracking the company are not too gung ho about the stock’s prospects. Bloomberg data showed that the consensus target price on the stock is Rs 367.45, which is 8 per cent below the current market price of the stock. Prabhudas Lilladher has the highest target price on the Street on JSW Steel at Rs 450."

With tariffs beginning to hurt the Chinese economy, Asian stocks lost some of their gains. European shares opened weak in the afternoon on concerns over trade relations between the world’s two largest economies, Reuters reported.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outperformed the Sensex, rising 0.43 per cent and 0.27 per cent, respectively. 

Let's walk you through the highlights of today's trade:


Who moved my SensexReliance Industries (RIL) emerged as the top drag, contributing 66.48 points to the fall in Sensex. The scrip, falling for the second consecutive session, closed 1.57 per cent down at Rs 1,274.10. The stock snapped its eight-session gaining streak on Wednesday. Global brokerage firm Jefferies retained underperform rating on the oil-to-telecom behemoth. It expects RIL’s refining margins to ease from highs of the 2017-18 financial year as refining demand supply becomes less benign.


Agencies
Other than RIL, HDFC, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki and IndusInd Bank also featured among the top drag on Sensex in that order.


ITC at 52-week highITC stock touched a 52-week high of Rs 320, eventually settling 2.08 per cent higher at Rs 319.20. BofAML maintained a buy rating on stock with a price target of Rs 360 with 15 per cent potential upside. The cigarette maker’s June quarter numbers met analyst estimates and cigarette volume growth at 1.5 per cent, which came on a base of the best quarter of FY18, has managed to impress. Besides the valuation discount to its FMCG peers, ITC’s efforts to shift focus towards other business verticals and hopes of stabilisation of cigarette volumes are giving the stock a lift, say analysts. 


Rupee’s plight The rupee has been on a record-setting spree in terms of its fall. It touched its fresh record low of 70.86 against the US dollar today. Higher crude oil prices and sustained demand for the US dollar has been adding to rupee's fall. Trade deficit- mostly because of India's unrelenting demand for oil- is a major reason behind rupee's fall. A widening trade deficit is dragging the rupee down as more imports require India to buy more foreign currencies. 


52-week highs & lowsAs many as 58 stocks, including Aarvee Denims & Exports, ABM International, Accelya Kale Solutions and Bombay Rayon Fashions, hit 52-week lows on NSE on Thursday.

PNB, MTNL, RCapital among 53 stocks ready to rallyMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, on Thursday showed bullish crossovers on 53 counters on NSE. Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Reliance Capital, MTNL, Greaves Cotton and Syndicate Bank.


Agencies
The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It also signalled bearish crossovers on 48 counters on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. The stocks included NCC, Voltas, Bajaj Finance, Pidilite Industries and Havells India. 


Agencies
Market experts say the MACD alone may not be a sufficient indicator to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators."
56,2018-08-30,JSW,"Sajjan Jindal's JSW Energy has promised lenders that it would sweeten the offer for Pragyaraj Power in an attempt to trump Tatas backed Resurgent Power, but hasn’t specified what the betterment would be, said two people familiar with the matter.

This marks yet another bankrupt asset that’s drawing competing higher bids in more than one round from competing buyers deriving better value for assets and improve the recovery ratio for lenders. Earlier, Resurgent, a joint venture between Tatas and ICICI Venture, upped the bid to be more attractive than JSW Energy.

In a letter sent to lenders late 
on Thursday, JSW Energy, one of the few sound private sector power producers, the company said it was open to make an offer that would be attractive for lenders and that it needed an opportunity to do so.

Resurgent Power appeared to be the best bidder 
on Wednesday with an upfront cash payment of Rs 6,000 crore for the 1,980 mega watt Prayagraj Power and 15% equity for the lenders. While JSW Energy’s offer involved 15% equity to lenders, the payments worked out to Rs 3,740 crore since it was laced with conditions. Prayagraj Power, a thermal unit located in Uttar Pradesh near Allahabad, has outstanding loans of Rs 11,000 crore and lenders own 89% stake in the company.

JSW Energy’s original offer was at Rs 5940 crore with a clause that they would not be liable to pay any tax over dues of the bankrupt firm. A report by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said that tax liability could be as high as Rs 2200 crore and effectively JSW Energy offer amounted to Rs 3740 crore.

In a letter to lenders, JSW said “we wish you had given us an opportunity to discuss the terms offered by Resurgent Power and the parameters on the basis you are entertaining such unsolicited offer. We are more than pleased to address your concerns and better our offer.” 

The company has also indicated that they are open to offer higher upfront cash amount and absorb tax liabilities. Although lenders have already issued a letter of intent to Resurgent Power, they might not be averse to consider JSW offer it something is concrete in it, said one of the two people cited above.

Prayagraj Power is one of the seven power accounts identified by lenders where they see a possibility of resolution outside the bankruptcy court. Banks are running against time after the Reserve Bank of India mandated them to resolve all distressed assets above Rs 2000 crore or refer them to bankruptcy court by early next week.

The Tata Group and JSW Energy are also in the race to acquire Bhushan Power & Steel, where JSW Steel improved its offer by 60% after lenders declared the Tatas as the highest bidder."

0,2018-09-01,JSW,"BHUBANESWAR: The Orissa High Court on Monday stayed mining of three deposits, won by Essar Steel Ltd, Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) and Bhushan Power and Steel Limited (BPSL).

The interim order came during the hearing of a public interest litigation that questions the state’s decision two years ago to allow the three companies to participate in auctions of iron ore deposits, even as they had defaulted on loans and were then possibly headed towards bankruptcy. 

The writ, filed by activist Chitta Ranjan Sahoo, seeks cancellation of the auctions and their outcomes, or the letters of intent granted to Essel Steel, BSL (now acquired by Tata Steel) and BPSL (for which JSW Steel recently emerged as the highest bidder). He questioned “the due diligence and conduct” of Naveen Patnaik’s government and the decision of the Odisha steel and mines department in granting mineral blocks to companies that went bankrupt within months of winning those. 

The deposits, auctioned after mining laws were amended in 2015, are not yet operational. All three companies have plants in the state and are chasing clearances that will enable them to get a mining grant. 

“The matter was still pending in court and we will be submitting our counter very soon,” said a senior government official, declining to comment further.

The state is expected to point out to the court that the deposits were auctioned as per the Mineral Auction Rules 2015 laid out by the Centre. “If these companies qualify, under the criteria laid out by the rules, submitting audited balance sheets and tax returns and emerge as the highest bidder, how is the state to predict their future insolvency,” asked an official of the steel and mines department, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Indian Bankruptcy Code 2016 recognises the companies as continuing concerns, even while their promoters are changing, and the state would take a call when conditions of the letters of intent were met, he added.

Essar Steel won the Ghoraburhani Sagasahi block in March 2016 committing to pay 44.35 per cent of the value of ore to the state. At this point of time, the steelmaker’s debt totalled Rs 45,000 crore, while its wholly owned subsidiary Essar Steel Offshore had failed to repay Standard Chartered Bank’s $413 million (as principal amount) and State Bank of India’s Rs 14,860.82 crore loans, the PIL alleges. The banks moved the National Company Law Tribunal in Ahmadabad, which declared Essar Steel a defaulter in July of 2017, while holding that “there appears no scope for Essar Steel to be repaying its debt for another 25 years”, the petition says. 

“It is difficult to believe how the state government, its agencies and instrumentalities could have lost sight of such developments with regard to insolvency proceeding initiated against the respondent (Essar Steel),” says the petition. Counsels for petitioner were senior advocate Yasobant Das, Ashok Das and Matrugupta Mishra.

Bhushan Steel won the Kalamanga West deposit in May 2017 with a very aggressive quote of 100.05 per cent of the value of the ore. BPSL quoted 87.15 per cent for the Netrabandha Pahar deposit.

A month after both companies received their LoIs from the state, the NCLB in New Delhi initiated corporate insolvency resolution processes against them. The PIL alleges that BPSL had defaulted on repaying Punjab National Bank in February of 2016.

Tata Steel, through its subsidiary Bamnipal Steel, recently acquired a 72.65 per cent stake in BSL with the financial creditors taking a 37 per cent haircut. JSW is likely to take over BPSL.

“How come the valuable resources are allotted to bidders whose financial stability is not only questioned but insolvency proceedings are initiated and the assets of such bidders are auctioned for sale,” says the PIL."
1,2018-09-01,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Market kept its slate clean on Friday by rallying for the sixth straight week on the back of select heavyweights. But the rupee's rapid descent towards 71-mark against the dollar came as a rude jolt. 

The Sensex advanced 1.03 per cent to 38,645.10 for the week to August 31, from 38,251.80 in the previous one. The NSE Nifty added 1.06 per cent at 11,680.50, from 11,557.10 during the same period.

More than 30 stocks in the Nifty index ended the week in the green, with UPL, Hindalco, Tech Mahindra, PowerGrid and Tata Steel rising up to 10 per cent. YES Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance Industries, Eicher Motors and GAIL were not as lucky, slipping up to 8 per cent.

Rupee's diminished clout remains a big worryline. The slide is mainly a fallout of elevated crude prices, worsening current account deficit (CAD), spike in inflation and fears of foreign portfolio outflow.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes, according to Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management, show that the benchmark finished the week below the 11,700 level. However, the index bulls failing to take out 11,760 might be a point of concern on a short-term basis. Hence staying cautious on rise is advised. 

Breaking out 11,760 may unfold a fresh leg of upmove towards 11,880 levels. Further, Nifty broader trading range for the coming week is expected to be 11,880-11,520.

Which are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week? Here we go.

Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), the government provides duty benefits at different rates depending on product and country.

Rewards under the scheme are payable as percentage of realised free-on-board value and MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties including the basic customs duty.

The top 10 companies that have obtained maximum disbursals during 2017-18 under the scheme includes JSW Steel (Rs 301.5 crore), Ford India (Rs 272.8 crore), Bajaj Auto (Rs 246.5 crore), Dr Reddys Lab (Rs 240.6 crore), Aurobindo Pharma (Rs 211.3 crore), Mylan lab (Rs 192.9 crore), Hyundai Motor India (Rs 189.3 crore), Vedanta Ltd (Rs 180 crore), Lupin Ltd (Rs 155 crore), and Nissan Motor India (Rs 150 crore).

The other firms which have gained from the scheme include Tata Motors, Hindalco Industries, Hetero Labs, Maruti Suzuki India, Cipla Ltd, Reliance Industries, General Motors India and Shahi Exports.

In 2017-18, the ministry disbursed about Rs 31,000 crore to exporters under the scheme, while it was over Rs 23,000 crore in the previous fiscal.

Going ahead, the government may have to change the scheme as it was challenged by the US in the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement system.

The US had alleged that such incentive schemes were harming American companies and they are not in compliance with the global trade rules.

Government officials have earlier stated that they may look at reviewing the existing export incentive schemes to ensure that they comply with the WTO norms.

The US had alleged that thousands of Indian companies are receiving benefits totalling over USD 7 billion annually under various export promotion programmes."

9,2018-09-04,JSW,"JSW Steel and its promoters have acquired around 88 per cent stake in the Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd (MIEL) following completion of the insolvency resolution proceedings, MIEL said Tuesday. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier approved a Rs 2,875-crore bid by a consortium of Aion Investments and JSW Steel to acquire the bankrupt Monnet Ispat & Energy, which owes over Rs 11,000 crore to a clutch of lenders. 

 The Aion-JSW consortium was the sole bidder for the 1.5-million-tonne asset in Chhattisgrah. 

 According to a filing by MIEL, JSW Steel Ltd, Crexient Special Steel Ltd, JTPM Atsali Ltd, AION Investments Private II Limited and JSW Techno Projects Management Ltd have been allotted around 87.52 crore equity shares and compulsorily convertible preference shares representing 87.91 per cent shareholding of the company. 

 MIEL had recently said the insolvency resolution plan approved by NCLT was completed under which JSW Steel provided a working capital advance of Rs 125 crore. 

It had also said Rs 2,457 crore has been paid to the secured financial creditors. 

 Monnet Ispat, once one of the country's foremost steel makers, ran a successful coal-based sponge iron plant with an annul capacity of 1.5 million tonne in Chhattisgrah. 

The company ran into problems when coal mines attached to the plant were cancelled in 2014 after the Supreme Court order. Crashing steel prices on account of Chinese dumping further aggravated its crisis and resulted into bankruptcy proceedings. 

Monnet was one of the 12 accounts that the Reserve Bank had identified in its first list tagged as the 'dirty dozen' for an immediate resolution mid-last year."
5,2018-09-04,JSW,"Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. is considering a breakup plan as part of a restructuring to help trim its 420 billion rupee ($6 billion) debt pile and boost investor confidence in a company that was once India’s biggest steelmaker by market value.

The New Delhi-based company is looking at splitting its steel, power and international businesses into three separate entities, Chairman Naveen Jindal said in an interview. Any such plan would need the approval of lenders, regulators and the board, he said.

The steel unit would include the coal mines, while the international business would include the Oman steel plant, he said.

Jindal Steel will seek to progressively sell about 30 percent of the Oman unit over two to three years, and this may partly be achieved through an initial public offer, the chairman said. The company will engage with potential buyers in December and hopes to conclude a deal by March, he added.

The outlook is brightening for the mill, which last month reported its first quarterly profit after notching up three-and-a-half years of losses. In the wake of a global steel industry revival, its shares have risen 55 percent in the past year, making it the best performer on the 10-member S&P BSE Metal Index.

“It is a kind of value unlocking,” said Goutam Chakraborty, a Mumbai-based analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services, by phone. “Breaking the company into three and distributing the debt accordingly is probably going to take the load away from the single company.”


Others
While the company’s steel business is performing well with a rail order from the government and a buoyant market, its power business was hit by the cancellation of coal licenses by the government, Chakraborty said.

The steelmaker, which has come back from the brink of bankruptcy, wants to get its debt ratio down to two times pre-tax earnings, from about five times now, over the next four or five years, Jindal said in the Aug. 30 interview. This fiscal year the company wants to cut debt by 15 percent. “We are going to be really, really conservative. There is no question of taking more debt,” he said.

Jindal Steel’s coal mining operations in Australia may also be on the block -- but there’s no hurry. “Coal prices are very good, so if we get a good price, we can look at that,” he said.

JSW Energy Ltd., run by his brother Sajjan Jindal, had paid an advance of about 4 billion rupees for a deal brokered in 2016 for Jindal Steel’s 1,000-megawatt power plant in central India. However, the period for completion of the deal has been extended by a year as some of the conditions for the sale remain unfulfilled.

“If we do not do the deal then we will pay it back to them,"" Jindal said. Both are sons of billionaire Savitri Devi Jindal.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, Jindal’s company had a market value ahead of rival producers Tata Steel Ltd. and JSW Steel Ltd. -- owned by Jindal’s brother -- and Steel Authority of India Ltd.

Jindal’s group was among those that benefited when the government began awarding 218 coal mines to companies starting from 1993 on condition they invest in industrial projects and pay royalties. But in 2014, the Supreme Court canceled most of these permits, terming the allocations arbitrary and illegal, and ordered the producers to pay for the coal they had already extracted.

“We got into this situation because we had to borrow almost a billion dollars to pay the additional levy and then to complete the plant,” said Jindal. “When you have such things happening, you have no option but to carry on and find ways to survive without it and we have done that successfully.”

Risks still remain for the company. In addition to weak power demand and a struggle to get coal supplies, India’s Enforcement Directorate has filed a complaint against Jindal for alleged money laundering.

The cases are “completely frivolous and malicious,” said Jindal. “These are very unfortunate, but we have full faith in India’s judiciary and we know we are going to come out clean and strong from these cases and they do not deter us at all.”"

12,2018-09-05,JSW,"MUMBAI: India is under the threat of dumping of foreign steel, led by the diversion of exports originally meant for the US and the European Union, which could lead to an encore of 2016 when local mills making the alloy were crippled by shipments from overseas, fear domestic steelmakers.

Rating agency ICRA in a note on Wednesday said that in the first quarter of FY2019, country’s steel exports dropped by over 33% whereas steel imports grew by over 11%, and consequently India turned a net steel importer in Q1 FY2019, after having been a net exporter for the last two years.

However, with a sharp rupee depreciation in the recent months, the rating agency expects a ""slide in steel imports"" and a ""boost in exports"" in the coming months, which is likely to improve India’s overall steel trade balance

The industry has also started ""sensitising"" the government to take action to check unfair imports that could accelerate in the future. It wants the reference price of the antidumping duty to be pushed up or a replication of what Europe has recently done to protect local steelmakers by providing safeguard measures.

""In the last quarter (first quarter of FY19), China, Japan, and Korea diverted twice their export to the US into India,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint MD at JSW Steel had told reporters in July at a conference held to announce the company's first quarterly earnings. He said the recent imposition of safeguard measures by the EU will hit the industry more in the coming quarters.

He had bolstered his statement with data from last quarter. Imports into the US from China, Japan and, Korea reduced by 240,000 tonnes after the imposition of tariffs. But their collective shipments into India increased by 450,000 tonnes - a case of diversion of imports.

""Countries are putting safeguard measures to protect their domestic steel industry against unfair dumping. Indian Government had taken safeguard measure by way of reference price at $480/tonne to curb dumping. This has now become redundant in view of the higher international prices. Consequently, imports into India have risen by 31% in Q1 of FY19 compared to Q4 FY18. Hence there is a definitive case for revision in reference price,"" said an Essar Steel spokesperson.

While the US had, in March, imposed a 25% import tariff on steel entering the country, more recently, on July 18, the European Commission has announced safeguard provisional measure to curb diversion of exports to Europe. According to the measure, a 25% tariff will be imposed once imports exceed the average import of the last three years. This will be applicable to all countries save some developing countries.

“Unlike the USA, the EU tariffs would be more worrying for Indian steelmakers, given that export volumes by Indian mills to EU are over five times of volumes exported to the USA,"" said Jayanta Roy, group head, corporate sector ratings at ICRA. ""Moreover, as per India’s Q1 FY2019 steel import data, redirection of impacted steel volumes from countries like Japan and South-Korea, with whom India has Free Trade Agreements (FTA), is clearly visible,"" Roy added"

14,2018-09-06,JSW,"MUMBAI: Monnet Power, which is facing bankruptcy proceedings, has received expressions of interest from five companies, said two senior officials.

Jindal Steel, ACB India, Sterlite Power Transmission, JSW Energy and Adani Power are among the bidders, said the officials mentioned above. The company has debt of nearly Rupees 6,000 crore on its books.

Monnet Power is an unlisted company owned by the Jajodia family, and is the second of Sandeep Jajodia’s companies to go through insolvency proceedings. It is also an 88per cent subsidiary of Monnet Ispat, a steel producer which too was facing bankruptcy proceedings.

Monnet Ispat was acquired by a JV between JSW Steel andPE firm AION investments under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code. JSWAION has acquired 88per cent stake in Monnet Ispat by paying Rupees 2,875 crore as against Rupees 10,300-crore dues of the company. Monnet Power was admitted to the bankruptcy court in February following instructions from RBI . Couple of year ago, JSW Energy had offered to acquire Monnet Power after it showed signs of distress due to cost overrun. But the deal was not conclusive since lenders were not willing to take a haircut following which JSW Energy dropped its plan to acquire it. Most banks are worried about the power sector with 34 large accounts in distress. Over the past few months, banks have referred 18 power sector accounts to the bankruptcy court. Five more accounts are likely to be referred to the bankruptcy court as an outcome of RBI circular which directs lenders to refer an account with over Rupees 2,000 crore loans to bankruptcy court if an account is not restructured in 180 days of default."
15,2018-09-06,JSW,"Tata Steel Thursday submitted before the NCLAT that the lenders of the debt ridden firm Bhushan Power & Steel permitted rival JSW Steel to change the basic parameters of its bids after submission. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing on behalf of Tata Steel, submitted before the appellate tribunal that it was against the interim order passed by NCLAT on August 6. 

While, Tata Steel following NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) order of the appellate tribunal August 6 order, has filed one additional plan. 

Passing an order on August 6 order, the NCLAT had allowed all three contenders -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW - to file additional unconditional 'resolution plans' by August 13, 2018, improving their financial offer without compromising the basic parameters of the 'resolution plans' already submitted by them. 

However, the Committee of Creditors allowed JSW to change basic parameters of its resolution plans. 

A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya has listed the matter on September 24 for next hearing. 

In July, NCLAT had vacated its stay and asked the CoC to consider resolution plans submitted by three firms -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel. The tribunal on July 20 gave a go-ahead to the CoC meeting, directing it to finalise a bid for the company. 

However, JSW Steel revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore ahead of the CoC meeting. 

Tata Steel put in a bid of Rs 17,000 crore. 

Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders. 

Earlier on July 17, the NCLAT had stayed the meeting of CoC when they were going to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder (H1) for BPSL. 

Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the RBI for NCLT proceedings."

17,2018-09-07,JSW,"MUMBAI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ruled that both Numetal, a consortium headed by Russia’s VTB Bank, and ArcelorMittal are eligible to bid for the bankrupt Essar Steel, ending months of speculation about the fate of their offers. In the process, NCLAT opened the door to pitches from other parties as well.

Numetal will no longer have a member of the Ruia family that founded the Essar Group as part of the consortium. ArcelorMittal’s bid will be entertained once the companies in which CEO LN Mittal was classified a promoter —Uttam Galva and KSS Petron clear their dues to banks. The ruling allows other bids to be considered by the committee of creditors, opening up a window of opportunity for Vedanta Resources and JSW Steel that had expressed interest in the asset.

“We give one opportunity to the resolution applicant — AM India Ltd (ArcelorMittal) — to make payment of all overdue amount with interest thereon and charges relating to nonperforming accounts of both the Uttam Galva and the KSS Petron in their respective accounts within three days i.e. by 11th September, 2018,’’ the order said. “If done, the committee of creditors will consider the resolution plan submitted by AM India Ltd along with other resolution plans, including the resolution plan submitted by the Numetal Ltd.”

Numetal and ArcelorMittal have challenged each other’s eligibility under the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which prohibit defaulters from bidding for their own assets during resolution proceedings. Rewant Ruia was originally a part of the Numetal consortium. Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, in which LN Mittal was listed as a promoter, have defaulted on debt.

The ruling will have a significant bearing on the resolution process at Essar Steel, which has dues of more than Rs 49,000 crore. ArcelorMittal had offered Rs 30,000 crore in the first round, while Numetal had bid Rs 18,000 crore. Subsequently, both were declared ineligible by lenders— ArcelorMittal because of the association with Uttam Galva and KSS Petron and Numetal for the Ruia connection.

Subsequently, ArcelorMittal agreed to clear the dues of the two companies while Numetal said it would replace Ruia. In the meanwhile, both bidders moved the higher bench questioning the rival’s eligibility.

ArcelorMittal has parked Rs 7,000 crore in an escrow account in State Bank of India’s London branch with the rider that lenders will get it only if the tribunal declares it eligible to bid for Essar Steel. The court said this was not tantamount to clearing dues, hence the deadline."
16,2018-09-07,JSW,"A homegrown champion, a global benchmark

Over the past decade, even as India’s biggest banks have become burdened with rising non-performing assets (NPAs), HDFC Bank has been a beacon of stability with consistent loan growth, continuous innovation and solid asset quality.

HDFC Bank has grown steadily to become the country’s second-largest private sector bank, after ICICI Bank, based on total income and the largest when it comes to interest earned in a year. It is also the most valued bank with a market capitalisation of Rs 5.5 lakh crore.

In addition, HDFC Bank leads the pack of top five private sector banks in terms of operating ratios such as net interest margin (NIM), return on assets (RoA) and low NPAs. Gross NPAs were at 1.30% of advances on March 30, among the lowest in the industry with provision coverage of 70%.

19,2018-09-09,JSW,"India may impose anti-dumping duty of up to USD 185.51 per tonne for five years on certain varieties of Chinese steel with a view to guard domestic players from cheap imports of the commodity from the neighbouring country. JSW Steel Ltd, Sunflag Iron & Steel Co, Usha Martin, Gerdau Steel India, Vardhman Special Steels and Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd had jointly filed an application for initiation of investigations and levying of anti-dumping duties on the steel. 

In its anti-dumping investigations, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has stated that dumped imports of 'straight length bars and rods of alloy steel' from China have increased in absolute terms during the period of probe (2016-17). 

It said that the dumped imports are undercutting the prices of the domestic industry and due to this the domestic industry's profits, return on capital employed and cash profits have declined during 2016-17. 

""The authority recommends imposition of anti-dumping duty"" on the imports from China ""for period of five years,"" the DGTR has said in a notification. 

It has recommended duty in the range of USD 44.89 per tonne and USD 185.51 per tonne. 

However, it added that no anti-dumping duty shall be payable on imports of forged bars and tool and die steel if their landed value is above USD 659.91 per tonne. 

If the landed value is lower than USD 659.91 per tonne, then the difference between that value and USD 659.91 per tonne shall be payable as anti-dumping duty, it added. 

While the DGTR, under the commerce ministry, recommends the duty, the final call is being taken by the finance ministry. 

Imports of straight length bars and rods of alloy steel from China have increased to 1,80,959 tonnes in 2016-17 from 56,690 tonnes in 2013-14. India's total imports rose to 2,56,004 tonnes in 2016-17 from 1,32,933 tonnes in 2013-14. 

The demand of this steel in India too increased to 16,69,653 tonnes in 2016-17 from 15,14,795 tonnes in 2013-14. 

Domestic steel manufacturers always flag concerns over the imports from the neighbouring country, with which India has a huge trade deficit. 

The trade gap with China has increased to USD 63.12 billion in 2017-18 from USD 51.11 billion in the previous financial year. 

The DGTR has also stated it recognises that the imposition of anti-dumping duties might affect the price levels of the product in India. However, fair competition in the market will not be impacted by the imposition of these trade remedy measures. 

On the contrary, imposition of anti-dumping measures would remove the unfair advantages gained by dumping practices, prevent the decline of the domestic industry and help maintain availability of wider choice to the consumers of these goods, it added. 

In general, the purpose of these duties is to eliminate injury caused to the domestic industry by the unfair trade practices of dumping so as to re-establish a situation of open and fair competition in the Indian market, which is in interest of the country. 

""Imposition of anti-dumping duties, therefore, would not affect the availability of the product to the consumers,"" it said."
20,2018-09-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: The resolution professional of Essar Steel has informed lenders that bids received in the second round will be opened at 10 a.m. on Monday, said senior bank officials who did not want to be identified. 

ArcelorMittal in partnership with Nippon of Japan, Numetal, backed by Russia’s VTB Bank in partnership with JSW Steel, and Vedanta had submitted bids in the first week of April. The decision to open the bids follows a ruling by the higher bench of the bankruptcy court. 

“The committee of creditors will consider the resolution plan submitted by AM India Ltd. (ArcelorMittal) along with other resolution plans, including the resolution plan submitted by Numetal,” the court said. 

In the first round, ArcelorMittal had offered Rs 30,000 crore and Numetal Rs 18,000 crore. The lenders declared both ineligible because ArcelorMittal had not cleared dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron and Numetal was partly owned by Essar Group cofounder Ravi Ruia’s son Rewant Ruia. 

Subsequently, a second round of bids was called, although they were not opened due to a stay by the tribunal. During this time, ArcelorMittal agreed to clear the dues of the two companies provided it was awarded Essar Steel, while Numetal said it would replace Rewant Ruia. Both bidders moved the higher bench, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, questioning the other’s eligibility. 

Numetal said the court should allow the resolution professional to open the bids of the second round in which it had offered Rs 37,000 crore. The amounts offered by the other two are not known. The tribunal ruled on Friday that Numetal and ArcelorMittal are eligible to bid for bankrupt Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal’s bid would be entertained once the companies in which Chairman and CEO Lakshmi Mittal was classified a promoter — Uttam Galva and KSS Petron — cleared their dues to banks. 

“We give one opportunity to the resolution applicant — AM India Ltd. (ArcelorMittal) — to make payment of all overdue amounts with interest thereon and charges relating to nonperforming accounts of both Uttam Galva and KSS Petron in their respective accounts within three days, i.e., by September 11, 2018,” the tribunal said. 

ArcelorMittal has deposited Rs 7,000 crore in an escrow account in State Bank of India’s London branch, with a rider that lenders will get the amount only if the tribunal declares it eligible to bid for Essar Steel. The court said this was not tantamount to clearing the dues. It is not clear if ArcelorMittal will repay the dues or move the Supreme Court against the tribunal’s order. 

Essar Steel has dues of Rs 49,000 crore and has been facing insolvency proceedings for over a year now."
25,2018-09-10,JSW,"Kolkata | Mumbai: ArcelorMittal submitted a fresh bid for bankrupt Essar Steel, in line with a ruling by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), said people with knowledge of the matter.

However, lenders deferred a decision on Monday and decided to wait for the Supreme Court’s ruling on the eligibility of a rival bid by Numetal, following a challenge by ArcelorMittal.

The revised offer by ArcelorMittal is pegged at Rs 42,000 crore, along with a commitment to repay Rs 7,000-crore dues of two companies as per last week’s NCLAT decision, said the people cited above.

Its previous offer was said to have been in the region of Rs 38,500 crore. ArcelorMittal has also challenged a stipulation of the NCLAT ruling that it needed to pay the debts of the two defaulting companies in which CEO LN Mittal was listed as a promoter.

Numetal told NCLAT recently it had bid Rs 37,000 crore in April, while the offer by Vedanta, also made at that time, was estimated at Rs 30,000-35,000 crore, according to sources. The NCLAT decision had opened up the field to contenders other than ArcelorMittal and Numetal.

While ArcelorMittal’s offer is higher, attached conditions could complicate the choice for the lenders, which are keen to avoid any litigation that may arise from the decisions they take, said two people familiar with the matter.

ArcelorMittal confirmed that it had revised its bid for Essar Steel India Ltd (ESIL), which is undergoing resolution under IBC.

“The financial terms of the proposal are confidential, but represent a material increase to the previous offers made by the company,” the company said in a release. “The revised offer, which includes a commitment to pay the entire amount due to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, therefore represents unprecedented value to all concerned creditors.”

NCLAT had ruled that ArcelorMittal would be eligible to bid if it repaid the dues of debt defaulters KSS Petron and Uttam Galva. NCLAT had said AreclorMittal needed to pay the dues by Tuesday, September 11. IBC doesn’t allow the participation of bidders connected to companies that have defaulted on debt. However, Arcelor-Mittal filed an appeal before the Supreme Court on Monday evening against the NCLAT order, said a person aware of the development. ArcelorMittal didn’t comment on this.

At the same time, ArcleorMittal asked the committee of creditors (CoC) to “confirm the overdue amounts of UG and KS Petrron and the modality of the payment.” But it also told the committee in its submission, which ET has seen, that this “must in no way be construed” as giving up its right of appeal on the matter.

“We continue to believe that we are, and have always been, eligible to submit bids for Essar Steel and we reserve all rights in respect to any finding to the contrary, including by the honourable NCLAT,” it told the CoC.

ArcelorMittal said in the statement to ET that the revised offer demonstrates its “serious commitment to India, creditor banks and all ESIL’s stakeholders.” The company wants the dues repayment to be dependent on bankers negotiating exclusively with ArcelorMittal for Essar Steel, said some of the people cited above.

A spokesperson representing rival bidder Numetal said he did not wish to comment on its bid.

The offer by the Russian VTB Bank-led consortium, which has JSW Steel among its partners, is believed to include Rs 2,000 crore of debt owed by Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure Ltd, which transports raw material from Odisha to Essar Steel’s Hazira complex in Gujarat.

A top source close to the development said the ArcelorMittal revised offer “covers the entire secured principal debt of Essar Steel.” It is not clear whether Arcelor’s bid—said to be an improvement over its earlier offer of Rs 38,500 crore — includes payment of dues for OSPIL.

NCLAT had said Numetal would need to ensure that the consortium didn’t have any member of the Ruia family in order to be eligible to bid."
24,2018-09-10,JSW,"JSW Steel today said its crude steel output grew 8.3 per cent to 14.48 lakh tonne (LT) during August 2018.

The company's crude steel production was at 13.37 LT in August 2017, it said in a filing to BSE.

Last month, the production of flat rolled products was almost flat at 9.81 LT against 9.79 LT in August 2017, it said.

The output of long rolled products increased 9.7 per cent to 3.05 LT over 2.78 LT in the same month last year, it said.

JSW Steel is a part of the diversified USD 13 billion JSW Group, which has a presence in steel, energy, infrastructure, cement, ventures and sports.

It is a leading integrated steel company with an installed steel-making capacity of 18 million tonne per annum (MTPA) in India.

The company's plant at Vijayanagar in Karnataka is the largest single location steel producing facility in the country with a capacity of 12 MTPA."
21,2018-09-10,JSW,"MUMBAI: Tata group will complete balance-sheet commitments, including write-offs and capital infusion in group companies, by March 2019, said a person with knowledge of the progress on the conglomerate’s strategic blueprint as authored by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran. “Next fiscal onward, our focus will be on growth and cash flows will stay ahead of the capital expenditure,” the person said.

Chandrasekaran seems to have gained confidence of Tata Sons’ board and its largest shareholder, Tata Trusts, after about 18 months on the job. Among other things, he’s found a resolution for Tata Teleservices, which was struggling to stay afloat amid competition and heavy debt—Bharti Airtel is in the process of taking over its mobile services business.

“The only possibility was to hawk it and (he) could not do anything in the business environment he took over with the business losing money and interest rising steadily,” said investment banker and managing director Arpwood Capital Rajeev Gupta. “If it was two years back, things would have been different.”

The Tata Trusts have backed the chairman’s plan to provide capital to strengthen the balance sheet and capture future growth. The holding company of the diversified conglomerate received around Rs 27,000 crore from two share buybacks by the group’s cash cow Tata Consultancy Services.



Armed with capital, Chandra is forging ahead with his plan that’s underscored by the vision of the group’s founders. He has assured group companies of full backing for robust scalable plans that will deliver returns within a stipulated period. For example, Tata Steel has purchased bankrupt Bhushan Steel, which has 5 million tonnes of capacity, and is competing with rival JSW Steel for Bhushan Power and Steel.

“Purchase of steel companies would not have happened but for the conviction of Chandra,” said Gupta of Arpwood.

This will give Tata Steel the muscle it needs to benefit from the growth cycle that’s kicking off, said a senior Tata Steel executive. The company had previously taken almost two decades to build a 3 million steel plant in Gopalpur, bogged down by bureaucratic hurdles and opposition from environmental activists. Tata Sons has approved an investment plan of Rs 10,161 crore to support finance, insurance, defence, realty and retail businesses, sectors Chandrasekaran is aggressively betting on, ET had earlier reported. “We have to create a model to make money,” said a senior executive. “First we have to get the direction right and then comes velocity.”

Former Tata Sons directors backed the chairman’s vision. “The strategy is now stronger and has torque and direction, given the changed business environment globally,” said R Gopalakrishnan, a former Tata Sons director. “The best strategies remain single-minded but are continuously subject to reprioritisation and refreshment.” The fresh capital comes with riders on delivering returns. “There is clear pressure to deliver,” another person close to the plan said. “Chandra wants loyalty to accountability and performance.” Companies need to have aggressive growth plans in place by year end. “It will be no more incremental growth,” the executive said. Fund managers said a clear sense of direction gave confidence to investors. 

“There are strategic decisions taken to deal with niggling issues, there is significant long-term allocation of resources to scale up businesses,” said Gopal Agarwal, senior fund manager and head of macro strategy at DSP BlackRock Investment Managers. 

“Going ahead, the group needs to be consistent and nimble, backed with balanced aggression in the domestic market.” At least five top mutual funds have added significantly to their Tata holdings during Chandrasekaran’s tenure. Aditya Birla AMC, for instance, has spent .`1,105 crore to add to its Tata Steel holdings during the period, a rise of 211%. Tata Global Beverages has also seen a rise in investment. 

Chandra is said to be building on Ratan Tata’s legacy. “Through his several initiatives over the last 25 years, Ratan Tata modernised and refreshed the group vison and strategy,” said a former Tata Sons director. “Chandra has adhered to the strategy, but has focused management attention on execution… He not only demands delivery, he does so with urgency. This should produce better results, given the changed business environment globally.” As of July 31, Tata Sons’ standalone cash and cash equivalents were about Rs 5,587 crore. 

“There will be increased participation in Tata group companies’ investment programmes in sectors such as financial services, retail, consumer, infrastructure, realty, defence and aerospace,” said Subodh Rai, senior director, Crisil Ratings. “Tata Sons’ debt to market value of investments ratio has increased over the last 12 months due to the increased level of investments in group entities, including Tata Teleservices.” The group is not without challenges, including Tata Motors and Tata Power. While the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit was added to Chandrasekaran’s to do list after a few months of his joining, its parent Tata Motors is debt-laden and grappling for a solution. 

JLR lost operating leverage due to a combination of slowing demand and higher capital expenditure that pulled down cash flows and profit. Adding to this are environmental concerns over diesel vehicles in Europe, the impact of Brexit, technological disruptions and automakers moving to shared technologies because of heavy investments entailed. “Given competitive intensity, we expect profitability of this segment to lag volume growth,” said Kshitij Kaji, analyst at Edelweiss. “Tata Motors continues to invest in a new platform due for launch in 2019... 

Success of this platform is a key monitorable. In commercial vehicles, the risk is of further market share loss.” The group is betting on future models by investing Rs 1.2 lakh crore in JLR and Rs 7,000 crore in Tata Motors by 2021. Tata Power, which primarily generates power from coal, is turning to non-renewable energy, which is attracting investor attention, although the Mundra ultra mega power project is a drain. “The loss-making legacy Mundra project remains a drag for Tata Power with its huge debt, recording massive losses each day with rising coal prices,” an executive told ET. “Right now we don’t have a solution... We are waiting for the government to find a solution.”"

An unabated fall in the rupee, weak Asian peers and an uptick in global crude oil prices were the factors that hit market sentiments severely, while a strengthening US dollar aggravated capital outflow from the market.

The BSE Sensex plunged about 468 points, or 1.22 per cent, to settle at 37,922, while NSE’s Nifty50 tanked 151 points, or 1.30 per cent, to end the day at 11,438.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices suffered losses of over one per cent each.


Let’s walk you through the key highlight of Monday’s session...

Who dragged my SensexBarring four stocks – Axis Bank (up 0.99 per cent), Wipro (up 0.26 per cent), YES Bank (up 0.09 per cent) and TCS (up 0.07 per cent) – all other components of the 30-share index suffered losses. Sun Pharma, falling 3.72 per cent, stood as the top loser. In terms of index contribution, HDFC, Reliance Industries, ITC, HDFC Bank and M&M were biggest index losers. 


Axis Bank bucked the trendShares of the private lender jumped nearly 5 per cent to hit a 52-week high of Rs 676.90 on BSE, but cooled off later and settled at Rs 651.55, with a gain of 6 points, or 0.99 per cent. Shares of the bank rallied after Amitabh Chaudhry of HDFC Life was named its new CEO and MD to take office from January 1, 2019. Analysts see the development as game changer, as the appointment could reverse weakening of Axis Bank’s brand image.

Carnage in currency marketA persistent fall in the rupee dampened market sentiment. The local currency weakened further to hit a new low of 72.67 against the greenback, dropping nearly 94 paise in afternoon trade. Other than the turmoil in emerging markets, the major reason behind the fall in the rupee was strengthening US dollar and a surge in crude oil prices, which is threatening to disrupt India’s fiscal maths.


Trade war intensifiesAdding fuel to the trade conflict with China, US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened tariffs on a further $267 billion worth of Chinese imports. Subsequently, Beijing warned of retaliation if the US goes ahead with the new measures. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing would counter if the US takes any new step on trade.

27,2018-09-11,JSW,"KOLKATA: Two of India’s largest steel producers Tata Steel and JSW Steel are expected to improve earnings per tonne due to strong domestic consumption, few new capacity additions and higher capacity utilisation driven by consolidation in the sector.

This is part of Moody’s Investors Service latest outlook for the Asian steel industry which is tipped to remain stable on the back of steady demand with producers’ profitability expected to improve over the next 12 months.

Moody’s conclusions are contained in its just-released report, “Steel-Asia: Earnings Growth on Steady Asian Demand Drives Stable Outlook”.

“Profitability, as measured by average earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per tonne for our rated steel companies, will grow slightly over the next 12 months — following a strong improvement in 2017 — underpinned by steady regional demand,” Chris Park, a Moody’s Associate managing director said.

Two rated Indian steel producers’ EBITDA per tonne will rise by a midsingle-digit percentage on solid steel consumption, the report said. “With minimal new steel capacity expected to be commissioned until 2021 in India, robust steel demand — especially from the construction, infrastructure and automotive sectors — will keep end-product prices high, even as rising costs for key inputs, coking coal and iron ore, pressure profitability,” it added.

Tata Steel’s recent acquisition of 5.6 million tonne producer Bhushan Steel will increase in the company’s steel shipments by over a third. Moody’s expects Tata Steel’s India operations to see a rise in EBITDA per tonne by mid-single-digit over the next 12 months while the company’s backward integration in iron ore and coking coal augurs well in times of rising input prices.

JSW’s EBITDA per tonne will also increase by a mid-single digit, with the effect of rising input prices compensated by an increasing proportion of specialty and high-value-added products, and cost reductions. Moody’s also said Indian steel producers have marginal exposure to the US, reducing their indirect exposure since most of their sales are to domestic automotive and manufacturing companies."
28,2018-09-11,JSW,"The Supreme Court Tuesday said it would tomorrow hear a plea of ArcelorMittal challenging an NCLAT order asking it to pay by today Rs 7,000 crore to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel for which it has made an offer of Rs 42,000 crore.

A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said ""we will hear the matter tomorrow"".

The matter came up before the apex court a day after steel tycoon L N Mittal-promoted group made a bid of Rs 42,000 crore for Essar Steel.

ArcelorMittal has moved the apex court challenging the NCLAT order of September 7 by which it had held as eligible the second bid of NuMetal, a consortium of Russia's VTB-JSW, for Essar Steel.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had asked ArcelorMittal to clear the stigma of defaulter by clearing the dues of its subsidiaries.

The NCLAT had last Friday ruled that NuMetal's second bid for Essar Steel is eligible but the same by ArcelorMittal will qualify only if it clears the Rs 7,000 crore dues of firms it was previously associated within three days.

NuMetal and ArcelorMittal had in February submitted separate bids to takeover Essar Steel, which lenders were auctioning, to recover their Rs 49,000 crore defaulted loans.

The Committee of Creditors (CoC) had, however, disqualified both the bids saying their promoters were tied to companies which were bank loan defaulters and hence ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

The second round of bids was called where JSW Steel joined NuMetal to put in a bid of Rs 37,000 crore, while Vedanta Ltd entered the fray as a third bidder. ArcelorMittal too had put in a bid.

The NCLAT held that the first round of bids were not eligible but NuMetal's second bid submitted on March 29, after restructuring the share holding, was eligible. It had asked ArcelorMittal to clear the dues of Uttam Galva Steel and KSS Petron by September 11 for its bid to be considered eligible.

The Tribunal ordered the committee of Essar Steel creditors to get the highest value, including by negotiating with the eligible bidders expeditiously.

Both NuMetal and Essar Steel had initially moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)-Ahmedabad challenging the disqualification of the first round of bids. The NCLT had refused to give any relief to the bidders but asked the CoC to take another look at the bids before disqualifying them.

The NCLT order was challenged by both bidders in NCLAT. After the NCLT order, ArcelorMittal had offered to repay any outstanding loans owed by Uttam Galva Steels Ltd and KSS Petron. The steelmaker had placed Rs 7,000 crore in an escrow account, with the condition that the lenders disqualify Numetal's bid.

On its part, Numetal offered to take out Rewant Ruia, scion of Essar Steel's promoter Ruia family, from the company's share holding. JSW Steel Ltd replaced Rewant Ruia on NuMetal and brought to table technical knowhow on managing a steel plant.

The NCLAT last week directed the lenders of the Essar Steel to expeditiously take a decision on the bids. It held that NuMetal was not related to promoters of Essar Steel and hence eligible for submitting a resolution plan for the company.

However, in the case of ArcelorMittal, it had held that the company was connected to Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, which are classified by many banks as NPA. ""The stigma would continue till the payment of all charges by ArcelorMittal,"" the NCLAT had said and directed payment of dues within three days till September 11."

The remarks come a day after the leading global steel producer offered Rs 42,000 crore to acquire Essar Steel India Ltd (ESIL), upstaging a Rs 37,000 crore bid by Russia's VTB Group-backed NuMetal, in addition to Rs 7,000 crore it will pay to clear dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.

The Supreme Court would tomorrow hear a plea of ArcelorMittal challenging an NCLAT order asking it to pay by today Rs 7,000 crore to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel.

""The revised offer, which also includes a commitment to pay the entire amount due to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, therefore represents 'unprecedented value' to all concerned creditors. Through the revised offer ArcelorMittal demonstrates its serious commitment to India, creditor banks and all ESIL's stakeholders,"" the Luxembourg-headquartered company said in a statement.

In response to media speculation, ArcelorMittal confirms that yesterday, September 10, 2018, it submitted a revised proposal to the Committee of Creditors for the acquisition of ESIL, it said.

""The Company can also confirm that media reports speculating on the financial value of the revised offer are broadly accurate,"" ArcelorMittal said.

The statement said that the company believed ESIL provides it with a ""compelling opportunity to enter the high-growth Indian steel market and, should it prove successful with the proposed acquisition, ESIL will add significant strategic value to the group's business.""

The ministry wants to bring domestic secondary players at par with the primary steel players, Singh said at the first edition of Secondary Steel Sector Awards, instituted to acknowledge the role of the secondary sector in the domestic steel industry here. 

""The secondary industry contributes 57 per cent to the total domestic steel output. It is claimed that when the capacity would be 300 million tonne (MT), their share would increase to 70 per cent. It is very important sector and are being awarded for the first time. 

 ""I have seen awards for integrated steel players like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL and RINL... We also have plans of having Khel Ratna like award which is the highest honour in sports. It will be given to a player who works on research and development (R&D) and develops a patent of its own to produce steel,"" he told reporters. 

The minister also said that 86 per cent products being produced by the secondary sector are BIS-complaint. 

""We will bring the rest 14 per cent under the BIS code soon. In the beginning, they were reluctant. We explained them if you will go for any tender of any big project you will be disqualified on the very basis that you don't have BIS standard, your products are not of the required grade,"" Singh said. 

The ministry wants secondary sector to have a remarkable position in the global steel market. 

 The minister further said ""we want to bring secondary industry in par with the primary industry... I have also asked them to get in touch with SRTMI (under Steel Ministry) to identify the R&D needs of the country. The secondary sector must realise that besides increasing output, it must keep on exploring new and latest ways of producing steel."" 

New Steel Secretary Binoy Kumar said that the secondary sector is going to play a major role in India's economy and with this kind of recognition, the ministry wants to see how the sector gears up for the challenges of 2030-31.

37,2018-09-18,JSW,"MUMBAI: AION Capital Partners, the joint venture between global PE fund Apollo Global and domestic fund ICICI Venture, has joined the race to acquire a significant minority stake in Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB), according to two people aware of the development.

A clutch of private equity investors, including Blackstone, Carlyle and True North, and strategic investors such as DBS are engaged in an initial discussion to acquire a stake in LVB.

The bank plans to dilute stake between 26-30 per cent and has hired JP Morgan to run the process.

The 92-year-old bank will consider various strategic options after the private-sector lender’s board ratified the proposal and engaged in initial discussions with foreign banks and private equity funds, ET reported in May.

An AION spokesperson declined to comment.

“We have met investors including AION, Blackstone in the past for stake sale,” said Parthasarthi Mukherjee MD Lakshmi Vilas Bank. “The process is run by JP Morgan and we expect to close the deal by year end.”

In November 2017, Lakshmi Vilas raised Rupees 800 crore through a rights issue of shares. The promoters of LVB hold 9 per cent while public shareholders — including foreign portfolio investors and financial institutions — hold the remaining 91 per cent.

LVB has a strong base in Tamil Nadu and a significant presence in Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and as on June 30, 2018, the bank has 567 branches and 1,039 ATMs. Its focus areas is the retail, mid-market and corporate space. It has a strong deposit book of Rupees 32,473.26 crore.

The bank’s non-performing loans had shot up in the past one year and is at 9.8 per cent at the end of March 2018. The bank saw Rupees 2,916 crore of additions of bad loans during last fiscal year. It has market capitalisation of Rupees 2,386 crore.

The company is also looking to raise capital through qualified institutional investors or preferential allotment. This capital will be used to fund the growth and increase capital adequacy ratio which has fallen to less than 10 per cent. With bad assets cleaned from its book, the bank wants to increase its market share. The bank’s gross advances was at Rupees 27,000 crore.

LVB had a loss of Rupees 584.87 crore in FY18 against a profit of Rupees 256 crore in the previous year. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) stood at Rupees 2,694 crore in the last financial year compared with Rupees 489 crore in the year earlier. In percentage terms, it rose to 9.98 per cent from 2.67 per cent.

AION, a JV between global PE fund Apollo Management and ICICI Venture, was one among the contenders to acquire stake in Catholic Syrian Bank, which got acquired later by Prem Watsa-owned Fairfax India Holdings in February this year.

AION Capital had raised its maiden fund in 2014 at $825 million and invested in. Avantha Group, Ballarpur Industries Ltd, PlanetCast Media Services (formerly Essel Shyam Communications), electrical appliances maker Crompton Greaves. In 2016, AION had acquired the commercial lending and leasing business of GE Capital in India by joining hands with former senior GE Capital executives Pramod Bhasin and Anil Chawla.

A consortium of JSW Steel and AION Investments had acquired Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd for 2,875 crore this month as per the the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal.

The total PE/VC investment in the banking sector during the period 2015-first half of 2018 amounts to $2.9 billion, with $1.9 billion coming in 2017, according to a recent report by EY-IVCA (Indian PE & VC Association).

The top deals include $795-million investment in Axis Bank Ltd by Bain Capital in 2017; $387-million deal with Kotak Mahindra Bank by CPPIB, CDPQ; $259-million investment in RBL Bank by a clutch of investors such as CDC Group, ABG Capital and Multiple PE; $176 million in Bandhan Bank by IFC, GIC and SIDBI and $147-million ddeal by Temasek in AU Small Finance Bank in 2018.

“Year 2017 was the year when banks began to show signs of recovery and this was especially seen in the case of the larger private sector banks. The sector saw a high average deal value of $105 million during this period,” the EY report added."

39,2018-09-18,JSW,"Though PSU bank merger is an expedient solution from the government’s perspective, it is better if retail investors stay away from PSU banks if 
  
  
  they want to make money, Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Everybody was of the view that one should go ahead and merge PSU banks. Banking sector consolidation perhaps was the best and the only way out to repair some of the PSU banks but today when Bank of Baroda has been merged with Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, the stock is down is 12-13%. The BOB shareholders are not very happy.
It is the best of a bad situation from a country’s perspective. Not only do you have a paucity of capital amongst the PSU banks, an even greater weakness for the PSU banks is lack of management talent and bandwidth. Hundreds of highly capable managers are needed to turn around these 15 to 20 largest PSU banks and there simply is not that sort of talent available in the Indian markets, certainly not at the salaries that the PSU banks offer. 

So merging the weaker PSU banks with the stronger ones is an expedient solution from the government’s perspective. But as you are saying, the market is saying clearly and rightfully, that it is not the best idea for the Bank of Baroda shareholders. I suspect we will see more such mergers amongst the PSUs with the more capable PSUs being forced to take on board the less capable PSUs which is bad news for the shareholders of the better run PSUs. But from a practical perspective for the nation as a whole, this is an expedient way to move ahead and make the best of a bad situation. 


It took State Bank of India 12-18 months, when they decided to merge their own subsidiaries. Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank are three separate entities. One could be big, other could be small and another could be very small but the bottomline here is that government is trying to merge three islands. How long will it take for the integration to take place and the synergy benefits to flow through?
I do not think anything on this sort of scale has been done before in India. Anjali Bansal will be the chairperson of that merged entity. She is a very capable leader. She has got a big job on her hands and clearly the constants and the post merger integration team has an epic task ahead of them. 

But from the practical perspective of a stock market investor, I would reiterate that retail investors should stay away from PSU banks if you want to make money from buying PSU bank stocks at 1 time, 1.2 times price to book. 



The market has come off quite a way bit since we last spoke and irrespective of the government’s attempts, the currency weakness continues. We continue to face the heat from crude as well. Does it seem like we are out of the woods yet?
I have been saying for a good seven-eight months that this market is 15% to 20% overvalued and I am sticking to that point view. It could be a combination of currency weakness and the subsequent RBI tightening which I am sure will follow through in October and through the winter. That might be the long needed catalyst to get the market to retrace by 15-20%. 

But at the same time, it is worth reminding us again that the Indian market benefits from a weaker rupee. The IT stocks have had a stellar run for 9-10 months. I have been banging the table on the IT stocks since last November-December. The pharma stocks will continue doing well. The rupee has got to weaken further. Within the manufacturing sector, auto sector and auto ancillary sector, there are several names which have a high export component in their revenues. Those stocks will also benefit. So it is not all doom and gloom. There are companies who have significant export oriented revenues and they will be big beneficiaries of this long overdue correction in the rupee. 


When it comes to auto ancillaries, there are a few companies that have a large export component. Which ones are you particularly in favour of?
Without giving stock recommendations, I will say, companies which have over the last three-four years have been well managed companies with significant export revenues. Balkrishna Industries stands out as a prominent name in the highway tyre market. Then there is MM Forgings. Two-thirds of MM Forgings’ revenue come from abroad and we are talking about export revenues and not just company making a stuff overseas and selling it. 

Motherson Sumi makes stuff overseas and sells it there. It is not really an exporter but Balkrishna Industries and MM Forgings and to a lesser extent a Hero Moto are relatively well run companies which will benefit from the rupee coming off.


The theme at a global level is trade war. From an India standpoint, there are a handful of companies which have a presence or manufacturing presence in the US -- Bharat Forge, JSW Steel, Wellspun Corp. Could that be an exciting theme going forward? Go for companies which are likely to benefit from trade war and if America is fighting let us look at who is benefitting?
It is an interesting point that you have raised. I have to be honest that whilst I have tried to think through what are the second round, third round effects of the trade war on our economy, but I have not got very far. The best I can infer is we are likely to get an inflationary shock across the world as each country -- whether it is China or America, in India as we erect tariff barriers in retaliation to what America is doing, we will increase the cost of the goods that we use in our day to day lives. As we do that, it will create an inflationary shock across the world which in effect leads to monetary policy tightening. 

So in a way, it is the logical ending of the 10 years of record low cost of capital that we have had on the back of Lehman Brothers crisis. We have had 10 years of super low cost of capital, stocks have done very well in that decade -- whether it is in America or India and now we seem to be turning the tide through these tariff walls which will then create an inflationary shock which pushes up the cost of capital. The natural casualties of that are companies whose raw material is capital -- that is financials, it make for 40% of our stock market and the most exposed sector at this juncture as cost of capital continues to rise by the week in our country.


Last when we spoke, you continued to believe in the pharma story. and we have seen a solid rally play out in just not the domestic names but even some of the MNC pharma companies. The news flow has been positive as well. Is it time to be selective? Is the best of the rally behind us or is this just the beginning?
I would say it is sometime away from getting too selective about pharma or IT. There are a couple of reasons for that. One, the domestic flows courtesy SIPs domestic flows into the equity market continue to be pretty punchy. As long as fund managers keep getting inflows, I cannot see where else they will put their money beyond turning to well-run frontline names in IT and pharma. 

Two, the rupee weakness is far from over. As long as the correction continues, there will be good reason to carry on loading up on frontline names in IT and pharma. So both from a flows and a fundamental perspective, more is left in the IT, pharma rally because it is not clear where else fund managers who are getting flows will invest their monies.


When it comes to the sugar based on ethanol blending prices, would you say this is a sector to bet on? Would the speculative nature of some of these stocks and the high debt on their books make you stay away?
This is one of those sectors where there is a nice political cycle. As you get closer to elections in the big sugar producing states, there is a strong tendency to gratify the sugar lobby by hiking prices. So there is a political cycle but I have never been able to figure out how to second guess the political cycle other than by looking at elections and to the extent that this is sector driven by regulations and politicians. 

I am not so sure the average investor out there can time his entry and exit. Fundamentals seem to have very little to do with the sugar sector. Political or regulatory interventions make for a hazardous investing experience.


On OMCs, which camp do you belong to -- the bulls or the bears?
Let us first look at the bull element. A lot of credit has to go this government to have stood firm in the face of a such a steep rise in the rupee cost of petrol and diesel. It is politically unprecedented. I certainly have not seen this sort of political guts in my 10 years in India. Even for someone like me, every time I am filling my tank up, I am spending the best part of Rs 5000 on petrol. So, to see this sort of government firmness of intent is remarkable. 

The call that is still unclear is the election call. If this government comes back with similar number of seats in the Lok Sabha, it is reasonably clear that OMCs will do very well. If the government can hold its nerve at this juncture, I am pretty sure they will hold their nerve post the election. Once it is clearer what sort of government we are going to get after the election, you can use the OMCs as a bet on the elections. 

I do not yet know the outcome of the 2019 election and hence there is no point in second guessing that by buying OMCs this early. But OMC become a classic election play as we get closer to spring 2019."
40,2018-09-19,JSW,"MUMBAI: State-run Bank of India has put on block 45 bad loans aggregating to more than Rs 8,800 crore, including those of Essar Steel, Binani Cement, Bhushan Power and GMR Chhattisgarh.

The lender is looking to sell these to asset reconstruction companies even though bankruptcy proceedings are currently underway, because it believes the process wouldn't conclude before the end of the current quarter. Having these assets out of the books will help the bank show better earnings.

On some of the accounts — such as Alok Industries and Amtek Auto — the bankruptcy court has endorsed a resolution plan, but it is still trying to dispose of these on grounds that buyers were delaying payment.

Bidding for the bad loans is scheduled for September 26 and the sale will be on a 100% cash basis, bank officials told ET.

The terms for the sale include a condition that the bidders will have to share the upside profits with the bank for a few accounts such as Essar Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel, which have received aggressive bids but are facing litigation. 

The bank has also for the first time put on block several accounts on its overseas books, such as Essar Steel and Amtek Auto.

Reducing the share of distressed loans on the books is the only way to improve profit, a senior bank official said, who did not want to be named. “Resolution for some of the accounts does not appear to be in sight with many of them under litigation. At least by selling the accounts, we would be able to see the colour of money.”

The bank hopes to conclude the transactions by the end of this month so that it can be reflected in the earnings of the bank this quarter. The total NPA of the bank stood at 16.6% of assets. Post provisions, this fell to 8.4%.

The largest exposure on block is of Bhushan Power & Steel, amounting to Rs 2,439 crore — Rs 1,465 crore of domestic exposure, Rs 651 crore given from the Hong Kong branch, Rs 50 crore from New York branch and Rs 273 crore from Tokyo branch.

Bhashan Power is facing litigation with bidders Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Liberty House questing the resolution process. The matter is under review at the appellate bankruptcy court.

The other large exposure is to Essar Steel, amounting to Rs 1557 crore, which includes Rs 1282 crore of domestic loans and the rest given from overseas branches. GMR Chhattisgarh Energy owes it Rs 562 crore, which is also on sale.

Bank officials said based on bids received from asset reconstruction companies, the bank will finalise a reserve price for each account. Thereafter, bidding under the swiss challenge model will take place.

The other accounts which are on block even as they are nearing the resolution at bankruptcy court includes Binani Cement (Rs 61 crore); Amtek Auto (Rs 140 crore) and group companies AWM Motor (Rs 253 crore) and AMW Auto Companies; Asian Colour Coated (Rs 190 crore); Jai Balaji (Rs 123 crore); and Uttam Galva Steel (Rs 198 crore)."

The index formed a pattern similar to Three Black Crows and made a lower high lower low on the daily scale, which indicates that bears are having a tight grip on the market.

Now, till Nifty holds below 11,333 level, it can slip towards previous swing high of 11,171 and lower zones, while on the upside, hurdle is seen at 11,333 then 11,400.

On option front, maximum Put open interest is at 11,200 followed by 11,000 strike, while maximum Call OI is at 11,500 then 11,400 strikes. We have seen Call writing at 11,300 followed by 11,400 strike, while Put unwinding is seen at all immediate strikes.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices trailed benchmark Sensex, falling by 0.72 per cent and 0.98 per cent.


Let's take a look at the highlights of Wednesday's session:

Rupee gained some ground
Indian rupee recovered on Wednesday by rising 58 paise to 72.38 against the US dollar on fresh selling of the US currency by exporters and banks. Weakness in the dollar against other currencies and easing crude prices in the global market helped the domestic currency rebound. 


Sensex movers and shakers
HDFC twins contributed over 100 points to the fall in Sensex. IndusInd Bank, Maruti, ITC and Reliance Industries also featured among top drag. In terms of percentage loss, IndusInd Bank (3.03 per cent), Maruti (2.30 per cent), HDFC Bank (1.58 per cent), YES Bank (1.44 per cent) and HDFC (1.35 per cent) were the top five losers.

Metal pack bucked the trendEven as market ended the day on a dull note, metal pack dazzled on reports that the government was to raise import duty on some steel products to 15 per cent. Another media report suggested that the US may exempt Indian steel and alumimium from the higher tariff regime announced by President Donald Trump's administration this March. But the exemption is likely to come with riders. The BSE Metal pack climbed 1.25 per cent, with JSW Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, Nalco and Hindalco among top gainers. 


Sugar stocks ralliedAfter approving a hike in ethanol purchase price by up to 25 per cent, the government is likely to raise minimum selling price for sugar to Rs 32,000 per tonne for the 2018/19 season from Rs 29,000 in the current season, Reuters reported.

45,2018-09-20,JSW,"Nomura, India has a buy call on JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 484.

The current market price of JSW Steel is Rs 416.60.

Time period given by the financial firm is one year when JSW Steel price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by Nomura:
Indian steel on cusp of strong demand growth, but capacity expansion is slow. We expect Indian steel demand to grow at 5-7 per cent over the next decade driven by large-scale infra spending and consumption growth. Steel capacity expansion in FY18-21F likely to be limited, which will likely saturate capacity in next 3-4 years, in our view. Already in FY19 we are seeing steel demand growing faster than GDP.

JSW Steel (JSTL) is favoured, in our view, due to its history of timely capex and lowest capacity-expansion costs. JSW Steel is incurring Rs 440bn capex programme on expanding capacity from 18mnT (currently) to 24.7mnT by FY21F and adding value-added products (improving product mix). This will drive EBITDA margins and profitability growth while maintaining balance sheet strength, in our view.

Balance sheet remains strong despite capex-intense phase, as cost-saving measures and increased share of value-added products has led to strong operating cash flows. Even FY18 OCF of Rs 124bn largely covers FY19F capex of Rs 100bn and estimated interest expenses; hence, we believe debt metrics are likely to improve despite heavy capex.

JSTL could incur capex on acquisitions (inorganic) for 4.5-8.0mnT while maintaining net debt metrics. With lots of stressed assets up for sale in India, we see great value-addition potential (historically JSTL has turned around acquired assets, transforming them into low-cost steel converters).


Valuation- Trading at 6.7x FY20F EV/EBITDA; initiate at Buy: We value JSTL at 2.53x one-year forward P/B (regression justified) and add Rs 7.9/share value accretion from Monnet Ispat to arrive at a target price of Rs 484, implying 18 per cent upside, and hence we initiate with Buy. Key risks are sharp compression in steel spreads and risks to supply of iron ore and coking coal."

50,2018-09-21,JSW,"NEW DELHI: It was complete mayhem on Dalal Street that shocked investors on Friday as BSE benchmark Sensex plunged and then recovered 800 points within minutes.

Sensex swung 1,500 points intraday, Nifty witnessed a movement of 480 points and the volatility index, India VIX, stood at 9.69 per cent.

Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty opened in the positive zone, traded in the green zone during the first half, plunged sharply in the afternoon session and settled after staging a smart recovery. 

After falling about 1,128 points intraday, the 30-share Sensex closed at 36,841.60, with a loss of 279.62 points, or 0.75 per cent. Overall, 13 stocks in the index ended the day with gains.

The Nifty50 plunged 368 points intraday and eventually closed at 11,143.10, with a loss of 91.25 points, or 0.81 per cent. Among the 50 stocks in the index, 23 settled in the positive terrain and 27 in the negative zone.

This was the fourth consecutive fall for Sensex and Nifty on a daily basis. Sensex lost 1,249 points, or 3.28 per cent even as Nifty pared 372 points or 3.23 per cent in the last four sessions. 

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap underperformed benchmark Sensex and finished the day with a loss of 1.72 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.

Analysts said a tight money market and the lack of clarity regarding IL&FS exposure led to the knee-jerk reaction.


YES Bank plunged
Shares of YES Bank plunged 28.71 per cent on BSE on Friday, finishing at Rs 227.05. The stock hit its 52-week low of Rs 210.10 today after the RBI asked its managing director and CEO Rana Kapoor to step down after an extended term till January 31, 2019. The news upset the investors and most top brokerages downgraded the stock after RBI's directive. The market capitalisation of the company plunged by over Rs 22,000 crore today.

51,2018-09-22,JSW,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel has signed a definitive agreement to take over the specialty steel business of Kolkata-based steel and wire rope maker Usha Martin for a cash consideration between Rs 4,300 crore and Rs 4,700 crore, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange on Saturday. 

The transaction, which is Tata Steel's first major acquisition outside the NCLT process where it bagged Bhushan Steel earlier this year, involves Usha Martin's one million tonne specialty steel plant in Jamshedpur that makes alloy based long products. The facility at Jamshedpur also comprises a functional iron ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.

In a separate statement Usha Martin said, ""all the employees pertaining to the steel business will be transferred as part of the divestment and the sale proceeds will be applied first to repay existing lenders of Usha Martin.""

The deal, which is estimated to get completed in the next 6-9 months will help Tata Steel build capacity in long and value added products used particularly in the automotive segment. It will also help Usha Martin clear debt worth over Rs 3,700 crore. 

""The company may acquire the asset itself or use any of its subsidiaries to acquire it at the time of closing,""a Tata Steel statement said.

ET had first reported in June that Tata Steel has shown interest in buying the asset along with JSW Steel, Liberty Group and Kalyani Steel after reporting in May that the asset was being put on the block by the company. Vedanta had also shown preliminary interest. 

This is another asset for which Tata Steel has trumped rival JSW Steel which was also keenly pursuing it to enhance its presence in the east. It had earlier defeated the Sajjan Jindal-led steelmaker in succeeding to acquire Bhushan Steel and putting in a higher bid for Bhushan Power and Steel. 

""Tata Steel Limited hereby announces that it has executed definitive agreements for acquisition of the steel business of Usha Martin Limited through a slump sale on a going concern basis,"" the company said in a release. 

Usha Martin's steel business had reported a revenue of Rs 3,441 crore in the last fiscal year."
52,2018-09-24,JSW,"Mumbai: Within days of selling their specialty steel business to the Tatas, the promoters of Usha Martin, Basant and Prashant Jhawar, Monday sought transparency from the Tatas on fund utlilisation saying as of now there is no clarity on who'll get how much from the sale proceeds.

In one of the largest debt resolution plans outside the NCLT process, the Usha Martin board had Saturday signed an agreement with Tata Steel to acquire the Kolkata-based steel and wire rope-maker for a cash consideration up to Rs 4,300- 4,700 crore.

Usha Martin, which had a debt of over Rs 3,700 crore and a revenue of Rs 3,441 crore in the last fiscal year, had informed the exchanges that the sale would bring down the debt significantly. SBI is the lead banker for the group's debt.

The slump sale is a milestone in the six-decade history of the Kolkata-based company and one of the few instances of promoters deleveraging through asset sale.

""Though we are encouraged by the Tatas signing an agreement with the current management of Usha Martin, the end use of the funds is opaque,"" Usha Martin founder Basant Jhawar and his son Prashant, who together own 25 per cent stake in the company, said in a statement Monday.

But the Jhawars were quick to add that the Tatas' involvement in their steel business will add value to the stakeholders and that the transaction with Tata Steel is overall a positive development.

The company is fighting a takeover and management control battle at the NCLT now.

""As 25 per cent shareholders, we are concerned about the liabilities which will fall on the residual business and its capacity to service the same. No details are available.

""How much of the term loans, working capital, liabilities to unsecured creditors and other liabilities will be cleared and how much will be carried forward with the burden falling on residual business is very opaque.

""This has created doubts over the transparency and the management accountability. Since no details are on the table, our concern over diversion of funds continues,"" they said and sought ""complete transparency in fund utilisation"" and have sought further details from the board.

The deal is expected to be completed over the next two-three quarters.

""It is proposed that the steel business of Usha Martin will be acquired subject to transaction closing, for a cash consideration of Rs 4,300-4,700 crore subject to various transaction adjustments,"" Tata Steel had said in a statement.

Usha Martin's steel business comprises the specialised one-million tonne alloy-based manufacturing capacity in long products segment in Jamshedpur, a producing iron-ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.

Tata Steel is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 27.5 million tonne as of March.

Usha Martin is amongst the top five wire rope manufacturers in the world and a leading speciality steel producer in the country.

In May, Bamnipal Steel, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in Bhushan Steel, for a consideration of Rs 35,200 crore, though the insolvency auction process.

JSW Steel, Liberty Group, Kalyani Steel and Vedanta were also in the fray."
54,2018-09-25,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Losses in shares of Coal India (down 2.31 per cent), Tata Steel (down 1.91 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (down 0.99 per cent) dragged the metal index down in Tuesday's session. 

The Nifty Metal index was trading 0.60 per cent down at 3,610 around 12:20 pm. 

Shares of Hindustan Copper (down 0.80 per cent), Hindalco Industries (down 0.25 per cent) and MOIL (down 0.23 per cent) also suffered losses. 

However, Nalco (up 2.30 per cent), Steel Authority of India (SAIL) (up 1.77 per cent) and Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (up 1.73 per cent) clocked decent gains.

NMDC (up 0.53 per cent), APL Apollo Tubes (up 0.29 per cent), Jindal Steel & Power (up 0.16 per cent), JSW Steel (up 0.11 per cent) and Vedanta (up 0.09 per cent) too were in the green zone at that time. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 26 points at 10,993, while the BSE Sensex was up 108 points at 36,413. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 28 were trading in the green, while 22 were in the red. 

Axis Bank, YES Bank, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank and Infosys were among the top gainers in the Nifty index.

Indiabulls Housing Finance, GAIL (India), BPCL, HPCL and PowerGrid were among the top losers in the Nifty pack of stocks."
53,2018-09-25,JSW,"Tata Steel’s likely acquisition of Usha Martin’s steel operations on a slump sale basis for Rs 4,300-4,700 crore is small, yet a good one. The buyout that includes Usha Martin’s captive iron ore mine and a power plant marginally increases debt on Tata Steel’s already leveraged balance sheet, but offers significant scope for earnings improvement.

Usha Martin’s EBIDTA per tonne in FY18 was around Rs 5,500. Peers with a similar set-up make much higher profits. For instance, EBIDTA per tonne for Jindal Steel & Power is Rs 10,600. This means that after the buyout by Tata Steel, Usha Martin’s steel division profits could improve sharply.

The acquisition of a million tonnes of steel capacity would include a captive 2.5 mtpa iron ore mine, which is 160 km away from the steel plant, and a 155-MW captive power plant. The company also has a coal mine that it won in the 2015 auctions. Analysts attribute low profitability to existing operational inefficiencies, and estimate an earnings upgrade in the next 18 to 24 months. The transaction could take 6 to 9 months.

At Rs 4,500 crore, the transaction can be valued at 6 to 6.5 EV by potential EBIDTA. Enterprise value is the market capitalization plus net debt. This would increase the net debt (from FY18 end) by 6 per cent, a limited impact for the Tatas. But once the earnings are upgraded, the acquired asset will be able to meet its own debt obligations.

For Tata Steel shareholders, the acquisitions of 1 mtpa steel capacity remains largely insignificant when compared with the overall size of the company. Tata Steel’s Indian capacity is 13 mtpa, which it plans to increase to 18 mtpa through expansion. What will be more important is the outcome on the Bhushan Power and Steel bidding, where Tata Steel is competing with JSW Steel and Liberty House.

This will decide the extent of leverage the company is willing to take. Its consolidated net debt (Rs 72,000 crore) to EBIDTA (Rs 21,890 crore) in FY18 was 3.3 and is expected to increase to 3.6. This is in the positive phase of the cycle. Bhushan’s acquisition could take the net debt to Rs 1.1 lakh crore and that may be considered a stretch by a section of the investors. On Monday, Tata Steel’s stock fell 2.8 per cent to Rs 607.7."
55,2018-09-25,JSW,"After an immensely volatile session and gyrating over 180 points, the equity market ended with decent gains, as short covering fuelled the pullback rally in Tuesday’s trade. 

The session remained technically important as Nifty held on to its 100-DMA on a closing basis after closing a notch lower in the previous session. At the end of the day, the index settled with a gain of 100.05 points or 0.91 per cent.

The Nifty also did not breach the previous immediate low of 10,866 and formed a marginally higher low of 10,882 on Tuesday.

On Wednesday we will enter the penultimate day of the expiry of the current derivative series, which has remained one of the most volatile series in recent times.

We expect a quiet start to the trade on Wednesday and the market is expected to remain volatile. However, continuation of the pullback is very much likely. In any case, the level of 11,170 will be important level to watch for in coming days.


ETMarkets.com
We expect the levels of 11,090 and 11,170 to act as resistance area on the upside, while 11,010 and 10,935 are expected to act as supports.

The RSI on the daily chart stands at 37.3306. It remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line.

As we approach expiry day, and as we navigate the last two sessions of the current derivative series, volatility is something that we will have to deal with. 

In event of any weakness, the immediate past low of the market is not likely to be breached. On the upsides, the level of 11,170 will continue to provide resistance until it is breached on the upside.

We expect a rangebound and volatile trade going ahead with no significant downsides likely. We expect the short covering to continue. Exposures should still be kept moderate unless we move past the important 11,170-mark.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Short covering was seen in stocks like Adani Power, ICICI Bank, PFC, Dish TV, Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, JSW Steel, SAIL, State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Hindalco, Infosys and Tata Power.

9,2018-10-04,JSW,"KOLKATA: Acquisition of stressed steel assets could increase leverage of acquiring companies, which also face the risk of higher imports in the domestic market as trade risks mount according to a new report on the sector by Fitch Ratings.

Domestic steel majors Tata Steel Limited and JSW Steel Limited have acquired steel assets that were under insolvency proceedings, seeing them as an opportunity to gain capacity cheaply and quickly in a fast-expanding market compared with executing green-field projects. ""We believe acquisitions could increase TSL's leverage and that even though JSWS has taken a more conservative approach in terms of transaction structure, a shift from its focus on maintaining investment discipline may also weaken its credit profile,"" the report said. 

Fitch also believes solid domestic demand has created space to accommodate some increase in imports, but domestic output could be displaced if imports pick up substantially, possibly due to escalation of trade barriers. However, the government could boost the currently inadequate protectionist measures for the domestic industry in such a scenario.

The report added that capex at TSL and JSW is likely to rise from the financial year ending March 2019 due to planned projects, which could keep leverage near current levels for the next three years with neutral to negative free cash flow. ""We believe this will offset gains from a larger scale and higher market share,"" it said."
10,2018-10-05,JSW,"Nifty 50 companies are likely to report 11.4 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit for the September 2018 quarter. At 7.4 per cent, profit growth in the previous quarter had fallen below 10 per cent after three consecutive quarters of double digit growth. Revenue is expected to grow by 11.6 per cent in the September quarter, which would be the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Growth in revenue and profit in the year-ago quarter was 11.6 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.

Improving trend in the financials of top companies may offer some solace to investors amid a sharp drop in benchmark indices over the past few weeks. S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have lost over 7 per cent in a month. The current market turmoil is likely to result in mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio of companies, especially banks and finance companies. Its extent is difficult to measure at the aggregate level but may cause some pressure on the bottomlines.

Select companies in the automobiles, banking and finance, consumer goods, mining, and IT sectors are likely to support overall growth of the sample. The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by 18.8 per cent in the September quarter, faster than 15.2 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin is likely to expand by 60 basis points to 21.6 per cent.




SECTOR TREND

AUTOMOBILES
Two-wheeler companies are likely to drive earnings growth of the sector for the September quarter due to sustained volume growth despite many disruptions. The floods in Kerala and new rules of registration in Bengal did impact the volume growth. The volumes of Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto grew 6 per cent and 26 per cent, while that of Maruti Suzuki fell by 1.5 per cent during the quarter. The operating margins may shrink by 50-100 basis points due to higher input prices.


BANKING, FINANCE
Banks with higher exposure to corporate loans such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank may show deceleration in new bad loan recognition for the September quarter. Other banks with greater retail exposure such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank are likely to report sustained momentum in advances. Rising interest costs may put pressure on margins. In addition, mark-to-market losses on investments may widen due to a sharp fall in the stock market.


CAPITAL GOODS
A sustained order flow from the government should support the growth of capital goods companies. Project execution is picking up as most of the slow moving orders are out of the system. The order inflows momentum of Larsen & Toubro shows that it will be able to meet its order inflow and revenue growth guidance.


CEMENT
The September quarter is again expected to be driven by volume growth rather than price increase.

Cement volumes of the top five players by capacity Ultratech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to increase by 10-25 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter. Their revenue is likely to grow by 8-15 per cent while net profit may drop due to higher pet coke prices.


FMCG PREVIEW
A gradual recovery in rural demand may support the performance of FMCG companies. However, a below normal monsoon remains a concern. Companies are likely to raise product prices to pass on the higher input costs.


IT
A sharp depreciation of 4.3 per cent sequentially and 8.1 per cent annually in the average rate of the rupee against the dollar and momentum in projects on the digital platform will be the key growth drivers for the sector in the September quarter. TCS and HCL Technologies are expected to fare better while Wipro may continue to face pressure on the topline.


PHARMA PREVIEW
The September quarter performance of pharma companies is likely to indicate the bottoming out of price erosion in the US generics market. In the absence of any major launch in the US, companies are likely to report lack-lustre performance. There has also been rationalisation in the R&D expenses. The management commentary on the business prospects in the US market would be crucial.


METALS & MINING
Base metal companies such as Hindalco and Vedanta are likely to see a subdued quarter due to flat product prices year-on-year. LME aluminium prices were 2-3 per cent higher while LME zinc prices were down 10 per cent . A weak rupee would partially offset these negatives. JSW Steel and Tata Steel are likely to report decent quarters due to firm steel prices and weak rupee advantage.


POWER
Although monsoon is seasonally the weakest quarter for the sector, power companies are likely to report good growth. Power generation may grow by 6 per cent year-on-year. Higher merchant tariffs will help. It may turn out to be a decent quarter for a sector which has remained weak for the last several years.


TELECOM
The competitive pressure will continue to eat into profits and profitability of the telecom operators. Which means the commentary may not be much different for the second quarter compared with the past several quarters."
11,2018-10-08,JSW,"MUMBAI: Russia’s second-largest banking group VTB is set to make a solo bid for the bankrupt Essar Steel, people directly aware of the matter said. This follows the Supreme Court order that VTB cannot be barred from the auction process because of sanctions imposed by the US on Russian government entities in the wake of the Ukraine annexation in 2014.

The SC last week allowed VTB-led Numetal consortium and ArcelorMittal to resubmit bids for Essar Steel, which is saddled with Rs 49,000-crore debt and being sold under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta is the third bidder in the fray.



VTB — which holds a 40% stake in Numetal — has now decided to go at it alone, bolstered by the apex court observation that it wasn’t ineligible due to the US sanctions. The Numetal consortium included UAE-based Indo International Trading (34.1%) and Russian engineering company TPE (25.9%). Numetal has JSW Steel as a 25% shareholder in its step-down Indian subsidiary. VTB, through its subsidiary Crinium Bay, will buy out these investors wrapping up the consortium.

The decision to make an ambitious, solo bid for the Indian steel maker comes even as VTB group’s chief executive Andrey Kostin was part of a business delegation accompanying Russian President Vladimir Putin to India. Entities of the Russian government have over 60% ownership in VTB.

Numetal’s last bid for Essar Steel was pegged at Rs 37,000 crore. ArcelorMittal made an offer of Rs 42,000 crore, while Vedanta’s bid was estimated at Rs 35,000 crore.

Incidentally, the Mauritius-incorporated Numetal originally had Aurora Enterprises — controlled by Rewant Ruia, a member of the Essar Steel promoter family — as a shareholder. However, it rejigged the shareholding after the participation of Aurora Enterprises ran into bankruptcy regulations. Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) bars promoters and their relatives of non-performing assets (NPAs) from participating in bankruptcy processes.

Last Thursday, the apex court invoked its extraordinary powers to provide both Numetal and ArcelorMittal one more opportunity to bid for Essar Steel after clearing dues pertaining to non-performing loans. 

One of the sources cited earlier said VTB’s solo move is significant in this context as Numetal, due to its original shareholding, would have had to settle the entire Rs 49,000 crore as calculated by resolution professional Satish Kumar Gupta. ArcelorMittal would have had to pay Rs 7,000 crore associated with NPAs like Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.

Sources said VTB’s decision to submit a solo bid would expand the bidding fray for Essar Steel. JSW Steel — which was part of the Numetal consortium — may bid independently, making it a four-way final race for India’s fourth-largest steel maker. It isn’t clear how the latest developments would tilt the equations in the most fiercely fought bankruptcy auction, also the most high-profile test case for the recently enacted IBC.

Numetal and Essar Steel declined to comment, while VTB could not be reached for comments immediately."

18,2018-10-09,JSW,"JSW Steel is seeking a legal opinion if it can bid solo for stressed assets of Essar Steel, a top company official said Tuesday. When asked if JSW Steel is mulling going solo for acquiring stressed assets of Essar Steel if fresh bids were allowed, JSW Steel joint managing director Seshagiri Rao said that it would depend on legal opinion and the view of the Committee of Creditors. 

 ""It depends upon the legal opinion and the view of the CoC (Committee of Creditors) and the Resolution Professional (RP). If they take a positive view ... then we are open to look at it,"" he told reporters here. 

 ""We are seeking a legal opinion and based on that opinion we will take a call,"" he said. 

 He was speaking during the International Conference on Minerals and Metals. 

 ""At that time when the second round of bidding was happening JSW Steel was looking at submitting the bid alone. We were not permitted. So, we have to see what view CoC and RP will take in the light of the Supreme Court judgement,"" he said. 

 JSW Steel had teamed up with NuMetal to place a Rs 37,000-crore offer for Essar Steel in the second round of bidding. 

 NuMetal and ArcelorMittal were the only two parties that bid to buy out Essar Steel in the first round but the resolution professional was advised to reject both the bids owing to their promoters being linked to defaulter companies. 

 The Supreme Court last week granted one more opportunity to steel and mining major ArcelorMittal and Russia's VTB Bank-promoted NuMetal to bid for Essar Steel, provided the two pay off the non-performing assets (NPAs) of their related corporate debtors within two weeks. 

 As per the judgement, ArcelorMittal would qualify to bid for Essar Steel only if it clears the Rs 7,000 crore dues of two firms, Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, it was previously associated with. 

 With regard to NuMetal, it has not specified NPAs of its related corporate debtors which have to be paid off to become eligible to bid for corporate debtors Essar Steel, which had NPAs or bad debts amounting to Rs 45,000 crore."

With the use of plastic likely declining following a ban on the material, domestic steelmakers appear rather optimistic about an increase in tinplate demand from the packaging industry, and are adding capacities to raise tin output.

Tinplate, a thin steel sheet coated with tin, is used for making containers such as beverage cans, food containers and packages. Even though India’s per capita consumption of tinplate has been low in comparison with countries such as China, stringent norms such as the recent curbs on plastic use are helping boost tinplate demand. Improving rural demand could also enhance tinplate consumption.

To be sure, increasing imports of tinplate from Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners pose a threat.

""The use of tin as a mode of packaging has picked up,"" Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing, JSW Steel, told ET in an interaction.

""The aspiration for using tin as a packaging medium was always there, but it was perceived as the appropriate material for higher-end products. Now, rural buyers at malls, too, find tin packaging attractive.”

Earlier this year, JSW Steel had begun building a tinplate line of 0.25 million tonnes per annum at Tarapur. It had entered the tinplate making business with its acquisition of Vallabh Tinplate that it bought for Rs 46 crore in 2014. Prior to this, tinplate making was Tata Steel's monopoly, with its subsidiary Tinplate Company of India controlling almost half the production of the material.

It still controls 45% of the total market share and with a capacity of 379,000 per annum and 94% utilisation, it is also considering output expansion, PTI had reported in July."

13,2018-10-09,JSW,"Kolkata: JSW Steel is considering legal opinion on the possibility of a fresh bid for Essar Steel and would be interested in entering the fray with an independent offer if it is legally tenable in light of the recent Supreme Court order.

The apex court has directed rival Essar Steel bidders, ArcelorMittal and Numetal, to clear their respective dues and meet the eligibility norms under the bankruptcy rules.

Essar Steel’s bid size is expected to be around Rs 40,000-45,000 crore, and JSW is most likely to rope in a PE partner if it is allowed an independent bid.

Officials from Numetal’s lead players VTB and JSW were in a huddle with lawyers on Monday, and so have been the bankers who are seeking legal opinion before planning their next move. Apparently, legal experts have picked up the last paragraph of the order that says if the resolution applicants pay within the period, they can resubmit their plans to the Committee of Creditors (CoC) who will get eight weeks to accept the best plan, including that submitted by Vedanta.

This is being interpreted by a section of the lawyers as an opportunity for the CoC to call for a third round of bids. Lawyers from Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas are among those advising bankers on the issue.

When asked about its plans in the wake of the order, a top source in JSW Steel told ET: “If the CoC looks at it positively and opens up the bidding process to widen the fray, we would be interested to put in an independent bid. We were keen on going it alone in the second round too but we were not allowed to do so.”

VTB has said that its interest in Essar Steel remains unchanged after the top court order, with reports suggesting it might consider bidding on its own. However, sources said that while VTB can underwrite the deal, as a stateowned entity, it is unlikely to bid on its own and this could also involve a lot of tax issues. Incidentally, VTB was part of the Essar Oil deal, too, where it bought out the company’s loan book and sold it to Rosneft.

The Supreme Court order said: “If such payments are made within the aforesaid period, both resolution applicants can resubmit their resolution plans dated…to the Committee of Creditors, who are then given a period of eight weeks from this date, to accept … the best among the plans submitted, including the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta.”

JSW joined the race for Essar Steel by picking up the 25% stake held in Numetal by Aurora Enterprise, which represented Essar co-founder Ravi Ruia’s son Rewant Ruia’s interests."

Steel mills in India are increasingly tapping the global market for iron ore as they find it difficult to transport the key raw material from local mines, and demand for the metal surges in response to the government’s ambitious plans to build out the nation’s infrastructure.

“Today, India is a net importer of iron ore,” as producers along the coast buy from overseas because they face domestic logistics challenges, mainly as a result of an overloaded railway system, Tuhin Mukherjee, managing director of Essel Mining & Industries Ltd., said in an interview in New Delhi.

Freight and passenger trains in Asia’s third-largest economy jostle for space on the same tracks, and goods carriers often have to make way for passenger traffic, prolonging turnaround time for wagons hauling commodities. More supplies of iron ore will be required as the South Asian nation is set to overtake Japan as the world’s second-biggest steel producer this year.

More demand from India for imports will help global mining companies. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. doubled sales outside China to 8 percent in the year through June, and has experienced strong growth in cargoes to India, Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Gaines said in an interview in August.


Bloomberg

“If iron ore is available at competitive prices domestically, it won’t happen,” Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the country’s top mill JSW Steel Ltd., said in an interview, referring to imports. “That’s why we are requesting the domestic mining companies to adjust the prices in line with the quality of the iron ore. But the problem today is that even though the iron ore is getting mined, transportation is the issue.”


‘Better Price’
Inbound cargoes from April through July, the first four months of the current fiscal year, were 5.5 million tons, more than three times shipments in the year ago period, according to Commerce Ministry data. By contrast, exports dropped 40 percent on year to 5.1 million tons. Australia’s government expects annual imports to rise to 19 million tons by 2020, with exports at 8 million tons.

“Wherever you get a better price, better availability, people will go for that. You cannot restrict that,” said Mukherjee, who runs the iron ore arm of billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Aditya Birla Group. “Earlier, people were talking about quantity, today they are talking about quality. If at a good price they get good quality and low aluminum, they will jump on that.”"

25,2018-10-12,JSW,"Mumbai: With less than a week left for Essar Steel bidders to obtain eligibility tag, VTB Capital Friday petitioned the Supreme Court to be allowed to bid alone for the asset, sources aware of the development told ET.

VTB Capital has so far bid for the steelmaker in a consortium with Numetal, and has reportedly offered Rs 37,000 crore. However, last week, Supreme Court ruled that Numetal and second bidder ArcelorMittal must pay off dues owed by defaulting companies linked to them to be eligible to buy Essar Steel.

This had given rise to speculation that the state-owned Russian bank might go solo for Essar Steel. EThad reported on Tuesday that VTB Capital is consulting its lawyers to decide whether to bid for Essar Steel independent of Numetal.

VTB has said it has sovereign guarantee of the Russian government, the source said. It has been considering this option after the apex court observed the “looming presence of Rewant Ruia” in Numetal all along even after VTB bought out his stake in the consortium.

An email sent to VTB Capital remained unanswered.

To become eligible, Numetal will have to pay all the dues related to its promoter and not just Essar Steel, much like its rival bidder ArcelorMittal.

Separately, JSW Steel had partnered Numetal in the second round of bidding. It has also said it is considering a solo bid for the asset if allowed by the resolution professional and committee of creditors (CoC).

In another development, ArcelorMittal on Friday proposed to pay off Rs 4,500 crore out of the total dues at Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron, two sources aware of the development said.

ArcelorMittal declined to comment on ET's query.

However, the insolvency proceedings against the two companies will continue, said one of the sources. ArcelorMittal had been mandated by the Supreme Court to pay off Rs 7,000 crore as dues owed by Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron, companies in which it earlier held stakes, to become eligible to acquire Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal had offered Rs 42,000 crore in its last bid for Essar Steel.

Supreme Court told both bidders on October 4 that they had two weeks to pay off dues to be eligible to bid again. After the deadline, the lenders have eight weeks to evaluate the bids. If no plan is found fit, the asset will go into liquidation. Essar Steel owes Rs 49,000 crore to banks."

24,2018-10-12,JSW,"MUMBAI: Sanjeev Gupta led Liberty House will be buying ArcelorMittal's steel plants in Europe that the world's largest steelmaker has put on the block to clear its way to buy Italian steel company Ilva, Liberty House announced on Friday. 

The steelmaker has made a binding offer to buy ArcelorMittal's major integrated works at Galati in Romania and Ostrava in Czech Republic, along with rolling mills at Skopje in Macedonia and Piombino in Italy; a move that will more than double its global production capacity. 

The four facilities will together add 8 MT rolling capacity to Liberty House and take it to 15 MT a year apart from adding 12,500 people to its total workforce. The plants serve domestic and wider European markets, including automotive, construction, industrial machinery and oil and gas sectors. 



The announcement follows another recent announcement by Liberty House of acquiring France's last remaining aluminium wheelmaker as well as to purchase Europe's largest aluminium smelter at Dunkerque. 

""At a stroke these acquisitions would almost double the size of our workforce and global production capacity, giving us a strong presence in the heart of Europe’s key manufacturing regions,"" executive chairman of GFG Alliance, Sanjeev Gupta said in a release. GFG Alliance is the parent company of Liberty House. ""We intend to work with local partners to position ourselves strongly within the domestic supply chains of these fast-expanding national economies and become a pivotal part of a thriving European industrial sector,"" Gupta added. 

ArcelorMittal had bagged Ilva from the Italian government last year, in a deal amounting to 1.8 billion Euros. JSW Steel was also interested in buying the plant which is the biggest by output in the continent. 

However, the European Union (EU) antitrust regulators were concerned that the acquisition would reduce competition in some flat carbon steel products and result in higher prices in southern Italy. This resulted in AM deciding to sell off a large capacity to allay the regulators' worries. 

Back home, Liberty House has already bagged Amtek Auto and Adhunik Metaliks under the insolvency law and has put in binding bid for Bhushan Power and Steel which is still awaiting a final order. ET reported on Friday that the company has also submitted an Expression of Interest (EoI) for two of Uttam Galva Steels' debt-ridden subsidiaries - Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics."

Karnataka Bank, Tata Sponge: 3I Infotech, Karnataka Bank, Tata Sponge and Integrated Capital Services will be other companies scheduled to announce their second quarter numbers later in the day. 


TCS: The second quarter performance of TCS shows that the country’s largest software exporter is on a solid footing. For the first six months of the current fiscal, the company delivered a double- digit topline growth in dollar terms for the first time in four years. And, this was without sacrificing operating profitability.


PNB Housing Finance: The company is looking to raise another $250-300 million through external commercial borrowing by November amid market turmoil and fear of a further squeeze in the liquidity system. 


Jet Airways: The company has delayed the payment of salaries due on Thursday to its senior employees, a problem that has been recurring for the last two months. In September, Jet announced that the airline will pay its employees salary in two equal instalments — 50 per cent on 11th and the remainder on 27th of every month till November.

APL Apollo, meanwhile, has shown interest in buying Uttam Value Steels, the source told ET.

Both target companies are subsidiaries of debt-laden Uttam Galva Steels, promoted by the Miglani family. Uttam Value Steels owes banks Rs 3,200 crore and Uttam Galva Metallics Rs 2,200 crore. Rajiv Chakraborty from PwC is the insolvency resolution professional for both companies that were admitted in the NCLT in June and July, respectively.

JSW Steel, Aion Investments and Liberty House declined to comment. Mails sent to SSG Capital, APL Apollo and Chakraborty remained unanswered until the publication of this report.

Phoenix ARC, an asset reconstruction company owned by the Kotak Mahindra group, could not be reached for comments.

Uttam Value Steel (formerly Lloyd's Steel) is listed on the stock exchange and has a hot-rolled production capacity of 1 MT in Wardha. It buys pig iron from Uttam Galva Metallics, which is privately owned by the group.

State Bank of India (SBI) had initiated insolvency proceedings against the company in December last year at the Mumbai bench of NCLT and another petition was filed by the bank in the Chandigarh bench against Uttam Galva Metallics. The company had, however, filed a 'transfer petition' to consolidate both pleas as one for an efficient resolution of the loans since the companies are integrated facilities. However, both were admitted by the NCLT Mumbai separately.

Uttam Value Steel reported operational revenue of Rs 2,704.2 crore last year, with a net loss of Rs 467 crore. A source close to JSW Steel said that the steelmaker is erring on the side of caution by submitting EoIs after their sour experience with Essar Steel and Electrosteel."
26,2018-10-13,JSW,"New Delhi: Lenders to bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL) have decided to put to vote a revised financial offer from JSW Steel that trumped earlier bids by Tata Steel and Liberty House, though it was submitted in August , months past the original bid deadline of February 8.

JSW Steel was among the first lot of bidders for the steel company that owes over Rs 43,000 crore, but its first financial offer that was submitted within the stipulated timeline was significantly lower than that of Tata Steel’s.

JSW had initially offered upfront payments of Rs 11,500 crore to BPSL’s lenders against Tata Steel’s offer of Rs 17,000 crore.

Though Tata’s offer was the highest in the bidding process, it was subsequently trumped by UK’s Liberty House that made an offer of `18,500 crore to Bhushan Power’s lenders, well past the deadline.

Liberty’s belated bid was entertained by the lenders under instructions from the insolvency court, though Tata has challenged that decision at an appellate tribunal.

JSW unexpectedly revised its offer for Bhushan Power on August 13 on grounds that the operational performance had improved significantly since it was first admitted into insolvency proceedings in June last year.

JSW Steel has offered Rs 19,300 crore to the lenders.

Bhushan Power’s resolution professional Mahender Khandelwal will submit the results of voting on JSW’s offer to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday.

NCLAT is hearing Tata Steel’s appeal against Liberty House.

Khandelwal declined comment when contacted.

Bhushan Power has steel-making capacity of 3.1 million tonnes per annum and is promoted by Sanjay Singhal, an estranged member of the family that is also the promoter of Bhushan Steel.

The Singhals lost control of their respective companies after defaulting on payments to banks.

The company has announced bonus payouts to workers, is operating plants at over 90% capacity utilisation and has been growing sales each quarter, according to people in the know."

Globally, stock markets witnessed severe selling pressure on the back of growth worries because of trade tensions and expectation of further liquidity tightness amid rate hike by global central banks. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last week that sustained trade tensions could slash Asia’s economic growth by up to 0.9 percentage point.

Nifty’s top gainers

With a rally of 32 per cent, oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) emerged as top gainer in the Nifty pack. It was followed by YES Bank (up 20 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 13 per cent), Indian Oil Corporation (up 13 per cent) and Bajaj Finance (up 12 per cent).


Nifty’s top losers
Tata Motors (down 15 per cent) stood as top loser of the week in the Nifty pack. The stock remained under pressure after Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) reported a 12.3 per cent drop in global sales at 57,114 units in September, hit by lower demand in China. The company’s China sales declined 46.2 per cent during September compared with that in the same month last year as ongoing market uncertainty over import levies and continued trade tensions held back consumer demand. JLR also announced a two-week shutdown of its West Midlands plant to cope with weakening global demand for its luxury vehicles. Among others, HCL Technologies dropped 9 per cent, Tata Consultancy Services 8.78 per cent, Vedanta 7.61 per cent and Infosys 5.93 per cent to emerge top index losers in last five sessions.

Zee Entertainment (ZEEL), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Hindustan Unilever and Karnataka Bank announced their financial results for the quarter ended September 2018. TCS reported a 22.6 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 7,901 crore, buoyed by strong demand for digital services.

On BSE, the scrip got listed at Rs 104, down 11.86 per cent.

The scrip closed at Rs 102.05 on BSE and at Rs 100.80 on NSE on Friday.



Aviation stock fly high

Shares of airline majors including Jet Airways, SpiceJet and InterGlobe Aviation rallied up to 16 per cent for the week ended October 12 after the government cut excise duty on jet fuel to 11 per cent from 14 per cent to provide some relief to the aviation industry.

Sectoral gainers & losers

Barring the BSE Metal (down 0.45 per cent), TECk (down 5.25 per cent) and IT (down 6.57 per cent), all other sectoral indices closed in the green for the week. The BSE Oil & Gas index rallied 9.33 per cent, followed by Bankex (up 4.42 per cent), Power (up 2.50 per cent), Auto (2.23 per cent) and Capital Goods (up 1.31 per cent). Besides a slight fall in crude oil prices, reports that the government may not push oil companies to share increased subsidy burden set the mood for the oil marketing companies.



Bandhan Bank sees respite

Shares of Bandhan Bank rallied nearly 3 per cent during the week gone by. The lender on Wednesday posted a 47.28 per cent increase in net profit to Rs 487.65 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.

The private sector bank on Friday also said it got an exemption from market regulator Sebi on the one-year lock-in period for selling shares by promoters. 



Kiri Industries settles case

Chemicals firm Kiri Industries and its two promoters have settled a case related to alleged disclosure lapses with markets regulator Sebi after paying nearly Rs 11 lakh towards the settlement. Sebi had initiated adjudication proceedings against the three entities for allegedly violating disclosure norms under its regulations, including PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) and SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover). Shares of Kiri Industries jumped 5 per cent on Friday.



JSW Steel in mood to rally

Shares of JSW Steel rallied nearly 4 per cent during the past five sessions. The company on Thursday said its crude steel output grew 6 per cent to 4.18 million tonne (MT) during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. It had produced 3.94 MT crude steel in July-August 2017."

Technical analysts suggest initiating fresh longs in case of any short term decline as they expect Nifty to touch 10,700-10,850. Stocks like HDFC Bank, Petronet LNG, Colgate-Palmolive, JSW Steel and Divi’s Lab are showing long opportunity, while NIIT Tech is showing fresh signs of weakness, say technical analysts.

Where we are: Nifty after a series of declines has bounced from the oversold levels and indicates a short-term bottom in place. There is an immediate support at 10,250-10,150 levels which likely to act as a cushion in case of declines. BankNifty formed a positive divergence in the momentum indicator and with a weekly closing above 25,300 has confirmed a short term trend reversal.


What is in store: The Nifty has strong support clusters near the 10,250 levels and any short term decline one should look to initiate fresh longs and expects targets of 10,700-10,850. The BankNifty is likely to outperform in the near term and likely to test the levels of 26,000-26,350. Expect HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Indusind Bank to see a sharp rally of 5-8 per cent in short term.


What could investors do: There are select stocks which are showing high margin of safety due to positive price pattern and oscillator formation and can be considered for investments. TVS Motors, Dr Reddy’s, PTC can be bought for an upside potential of 15-20 per cent over the next few months.

While capacity utilisation of domestic pellet plants remained low till FY2017 due to large capacity additions coinciding with depressed domestic demand, utilisation rates in the near-to-medium term are expected to improve on the back of healthy demand.

 “Given the significant share of low grade iron ore fines in India’s total iron ore production, there is a growing need to beneficiate inferior grade ore and feed its output to pelletisation plants, to make the ore usable in steelmaking,” Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president, ICRA, said. He added that domestic pellet makers are also expected to benefit from a robust demand environment both in domestic and Chinese market.

 In India, pellet producers include both large integrated steel manufacturers having captive pelletisation operations as well as merchant pellet manufacturers.While large pellet makers include the likes of Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Essar Steel and Jindal Steel & Power etc., the merchant category includes Brahmani River Pellets, KIOCL, MSPL etc. 

“Growth in installed capacity of pellets remained muted till FY2010 with a capacity of only 21 million tonne (mt) but improved sharply at a compound annual rate of 22.8% to 87 mt in FY2017, albeit with low capacity utilisation levels at about 55%,” the ICRA note said. However, given the expected capacity additions by a number of large steel companies in the next two years, India’s pelletisation capacity is set to cross the 100 mt mark by FY2020, the note added.

China remains India’s preferred pellet export destination with a share of 81% in FY2018 (67% in 4M FY2019, the ICRA report said. After an unfavourable export environment prior to FY2017, improved iron ore availability in FY2017 and healthy import demand from China have led to a sharp rise in Indian pellet exports to 8.8 mt in FY2017 from a negligible 0.7 mt in the previous year. Pellet exports grew further by 6% in FY2018."

Where we are: Equity markets closed in the positive giving some respite to bulls after five consecutive weeks of fall. But it was tumultuous in terms of volatility which hit an eight-month high. Selloff in US markets added to weak rupee and crude oil price concerns. Still, the Nifty managed to recover on Friday and close at 10473 levels up by 1.5 per cent for the week.

What is in store: Last week the market tested the rising support trend line connecting lows of 6,825 and 7,893 after piercing it during the week. Nifty managed to bounce back after hitting 10,138 a new low for the decline. For the week index has formed bullish candle with lower shadow at support trend line. Relative strength index has given positive crossover with its average on daily chart and moved above oversold zone. Thus, suggesting bounce back in market can continue. Now crossing above 10,500 levels on sustainable basis index can rally towards 10,750-10,850 which is the falling gap area resistance zone. On the downside if market trades below 10,200 levels then index can see decline towards March’18 low of 9,952 and 9,870 levels which is 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the major rise from 6,825 to 11,760 levels.

At 8 am this morning, SGX Nifty was up 109.50 points, or 1.03 per cent, at 10,694. 

Here is a look at the top stocks that may hog limelight in Wednesday's session:


Infosys: IT giant Infosys on Tuesday reported a 10.30 per cent YoY rise in profit at Rs 4,110 crore for September quarter, largely in line with a Rs 4,048 crore profit estimate that analysts had projected.

Revenues rose 8.6 per cent on a yearly basis to Rs 9,090 crore. Volumes grew 5.5 per cent year-on-year to 2.13 lakh units, thanks mainly to higher de mand in rural markets. 


Reliance Industries: Reliance Industries is likely to post an 18 per cent growth in second quarter net income on Wednesday, underpinned by higher volume and prices in the petrochemical business. This would be the third quarter in a row in which the company would post double-digit earnings growth, the first time since September 2016.

Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House are also in the race to acquire the company.

JSW Steel traded at Rs 367 at 11 hours against Tuesday’s close of Rs 373.

Domestic benchmark indices had a good start this morning in response to strong cues from Asian and US markets, but gave up much of the gains within an hour. The Sensex traded 150 points, or half a per cent, higher at 35,319 at 11 hours."
36,2018-10-17,JSW,"JSW Steel's Rs 19,700 crore offer for debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL) has been backed by around 90 per cent of lenders, a source in the know of the matter said.

Besides JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Liberty House have also submitted bids for the stressed steel company.

The voting on offers had begun on Monday and ended Wednesday, the person said.

Till Tuesday, the offer submitted by JSW Steel had received over 66 per cent of votes of the members of the committee of creditors (CoC), the source who did not wish to be named said.

""The plan submitted by JSW Steel has received about 88-90 per cent lenders' vote,"" the person said.

The CoC will declare the outcome of the voting next week, the source added.

Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the RBI for NCLT proceedings and owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders.

According to reports, JSW Steel had submitted a resolution plan of Rs 19,700-crore to the Committee of Creditors of Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd.

Tata Steel made an offer of Rs 17,000 crore and Liberty House's resolution plan was of around Rs 19,000 crore.

33,2018-10-17,JSW,"More than two-thirds of lenders to bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel on Tuesday voted in favour of a revised offer by JSW Steel, turning on the heat in a contest for an asset that is being pursued by Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House, according to people directly briefed on the matter.

Nearly 90% of lenders voted in favour of Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW’s bid, which has offered upfront payment of Rs 19,300 crore to banks in lieu of the loans they have to recover from debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL).

JSW has emerged a dark horse in the race for BPSL after it initially showed signs of bowing out of the contest for the bankrupt company with a weak offer of Rs 11,500 crore, which was trumped by Tata Steel with its bid of Rs 17,000 crore for the company.

Tata’s offer was bettered by UK’s Liberty House, which submitted a bid of Rs 18,500 crore for the steel maker on February 20, well past the deadline for submission of bids, forcing Tata to go to court to block the UK company from participating in the bankruptcy auction.



JSW surprised the other two contestants by placing a revised offer on August 13, citing a substantial improvement in BPSL’s operations and financial performance as the reason for raising its offer significantly. JSW Steel and Tata Steel declined comment.

BPSL was dragged to bankruptcycourt in June last year after its promoter, Sanjay Singhal, defaulted on Rs 47,000 crore of dues owed to banks.

“JSW’s bid accounts for the value maximisation that has resulted from the operational turnaround of the company over the past 15 months since it went into insolvency proceedings,” a banker told ETon condition of anonymity.

The stressed steel maker, which has 3.1 million tonnes per annum of production capacity, is operating at 90% capacity utilisation at its plants and has been growing revenues each quarter over the past five quarters, according to sources.

The company has also cleared nearly Rs 400 crore of dues to operational creditors and has paid off employee and statutory dues.

The resolution professional of the company, Mahender Khandelwal, will take the results of the voting to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which is hearing an appeal by Tata Steel that is still fighting to assert the validity of its bid, which was the highest offer submitted at the time of the first official deadline of February 8 for submission of bids. Khandelwal declined comment.

Tata had initially sought a stay on the insolvency resolution process of BPSL till the time its appeal was being heard in court. The request was declined by the NCLAT in August, which allowed all the three bidders—Tata, JSW and Liberty House—to submit revised offers if they wanted, till Tata’s case was being decided.

Only JSW submitted a revised financial offer post the order. JSW Steel, which also purchased bankrupt steel maker Monnet Ispat in a consortium with PE firm Aion Capital, is competing neck and neck with Tata Steel with both companies having comparable steel production capacities of around 19 million tonnes per annum each. Tata has caught up with JSW after it acquired Bhushan Steel, a company formerly owned by Sanjay Singhal’s brother Neeraj, which was also auctioned through the bankruptcy route."

38,2018-10-19,JSW,"India has imposed anti-dumping duties of up to USD 185.51 per tonne for five years on certain varieties of Chinese steel to guard domestic players from cheap imports from the neighbouring country.

The revenue department imposed the duty based on recommendations of the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), according to a government notification.

JSW Steel Ltd, Sunflag Iron & Steel Co, Usha Martin, Gerdau Steel India, Vardhman Special Steels and Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd had jointly filed an application before DGTR for initiation of investigations and levying of anti-dumping duties on some steel products.

In its anti-dumping investigation, the DGTR stated that dumped imports of 'straight length bars and rods of alloy steel' from China have increased in absolute terms during the period of probe (2016-17).

While recommending the anti-dumping duty, DGTR said the goods have been exported to India from the China below normal value and the domestic industry has suffered material injury on account of the imports.

The duty has been imposed in the range of USD 44.89 to 185.51 per tonne on import of 'Alloy bars and rods in straight length, whether or not hot rolled, hot drawn, cold drawn, cold extruded, peeled bar, surface machined, polished, bright bar, forged'.

""The anti-dumping duty ... shall be effective for a period of five years (unless revoked, superseded or amended earlier) from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette and shall be paid in Indian currency,"" the notification said.

The product finds end use application across various segments and sectors including forging, automobiles, auto components, crank shaft, springs, gears, fasteners, cement plants, power plants, turbines, ship-building, and railways, among others.

Imports of straight length bars and rods of alloy steel from China have increased to 1,80,959 tonnes in 2016-17 from 56,690 tonnes in 2013-14. India's total imports rose to 2,56,004 tonnes in 2016-17 from 1,32,933 tonnes in 2013-14.

The demand of this steel in India too increased to 16,69,653 tonnes in 2016-17 from 15,14,795 tonnes in 2013-14.

Domestic steel manufacturers always flag concerns over the imports from the neighbouring country, with which India has a huge trade deficit.

The trade gap with China has increased to USD 63.12 billion in 2017-18 from USD 51.11 billion in the previous financial year.

In general, the purpose of anti-dumpinmg duty is to eliminate injury caused to the domestic industry by the unfair trade practices of dumping so as to re-establish a situation of open and fair competition in the Indian market, which is in interest of the country."
42,2018-10-19,JSW,"The world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal has been declared the preferred bidder by lenders of debt-laden Essar Steel ahead of metals player Vedanta Group, bankers said, as the 14-month battle for ownership of the prized asset draws to a close. The committee of creditors (CoC) for Essar Steel met to discuss the bids on Friday, a day after the Supreme Court-mandated two-week deadline ended. 

“ArcelorMittal has been declared the highest, or H1, bidder mainly because of its track record and experience in managing steel companies successfully for years. Both Arcelor-Mittal and Vedanta were very close in terms of the money offered, but we think (Lakshmi) Mittal can do a better job in turning around the company,” a senior banker closely involved in the process told ET. 

If the steelmaking asset located in Hazira, Gujarat, is finally awarded to ArcelorMittal, it will fulfill Mittal’s more than a decade-old ambition to have a beachhead in the country. Mittal has had plans since 2005 to set up greenfield facilities in Jharkhand and Karnataka, but the plans have not progressed. 


Others

“ArcelorMittal confirms it has been informed by the CoC for Essar Steel that it has been evaluated to be the H1 Resolution Applicant (the preferred bidder) in the corporate insolvency resolution process for Essar Steel,” said a statement from the global steel behemoth. 

“The company will now enter into further final negotiations with the CoC,” it added. Essar Steel owes Rs 49,000 crore to various banks and was admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in August last year, led by lead banker State Bank of India.

ArcelorMittal had offered to pay back Rs 7,469 crore of dues owed by Uttam Galva and KSS Petron in addition to an upfront payment of Rs 35,000 crore for loans due from Essar Steel, pegging its total commitment at more than Rs 42,000 crore. 

Vedanta put in a bid of Rs 34,000 crore in the second round, which was conducted in April 2018. Russian lender VTB had formed a consortium with Numetal and a Rewant Ruia-promoted trust for the first round of bids. This trust was subsequently replaced by JSW Steel. 

However, earlier this month, the Supreme Court said only the first-round bidders would be considered. On October 4, the apex court directed ArcelorMittal and Numetal to pay off dues of companies in which they had stakes to be eligible to bid for Essar Steel. 

Last week, VTB petitioned the Supreme Court, asking it to allow a solo bid. The petition is likely to be heard next week. However, bankers said they have made their preference clear after Friday’s meeting. 

“The final voting on this matter will be held on Monday. We expect most banks to back Arcelor-Mittal,” said the banker cited above. The bids will be opened on Saturday when the final bidding amounts will be known. 

In April, ArcelorMittal had offered Rs 42,000 crore but was disqualified along with Numetal under Section 29 (A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The process ran a rigorous legal course until it finally reached the Supreme Court. The apex court on October 4 gave ArcelorMittal and Numetal two weeks to clear dues to become eligible to bid. 

Following this, ArcelorMittal on Wednesday announced it will pay Rs 7,469 crore to repay dues owed by Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. The Mittal company owned stakes in the two defaulting firms but sold them before bidding for Essar Steel in July. Numetal was edged out of the race owing to its inability to pay outstanding dues."

40,2018-10-19,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Mining baron Anil Agarwal has indicated that he is open to raising bid for acquiring Essar Steel, saying his flagship Vedanta Ltd is the best suited to take over the indebted firm as it is an iron ore as well as natural gas producer - key ingredients for making steel.

Agarwal said Vedanta's Rs 35,000-36,000 crore offer in the first round of bidding for Essar Steel was the highest in the three-way race for Essar Steel that lenders are auctioning to recover about Rs 50,800 crore of overdue loans.

The bid was more than offers made by ArcelorMittal and Russia's VTB Capital-backed NuMetal Ltd in the first round.

But during the legal battle over the eligibility of ArcelorMittal and NuMetal, the VTB Capital-based special purpose vehicle raised the offer to Rs 37,000 crore in the second round which subsequently was bettered by ArcelorMittal to Rs 42,000 crore.

NuMetal has said it will match the ArcelorMittal's offer.

The issue has reached the Supreme Court which asked ArcelorMittal and NuMetal to pay off loans for group companies in India to be eligible to bid for Essar Steel.

""See the Court has clearly said that the first round of bid will be the basis and it has allowed all three bidders to come into the ring. ArcelorMittal has to pay dues to come in the ring and NuMetal has to pay the outstanding loan to come into the ring,"" Agarwal said here.

Vedanta, he said, remains eligible with its first round of bids. ""We are already in the ring,"" he said. Once the condition set by the Supreme Court are met, the Committee of Essar Steel Creditors will take a view on the bids received.

""As far as we are concerned, we are definitely interested but I never wanted to get into a fight. I have enough and I am happy. I have not gone to court. I have never made noise (on acquiring Essar Steel),"" he said.

He said Vedanta is the best-suited company to take over Essar Steel as it produces iron ore - the raw material for making steel. Also, it produces natural gas which is used in the steel making process.

""I am an iron ore producer, I am a natural gas producer, both of which will be of advantage to Essar,"" he said. ""I continue to be interested in Essar Steel (despite in bitter acquisition fight).""

Asked if he would be open to raising the offer price, he said: ""I am open to everything."" But he wants to wait and see how the other two rivals act on the condition set by the Supreme Court for their eligibility.

Agarwal said he has already set foot in steel manufacturing through a Rs 5,320 crore acquisition of Electrosteel, a firm that too was auctioned to recover unpaid loans.

""For us, steel making is a natural progression from being an iron ore producer,"" he said. Essar Steel has emerged as the most sought-after asset in the government's crackdown on delinquent borrowers. Of a dozen loan defaulters that have been pushed into bankruptcy proceedings, Essar Steel is the most bitterly fought for.

The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and VTB Capital-led consortium NuMetal have opposed each other's eligibility under a rule that disallowed bidders with links to a defaulter from being part of the process.

Lakshmi Mittal's steelmaker questioned the eligibility of Numetal Ltd because, in the initial round of bidding, it included a company that is backed by the son of one of Essar's founders.

NuMetal opposed ArcelorMittal as its promoters were tied to loan defaulting firms like KSS Petron Pvt Ltd and Uttam Galva Steels Ltd.

While the firm linked to Essar founders wasn't part of NuMetal in the second round, but the Supreme Court held that it remained a related party to Essar Steel.

This meant that while ArcelorMittal has to clear dues of its associate firms, Numetal will have to pay off the bad loans of the entire Essar group if it wants to remain a bidder.

While VTB Capital is now seeking to make a solo bid and has filed a clarificatory application in the Supreme Court, ArcelorMittal has agreed to pay off Rs 7,469 crore of loans of the two group companies.

JSW Steel Ltd, which was part of NuMetal in the second round of bid, too is seeking legal opinion if it can bid solo. Essar Steel, which can produce 10 million metric tons of the alloy annually, owes creditors about Rs 50,800 crore."
41,2018-10-19,JSW,"Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel is exploring various financing models, including a 'joint control mechanism', to fund the acquisition of the stressed assets of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd and Essar Steel, a source said.

This assumes significance as JSW Steel's Rs 19,700 crore offer for debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL) has been backed by around 90 per cent of lenders.

""JSW Steel is exploring differentiated financing options, including joint control model, to fund its acquisition of stressed assets of Bhushan Power and Steel and Essar Steel,"" according to a banking source.

Under the joint control model, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be set up and the acquired stressed assets will rest with the SPV.

Joint control model will insulate debt impact of yet to be acquired stressed assets of these two firms on JSW Steel financials, the source said.

If acquired, JSW Steel is exploring to merge the stressed assets of the both companies into its books post turnaround of the stressed assets, the source said.

When contacted, JSW Steel spokesperson declined to comment.

Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd is among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the RBI for NCLT proceedings and owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders.

According to reports, JSW Steel had submitted a resolution plan of Rs 19,700-crore to the Committee of Creditors of Bhushan Steel and Power.

JSW Steel had teamed up with NuMetal Mauritius to place a Rs 37,000 crore offer for Essar Steel in the second round of bidding.

It had earlier said it was seeking a legal opinion if it can bid solo for stressed assets of Essar Steel if fresh bids were allowed.

JSW Steel has also implemented joint control model to bid for acquiring Monnet Ispat and Energy.

Jsw Steel grew from 1.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in 2002 to 18 MTPA in 2018 both organically and inorganically. Despite the company's eleven times growth in capacity, the JSW Steel's financials improved substantially, according to sources.

Market capitalisation of JSW Steel surged 300 times from Rs 258 crore in FY2002 to Rs 23,117 crore in FY2010 to Rs 87,503 crore currently.

Over last couple of years JSW Steel debt to Ebitda ratio has improved significantly. 'It was 3.14 times in FY'17, then it improved to 2.57 times in FY'18 and in first quarter of FY'19 it improved to 2.26 times.

The capacities have gone up but if you see the debt to Ebitda ratio they have gone down. That means financial health of the company has improved despite capacity expansions.

""The company has been guiding in the market that it will put in place innovative and differentiated financing models in case it acquires the stressed assets of Bhushan Power and Steel and Essar Steel. These innovative financing models which is primarily joint control model are aimed at ensuring that its financials issues are well within the limits as communicated by the JSW Steel from time to time,"" another source said.

For bidding and acquisition of Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd, JSW Steel implemented the joint control model with Aion Capital.

JSW Steel had put in only Rs 375 crore in the form of equity or Quasi-equity instruments for acquiring the assets of Monnet Ispat.

""The debt in Monnet Ispat was arranged without recourse to the company. When you say without recourse to the company it means that the debt will not impact the company's financials. It will be serviced from the cash flows of the company of the acquired asset,"" the source said.

When JSW Steel acquired Ispat Industries in 2010 the company used the similar financing plan. The acquisition of the company was grounded on differentiated financing plans.

Post the turnaround of the acquired asset, JSW announced the merger of the Ispat Industries in JSW Steel."
43,2018-10-20,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel is likely to rope in a partner to bid for the stressed assets it is eyeing — Bhushan Power & Steel, people aware of the development said. This will help the company insulate itself from the short-term risks involved in turning around the bankrupt steelmakers.

JSW Steel prides itself on its financial ratios and to protect those had refrained from going overboard for assets like Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin in the past. It had employed a ‘joint control model’ to acquire Monnet Ispat & Energy and may look at the same for Bhushan Power & Steel and Essar Steel as well.

This model entails the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to take over the asset. Once the acquired business turned around, it would be merged with JSW Steel. “This protects the company’s books from the debt impact of the acquisition till the time the asset starts making money at which time it can be merged with the company,” one of the people said. A JSW Steel spokesperson was unavailable for comment.

For acquiring Monnet Ispat underthe insolvency code, JSW Steel had bid with Aion Investments. It had put in Rs 375 crore as equity and quasi-equity instruments and raised Rs 1,000 crore through debt that would be serviced from Monnet Ispat’s cash flow without any recourse to JSW Steel.

According to reports, JSW Steel has offered Rs 19,700 crore for Bhushan Power & Steel. On Tuesday, 90% of Bhushan Power & Steel’s lenders voted for JSW Steel's plan. The company is competing with Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House for Bhushan Power & Steel that owes Rs 47,000 crore to lenders. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday.

“We don't rule out a structure where the company gets a partner to bid for the assets since the management has been very categorical in saying that its net debt to EBITDA shall not exceed 3.75x post acquiring assets,” said Ritesh Shah, lead analyst for materials at Investec Capital Services. Its net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.26 at the end of the June quarter. It had consolidated net debt of Rs 38,019 crore as of March 2018.

For its offer for Essar Steel, the company is also considering bidding alone after it had initially tied up with Numetal to bid, said a person."

46,2018-10-24,JSW,"JSW Steel has taken over Dolvi Minerals and Metals by buying the remaining 60% of its share capital for Rs 109 crore, the company informed the stock exchange on Wednesday.

With 40% already owned by JSW Steel earlier, Dolvi Minerals and Metals (DMM), that deals in the business of acting as trader, whole-seller and retailer in metallic and non-metallic minerals has now become JSW Steel's 100% subsidiary. 

""Pursuant to the acquisition of shares of DMMPL, DMMPL has become a wholly owned subsidiary of JSWSL, wherein JSWSL and its nominees hold 100% of the issued and paid-up equity share capital of DMMPL,"" said the notification by JSW Steel. 

The acquisition will help the 18 MT steelmaker with raw material security as DMM's subisidiary Dolvi Coke Projects will be supplying coking coal to JSW Steel's Dolvi facility. Coking coal and iron ore make for the two most important raw materials for steelmaking with JSW Steel mostly importing most of its coke requirements. 

The Sajjan Jindal-led steelmaker has lined up an elaborate organic expansion plan where it plans to add capacities to its existing works at Vijayanagar in Karnataka and Dolvi in Maharashtra. It is spending close to Rs 44,000 crore till March 2020 to scale up its capacity at Dolvi from 5 million tonne to 10 million tonnes and its capacity at Vijayanagar from the current 12 MT to 18 MT; a vision that will require the company to have more coke security and with the rupee falling to record lows, having local supply of the mineral is likely to help the company save costs. 

Apart from its organic expansion plan, the company has also acquired the 1.5 MT Monnet Ispat and Energy under the insolvency law and has put binding bid for Bhushan Power and Steel which is still awaiting a final court order."

53,2018-10-26,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks extended losses to the second consecutive session on Friday as concerns over weak macro, lacklustre Asian cues and uninspiring September quarter earnings continued to weigh on the sentiment.

An official data released on Thursday showed that the fiscal deficit of the country has widened in the first half of 2018-19 to 95.3 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE), mainly on account of slow growth in revenue collections. The deficit was at 91.3 per cent of BE at September-end of the last financial year.

Weak Asian peers also kept the mood subdued at home. Asian shares slipped again on Friday morning, deepening this week's markets rout, after disappointing results from Alphabet and Amazon heightened concerns over the outlook for US corporate earnings, global trade and economic growth, Reuters reported. 

Domestic currency rupee today opened 16 paise down at 73.43 against the US dollar following steady capital outflows and weakness in domestic equities amid rising geopolitical tensions.

57,2018-10-26,JSW,"These are turbulent days for stocks. But promoters have gone ahead and made a statement by lapping up stakes in their own companies. 

That merits the question, do promoters know the true worth of their business?

As the domestic equity market went through a volatile phase during the second quarter, promoters of close to 350 companies -- barring PSU banks -- on the BSE have increased their stakes across the board. 

Monnet Ispat & Energy, Vodafone Idea and Dish TV all saw a substantial rise in promoter holding during the quarter gone by. Idea Cellular and Vodafone completed merger of their India operations on August 31. 

The promoter share in Monnet Ispat jumped to 74.37 per cent in Q2 FY19 from 25.27 per cent in Q1 FY19 while the holding in Vodafone Idea stood at 71.33 per cent as of September 30 against 42.56 per cent in the preceding June quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed.

The figures are as of October 25.

JSW Steel and its promoters have acquired around 88 per cent stake in Monnet Ispat and Energy following completion of insolvency resolution proceedings, MIEL said in September. 

Websol Energy Systems, Kilitch Drugs, Hathway Cable & Datacom, IDFC Bank, Mcnally Bharat Engineering, DCM Shriram Industries, Akzo Nobel, Sintex Plastics, DB Corp, Hindustan Foods, HDFC Bank, Mcleod Russel, and Hatsun Agro Products are among others where promoters upped their stake during the quarter gone by. 

Kilitch Drugs, a pharmaceutical exporter, is all set to boost its expansion plans in Africa with its first manufacturing plant in Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, the company told exchanges on Wednesday. 

Why do promoters raise stake in their own business? In most cases, they find value in the stock or prepare for a positive development in the company. Sometimes, they do so to avert any possible hostile acquisition.

Out of the 348 BSE stocks that saw promoters stocking up, 305 moved southwards in 2018 so far. But Darjeeling Ropeway is a picture in contrast. The company, in which promoters raised their stake to 32.38 per cent in Q2 FY19 from just 1.22 per cent in Q1 FY19, delivered 448 per cent returns to investors on a year-to-date basis.

The Nifty opened in the negative zone and remained under pressure for most part of the session, as every bounce was been sold in the market. 

The index failed to surpass its previous support of 10,138 level and corrected towards 10,000 zones by making fresh seven-month low.

Now, till it remains below 10,130, weakness could continued towards 9,952 and then 9,800 level. On the upside, hurdle is shifting towards 10,250 and then 10,333 zone.

On the option front, maximum Put OI was at 10,000 followed by 9,800 strike, while maximum Call OI was seen at 10,500 followed by 10,800 strike. We have seen Call writing at 10,100 followed by 10,400 strike, while Put writing was seen at 10,000 followed by 9,800 strike.

India VIX moved up by 3.21 per cent to 19.57 level. Volatility is not cooling down further and it remains a concern for the market. It has to go down below 17-16 zone to rescue the bulls after the sharp cut of the last two months.

Nifty Bank index breached its crucial support level of 24,650 mark and slipped sharply in the last hour towards the 24,350 level. It formed a bearish candle on daily and weekly scales, which suggests the bears are holding tight grip on the market. Now, till it holds below 24,650, it can slip towards 24,000 and even lower levels, while on the upside, hurdle is seen at 25,000 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 1.29 per cent at 10,042. Built up of Long positions were seen in Bajaj Finance, KPIT, Ceat and Reliance while shorts were seen in Exide, HDFC Bank, TCS and JSW Steel.

59,2018-10-27,JSW,"NEW DELHI: ArcelorMittal said Essar Steel’s creditors put the seal on its acquisition of the bankrupt company, a day after the erstwhile promoters sought to make a last-minute bid to regain control.

“Further to ArcelorMittal being named the H1 resolution applicant (the preferred bidder) on October 19, 2018, ESIL’s CoC (committee of creditors) has now approved the company’s resolution plan for ESIL (Essar Steel India Ltd), with the LoI (letter of intent) identifying it as the successful resolution plan,” ArecelorMittal said in a release. The plan has to be formally accepted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), “which is expected before the end of 2018,” it added.

The Ruias, founders of the Essar Group, however seem to be unwilling to give up the chase just yet, promising a further test of the country’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which was only put in place in 2016. The year-long Essar Steel insolvency saga has seen various twists and turns involving Russian bank VTB, steel tycoon LN Mittal and Vedanta’s Anil Agarwal among others, all seeking to gain control of the prized asset.




A person close to the Ruias said they are likely to wait for the response of the CoC to their latest offer before approaching the NCLT. They also have the option of filing a caveat, lawyers said. The CoC filed the plan with the NCLT’s Ahmedabad bench on Friday. It’s likely to be heard after Diwali on November 7.


ARCELORMITTAL- NIPPON STEEL PLAN
“CoC has to respond within seven days on Essar’s application filed under Section 12A,” said Alok Dhir, managing partner of Dhir & Dhir Associates. ArcelorMittal said two-thirds of the transaction will be funded by debt and the rest through equity. 

It will involve a payment of Rs 42,000 crore to lenders and another Rs 8,000 crore of capital expenditure on Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal also plans to raise shipments to 8.5 million tonnes in the medium term and ultimately to 12-15 mt through investments in iron ore and steel capacity. Essar Steel currently has a capacity of 6.5 mt.

Once the acquisition is completed, ArcelorMittal will jointly own and operate Essar Steel in partnership with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (NSSMC), Japan, the third largest steel producer in the world. The two had signed a joint venture agreement to this effect on March 2 “ArcelorMittal and NSSMC expect to finance the joint venture through a combination of partnership equity (one-third) and debt (two-thirds) and ArcelorMittal anticipates that its investment in the joint venture will be equity accounted,” ArcelorMittal said.

In a separate statement, the Japanese company said that “by bringing together the strengths of both companies, NSSMC and ArcelorMittal will be able to turn around ESIL to be a competitive steel manufacturer.”


RUIAS’ BID
The Ruias had submitted a Rs 54,000 crore bid on Thursday to get back control of Essar Steel, just hours after most of the lenders had okayed ArcelorMittal’s proposal. The plan involved repaying all lenders and operational creditors in full. They said the submission had been made under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which allows companies to be withdrawn from the resolution process. 

“In the true spirit of the June 2018 amendment, an opportunity to withdraw from IBC process under Section 12A should not be denied to ongoing cases where EoI (expression of interest) stage was over prior to this amendment,” a Ruia spokesperson said Friday.

Essar Steel had been admitted by the NCLT in August last year with an EoI submission date of October 20, 2017. The Ruias want the amendment to be applicable to cases admitted before the amendment. The Ruias’ statement also said that to aid the “ultimate objective of maximisation of value and protection of stakeholders’ interest,” bankers and judicial forums have made exceptions to the law in some instances. It gave the example of ArcelorMittal and Numetal being given the opportunity to remedy their ineligibility by paying dues after the submission of their bids for Essar Steel.

“When looked at from operational creditors perspective, the Essar offer may be a fit case for the Supreme Court to exercise its powers under Article 142,” said Jayesh H, cofounder of Juris Corp. If the steelmaking asset located on the western coast of India, in Hazira, Gujarat, is finally awarded to ArcelorMittal, it will help LN Mittal fulfil his quest for a beachhead in the country. Mittal’s plans for greenfield facilities in Jharkhand, Odisha and Karnataka date back to 2005, but these got stuck in the approval process.

Essar Steel owes Rs 49,000 crore to various banks and was admitted by the NCLT in August last year following an application by lead banker State Bank of India (SBI). The IBC bars defaulters from bidding for assets. For this reason, ArcelorMittal had offered to repay Rs 7,649 crore of dues owed by Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, in which LN Mittal was listed as a promoter, in addition to an upfront payment of Rs 35,000 crore for loans due from Essar Steel.

Vedanta’s bid was pegged at Rs 34,000 crore in the second round of bidding, which was conducted in April 2018. Russian lender VTB formed the Numetal consortium that initially included a Rewant Ruia-promoted trust, which had to be subsequently replaced by JSW Steel, owing to the defaulter clause. However, the Supreme Court said only first-round bidders would be considered.

In a ruling on October 4, the apex court directed both ArcelorMittal and Numetal to pay the dues of companies in which they had a stake if they wanted to qualify as eligible bidders. Numetal was edged out of the race owing to its inability to pay the outstanding dues. Two weeks ago, VTB petitioned the Supreme Court asking to be allowed to bid for the company on its own. The petition is likely to be heard next week. However, bankers said that they have made their preference clear at the October 19 meeting."

62,2018-10-28,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Enthused by the impact of new insolvency and bankruptcy law, the government expects bad loan recoveries to exceed Rs 1.80 lakh crore target for the current financial year, an official said.

Some big accounts are in the process of getting resolved while some more are lined up for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), a senior Finance Ministry official told PTI.

""Going by the success rate, we hope that the recovery would exceed our own target of Rs 1.80 lakh crore through the IBC and other means,"" the official said citing some of the ongoing resolution of Essar Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd.

Banks hopes to write back more than Rs 1 lakh crore alone from the resolution of 12 NPA cases referred to insolvency proceedings by the RBI in its first list.

Banks recovered Rs 36,551 crore in the first quarter of 2018-19. During 2017-18, banks recovered Rs 74,562 crore.

Satisfied with the progress of IBC, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said ""now people have become broadly aware that the rules of the game in India have changed. The banks won't chase you anymore, you will have to chase them.""

As a result of this, recoveries have picked up, he had said, adding, recoveries are not just because resolutions have taken place in the NCLT but they have also picked up because of fear that if they cross redline they will be condemned to IBC process.

""The unintended consequence was that potential defaulters started realising that the moment you cross the redline, at least you will go out, and never get back. And if you have seen the last quarter or two, potential defaulters are begging, borrowing and stealing and paying back. And that's why the banks have started getting monies even outside the NCLT system from potential defaulters not wanting to cross the redline,"" he had said.

From the first list, two big cases Essar Steel and Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd are at the final stages of resolution, while Binani Cement and Jaypee Infratech are also under the process.

Lenders are expecting to recover almost 86 per cent of the Rs 49,000 crore loan in case of Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal has agreed to pay a total of Rs 50,000 crore, including a Rs 8,000 crore capital infusion, to acquire the firm.

In the initial round of bidding, Bhushan Power and Steel had got bids of Rs 11,000 crore from JSW Steel, Rs 17,000 crore from Tata Steel and Rs 18,500 crore from Liberty House. JSW Steel had subsequently revised its bid to Rs 19,700 crore.

Last year in June, RBI's internal advisory committee (IAC) identified 12 accounts, each having more than Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans and accounting for 25 per cent of total NPAs of banks.

Following the RBI's advisory, banks referred Bhushan Steel Ltd, Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd, Essar Steel Ltd, Jaypee Infratech Ltd, Lanco Infratech Ltd, Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd, Jyoti Structures Ltd, Electrosteel Steels Ltd, Amtek Auto Ltd, Era Infra Engineering Ltd, Alok Industries Ltd and ABG Shipyard Ltd to NCLT. These accounts together have a total outstanding loan of Rs 1.75 lakh crore."

This is part of the USD 500 million investment commitment made by the company for the steel pipes and plates facility in Texas in March this year.

""JSW Steel will invest USD 150 million (approximately Rs 1,000 crore) in the new (steel) facility at Baytown, Texas,"" the company said.

JSW Steel (USA) Inc is setting up the technologically advanced and eco-friendly electric arc furnace, slab caster and plate mill.

""The new facility is expected to be the only melt-and-manufacture plate mill with a contiguous pipe mill in North America,"" the company said.

The plant will be built on 111 acres at JSW USA's 700-acre Baytown campus.

""The company is embarking on a journey to create 1,000 new jobs in the USA. This follows JSW's announcements to invest up to USD 1 billion dollars in enhancing its steel manufacturing capabilities in the USA,"" it said.

The plant is expected to be completed by March 2020.

""We are proud and excited to be building this fully integrated plate and pipe mill in Texas, enabling this unit to be considered a US melt-and-manufacture facility,"" Parth Jindal, Director, JSW USA said.

In March, JSW Steel (USA) Inc and the Office of Governor, Texas, signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to develop and augment the steel industry in the state.

According to the memorandum, JSW Steel (USA) Inc agreed to consider an investment of up to USD 500 million in phases (subject to EPA approval) to develop its steel manufacturing infrastructure in Texas.

Later in June, JSW Steel proposed another investment of up to USD 500 million in acquiring, enhancing and upgrading Acero Junction Inc, an integrated steel manufacturing unit with a potential capacity of three million tonnes per annum (MTPA) located in Ohio, US, in phases.

""This takes JSW's overall investment blueprint for the US market, to produce American melt and manufactured steel, to up to USD 1 billion,"" the company added."

68,2018-10-31,JSW,"MUMBAI: Prudent ARC, Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited (Arcil), a consortium led by SSG Capital Management and another consortium led by New Zone Intertrade FZE have joined the list of eligible resolution applicants for debt-ridden Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics, said a person aware of the development.

ET had reported on October 12 that JSW Steel, Liberty House, Aion Capital, Phoenix ARC and SSG Capital had submitted expressions of interest (EoIs) for the two subsidiaries of Uttam Galva Steels that owed Rs 3,200 crore and Rs 2,200 crore, respectively, to lenders.

SSG Capital has tied up with Synergy Metals and Mining Fund and ART Special Situations Finance (India) whereas New Zone Intertrade has shown interest along with Glacier Blue and Cheer Keen. Rajeev Chakraborty from PwC is the resolution professional for both companies.

APL Apollo had also submitted an EoI for Uttam Value Steels alone but was not identified as an eligible resolution applicant as it is preferred that a resolution applicant shows interest in both assets owing to their interconnectedness, said people aware of the matter.

Emails sent to Prudent ARC, Arcil, New Zone Intertrade FZE and Rajeev Chakraborty remained unanswered till late evening on Tuesday.

Uttam Value Steels (previously known as Lloyds Steels Industries) is listed on the stock exchange and has a hot-rolled production capacity of 1 MT in Wardha. It buys pig iron from Uttam Galva Metallics, which is privately owned by the group.

The State Bank of India had initiated insolvency proceedings against the company in December last year with the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal and another petition was filed by the bank with the Chandigarh bench against Uttam Galva Metallics.

The company had, however, filed a transfer petition to consolidate both pleas as one for an efficient resolution of the loans since the companies are integrated facilities. Although this was not allowed, the pleas were admitted separately by Mumbai bench. Uttam Value Steels reported operational revenue of Rs 2,704.2 crore for 2017-18, with a net loss of Rs 467 crore."

2,2018-11-21,JSW,"One-off deferred tax gain supported bottom lines for much of India Inc during the September quarter. But that should not take away credit from those which managed to grow bottom lines on the strength of top line expansion.

September quarter earnings season broadly turned out to be better than expected, which took BSE benchmark Sensex to its record high mark. Sensex scaled a fresh all-time high of 40,676 amid the ongoing earnings season.

This was one of the better earnings seasons anytime in last three or four years, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Adviser.

“A number of companies have beaten Street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because we had the tax cuts in the middle of the quarter. A lot of companies adjusted that in the second quarter,” he said.

For instance, despite a drop in top line, Tata Steel reported a 6 per cent increase in consolidated net for the quarter at Rs 3,302 crore, thanks to the new tax regime.

JSW Steel posted 22 per cent rise in consolidated net profit, mainly due to a writeback of deferred taxes and accrued incentives from previous years. But the company’s revenue from operations actually declined 18.5 per cent to Rs 17,572 crore from Rs 21,552 crore a year ago.

But Mavani also points out that going by pre-tax profit or Ebitda number, a large number of companies also managed to grow on their own, actually showing margin expansions that beat Street expectations.

Data available with Ace Equity on November 6 showed 71 firms listed on BSE as largecap, midcap or smallcap reported over 100 per cent rise in net profit in Q2.

Even some of them like Dr Reddy’s Lab reported over 100 per cent expansion in net profit despite a 25 per cent rise in Q2 revenue. Others like SBI reported manifold rise in bottom line due to a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

SBI posted nearly six-fold rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter, supported by a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

Bottomline of the public sector lender grew 485 per cent to Rs 3,375 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576 crore in the same period last year. Gujarat Gas, GSK Pharma, Indian Bank, Jindal Saw, NIIT, JK Tyre, Deepak Nitrite, Motilal Oswal Finanical Services, Bank of Maharasthtra and Avani Feeds were among other major players that reported over 100 per cent profit growth in Q2.



Besides one-time tax gains, other income, improving asset quality and corporate-related actions supported bottom lines of select companies during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services reported 3,297 per cent profit growth at Rs 142.3 crore in September quarter against a Rs 4.5 crore in the year-ago period, while Indian Bank reported Rs 359 crore profit on increasing income and improving asset quality by controlling loan slippages and other factors, a top bank official said.

A sharp drop in provisions for loan writeoffs in the home finance arm during the quarter supported the bottom line of the Mumbai-based firm. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said a strong momentum was seen in the market is due to healthy Q2 earnings from big corporates. “This positivity is likely to stay in the short to medium term as concerns of the market are fading with tax cut,” he said.

Out of top 71, five players reported over 100 per cent sales growth, 25 others posted 10 to 70 per cent increase sales. Others reported up to 10 per cent rise or fall in net sales during the quarter.

Some 73 firms from across sectors such as consumer food, TV broadcasting, banking, NBFC, plastic products, power generation and engineering, among others, reported 50 to 100 per cent bottom line expansion.

The list included players like Multi Commodity Exchange, Bandhan Bank, SRF, GTPL Hathaway, Kukuyo Camlin, Varun Beverages, EIH, Petronet LNG, PSP Projects, Torrent Power, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, UltraTech Cement and Aarti Drugs.



“Corporate earnings have been subdued or below expectations over the past few years. However, we are starting to see a revival in corporate earnings growth, and expect it to pick up pace from H2FY20. This will help to drive the markets going forward,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

He said the recent corporate tax cut would provide a boost to corporate earnings over time. “We believe a bottom-up research-oriented process, coupled with growth at reasonable price (GARP) approach will help deliver superior returns over the long term,” he said."
3,2018-11-21,JSW,"New Delhi: Presence of more companies in the market will lead to more innovations, quality and R&D activities, said domestic steel players on Thursday while reacting to the entry of global steel giant ArcelorMittal in India. ""We don't see ArcelorMittal as a challenge,"" JSW Steel Chairman Sajjan Jindal told on the sidelines of the ISA Steel Conclave here. 

 More number of players, more the research & development (R&D) activities, innovations, quality in the market, he added reacting to a question how will the ArcelorMittal's entry benefit the consumers. 

 Jindal Steel and Power Chairman Naveen Jindal said, ""We see its (ArcelorMittal's) entry as a positive step."" 

 Tata Steel Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee also said there should be competition in the market. 

 Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) Chairman A K Chaudhary said, ""ArcelorMittal's entry will promote healthy competition in market."" 

 The industry looks forward to work with them in future, he added. 

 Last week, the Supreme Court paved the way for ArcelorMittal's takeover of debt-ridden Essar Steel for Rs 42,000 crore and set aside the July 4 NCLAT order giving equal status to financial creditors and operational creditors. 

 Following the verdict, ArcelorMittal said it expects to complete the acquisition of the debt-ridden company by the end of this year. 

 Essar Steel was auctioned under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to recover Rs 54,547 crore of unpaid dues of financial lenders and operational creditors."

5,2018-11-22,JSW,"KOLKATA: ArcelorMittal's entry into India through its Rs 42,000-crore acquisition of Essar Steel should ‘energise’ the domestic market, benefiting consumers in one of the world’s fastest-expanding economies that is building infrastructure to underpin its growth ambitions.

“With ArcelorMittal entering India, we expect the domestic steel market to become more competitive, and bring in more innovation and stability,” steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Thursday on the sidelines of a conclave in New Delhi. “This will ultimately help consumers.”

ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest producer of the alloy, is entering India at a time when the sector is going through a lean phase, facing a demand slump. Other steelmakers shared Pradhan’s sentiments about ArcelorMittal’s entry into India.

“Competition is good; it will keep us on our toes,” said Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Steel. Jindal said Indian steelmakers appear to have had a headstart in the local markets since they have been operating here for several years, with a good understanding of local needs.

ArcelorMittal’s presence will bring in new technology, and have a longer-term impact on prices and the steel product basket."
4,2018-11-22,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Indian boards are seem to be meeting slightly more frequently than they were earlier. The median number of meetings for 91 of the BSE 100 companies was seven in fiscal 2019, compared with six in FY18 as well as five years earlier in FY15, as per data from Bloomberg. Five was the most common number for board meetings held by the companies in the year ended March 31, 2019.

Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have a higher frequency of board meetings. The median number for the 16 PSUs in BSE100 index was 13, compared with 11 in FY15. Coal India topped the list with 21 board meetings in the last fiscal year ended March 31. The company’s board had met seven times in FY15.

Incidentally, the sitting fees for independent directors of PSUs is Rs 40,000 - around one-third of the statutory limit of Rs 1 lakh. ICICI Bank is the only privatesector company on the list of top 10 companies, with 18 board meetings in FY19. The bank’s board had met seven times in FY15. Incidentally, a dozen companies have had a sharp year-on-year surge in the frequency of their board meetings in FY19. This list is dominated by banks, with ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank featuring among these dozen companies. Banks have been under increased scrutiny of the regulators and investors, warranting a higher engagement for their boards. Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Larsen & Toubro, HCL Technologies and REC are the other companies on this list.


Agencies
In the case of nearly half of the 91 companies, a positive correlation was found between the frequency of board meetings and their stock performance. The boards of companies that are performing well typically meet more frequently compared with the opposite group. For instance, pharma companies Cipla, Lupin and Sun Pharma have witnessed a gradual decline in the number of their board meetings over the past five years as industry headwinds pressed along. The board of Indiabulls Housing Finance met nine times five years ago, but only five times in FY19. Likewise, Piramal Enterprises had eight board meetings in FY18, but that dropped to five in FY19. Housing finance business has come under pressure in the recent years.

Ten of the BSE 100 companies have conducted only four meetings in FY19 - the minimum needed to comply with the Companies Act 2013. Most companies on this list, such as Godrej Consumer Products, Page Industries, Lupin, Hero MotoCorp, Bharat Forge and JSW Steel, have been under performing in the past couple of years. To be sure, the median frequency of board meetings in India Inc is akin to that in the US. As per the Spencer Stuart 2018 S&P 500 Board Index, the median number of board meetings was seven for the year ended May 2018. A majority of S&P 500 company boards met on an average of six-nine times annually."
6,2018-11-24,JSW,"The government plans to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to provide immunity to companies taking over stressed assets from prosecution for financial crimes committed by erstwhile promoters.

This will help make the insolvency process more attractive for the bidders and instil confidence in them, sources said.

The government may move an amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 during the current Winter Session of Parliament.

The amendment comes after several companies that are vying for assets being auctioned under IBC expressed concern regarding getting into legal trouble over the cases against previous promoters.

In many of the cases under insolvency, the promoters are under investigation by various agencies, the sources said.

""We are working out a mechanism where the resolution applicant, who through this entire court supervised process is acquiring a stressed asset as a going concern, will not be encumbered by the criminal liability relating to the company which has been caused by the previous management,"" an official said.

A clear direction on this will not allow occurrence of cases like Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL).

Last month, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached BPSL's land, buildings, plant and machinery in Odisha worth more than Rs 4,000 crore in a case related to alleged diversion of bank funds, delaying the resolution process under which JSW Steel was set to take over the company.

Following the development, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) asked the ED and the corporate affairs ministry to reach a consensus on the issue of attachment of assets of BPSL.

While the ED is of the opinion that it can attach the property of BPSL under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ministry has been maintaining that the agency cannot do so as proceedings under the IBC are on."

VP-Derivatives and Technical Analyst – Motilal Oswal
Major trend of the Nifty is positive as declines are being bought into, but Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035, and then a lifetime high of 12103, according to technical analysts. They are bullish on HDFC, RBL Bank, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE, Maruti Suzuki and L&T.


Where are we: Nifty has been consolidating in a range of 250 points in between 11800 and 12038 zones from last 16 trading sessions. It witnessed some profit booking from higher levels in last two sessions but forming Doji candles for third consecutive week, indicating a tug of war between Bulls and Bears. However major trend of the index is positive as declines are being bought into but requires a decisive range breakout with follow up action to commence the next leg of rally.


What is in store: Now Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035 then life time high of 12103 while on the downside major support exists at 11800-11780 zones. Bank Nifty is outperforming from last couple of weeks and till the time it sustains above 30800 mark, we maintain our positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31500 then 31783 zones while next support below 30800 is placed at 30500-30300 zones.

What traders can do: Nifty has got stuck in a range where declines are bought but follow up is missing so better to use Bull Call Spread or Call Ladder Spread with the view that positive to range bound bias could continue. Aggressive option traders can do the short strangle or Call writing to get the benefit of time decay. On stocks, we have a positive view on HDFC, Bosch, Eicher Motors, RBL Bank, Exide Industries, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE while weakness is likely in Infosys, TCS, Petronet and Havells."

23,2018-11-28,JSW,"Kolkata: Domestic steel prices could increase by over Rs 1,000 per tonne in December, the first rise in six months, propped up by a strong revival in international prices and improvement in demand from infrastructure and housing sectors, according to industry executives.

“We are seeing signs of an improvement in demand since November and this has given us scope for price correction. However, we would prefer to calibrate the prices in step with a gradual recovery in demand,” said a top marketing executive of a steel manufacturer based in eastern India.

The sentiment was echoed by more executives working in other steel mills in the country. “Major steel players are looking at a moderate price recovery of Rs 1,000-1,500 per tonne in December on the back of a small price correction last month,” said a senior executive of a Mumbaiheadquartered steelmaker.

The October-March period traditionally represents two strong quarters for the steel industry, as construction activity generally picks up in the post-monsoon period. “This year, in addition to the seasonal impact on steel demand, a major contributing factor is the improvement in global prices by almost $40/ tonne. With a weak exchange rate, this translates into a higher price increase at home. However, domestic prices are yet to improve in tandem, since demand, though improving, is yet to catch up,” one of the executives cited earlier said.


An increase in price will improve the prospects of medium and large steel firms, including Tata Steel, Tata Steel BSL, JSW Steel, Essar Steel, Steel Authority of India and JSPL. Prices have been falling since May due to sluggish demand from infrastructure and construction sectors, and drop in orders from the slowdown-hit auto sector.

Benchmark global prices are based on rates of key flat steel items like hot rolled coils (HRC) which go into making of automobiles, consumer durables and construction materials. From a high of Rs 44,000 per tonne, HRC prices had plunged to, what industry executives termed as “unsustainable”, levels of Rs 34,000 per tonne."

0,2018-12-02,JSW,"MUMBAI: The steel sector, which is on a consolidation mode now under the IBC process amidst strong domestic demand, is unlikely to witness any greenfield expansion as mill-owners are likely to go in for brownfield expansion at least for the next half a decade or so, say industry players and analysts.

Domestic steel demand touched 91 million tonne (mt) in fiscal 2018, making the country the third largest consumer of the alloy in the world. In FY18, domestic demand grew by 8 per cent, while globally it grew by 5 per cent.

According to Crisil, companies with around 22 million tonne crude steel capacity are under various National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). These were from the first round of the stressed assets resolution process by the Reserve Bank.

These capacities have brownfield expansion potential of another 20-21 mt based on their environment clearance and regulatory filings, the Crisil report said.

""Already the flat steel space has some major players and with most of the big ones coming under NCLT, the dynamics of a more consolidated industry play out now. Also, spreads between landed and domestic prices are expected to narrow now,"" Rahul Prithiani, a director at Crisil Research, said.

He further said for the next four to five years, the expansion will most likely be only through brownfield development.

""Demand is expected to be quite robust at nearly 7-8 per cent. But capacity addition, except for in the case of NMDC, is largely going to be brownfield. Therefore, Tata Steel and JSW Steel are likely to put in low capex for expansion.

Currently the overall capacity utilisation of all the steel plants is 80-81 per cent, which will increase once they commence expansion,"" Prithiani added.

Tata Steel, which acquired Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin through the NCLT process, is planning to ramp up its domestic capacity to 30 mt per annum by 2025 from the current 13 mt.

""We will be ramping up capacity of both Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin,"" Tata Steel managing director TV Narendran had recently said, adding they will also be massively ramping up the Kalinganagar mill.

JSW Steel has plans to increase its capacity by 40 percent from 18 mt to 25 mt soon then further scale it up to 45 mt by 2030. This will include doubling of its Vijayanagar steel plant capacity to 23 mt from 12 mt now, as well as the Dolvi plant to 12 mt.

JSW Steel is operating out of seven locations apart from three plants which produce basic steel.

In addition to expanding the existing steel mills, the company will snap up more distressed assets, joint managing director and group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao had said recently. The company has submitted a higher bid to snap up Bhushan Power & Steel to the NCLT.

To expand its presence in the Eastern states, JSW Steel had announced a greenfield project in Odisha, which is likely to add another 10-12 mt to its capacity."

While Bhushan Steel deal is closed, Usha Martin deal is yet to be completed. With Bhushan Steel's capacity of 5.6 mt, Tata Steel has capacity of 18.6 mt now.

7,2018-12-06,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Indian shares witnessed a gap-down opening on Thursday in the wake of a selloff in Asian markets as worries of fresh tension flared up between the US and China after the arrest of Huawei CFO.

US stock futures and Asian shares tumbled on Thursday after Canadian authorities arrested a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei for extradition to the United States, feeding fears of a fresh flare-up in tensions between the two superpowers, Reuters reported.

Sensex and Nifty extended losses to the third consecutive session mostly on account of weak global sentiment, whereas RBI's status quo on key rates failed to impress domestic market. 

Rupee's poor health too weighed on the sentiment. The domestic unit opened 33 paise down at 70.79 against the US dollar on account of some buying in American currency by banks and importers.

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was 281 points, or 0.78 per cent, down at 35,603, while Nifty was 77 points, or 0.72 per cent, down at 10,705. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell up to 1 per cent in early trade.

8,2018-12-06,JSW,"The sharp selloff in equities in September-October may have tested your patience like never before. But you may actually have the last laugh. 

Analysts remain optimistic about the market and see a gradual recovery in select stocks, going forward.

The Sensex was at 36,241 on December 3 against 38,989.65 on August 29, the day when 30-share index scaled its all-time high. During this period, sentiment was fragile after a wild swing in crude oil prices, the rupee and the NBFC default.

“2019 will definitely be going to reverse the current trend. I see hundreds of stocks by more than 100 per cent up by the end of 2019. It is a tremendous opportunity despite the election outcome,” Porinju Veliyath, Founder, Equity Intelligence India, said in an interaction with ETNow.

ETMarkets.com drew up a list of stocks that witnessed severe selling pressure in the recent past, but may see some recovery. 

Maruti Suzuki: As many as 18 analysts have ‘Buy’ rating, while 17 have ‘Outperform’ call on the car major, according to Reuters. However, only two analysts have a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock. Since August-end, shares of the company declined nearly 19 per cent to Rs 7,665 on November 30 from Rs 9,418. Meanwhile, the scrip hit a low of Rs 6,609 on October 31. Maruti’s operational outlook had weakened in recent months led by rising fuel prices, increase in financing rates, a weakening rupee, and high input costs. Most of these factors are now easing on the margin with fuel and metal prices coming off from the peak and the rupee showing some strength of late. 

Global brokerage firm CLSA is bullish on Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 9200. “Festive demand was subdued this year, but we expect a gradual recovery ahead with ownership costs tapering off. Margins are likely to be weak in the third quarter due to high discounts and full foreign exchange impact, but should improve going forward,” CLSA said.

“I like Maruti Suzuki in the long run despite headwinds in the form of metal and oil prices,” Amisha Vora, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher, said at the recently-concluded at ETMarkets Global Summit. 


Ceat and Apollo Tyres: Phillip Capital sees a case of strong outperformance by tyre stocks in coming quarters. Their channel checks suggest that replacement demand remains healthy, with the industry experiencing near double-digit growth, further boosted by lack of Chinese tyre availability. On a year-to-date basis, the share price of Apollo Tyres and Ceat have plunged 13 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, till December 3. The brokerage firm has a ‘Buy’ call on Apollo and Ceat with a target price of Rs 320 and Rs 1,700, respectively. 

Phillip Capital is bullish on Ceat due to better volume outlook, pricing power picking up in 2Ws, and the new TBR capacity going on stream by Q4 2018-19. On the other hand, it sees Apollo as a major beneficiary of low Chinese imports. 

The robust demand environment, strong pricing power and a recent drop in crude prices warrant re-rating for Apollo Tyres, according to Phillip Capital.

Ceat and Apollo Tyres were trading at Rs 1263.45 and Rs 234.90, respectively, on December 3.


Tata Steel and JSW Steel: The domestic ferrous stocks’ meltdown post the recent dip in China steel (particularly rebar) prices is overdone due to healthy spreads, according to Edelweiss Securities. Little likelihood of spurt in China’s exports owing to relatively balanced supply-demand conditions there and anti-dumping duty will limit likely price correction in the domestic market. 

However, current stock prices imply a much sharper drop, which is unwarranted, according to Edelweiss Securities. The share price of JSW Steel has plunged nearly 25 per cent since September 19 this year. On the other hand, Tata Steel declined 22 per cent to Rs 537 on a year-to-date basis till December 3.

“On the valuation front, while Tata Steel stands out among peers, JSW Steel entails better RoE potential despite slightly higher valuation. JSPL is also trading at reasonable valuation and current market price, reflecting sharply reduced profitability,” Edelweiss said in a report.

As many as 11 analysts have ‘Buy’ rating on Tata Steel while 13 hold ‘Outperform’ call on the metal company, according to data available with Reuters.


Escorts: Credit Suisse maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on Escorts with a target price of Rs 1,050. Post sharp de-rating, Escorts is trading at very attractive valuation, according to the global financial services firm. Credit Suisse believes that Escorts would grow faster than the industry and improve margins at the same time."

10,2018-12-07,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Shares of JSW Steel and Tata Steel, which have fallen steeply over the past few days, could rebound as prices of Chinese steel begin to harden from recent lows, decreasing the spread between overseas and local rack rates for the alloy and cutting the incentive for imports.

Chinese steel prices fell by a fifth from October until November, making imports cheaper than domestic steel prices by nearly Rs 3,000 a tonne. But a pullback in the Chinese steel prices by 5 per cent over the past one week should restore the gap, offering some respite to domestic steel producers in the short term.

Furthermore, domestic iron-ore producers, such as NMDC, Serajuddin and Essel Mining, have taken price cuts and that would also help maintain steel margins. Earlier in the week, NMDC took the first price cut of the current fiscal, while the other two major ore producers have already taken two price cuts because of the global iron ore price correction of 15 per cent in the last two months.

JSW Steel, which sources iron ore from NMDC and through imports, will be in a more advantageous position. Although Tata Steel has its own captive mines, its earnings have been historically very volatile given its exposure to the European markets through Corus.

On Thursday, despite sharp corrections in the broader markets, stocks of the two steel companies held firm. While JSW Steel’s stock closed at 305, 0.3 per cent higher than previous day’s close, Tata Steel’s stock was down by 0.8 per cent, and closed at Rs 511 apiece."

17,2018-12-08,JSW,"MUMBAI: Karnataka iron ore producers are sitting on around 5.5 million tonnes of idle iron ore capacity despite state-run NMDC temporarily closing its Donimalai mine due to increasing imports by steel players, industry insiders said, denying any scarcity of the mineral.

Rising imports have even forced NMDC, the country’s largest iron ore producer, to cut prices as it led to a piling up of the mineral in the state, they said.

Without naming JSW Steel, which has Karnataka’s largest steel plant of 12 mt annual capacity in Vijayanagar, a senior executive of a natural resources major accused “a major steel player in Vijayanagar” of importing at a time when about 6 mt of iron ore remains unsold in the state, allegedly spending more in the short term but depressing prices in the long run.

Sales of NMDC, formerly National Mineral Development Corporation, in Karnataka had started dipping from April, and the staterun miner cut the price of lump iron ore by ?300 per tonne in December and that for fines by ?200 per tonne.

The price cut was in line with a global softening of iron ore prices from $74/tonne to $64/tonne following a fall in steel prices. Domestic steel players have cut prices of hot rolled steel coils by ?1,500 per tonne.

To be sure, on a net level, NMDC had increased average price of iron ore by ?500 per tonne between April and December.

“If the current level of import is not curbed, this will create a glutlike situation in the state,” said the executive cited earlier.

JSW Steel’s Vijayanagar plant has annual requirement of 22 mt of iron ore. It had plans to import 4 mt in the current financial year from Australia.

A person close to the company said the higher cost of imports does not impact the company in any way because it gets a higher grade of iron ore that cuts down costs on other processes like ore beneficiation, a process adopted to improve the grade of iron ore.

The person also countered the charge that JSW Steel was importing even as there was a glut in the state, saying the company often has to source iron ore from Odisha and abroad due to chronic shortage of the mineral in the state. If JSW Steel were to source its entire requirement from the state that would leave little for other customers, the person said.

NMDC had temporarily suspended mining at its Donimalai mine in November after a dispute with the state government, which wanted to impose an additional 80% levy on the sales from the mine, reached a stalemate.

Iron ore producers denied any scarcity situation due to the closure of the Donimalai mine.

According to data by Pellet Manufacturers Association of India, iron ore imports are projected to touch 15 mt by the end of this fiscal year, 60% higher than the import level of last year. Up till July, iron ore imports had touched 1.6 mt, 33% rise from the same time last year."
18,2018-12-10,JSW,"MUMBAI: Bhushan Power and Steel promoter Sanjay Singal has likened the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to an enabler of takeovers or liquidation instead of the intended objective — resolution of bad loans — to justify his eligibility to bid for the asset he has run for decades.

Singal described the dedicated IBC framework as an “imbalanced economic provision,” in a writ petition filed in the Supreme Court. He has challenged the constitutional validity of four sections of the law, including the contentious Section 29(A) that deals with the bidding eligibility for assets under resolution. A writ petition is filed in high court or Supreme Court when a fundamental right is violated. Singal has called the sections “violative” of Articles 14,19, 20, 21, 39 and 300A of the Constitution.

ET has seen the petition that is expected to be brought up for hearing Tuesday. IBC is an “imbalanced economic provision” that is “metamorphosing into a takeover or liquidation code instead of its objective of being a financial resolution code,” said the petition. If his contentions are held valid, certain provisions in the IBC could get a relook, perhaps affecting resolution process in several cases currently in various bankruptcy courts.

Singal said that by excluding the promoter from bidding for his own asset through Section 29(A), BPSL’s resolution process has been converted into its sale at “hugely discounted” rate based on its liquidation value of Rs 9,700 crore instead of its going concern value of Rs 25,000 crore.

IBC Section 29(A) bars defaulting promoters and persons related to them from bidding for stressed assets. Singal has also questioned retrospective applicability of the section on BPSL’s resolution since an amendment was introduced in November last year, while the steel company was admitted for insolvency in July. He has called the clause violative of his right to equality before law, freedom of individual rights as well as of right to property. “...rules of the game are being changed in such a manner that the petitioner’s (Sanjay Singal) rights are reduced in the company created by him and compulsory transfer of the said company is incurred at unnaturally discounted prices,” he said in the plea.

Section 29(A) was also discussed at length in the October 4 Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel, but in that case, the section itself had not been challenged and only the terms by way of which the two bidders — Arcelor-Mittal and Numetal — adhered to it were debated upon. “In the Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel, it was assumed the section is constitutionally valid as it had not been challenged,” said Alok Dhir, managing partner, Dhir & Dhir Associates.

As to whether it’s prospective, the court will have to consider possibilities such as whether the law applies to cases admitted before it came into being, or to cases which had been admitted but had not invited expressions of interest, Dhir said. BPSL has three bidders in the final lap of the race —Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Liberty House. 

JSW Steel revised its bid to more than Rs 19,500 crore, while Tata Steel and Liberty House have reportedly offered Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 18,500 crore, respectively. Singal has said if he were allowed to bid, he would provide a plan as per fair value of the asset whose capacity he has increased from 10,000 tonnes to 3 million tonnes over 40 years.

Singal wants Supreme Court to determine whether Section 29(A) is prospective in operation and, thus, a person like him who submitted an expression of interest before the law was introduced can be said to be ineligible. He has also asked if Section 21of the law violates right to equality as it treats “equals unequally” by making financial creditors (lenders) as the deciding force to accept a resolution plan, by which they may also sacrifice the interest of other stakeholders like operational creditors."

21,2018-12-10,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel is seeking to garner up to Rs 3,500 crore in a local bond sale as part of a broader, dedicated fundraising to finance the buyout of Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL), the future ownership of which would be decided by a court of appeals.

These domestic bonds may be of three- or four-year maturities, although the pricing is not yet decided, said one of the persons cited above. The sale is likely in January once JSW Steel obtains the final approval from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

“JSW Steel has been raising resources as part of its strategy of liability management and also to finance its organic and inorganic growth,” said a JSW Steel spokesperson, responding to ET’s queries. He did not comment on this specific bond sale.

Standard Chartered Bank and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the matter, while a mail sent to Credit Suisse remained unanswered until the publication of this report.

If the bond sale were to go through, it would be JSW Steel’s first domestic issuance after a gap of four years. It had last sold such debt papers in 2014 at 9.66 per cent. Those four-year bonds are yielding about 9.40 per cent now and set to mature on December 23, show data from Bloomberg.

In August, rating company Icra upgraded JSW Steel’s longterm rating to AA (Stable) from AA-(Stable), citing favourable demand and remunerative steel prices.

About 18 months ago, Bhushan Power and Steel was admitted for insolvency proceedings as the company had defaulted on Rs 47,000 crore of dues.

In October, more than twothirds of the lenders voted in favour of the Sajjan Jindalpromoted JSW’s bid, which offered upfront payment of about Rs 19,500 crore to banks in lieu of the loans they have to recover from the distressed Bhushan Power.

Earlier, Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House also submitted bids in a round of offers and counter-offers. Later, Tata Steel challenged the decision taken by the committee of creditors.

A two-member NCLAT bench, headed by Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, has scheduled the matter for further hearing on December 20."
23,2018-12-10,JSW,"I would clearly stay away from the highly levered companies but as long as there is a turnaround plan in place, 
  
  
  like in Jindal Steel and Power, and risk equity funding available, we would look at it, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts: 

Vijay Mallya is really an example of what is happening with the whole lending culture in India. You cannot keep providing liquidity lifelines to institutions to deal with problems that they have created with regards to bad loans. As an investor is that also your thought process and is that why you would not venture outside the quality names? 
Post 2013 till now, the NPAs have increased and economic activity has slowed down. Interest on the NPAs has also accumulated and some of the good credits have turned bad credits now. Some of the loan were given in good faith and they were good loans at that point in time. I would not paint everything with a single brush saying they were all bad companies. Today I would clearly stay away from the highly levered companies but as long as there is a turnaround plan in place, like in Jindal Steel and Power, and risk equity funding available, we would look at it.


How long do you think it will take before lending and credit growth starts picking up?
The lending growth will pick up and RBI has a very important role to play in terms of continuing its OMOs at least for the next several months and not stepping away from doing its bit will be a key part of the easing of liquidity in the market place. 

Having said that, even with higher liquidity being available, the lending growth rates are likely to come off extremely shortly for all NBFCs, right from the well managed ones to the not so well managed ones. Some of the banks are buying out portfolios, So, you will have overnight increase in market share by banks at the expense of NBFCs. Against this backdrop, NBFCs’ valuations would contract and banks on the margin will gain from the whole liquidity problem which has been created in the last couple of months.


What is your view on PSU names in general?
These are all good companies but I would like to stay away from the whole PSU pack because I wish I clearly knew whether it is PFC buying REC or REC buying PFC and then we can decide on whose is going to pay out the dividends. This is a trend that we are going to continue to see over the coming months because the disinvestment target needs to be met and against that backdrop, higher regulatory pressure is there, You can buy them whole as a basket where somehow some amount of the dividend comes out as dividend but otherwise I would stay away from the whole PSU pack.


Do you think HUL is buy at current levels?
HUL clearly looks good. Valuations is not a factor. In environments like this, the valuation will only get richer but the certainty of cash flows plus the deal which is also accretive, allows it a strong foothold. The strong brands in its current portfolio will do well for the company and also with its existing distribution system. The synergies will naturally increase the market reach of the products. Against that backdrop, a long-term investor can still make money in HUL.


What is your view on this Kotak deal?
A couple of years ago you had a fantastic interview with Warren Buffett and it was an extremely well watched interview. If that turns out to be true and if indeed he buys a stake in any one of the banks or Kotak, it will re-rate the entire private sector banking sector because it is a recognition of not just one company, rather of the sector.

Two, deal or no deal. Kotak has done the right thing by approaching the high court because it is still right in its view point of meeting its goal of diluting the promoter stake. Now whether it is paid up capital or whether it is equity capital is a detail which should have been thought by the authorities. But if you are meeting the norm, you are meeting the norm and also if you look at the whole thing, there is no such thing as all promoters are bad for the companies that they own and run. There are good guys and bad guys. Against this backdrop, Kotak approaching the high court on RBI’s decision of this preferential share issue probably clears up a number of grey issues or rather unsaid issues. More importantly, it meets the guidelines which I think is a positive.


Do you have any favourites in the metals and mining business?
The favourites continue to be the frontline names -- Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco. But they have been caught up in some kind of that US-China will lead to a trade slowdown and therefore demand for metals which is unlikely in my view as far as the demand for steel in India is considered and from that perspective, JSW Steel looks good. Also, Hindalco, considering the business that it does in selling Pepsi cans as well as autos, is unlikely to see impact in demand. I do not think it will change their estimates and at current valuations, they are looking good and they have taken a lot of knocks in the last several sessions.

It is likely that we will see some kind of rebound as and when the US trends up in the next day or two."

The current market price of JSW Steel is Rs 296.70.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when JSW Steel price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage

Vijayanagar’s operating model akin to cost-efficient Russian players: JSTL’s 12mtpa Vijayanagar plant is modelled on operating a lower number of high-capacity equipment at full efficiency. Thus, the plant’s fixed cost/tonne is lower than domestic peers even though it does not have a captive raw material base. Management is taking initiatives on fuel rate and enhancing iron ore quality—the latter would further reduce raw material cost. We find similarities between JSTL’s operating model and cost-efficient Russian plants run by MMK, NLMK, Severstal, etc.


Projects at Vijayanagar on track: Expansion projects at Vijayanagar are on track with the foundation work in progress at various sites. We found the key equipment being procured and ready for installation. Both crude steel capacity expansion (1mtpa) and CRM-1 expansion (1.8mtpa) are expected to be completed by December 2019. On the cost front, commissioning of a pipe conveyor in Q4FY19 is expected to yield gains of up to Rs 300/t.


Outlook and valuation- becoming bigger and better; maintain ‘BUY’: We remain upbeat on JSTL based on: 1) its fixed-cost advantage due to economies of scale; and 2) the progress on value-additive projects at Vijayanagar. By valuation, JSTL is trading at premium to peers. Maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with a target price of Rs 433 (exit multiple-6.7x FY20E EBITDA)."

31,2018-12-20,JSW,"MUMBAI: Sarda Energy & Minerals (SEM) may try to acquire distressed companies Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics by bidding jointly with Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management, two people aware of the development said.

The flagship company of the Sarda Group of Industries, SEM is a listed steel producer based in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, specialising in making niche grade manganese-based ferro-alloys, an additive in making steel. It owns a 20 million tonne iron ore mine in Rajnandgaon in the state. 

The two subsidiaries of Uttam Galva Steels together owe Rs 5,400 crore to lenders and SEM’s interest stems from the opportunity to expand its product portfolio, said one of the persons.

“The company is having discussions on potential growth opportunities,” said another person closely associated with SEM. SEM had previously shown interest in acquiring Impex Metal, a small-scale steel company based in Kolkata that eventually went into liquidation after lenders were unconvinced by the bids that came in.

Chaired by Kamal Kishore Sarda, SEM reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 206 crore on revenue of Rs 2,217 crore for FY18. A consortium led by SSG Capital Management has put in an expression of interest for Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics. 

The group includes Synergy Metals & Mining and ART Special Situations Finance (India). Other bidders are JSW Steel, Liberty House, Aion Capital, Phoenix ARC and a consortium led by New Zone Intertrade FZE. The deadline for final bids is December 21. Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics were taken to insolvency tribunals last year by State Bank of India."

33,2018-12-20,JSW,"NEW DELHI: A sharp drop in crude oil prices and a bounce in the rupee helped Dalal Street fight a global depression over a less-than-dovish posturing by the US Fed and pare early losses. 

Nifty ended the day 16 points down but formed a bullish candle on the chart, signalling that early Thursday’s blip has not damaged the winning momentum too much.

At one point during the session, BSE Sensex slipped as much as 281 points, but pared most losses. The 30-pack eventually settled 53 points, or 0.14 per cent, down at 36,431 while Nifty closed 16 points, or 0.14 per cent, lower at 10,951.

Midcaps and smallcaps managed mild gains, with BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices ending 0.07 per cent and 0.12 per cent higher, respectively. 

Let’s have a look at the stocks that created maximum buzz during the session: 


Sensex almost evenly poised
Out of the 31 components (including Tata Motors DVR), 16 Sensex stocks settled in the green and 15 in the red. YES Bank (up 3.93 per cent) led the index gainers, followed by Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra and Asian Paints, while the SBI (down 2.18 per cent) lost the most, followed by Wipro, Vedanta, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki. 


Telecom, metal worst hit
With a 1.17 per cent loss, the telecom pack emerged as top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE. It was followed by the BSE Metal index, which slipped 1.10 per cent. Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and Sterlite Technologies proved top drags on the telecom index. Similarly, Vedanta, Hindalco, Tata Steel and JSW Steel were top drags from the metals pack. 


ONGC board approves share buyback
Shares of ONGC logged a nominal gain of 0.13 per cent at Rs 148.65 on BSE after the company’s board on Thursday approved buyback of 25.29 crore shares, or 1.97 per cent of equity shares, for Rs 4,022 crore. In a regulatory filing, the company set the buyback price at Rs 159 apiece. 


Bharti Airtel falls 2%
Shares of the telecom giant slipped 1.89 per cent to Rs 316.15 on BSE after the company in a BSE filing said its board formed and authorised a 'Special Committee of Directors for Fund Raising' to comprehensively evaluate various options of fund-raising. Besides, the company also announced some management changes.


Bank recap plan fails to lift PSU stocks
Most PSU bank stocks did not react positively to the government’s capital infusion plan. The Nifty PSU Bank index closed 1.80 per cent down, with eight components declining out of 12. Major PSU lenders SBI, Canara Bank, PNB and Bank of Baroda all ended the session lower. Analysts said the ongoing political obsession with farm loan waiver has dented investor confidence on this basket.


GST cut hope sends tyre stocks soaring
Tyre stocks Govind Rubber (up 6.43 per cent), JK Tyre (up 5.88 per cent), Goodyear India (up 2.31 per cent), TVS Srichakra (up 1.56 per cent), Krypton Industries (up 1.27 per cent) gained across the board after reports that the GST Council is likely to slash tax rates on automobile tyres to 18 per cent from 28 per cent at its next meeting on Saturday. A drop in crude oil prices also proved a sentiment booster on the counter, as crude-related products are a key raw material in tyre manufacturing. 


Overbought and oversold stocks
Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 43 stocks slipped into the oversold zone on BSE. They included GTL Infrastructure, Arvind, Rolta India, Regency Investments and Ganesh Films India. While 35 stocks, including Zenith Healthcare, Alexander Stamps, Shriram AMC and Adi Rasayan, turned overbought. 


96 stocks show potential upside
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 96 counters on BSE, signalling bullish setup on these counters.

The stocks included Bharat Forge, Lupin, L&T, Gati, Dilip Buildcon, Pidilite and Apollo Hospitals. However, 50 stocks including Infosys, Nalco, Mindtree, Natco Pharma and Ramco Systems showed bearish crossovers, indicating that they may slide further. 


Nifty forms a bullish candle
The Nifty index negated the formation of higher highs and higher lows that it had formed in last two sessions and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. Before closing 15.60 points, or 0.14 per cent, down at 10,951, the index scaled an intraday high and low of 10,962 and 10,880, respectively."

The index slipped below its 50-day EMA and tested its 50% retracement of the entire upward move from 10,333 to 10,985 levels. As long as it sustains below the 10,777-10,750 zone, Nifty could see profit booking and slip towards its next major support in the 10,600-10,550 zone, while on the upside, hurdles are seen in the 10,750-10,777 zone.

Meaningful Call writing was seen at 10,700 followed by 10,800 level, which may cap the upside while Put unwinding at all immediate strikes could put some pressure.

""Even though the US President has said the Fed chief will not be fired, the market is slightly uneasy as to what will happen if Fed hikes rates again at its next meet,” he said.

Monday's fall caused BSE listed firms to lose Rs 1.22 lakh crore cumulatively in market capitalisation from 1,43,30,309 crore on Friday to Rs 1,42,08,021 crore. The market fall in last three days has eroded total wealth of companies of more than Rs 3.75 lakh crore. 


Inox Leisure rises on GST cut

It formed a Piercing Line pattern on the daily scale, as it recovered its losses of last session by more than a half. It has been making lower lows from last four sessions and a hold above the 10,750-10,777 zone can negate the same to extend its recent bounce towards 10,850 and then 10,929 levels.

45,2018-12-29,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel has withdrawn its nominees from the board of Vardhman Industries, a steel company it acquired recently through the insolvency resolution process for Rs 62 crore. The company's move follows the National Company Law Tribunal’s decision to include two fresh clauses in JSW's resolution plan for VIL, which had been approved by the insolvency court on December 19. JSW has decided to approach the NCLT seeking a modification in the order.

The two clauses pertain to VIL’s tax liability and receivables which JSW feels, if implemented, would mean that any additional financial gain may go to the lenders, making it a costlier purchase for JSW.

“These were not part of the resolution plan for VIL that was submitted by JSW Steel and approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of VIL. Hence, we are seeking a modification of the order and remain committed to the deal,” a top JSW Steel official said.

In a communication to the stock exchanges on Friday evening, JSW Steel said: “Acceding to the request of the Resolution Professional of Vardhman Industries Limited and in the interest of propriety, pending appropriate clarifications/modifications to the Hon'ble NCLT's order of December 19, 2018, we have withdrawn our nominees from the Board of Vardhman Industries Limited and delivered their resignations to the Resolution Professional/Vardhman Industries Limited.”

As per the NCLT order, the tax liability of VIL as on date of reference was not extinguished but is subject to approval of I-T authorities. This is contrary to other NCLT cases where the tax liability is extinguished as on the date of reference. Secondly, all receivables of VIL, as on date of admission to NCLT, will also be paid to the lenders.

On seeing the order, JSW wrote to the resolution professional of VIL seeking a review. JSW was advised by the RP to withdraw its nominees appointed to the VIL board following the December 19 nod from the NCLT, the JSW official said.

VIL is a manufacturer and wholesale supplier and exports a wide range of galvanised tubes, coils, precision steel tubes, galvanised steel pipes, steel square tube, galvanised sheets, corrugated steel tubes, cold rolled steel sheets.

On Wednesday, JSW Steel had notified the exchanges that “on perusal of detailed order, the NCLT (Principal Bench, New Delhi), while approving the resolution plan submitted by JSW Steel Limited as approved by the CoC for VIL, given certain directions which could have the effect of modifying the resolution plan submitted by JSW Steel and approved by the CoC.” These directions pertain to utilisation of receivables of VIL, notices, assessments or other proceedings pending or threatened against VIL and relationship and obligations of VIL to or in relation to various subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures executed by VIL.

JSW Steel was of the view that those directions “appear to amount to an amendment of the Resolution Plan given by it without seeking its consent.”

On this basis, JSW said it proposes to seek a modification and clarification by the NCLT and/or any other relevant forums. “The bonafide steps taken by JSWSL and all further steps with respect to implementation of Resolution Plan pursuant to the NCLT Order shall be subject to the aforesaid modifications/clarifications by the Hon'ble NCLT or such other relevant forums,” the notification added."

5,2019-01-02,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Shares of five metals and mining companies such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco plunged up to 3 per cent in Wednesday’s trade after global brokerages CLSA downgraded the stocks to ‘sell’, citing weak Chinese demand.

Deteriorating Chinese demand outlook will weigh on commodity prices, the brokerage said, while slashing FY20-21 earnings estimates for the companies anywhere between 9 per cent to 38 per cent. This, it said, priced in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.

Following the development, shares of Tata Steel fell 2.40 per cent to Rs 503.20. CLSA cut the target price for this steelmaker to Rs 460 from Rs 855 earlier.

JSW Steel was down 2.62 per cent at Rs 295.60, while Hindalco was trading 2.89 per cent down at Rs 216.35.

CLSA downgraded JSW Steel to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’ and cut price the target price for the stock to Rs 260 from Rs 375. Likewise, Hindalco’s rating was lowered to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’. The target for the stock is reduced to Rs 210 from Rs 255 earlier.

Data released earlier in the day showed that the China’s official manufacturing indicator -- Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) – contracted to 49.7 in December. This is against a reading of 50.2 in November. This was the first contraction in manufacturing activity, as suggested by a below 50 reading, for the index since May 2017.

The foreign brokerage, meanwhile, maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on both on Vedanta and Coal India, but revised targets for the former to Rs 250 (Rs 300 earlier) and latter to Rs 310 (Rs 360 earlier).

Shares of Vedanta were trading 2.52 per cent down at Rs 197.05 at around 9.40 am (IST), while those of Coal India were down 0.29 per cent at Rs 240.40.

9,2019-01-03,JSW,"Mumbai: Foreign brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded shares of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco Industries saying that deteriorating Chinese demand outlook is likely to continue to weigh on commodity prices. The brokerage has cut earnings per share estimates for the FY20-FY21 period by 9-38 per cent to factor in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.


“We expect large cuts to street estimates ahead,” said CLSA.

Shares of Tata Steel ended down 4 per cent at Rs 493.85 on Wednesday while JSW Steel and Hindalco ended down 5 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.

CLSA downgraded Tata Steel to sell from buy and cut target price to Rs 460 from Rs 855. JSW Steel was downgraded to underperform from sell by CLSA and target price was lowered to Rs 260 from Rs 375. The brokerage has downgraded Hindalco to underperform from sell and trimmed target price to Rs 210 from Rs 255.

CLSA has maintained buy rating on Vedanta and Coal India. However, target price for Vedanta has been cut to Rs 250 from Rs 300 while target price for Coal India has been reduced to Rs 310 from Rs 360 by CLSA.

2018 was a tough year for commodities despite decent global growth led by concerns on Chinese demand, escalating trade wars and benign winter cuts in China, said CLSA.

The brokerage said the calendar year 2019 is likely to offer little respite because of the deteriorating Chinese demand outlook.

“...India’s steel market is on the cusp of multi-year tightening due to insufficient capacity additions and we expect imports to rise sharply in coming years. However, the deterioration in global steel industry outlook is weighing down on Indian steel prices, weakening the earnings outlook of the steel companies,” said CLSA.

The brokerage is relatively more positive on Coal India and Vedanta.

The brokerage cut FY20-FY21 EPS estimates for Vedanta by 22-23 per cent on lower oil prices and stronger rupee but added that the company has decent volume growth, better earnings trajectory and an attractive 8 per cent dividend yield, it said.

CLSA sees Coal India as a defensive play amid the global headwinds in the resources sector.

While production growth for Coal India has been patchy but demand outlook for coal in India remains healthy, said CLSA."

17,2019-01-04,JSW,"The Nifty 50 companies are expected to report moderation in topline growth for the third-quarter of FY19 on account of slowing momentum in some sectors and a stronger growth base in the previous year’s corresponding quarter. The growth may be faster in the fourth-quarter as the benefit of lower raw material costs to manufacturing companies is expected to reflect fully by then.

According to ETIG estimates, the aggregate revenue is likely to grow at an eight-quarter low of 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter compared with 13 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter.

Net profit will grow by 6.7 per cent, making it a third consecutive quarter of single-digit growth. Automobiles, cement, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and telecom companies may report subdued numbers, whereas private sector banks, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and information technology (IT) companies may show improvement.



“In the December 2018 quarter, we will see the impact of lower industrial metal prices. Crude prices also have fallen. This will help consumers of commodities and crude oil -based fuel and raw materials. The rupee depreciated by 9 per cent, which will affect importers and borrowers of foreign capital,” said Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities. Except tin, other metal prices have fallen by 14-26 per cent while the crude price has dropped by 24 per cent from the year-ago quarter.

The operating margin is expected to be marginally lower by 30 basis points (bps; 100 bps = 1 percentage point) to 20.5 per cent year-on-year.

Analysts believe that growth may resume in FY 20 as stability gradually sets in the banking sector thereby improving credit availability in the system. The street expects 18-28 per cent growth in the Nifty 50 earnings per share. “This will be facilitated largely by the turnaround in corporate banks’ profitability. However, performance of the other key sectors of oil and gas, and metals could depend on global growth conditions and domestic policies.”


Sector Trends

AUTOMOBILESSales volumes of the majority of listed auto companies either fell or grew in single-digits barring Bajaj Auto. Average discount level remained elevated amid dismal festive demand and mounting dealer inventory. This is likely to put further pressure on margins of auto companies.


BANKINGProvisioning requirement is expected to reduce as the rate of new bad loans reported by banks gradually abates. A lower yield on longterm government bonds should result in higher treasury income. These factors may support profit growth.


CAPITAL GOODSA sustained order flow from the government will support topline growth in the December quarter. Execution is picking up as companies have reduced the proportion of slow moving orders over the past few quarters.

The commentary by Larsen & Toubro, the country’s largest infrastructure company, will be keenly watched since the number of order wins that the company reported to the stock exchanges during the quarter was lower than expected.


CEMENTAll-India average cement price fell by nearly 2 per cent to Rs 308 per 50kg bag year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter. Intense competition has kept players away from raising prices even though demand has improved marginally across regions. Realisations therefore may remain under pressure despite lower raw material prices. Large-sized companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cement, Dalmia Bharat and Shree Cement are likely to post 10-15 per cent volume growth, but their revenue growth will be capped at 3-9 per cent.


FMCG PREVIEWFactors including the extent of festive demand and the effect of lower GST rates will be crucial for the FMCG sector. Rural demand, which has been a key growth driver for the past few quarters, may show signs of moderation. Flaring crude oil prices in the previous quarter will have a lag effect on the sector’s margins in the form of higher input costs. A drop in GST rates may offer some respite.


IT
A weaker rupee against the dollar will boost realisations of the IT exporters though the benefit will be marginally offset by unfavourable movement in other major currencies. The dollar-denominated growth may remain at 2-3 per cent quarter-on-quarter given a seasonally weak quarter.


METALSPrices of most commodities declined in the December quarter. Steel price declined nearly 15 per cent, a negative for players such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel. A drop in the aluminium price will affect Hindalco and Vedanta. Vedanta, which has an oil exploration division, would also be impacted due to the falling crude prices.


PHARMAPharma companies may report subdued performance given the headwinds in the US and the domestic markets. A deceleration in price erosion in the US generics market may offer some relief to pharma exporters. Investors would be keen on seeking clarification from Sun Pharma on corporate governance front."
18,2019-01-04,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Healthy gains in bank, financials and metal stocks amid positive global cues and a strong rupee helped domestic equity benchmarks snap their two-session losing streak on Friday. 

Markets across the globe rallied after China said it would hold a vice-ministerial-level talks on Monday and Tuesday with the US to resolve the trade tussle. 

Investors cheered the news and a fresh spell of buying emerged in most sectors, barring IT, to lift Sensex 230 points in intraday trade. It, however, cooled off and settled 181 points, or 0.51 per cent, higher at 35,695, with 22 stocks ending in the green and nine in the red.

The Nifty50 climbed 55 points, or 0.52 per cent, to end at 10,727, with 33 stocks advancing and 17 declining.

On a weekly basis, both Sensex and Nifty declined by 1 per cent. 

We walk you through the highlights of Friday's session


Who moved my SensexBank and financial stocks contributed most to the rally in Sensex. HDFC, State Bank of India, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank were the top five contributors of the rise in Sensex. On the flip side, Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech, L&T and IndusInd Bank proved top drags on the 30-share pack.


122 stocks signal bearish moodMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 122 counters on BSE. Among them were SREI Infra, JSW Steel, Equitas Holdings, PowerGrid, GM Breweries, InterGlobe Aviation and CanFin Homes. Meanwhile, SBI, LIC Housing Finance, Apollo Hospitals, Thermax and Kamdhenu were among the 48 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on BSE. 


PSU banks shineThe Nifty PSU Bank index closed 2.32 per cent up with 11 stocks in the green and only one - Central Bank of India – ended in the red. Most PSU bank stocks rose after a parliamentary panel on Thursday asked RBI to ease capital adequacy norms for banks and review supervisory framework PCA. 


Bharti Infratel, Airtel surge up to 5%Shares of Bharti Infratel and Bharti Airtel closed 4.78 per cent and 3.02 per cent higher, respectively, on Friday. Shares of Bharti Infratel and Airtel rose after the company added more than 1 lakh new users in November after two months of decline, according to the industry data. 


Reliance Communications jumps 4%Shares of RCom finished at Rs 14, up 3.63 per cent after the company initiated contempt proceedings in the apex court against the Department of Telecommunications, alleging that it failed to issue a no-objection certificate regarding RCom’s spectrum deal with Reliance Jio Infocomm even after the court had directed it to do so. Separately, telecom equipment maker Ericsson filed its second contempt petition in the Supreme Court against Reliance Communications’ Chairman Anil Ambani, asking that he be detained in civil prison and be barred from travel overseas unless he ensures payment of Rs 550 crore owed to the Swedish company.


Tata Motors jumps on JLR sales dataShares of Tata Motors closed 2.74 per cent higher at Rs 170.75 on the back of healthy JLR US sales numbers.

For the entire year, the US JLR sales rose 7.3 per cent to 1,22,626 units from 1,14,333 units in 2017, Reuters reported.


IT suffers on rupee's riseThe rupee's rally against the US dollar hit most IT stocks, as a stronger rupee has a negative impact on revenues of this export-heavy sector. Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Mindtree and Wipro all suffered losses for the day in an otherwise positive market. 


Spurt in open interestMindtree, with a change of 43.37 per cent, led the stocks that saw biggest spurt in open interest (OI) on NSE. It was followed by Bharti Infratel (21.46 per cent), TCS (17.01 per cent), Apollo Hospitals (15.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (15.49 per cent).

19,2019-01-05,JSW,"The commentary of software companies derives its significance from the fact that most of the business comes from abroad, explains Rahul Shah, AVP, Group Leader-Equity Advisory Group, MOFSL. He spoke to ETNow. Edited excerpts:


First week of 2019 started on a cautious note. What to watch out for?

We have been just following the global front and we saw a selloff on the back of it. Obviously, things have been better for India as the macros have been improving. We have been discussing this a couple of times. 

My sense is obviously metal is one we need to watch out for. Earnings season will be starting from next week. It is to be followed initially by private banks and tech companies. 

These are two important events which are going to start from the next week and obviously how the global market shape up. So these are the few things for the next week one should look at.


Earnings season would come next week. Do you think particularly this will be a quarter where it will be tough to predict earnings? The currency was absolutely volatile, markets were volatile in October. You had issues as far as bond markets are concerned and then you had the festive season which was not that great?

I do not think there should be a problem. The only issue -- as you mentioned -- is with NBFCs or maybe, oil marketing companies where rupee-dollar and crude were very volatile. 

These two sectors are to be looked at. Rest I think more or less should be okay. That is where earnings should be in line with what Street is estimating. 


Let's talk about IT companies, how they are likely to report earnings. Q3 is a soft quarter, but do you think this will be the first quarter where they will get any indication about 2019 spending from their clients and that is why commentary would become important?

We have seen good numbers from most IT companies. It will be interesting to note that we have seen the US markets correcting. Also in the UK and other countries, we have seen the negative part. 

It would be very important to note the commentary because most of the business comes from abroad. Definitely, it will make more sense for hearing the commentary and the outlook for 2019 from the companies.


Any view on the metal pack and the sort of correction you have seen in steel names, non-steel names?
The correction has been steep and I think we have seen 20 per cent. That much has been shaved off from recent highs for most metal companies. Going forward, it is important to look at how the prices fare as the downside looks limited. 

The most important thing is how the metal prices fare. Friday's trade saw some bounceback in metals pack towards closing. Next week may be interesting from that perspective. JSW Steel and Tata Steel will offer a good value proposition from here. This could be temporary in nature in terms of metal prices. I would look at buying the stocks.


What are your stock picks?

One clear winner in the entire market in the last few sessions is all corporate banks. My sense is corporate banks will continue to do well. The top pick will be ICICI Bank from my side and SBI remains. These two are the large two banks on the corporate side which looks interesting going ahead."
30,2019-01-07,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Global cues yet again swayed Indian equities on Monday, as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their bull run into the second consecutive session, backed by gains in IT, energy, auto and private ba nk heavyweights.

In sync with most Asian peers, Sensex traded in the positive territory through the day, tracking positive global sentiment in the wake of US Fed’s dovish tone, healthy US employment data and policy easing by the Chinese central bank.

The market is showing optimism over forthcoming Q3 earnings and hopes of a comprehensive trade deal between the US and China. 

Sensex settled 155 points, or 0.43 per cent, higher at 35,850, while NSE benchmark Nifty50 shut shop with a gain of 44 points, or 0.41 per cent, at 10,771.

Midcaps and smallcaps underperformed Sensex as the indices representing these segments inched up 0.03 per cent and 0.06 per cent, respectively. 


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Monday's session:

Titan climbs 2%Shares of Titan climbed 1.61 per cent to Rs 943.50 after the company said it saw good growth momentum across its businesses in a seasonally strong third quarter. It expects the full-year growth in jewellery business to be around 22 per cent. Global brokerage Macquarie maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on Titan with a target price of Rs 1,186. 


Sobha rises 3% on Q3 numbersShares of Sobha settled 2.65 per cent up after the company said it had achieved a sales volume of 9,08,824 square feet valued at Rs 698.80 crore with an average realisation of Rs 7,669 per square feet during third quarter. Sales volume rose 11 per cent YoY for the first nine months. 


Bandhan Bank, Gruh Finance plungeShares of Bandhan Bank cracked 5.21 per cent to Rs 501 and those of Gruh Finance fell 3.86 per cent to 306 Rs after speculation about their possible merger. Bandhan Bank's talks with HDFC to either buy into or merge with Gruh Finance, a mortgage lender for the less affluent, have reached an advanced stage. Although the regulatory response to the proposal would decide the fate of the transaction. “Bandhan Bank has a problem of getting its shareholding pattern in order but Gruh Finance is a key NBFC to acquire. So, it will turn out to be a very good marriage and it may have very good repercussions in the long run,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, to ET Now. 


IL&FS Transportation defaults on dividend payment IL&FS Transportation Networks today said it had defaulted on dividend payment of Rs 7.12 crore due on redemption of cumulative non-convertible redeemable preference shares. The dividend of Rs 7.12 crore was due for the period between April 1, 2017, to December 23, 2018, and was not paid due to insufficient funds, the company said in a filing to the exchanges. Shares of the company closed 3.10 per cent down at Rs 12.21 on BSE.


Bharat Forge declines 2%Shares of Bharat Forge finished 1.63 per cent down at Rs 480.15 after global brokerage CLSA downgraded the stock to sell from outperform and cut its price target to Rs 420 from Rs 680 earlier. The stock has taken a hit after the US December truck sales fell 42 per cent annually to the lowest in two years. This happened despite December being the strongest month in a year. 


Eicher Motors plumbs 52-week lowShares of Eicher Motors settled below the Rs 20,000-mark after touching a 52-week low at Rs 19,751 on BSE. Falling for the fourth successive session after it posted disappointing December sales data last week, the scrip settled 1.52 per cent lower at 19,822.65. Royal Enfield, the two-wheeler division of Eicher Motors, had reported a 13 per cent drop in total sales at 58,278 units in December compared with 66,968 units in the same month last year.


YES Bank loses shineAfter climbing over 2 per cent in intraday trade on reports of shortlisting two names for MD & CEO position, the scrip slipped in late afternoon deals and settled 1.35 per cent down at Rs 186. Quoting sources, ET reported that Rajesh Sud, former MD and CEO of Max Life Insurance, and current Yes Bank Executive Director Rajat Monga are in race to head the private lender after incumbent CEO Rana Kapoor steps down on January 31 following a central bank advisory. 


Spurt in OIBerger Paints, with a change of 131.08 per cent, led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on NSE. It was followed by Tata Elxsi (52.47 per cent), DCB Bank (28.04 per cent), Ashok Leyland (18.54 per cent) and Bharat Forge (17.46 per cent).

20,2019-01-07,JSW,"The global steel sector is facing challenges due to the recent correction in steel prices. Concerns of slowdown in the Chinese economy and oversupply by Chinese steel firms has brought down prices. Analysts are concerned that such volatility will affect the margins of Indian steel players in the short run.

However, India’s steel demand continues to remain strong with 8.4% and 10.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in October and November 2018, respectively. Strong demand has made India a net importer of steel—imports jumped 12% y-o-y, whereas exports fell 42% y-o-y in November 2018.

According to a report by SBICap Securities, the domestic steel demand is likely to remain strong due to the election-fuelled infrastructure spending and approaching peak season. Some steel players believe that the current weakness in price, led by China, is temporary and seasonal and there is a strong likelihood of revival in steel prices in January-February 2019 due to rebound in restocking demand, ahead of the Chinese new year holidays.

Bloomberg Intelligence is bullish on the long-term prospects of the steel sector and believes that India’s steel consumption will accelerate as the country invests in rural infrastructure and manufacturing. According to the steel ministry, the demand is set to increase at 6.5% CAGR between 2017 and 2031. Increased outlays for the railways sector, government’s affordable housing push, and rising demand in capital goods and consumer durables will further boost domestic steel industry’s growth.

Valuation of most global steel players have contracted due to a subdued economic outlook and this could impact the prices of domestic steel stocks over the short- to medium-term. However, steel stocks can prove valuable long-term bets due to the growth prospects of the domestic steel sector.

Let us look at the four major Indian steel companies. Of the 99 recommendations by Bloomberg analysts on these stocks, 64% are buy, 17% are hold and 19% are sell.


Jindal Steel and Power


The company has a presence in steel, power, mining and infrastructure sectors. According to SBICap Securities, robust domestic steel outlook, ramp-up of steel business and depreciating rupee will help sustain its margins and profitability going forward. 

The brokerage believes that the company is on a sustainable path towards deleveraging and is a re-rating candidate. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company’s 2018-19 revenue and net profit growth, y-o-y, will be 40.5% and 88.7%, respectively.


Tata Steel


Tata steel’s operations range from mining to manufacturing and marketing of finished steel products. Bloomberg Intelligence believes that its revenue will keep growing due to robust domestic demand—it accounted for more than 50% of the company’s revenue in the first half of 2018-19. 

According to JP Morgan, Tata Steel is wellpositioned to generate profit, given its raw material security and exposure to value-added business segments. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, it’s net profit will grow 52.2%, y-o-y, in 2018-19.


SAIL


This is a government-owned steel manufacturing company and enjoys Maharatna status. Brokerage house JP Morgan is concerned about wage renegotiations in the company that may hurt its profitability. 

The brokerage believes that SAIL offers an attractive volume story in the tight steel market, but will wait for margin to rise and cash flows to translate into lower debt. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company will deliver revenue growth of 23.2%, y-o-y, in 2018-19.


JSW Steel
 
The company produces value-added and high-grade steel products and exports them to more than 100 countries. According to a report by JM Financial, sustained steel realisation, moderation in raw material price and lower conversion cost compared to peers augurs well for the company’s earnings trajectory. 

Recent acquisitions and planned capex over the next three years will also aid growth. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the company’s net profit will grow 29.4%, y-oy, in 2018-19.

33,2019-01-08,JSW,"Mumbai: Ratings agency CARE Ratings has assigned AA rating to JSW Steel with a 'stable' outlook owing to continuous improvement in the financial and operational performance of the company in FY18 and first half of 2018, supported by favourable demand-supply scenario as well as increased international and domestic steel price. 

The rating also takes into account the company's recent successful acquisition of stressed steel maker Monnet Ispat and Energy as part of a consortium with Aion Investments as well as its acquisition of Italian steelmaker Aferpi, JSW Steel said in a notification to the stock exchange on Tuesday. 

""The above acquisitions derive comfort from JSWSL’s significant presence in the Indian steel industry, strong track record of the management in project execution and cost management expertise,"" said a note by CARE ratings. 

""The rating also derive strength from JSWSL’s wide product offering with focus on enriching product mix, gradual increase in captive raw material integration partially reducing supply risk, cost optimisation through backward integration and hedging mechanism in place mitigating foreign exchange risk to a large extent,"" the note added. 

The rating is however ""tempered by financial leverage (overall gearing) albeit improved significantly during FY18, susceptibility of profit margins to volatility in input costs due to lack of availability of captive sources of raw materials and higher dependencies on imports as well as presence in the inherently cyclical steel industry"".

It is also constrained by the company's continuing debt-funded capacity expansion plans which are expected to be completed by 2020. 

JSW Steel is spending Rs 44,376 crore in the next three years to increase capacity at its Dolvi plant by 5 MT by 2020. It is also adding 6 MT to its Vijayanagar facility, taking the total capacity there to 18 MT besides adding 3.2 MT of downstream facilities to increase the share of value-added products in its portfolio."

42,2019-01-14,JSW,"India's crude steel production fell by 1.4 per cent to 8.936 million tonnes (MT) in December 2018, according to official data.

The country had produced 9.067 MT crude steel in December 2017.

""Crude steel production stood at 8.936 MT in December 2018, down by 1.4 per cent over December 2017 and was down by 0.3 per cent over November 2018."" the Joint Plant Committee (JPC) said in its latest report.

During April-December, state-run SAIL, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, Tata Steel, Essar Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power together produced 47.462 MT, the report said, adding that the rest 31.522 MT came from other producers.

In December 2018, hot metal output stood at 6.158 MT, 2.6 per cent higher over 6.001 MT in the same month in 2017, the JPC said.

The country's pig iron production fell by 5.5 per cent to 0.530 MT in December 2018 from 0.561 MT in December 2017.

India has set an ambitious target of increasing its capacity to 300 MT by 2030-31.

The JPC, under the Ministry of Steel, is the only institution in the country that collects data on the iron and steel industry."
38,2019-01-14,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel, which came from behind to surge ahead of the Tatas in the race for Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) with an offer of Rs 19,700 crore, is unlikely to face competition in its bid to acquire the stressed asset with the Tatas unwilling to raise their original offer.

“We will stay with our original bid. It is our stated position,” said a spokesperson for Tata Steel.

Tatas have, however, legally contested the lenders’ decision to allow JSW Steel to alter parameters of its bid. In the process, JSW Steel got to improve its bid twice after the Tatas were declared the highest bidder.

On December 20, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) reserved its order on BPSL and directed both JSW Steel and Tata Steel to file written submissions.

Tata Steel had put in an offer of Rs 17,000 crore for BPSL, which made them the highest bidder in the initial round when JSW had bid Rs 11,000 crore.

The third bidder for BPSL was Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty group with ?18,500 crore but after the deadline. However, Liberty group is not pursuing the BPSL bid aggressively.

Subsequently, JSW Steel revised its bid to Rs 19,700 crore, pipping the two other bidders with its offer receiving lenders’ approval by a two-thirds vote.



Sanjay Singal-led BPSL had piled up debt of over Rs 47,000 crore from a consortium of banks led by Punjab National Bank, before it was admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for initiation of insolvency resolution process. It is one of the 12 large companies identified by the Reserve Bank of India for early resolution. It operates a 3.5-million tonne steel plant in Odisha.

Singal has also challenged the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in general and Section 29A in particular, which bars defaulting promoters from bidding for stressed assets. Singhal had contented that excluding the promoter from bidding for his own asset converts BPSL’s resolution process into a discount sale.

Tatas have bid for stressed steel assets aggressively as part of a renewed focus on the domestic steel market where they have announced plans to achieve 30 million tonne installed capacity by 2025.

Last year, under the NCLT, Tatas acquired stressed steel asset Bhushan Steel for Rs 35,200 crore. Plans are afoot to raise its capacity at a later stage. Tata Steel has also embarked on a five million tonne expansion of their new greenfield unit at Kalinganagar, Odisha, at an investment of Rs 23,500 crore.

Outside the NCLT, Tata Steel recently did a Rs 4,525-crore deal to acquire Usha Martin’s steel unit near Jamshedpur. Steel being a cyclical industry, experts feel at this stage Tatas would prefer to be prudent and focus first on consolidating their new acquisition before further exposure."
45,2019-01-15,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel is unlikely to bid for Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metaliks as its chances of securing Bhushan Power and Steel get stronger, three people aware of the development said.

JSW Steel had put in an expression of interest (EoI) in October for the twin stressed assets that together owe Rs 5,400 crore to lenders. However, ET had reported Monday that JSW Steel will not be facing competition from Tata Steel for its Rs 19,700 crore offer for Bhushan Power and Steel with Tata Steel unwilling to revise its bid. With its position cemented further, it may not bid for the firms that would have added to its downstream capacities.

“JSW Steel is not interested in the assets anymore,” said a person close to the company. Another person aware of the resolution process of the two companies said the company has stopped ""actively pursuing"" the asset after putting in an EoI.

Its reluctance to bid for the assets that would have otherwise aligned with its strategy of augmenting downstream and value added steelmaking also stems from the recent correction in steel prices that fell to a one year low in December. This might have discouraged the company to stretch its balance sheet too much at a time when the upcycle that the steel industry witnessed last year seems to have changed course, said a person aware of the resolution process at the stressed steel companies.



The bid deadline for the assets has been extended to January 21.

“The largest reason for them to walk away could be the enhanced possibility of getting BPSL,"" said Ritesh Shah, lead analyst for materials at Investec. To be sure, Shah said, it is unclear by how much will it stretch its balance sheet as JSW Steel could be possibly employing a 'joint control model' to acquire BPSL, that is going to insulate the company from the short-term risks involved in turning around a stressed asset. JSW Steel has been categorical about not exceeding its net debt to EBITDA ratio beyond 3.75x.

Shah also said that from hereon, steel prices will move up, however, the ascent will be gradual and not dramatic."

Nifty forms Bullish Belt Hold
The index negated its lower highs of last three trading sessions, suggesting further upside in the offing. “Technically speaking, the ‘Bullish Diamond’ pattern has now been activated and therefore, we expect the fresh leg of the rally to commence now. Unless there is some unfavorable development from the global markets, we expect the Nifty to head towards 10,970.

A 10-year term will help him do a lot more things which he couldn’t achieve in the first term,” Jindal said.

In the second term, Jindal believes a Modi-led government could pursue some unfinished tasks, such as disinvestments. “I don’t know if there is any country in the world that has got such a big public sector play other than China. Narendra Modi is one person who believes that the government has no business to be in business. I have nothing against the public sector, but it lacks accountability. There are problems with decision-making. These, and other factors, erode the value of the public sector,” he said.

The 59-year-old, however, doesn’t see a hung Parliament emerging out of the national elections, likely to be held by May. “If all the opposition parties are coming together, they will somehow manage (to pull off forming a government), but how long will that government last will be the question. A ‘khichdi sarkar’ (coalition government) would be a disaster for the country. There should be one national party in the lead — it could be the BJP or Congress,” Jindal said. “But whether the Congress will lead the opposition pack is a question.” Jindal’s younger brother, Naveen Jindal, is a former member of Parliament from Congress.

According to the industrialist, political uncertainty could put a pause on overseas investments. But he does not foresee Indian businessmen deferring their plans. Jindal, who harbours a childhood passion for cars, is moving ahead with expansion plans for his steel and energy businesses and is also looking to enter new areas like paints, electric cars and home solutions (steel doors and windows). A part of his expansion goals will be met through acquisition of stressed assets such as Bhushan Power & Steel and a few thermal energy units. 

Though Jindal has made the highest offer of Rs 19,700 crore for Bhushan Power, the deal is in litigation. If — and by the time — Jindal closes this transaction, it will be an expensive one for the industrialist, who is known to be very value-conscious. This is because steel prices are already heading downhill. Being straight forward is a trait Jindal said he acquired from his father, the late O P Jindal. After starting from what he acquired from his father, Jindal made good strides in building his own business empire. It was only recently that JSW became the largest steel producer in India, ahead of the Tatas. On the other hand, global steel giant ArcelorMittal is yet to get a firm hold here. “In the past, ArcelorMittal was not serious about India, but now they are. It takes hard work to build a steel plant in India, but it’s not difficult. If JSW can build and Tatas can build, so can ArcelorMittal build a greenfield plant,” said Jindal, who was competing with ArcelorMittal in the bidding process for Essar Steel.

For the $13-billion JSW group, which acquired its acronym from the places its factories originated — first south and then west — steel is its biggest business, contributing as much as 77% ($10 billion) to its revenues. While business2business (B2B) will remain the foundation of the enterprise, Jindal wants to build a business2consumer (B2C) model and, hence, the entry into electric vehicles, sports and decorative paints. “It’s early days. We are trying to get a feel of the (new) sectors, but our core businesses will continue to be steel and power,” said Jindal.

Jindal said that the softening of steel prices could dent the group’s fortunes, but the enterprise is ramping up efforts to cut costs. The consumer-facing ventures of the group are handled by his son, Parth, who, Jindal believes, complements him. “He (Parth) likes marketing, HR… and I’m more interested in projects and technology,” said Jindal, who is the only engineer in his family (Parth is an MBA from Harvard). 

While Jindal doesn’t see the 28-year-old Parth occupying the corner office any time soon, he said the group’s various businesses will be spearheaded by professionals (Sebi rule mandates a split in the position of chairman and MD by April 1, 2020). Jindal holds the CMD position in the group’s listed entities — JSW Steel and JSW Energy.

With the enterprise expanding its portfolio in an environment that is changing, Jindal — a fitness enthusiast — wants the group to be “mobile” and “evolving” as there are “no comfort positions”. “Every organisation should take challenges as opportunities and not get worried about how the world is changing,” said Jindal. The approach is much like his life’s mantra — to be active and not sit quiet."

52,2019-01-18,JSW,"Promoters have spoken. 

The December quarter may have turned wild for stocks, but the promoters of over 150 NSE companies -- barring PSU banks -- went for the kill and raised their stake, Ace Equity data showed.

Such behaviour typically sends out a positive message that they see value in their companies at the current level. Chances are the firm may witness some positive development. At times, the move is intended to ward off any hostile acquisition. 

Over 50 per cent companies on the list where promoters upped their holdings saw a correction through the quarter. 

Companies like Arvind, Veto Swtichgears & Cables, Mcleod Russel India, and JSW Steel slipped 20-70 per cent during October-December whereas Sequent Scientific, Talwalkar Better Value Fitness, Indowind Energy, Shakti Pumps and Premier Explosives jumped over 30 per cent during the same period.

Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), Goldiam International, Lakshmi Electrical Control Systems and Jubilant Industries recorded a substantial rise in promoters’ holding. 

Infrastructure developer HCC in December raised Rs 497.6 crore through a rights issue. Promoters increased their holdings in HCC to 33.12 per cent, from 27.70 per cent in the September quarter. 

Likewise, promoters raised their exposure in Goldiam International, Lakshmi Electrical Systems, Jubilant Industries to 62.69 per cent, 32.13 per cent and 72.58 per cent, respectively, from 57.72 per cent, 27.87 per cent and 68.45 per cent, respectively. 

Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty slid around 1 per cent to 36,068 and 10,862, respectively, during the last quarter of 2018.

Veerhealth Care, Rane Engine Valve, Zodiac Clothing Company, Inox Leisure, Ruchira Papers, Housing Development and Infrastructure, Kohinoor Foods, Trident, BKM Industries, Bodal Chemicals, Alankit, Music Broadcast and Jasch Industries stood among others in which promoter holding went up by 150-400 basis points.

GAIL (India), IndusInd Bank and JSW Steel were among Nifty50 companies where promoter stake rose during the quarter. Data available till January 16 were considered for the article.

In the auto ancillary space, promoters of Rane Engine Valve, Autoline Industries and Rane (Madras) raised stake in Q3. 

Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBI Cap Securities in an interaction with ETNow said, “Certain auto ancillaries can deliver better results as we go forward partly due to their own expansion plans. You have to look at auto ancillaries which are able to better the share of business through wider product offerings and more capacities coming in. So, there are a few opportunities in the ancillary space.”

In the chemicals space, Bodal Chemicals, Oriental Carbon & Chemicals and Premer Explosives too saw promoter holdings go up during the quarter in question. 

As for pharmaceutical, promoters hiked stakes in Biocon and Alembic to 70.27 per cent and 64.01 per cent, respectively, from 69.22 per cent and 63.54 per cent, respectively.

Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice-President and Head of Research, Centrum Broking said, “A lot of smart money is staying away from pharma because nothing specifically is happening even though there was anticipation about the pharma cycle bottoming out and there may be a chance of uptick in overall pharma and new additions. But that definitely did not happen.

“Smart money is staying away and after the deep corrections in October, November in the Indian markets, there are many opportunities available now which were highly expensive in the beginning of the year 2018,” he said in an interaction with ETNow.

Energy Development Company, NLC India and Indowind Energy also witnessed a rise in promoter holdings in the power space. 

Among others, Apollo Tyres, Century Plyboards, Cox & Kings, SP Apparels, Arvind, Navneet Education, Cosmo Films and Jyothy Laboratories also registered a rise promoter holdings during the quarter. 

Textile firm Arvind recently announced the launch of its green-field garmenting facility in Ranchi, which was set up with an investment of Rs 300 crore."

57,2019-01-22,JSW,"If high quality product complying with our BI standards, are being imported, it is tolerable but it is low quality stuff that is being sold in India at lower prices, Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director and Group CFO, JSW Steel, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Talking about steel prices, November December were tough months and even to a certain extent, in January also, this fall continues. Do you think that in India the compression of sorts that we are seeing in spreads is relatively a little less compared to what we are seeing globally?
When the international steel prices went as high as $620 per ton, the Indian steel prices were at a discount of close to Rs 3,000 to 3,500 per ton. In India, we were selling at lower prices than the landed cost of imports because rupee depreciated suddenly. So, when $620 dropped by close to $100 per ton, domestic prices got adjusted. But the Rs 3,500 margin was already there.

That is why if somebody today compares the domestic price fall vis-à-vis international price fall, you may say there is further fall but it is not because of the discount which was there initially. If we adjust that discount and then see the current prices, they are almost equal to the landed cost of imports today.


Despite the very interesting mathematics that you mentioned, we are still seeing that influx coming by way of imports. Is this cheaper steel from Vietnam, Korea and China, being rerouted away from US shores into India? Is that the case what we are looking at on account of Section 232 tariffs?
That is exactly what has happened because aluminium zinc coated coils from Vietnam went up by 425%. It cannot go up so much from one country. If it is a high quality product complying with our BI standards, it is tolerable but it is low quality stuff that is being sold in India at lower prices. In India, it is particularly routing of Chinese steel through Vietnam. 

At the same time, even imports of coated coils from Japan, Korean and China almost doubled while that from Vietnam went up four times. Therefore something is happening. There are 53 products where BI standards are applicable in India but who is monitoring them? Who is ensuring the quality of whatever imports are coming into India when domestic industry is complying with that, it may not be a very effective surveillance to ensure that only high quality steel, compliant with BIS, come into India.That is why we are getting worried. 

At the same time, 98-99% of the total requirement of auto steel, can be met by domestic steel producers in terms of quality, timeliness and competitiveness and there is no need for import of auto steel at all."
58,2019-01-22,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Losses in metal, bank and auto heavyweights amid weak global cues made domestic equity benchmarks snap five-session winning streak on Tuesday.

The market traded in the negative zone throughout the day, as gloom in global markets extended to the domestic bourses.

Emerging stocks and currencies slid, as fears of slowing global growth spooked investors and made them move towards safe haven assets.

Optimism stemming from third quarter earnings faded and market reacted to the global sentiment due to the absence of fresh decisive triggers back home.

Sensex closed with a cut of 134 points, or 0.37 per cent, at 36,444.64, while Nifty settled 39 points, or 0.36 per cent, lower at 10,922.75.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 0.09 per cent and 0.49 per cent, respectively.


We walk you through the highlights of Tuesday's session:

Who dragged my SensexHDFC twins, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Larsen & Toubro emerged as the top drag on Sensex. However, the pack of losers was led by Vedanta, down 3.50 per cent. It was followed by Tata Steel (down 3.13 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (down 3.08 per cent), HCl Tech (down 2.18 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 2 per cent).


Metals meltThe BSE Metal pack suffered a loss of 2.31 per cent, emerging as the top sectoral loser, on fall in shares of Jindal Steel (down 4.53 per cent), Vedanta (down 3.50 per cent), Tata Steel (down 3.13 per cent), Hindustan Zinc (down 2.76 per cent), JSW Steel (down 2.46 per cent), SAIL (down 2.23 per cent) and Hindalco (down 1.88 per cent). As per Reuters, base metals prices dropped across global markets with benchmark London copper extending a sharp drop from the previous session, after economic growth in top metals consumer China slowed to its weakest in 28 years.


Sun shines againNotching up gains for a second straight day, India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharma closed 4.95 per cent up at Rs 418.05 after the company clarified that it neither gave any loan nor guarantees to Suraksha Realty.


A dull Q3 showAsian Paints on Tuesday posted 14.60 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit at Rs 635.60 crore for the quarter ended December 31. Consolidated revenue of the company increased 24 per cent to Rs 5,293.99 crore in Q3FY19 over Rs 4,267.49 crore in Q3FY18. But the numbers failed to excite the market as the stock closed the day with a loss of 0.99 per cent at Rs 1,406.55 on the BSE.


In fast laneShares of TVS Motor closed 2.94 per cent up at Rs 553.85 after it reported a 15.57 per cent increase in standalone net profit at Rs 178.39 crore for the third quarter. Revenue from operations was at Rs 4,663.98 crore, up 26.09 per cent against Rs 3,698.67 crore on a yearly basis.


A volatile rideAfter surging almost 20 per cent in early trade, shares of Prabhat Dairy nosedived and closed the session with a loss of 14.29 per cent at Rs 79.75 on the BSE. The stock came off even as its Rs 1,700-crore stake sale deal was much bigger in value than the company’s total market capitalisation of around Rs 900 crore.


Ashok Leyland declinesShares of Ashok Leyland closed 2.92 per cent down at Rs 88 after global brokerage firm CLSA maintained ‘Sell’ rating on the stock and also cut the target price to Rs 75 (Rs 85 earlier). India’s truck industry is currently in the fifth year of an up-cycle where historical upturns in the last four decades have lasted four years on average, said CLSA. The foreign brokerage expects competition to intensify in a downturn given Ashok’s improved ability to fight against Tata and the latter’s high focus on regaining its lost market share. 


Kotak firms up post Q3 nosShares of Kotak Mahindra Bank closed 1.92 per cent higher at Rs 1,291.60 as leading brokerages maintained their bullish stance on Kotak Mahindra Bank after the lender posted a 23 per cent rise in profit at Rs 1,291 crore for December quarter on higher net interest income.


Shining brightShares of Havells India jumped 4.95 per cent to Rs 711.40 even as the company reported a nominal rise of 0.67 per cent in standalone profit at Rs 195.67 crore. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 194.36 crore during the October-December quarter of the previous fiscal. Total income during the quarter under review stood at Rs 2,551.4 crore as against Rs 1,993.53 crore in the year-ago period.


151 stocks signal potential fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 151 counters on the BSE, indicating that these stocks may drop or extend their fall in coming sessions. Among the stocks with bearish crossovers were Prabhat Dairy, Praj Industries, Hindalco, ONGC, HDFC, 8K Miles Software and Grasim Industries.

On the other hand, 46 stocks, including TVS Motor, Havells India, Petronet LNG, Dabur India and Shalimar Paints, showed bullish crossovers on BSE.

54,2019-01-22,JSW,"More than two years after a new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was passed by parliament, bankers and lawyers are worried about a marked slowdown in proceedings as expectations of an adherence to the 270-day timeline have been dashed.

However, all participants of the code are also unanimous in their view that the new law has improved credit discipline among large borrowers. 

The IBC really took off after June 2017 when the RBI directed banks to drag to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) 12 large borrower accounts which owed 25% of the Rs 8 lakh crore dues to creditors. Of these 12 accounts, only five have met resolutions so far, namely, Vedanta buying Electrosteel Steels, Aion-JSW Steel winning Monnet Ispat bid, Tata Steel bagging Bhushan Steel while Lanco Infra is headed for liquidation.

“The delays are there but the more important thing is that IBC has begun to change creditor behaviour. Payment discipline has improved because the regulator has imposed zero tolerance. The fact that we have IBC and owners can lose complete control of their company is beginning to change behaviour which is fantastic because even though it is delayed or uncertain creditors have the ability to enforce their rights and borrowers recognise that they cannot take creditors for granted,” said Jaideep Khanna, CEO Asia Pacific at Barclays. 
 Lawyers practising the code say a big reason for the delays is because NCLT infrastructure has not kept pace with the huge backlog of cases.

“Admission process alone takes 3 months to one year while law mandate to admit the application with 15 days. Similarly, some NCLT’s take more than a month to pass order on application filed to replace resolution professional and excludes this time from the resolution period. Overall the entire period of 180+90 days is now being extended for several months,” said K P Sreejith, Managing Partner IndiaLaw LLP.

To be sure, the government has moved to improved infrastructure by expanding benches. However, the fact that the NCLT has to also deal with other corporate matters means the courts are overburdened.




Lawyers fear that the delays starting from just admission of cases could make this new law impotent like the debt recovery tribunal before this.

“All professionals including bankers have adjusted to the uniqueness and speed of the code, however, NCLTs after the initial agility have slowed down considerably which is not auguring well for success of the Code. If physical infrastructure is not improved and timelines are not adhered, it should not become another DRT,” Sapan Gupta, national head banking and finance practice at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

Sreejith from IndiaLaw also points to the delay in notifying provisions for bankruptcy of individuals particularly guarantors to corporate borrowers because of which lenders are unable to take any actions under IBC against individual guarantors who are mainly promoters of the borrower firms."

Asian stocks edged down on Wednesday on mounting signs of slowing global growth and anxiety over a yet-unresolved Sino-US trade dispute, Reuters reported.

Investors chose to restrict their bets ahead of December quarter earnings of ITC, Bharti Infratel and InterGlobe Aviation, with a hope that their numbers will give a direction to market. 

The rupee's rise, however, gave some support to sentiment and restricted the fall of market. 

The rupee on Wednesday opened 34 paise higher at 71.10 against the US dollar on account of some selling in American currency by banks and exporters.

59,2019-01-23,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW chairman Sajjan Jindal’s remarks in Davos that he’s still interested in Essar Steel and that Ruias should be given a chance evoked a strong riposte from ArcelorMittal, the highest bidder for the assets under the insolvency law. 

This sends a negative signal about the “certainty of India as an investment destination”, ArcelorMittal said, without naming Jindal.

“... Ruias should get a chance. It is their company and if they are paying 100% of the money, then why not?” Jindal said. “The process is not over till it is over,” he told BloombergQuint on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

“I’m a little biased in my view as we still have some interest in Essar Steel, but it will be very difficult for any judiciary or banking system to overlook Rs 12,000 crore...,” Jindal said, pointing to the fact that the Ruias’ offer for Essar Steel lenders exceeds that of ArcelorMittal by Rs 12,000 crore.

JSW Steel had bid for the 10-MT Essar Steel along with Numetal, when the asset was thrown open for the second round of bidding. The company had earlier stayed away as it was concentrating on Bhushan Steel, which was eventually acquired by Tata Steel. 

“It appears there are certain parties in India who would like that the IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code) not be implemented according to the law,” a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said. “The IBC was introduced for a very serious reason — to address a major problem with bad loans,” the spokesperson said. 

“In the case of Essar Steel, opportunities have been provided to bidders for nearly a year to first, be eligible and second, to make a compelling offer. 
ArcelorMittal has followed the process from the start. We fully expect the process to continue to be implemented correctly and as per the law and that statements attempting to convince otherwise not be given any credibility,” the spokesperson said.

ArcelorMittal has offered Rs 42,000 crore to the lenders of Essar Steel that owes Rs 49,000 crore. It will also infuse Rs 8,000 crore as capital expenditure. On the other hand, the promoters, in a last-ditch attempt to retain ownership, offered Rs 54,389 crore as full payment to the lenders as well as operational creditors of Essar Steel. The matter will next be heard at NCLT Ahmedabad on January 31."
63,2019-01-24,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Key equity indices Sensex and Nifty traded flat in the opening deals on Thursday, tracking lacklustre global cues as political uncertainty in the US and worries about weakening global economic growth weighed on investor sentiment.

Asian shares were subdued this morning with major indices trading marginally lower. 

The rupee traded with a nominal gains against the US dollar which failed to give any fillip to market. The domestic unit opened 7 paise higher at 71.26 against the US dollar on account of some selling in American currency by banks and exporters. 

After jumping about 70 points in the opening deals, Sensex gave up gains soon, falling over 40 points. 

Around 9:30 am, the 30-share Sensex was 31 points, or 0.09 per cent, down at 36,077.41, while Nifty was 11 points, or 0.10 per cent, down at 10,820.90. 

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were up 0.08 per cent and 0.03 per cent, respectively, at that time.

Tata Motors, Infosys, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra and Coal India were among the top losers in the Sensex index, each falling over 1 per cent.

ITC, on the other hand, climbed over 1 per cent and was leading the pack of Sensex gainers around that time. 

Shares of Power Grid, NTPC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp also traded with gains.

Among the sectoral indices, BSE Realty climbed over 1 per cent on gains in shares of DLF, Oberoi Realty, Sunteck Realty, Prestige Estates Projects and Indiabulls Real Estate.

BSE Metal index, on the other hand, fell over 1 per cent, with all components in the red. Jindal Steel & Power, Coal India, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Nalco were among the top losers in the index. 

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 775.82 crore crore worth of domestic stocks on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 583.77 crore, data suggested. 

YES Bank, Biocon, Ultratech Cement, Colgate Palmolive, Reliance Power, Jindal Saw, ICRA, PVR, NIIT, Mphasis, Pfizer, Quess Corp, PNB Housing, Sintex, Zee Media and Sharda Corp are among the companies that will announce their December quarter results today."
64,2019-01-25,JSW,"MUMBAI: A consortium led by SSG Capital Management and Sharjah-based New Zone Intertrade FZE have bid for the stressed Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics, two people aware of the developments said, without disclosing the offers.

SSG Capital Management, founded by ex-Lehman Brothers executives, has bid for the twin assets together with Synergy Metals and Mining Fund and ART Special Situations Fund. They will be competing with the Sharjah-based ferrous and non-ferrous trading company that is founded by Siddharth Khatwani.

The two assets are associate companies of the Miglanis-promoted Uttam Galva Steels and together owe Rs 5,500 crore to lenders. State Bank of India had referred the companies to the National Company Law Tribunal for insolvency resolution in December 2017.

Rajiv Chakraborty of PwC is the resolution professional of both companies. An email sent to him for conformation remained unanswered till press-time Thursday.

JSW Steel and Liberty House had also put in initial expressions of interest, along with Aion Capital, Prudent ARC and Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited (Arcil), but eventually did not make any binding bids.

Uttam Value Steels (previously known as Lloyds Steels Industries) is listed on the stock exchange and has a hot-rolled production capacity of 1 MT in Wardha in Maharashtra. It buys pig iron from Uttam Galva Metallics, which is privately owned by the group."
65,2019-01-25,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court upheld the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), backing the government’s efforts to deal with the bad-debt burden of banks and rejecting challenges by the promoters of defaulting companies barred by the law from regaining control of their firms. The court said the IBC was working and had led to rising credit flows.

“We are happy to note that in the working of the code, the flow of financial resource to the commercial sector in India has increased exponentially as a result of financial debts being repaid,” said the bench comprising justices RF Nariman and Navin Sinha.

The top court commended the IBC for bolstering the recovery of bad debt, saying a “defaulters’ paradise” had been ended. Several provisions, such as preferential treatment to financial creditors over operational ones (suppliers of goods) had been questioned by the petitioners.


Impact on Big Insolvency Cases
They had also disputed the broad sweep of Section 29A, which barred not just promoters but any individual or entity “related” to them from seeking to take over the ailing entity.

Among the promoters contesting the IBC were Sanjay Singal of Bhushan Power and Steel, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and lawyer Mahesh Agarwal.

The court rejected all challenges, except to clarify that the related entities should have been connected with the business of the promoter to be barred from bidding. Defaulters who repay debt within a year of them being classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) can submit resolution plans for assets as can promoters if they clear debt with interest.

“The provisions of Section 29A are intended to ensure that, among others, persons responsible for insolvency of the corporate debtor do not participate in the resolution process,” said the bench. “Parliament rectified a loophole… which allowed a backdoor entry to erstwhile managements in the resolution process. Section 30 of IBC, as amended, also clarifies that a resolution plan of a person who is ineligible under Section 29A will not be considered by the committee of creditors (CoC).”

The judgment was a victory for the government and other stakeholders, said lawyer Dhaval Vussonji of Dhaval Vussonji and Associates. “The court has rightly held that it is a very stable, very good piece of legislation and upheld it in the manner enacted by the government to hasten insolvency resolution,” he said.

The verdict will have an impact on the biggest insolvency cases, such as that of Essar Steel. Following ArcelorMittal’s highest bid for the company, the Essar Group’s Ruia family has sought to regain control by pledging to repay all that is owed. JSW Steel has pledged to support Essar.

Essar Steel declined to comment, saying its lawyers were studying the judgment. However, a source close to developments suggested that the verdict was a favourable one.

“The court has said the CoC has to consider our offer. If they do not do so, the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) or NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) can look into the offer. This is a positive development for us. Based on that contention we have already made an application at the NCLT, the judgment on which is awaited by January 31,” the person said. “The other point pertains to Section 12A, the period within which one can apply to withdraw the company from the IBC process. The rule came into force in June 2018 and we applied in October 2018. The court has maintained it is a valid application.”

ArcelorMittal and JSW Steel declined to comment, stating they are still studying the order.

The top court made minor tweaks to the law. It directed the government to set up NCLAT circuit benches across India within six months and also gave effect to another judgment that mandated all such tribunals would be under the law ministry rather than the corporate affairs ministry as they are now. The top court said that it would refrain from interfering in economic policy and lean in favour of the presumption that the law was constitutional.

Attorney general KK Venugopal had urged the court not to interfere with the 2016 law, citing executive privilege to take economic policy decisions. The bench agreed, saying the legislature should be allowed leeway because it had to deal with complex problems that don’t have easy solutions, especially with regard to economic matters. Moreover, in the context of the changed economic scenario, the expertise of people dealing with the subject should not be lightly interfered with, it said.

The court noted that previous attempts to address the issue had failed. After the code became operational, about 3,300 cases have been disposed of by the adjudicating authority based on out-of-court settlements between debtors and creditors involving claims amounting to over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, the court said. Eighty cases have since been resolved by resolution plans being accepted. Of these, the liquidation value of 63 is Rs 29,788.07 crore. However, the amount realised from the resolution process is in the region of Rs 60,000 crore, over 202% of the liquidation value, it said, citing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

As a result, credit given by banks and financial institutions to the commercial sector (other than food) has risen from Rs 4,952.24 crore in FY17 to Rs 9,161.09 crore in FY18 and to Rs 13,195.20 crore in the first six months of FY19, it said. Credit flow from non-banks was Rs 4,718 crore for the first six months of FY19 compared with Rs 6,819.93 crore in FY17.

Ultimately, the total flow of resources to the commercial sector in India, both bank and non-bank, and domestic and foreign (relatable to the non-food sector), has gone up from a total of Rs 14,530.47 crore in FY17 to Rs 18,469.25 crore in FY18 and to Rs 18,798.20 crore in the first six months of FY19. These figures show that the IBC is largely successful, it said.

66,2019-01-25,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Disappointing December quarter earnings of Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, weighed in on market sentiment, causing the benchmark indices to settle in the negative territory on Friday.

The market traded steady all through the first half of the session, but took a plunge after Maruti came out with a set of numbers that fell below expectations. 

A wave of selling emerged across sectors, led by auto, media, realty and bank stocks, which erased all the gains of the morning session and made Sensex and Nifty close in the red. 

Positive mood of most emerging markets failed to lift the mood. A 170 points, or 0.47 per cent, fall dragged Sensex to 36,025 at close. Nifty lost 69 points, or 0.64 per cent, to settle at 10,780.

Midcaps and smallcaps suffered most as their sectoral indices plunged up to 1.58 per cent.


Let us walk you through the highlights of the day’s proceedings:

Maruti's misery continuesThe automaker maintained negative trend in quarterly earnings. A 17.21 per cent drop in third quarter profit marked the second consecutive quarter of negative growth. On the back of a 10 per cent YoY slippage in September quarter profit, December quarter numbers turned out to be worse; and worst ever since March quarter of 2014. Maruti reported 35.46 per cent quarterly de-growth in profit after tax. The scrip closed 8.11 per cent down at Rs 6,469 on NSE.


Zee logs worst-ever fallShares of Zee Entertainment tanked 30.92 per cent to Rs 229 on NSE, logging their worst-ever fall. Company's subsidiary Dish TV tanked 37.41 per cent to Rs 21. Both stocks crumbled after reports that a link has emerged between Essel Group and a company being probed for suspect deposits during the demonetisation drive. “Dreamline Manpower Solutions, a company being probed by the SFIO, carried out transactions involving a few Essel entities in 2016-17 and is also at the heart of a legal spat between Videocon and Essel,"" the report said. However, Zee told BSE it was not aware of any such probe.


Indian Bank plunges as Q3 profit halvesIndian Bank's third quarter profit halved to Rs 152.26 crore on account of rising provisions for bad loans. The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 303.06 crore in the corresponding October-December period of the previous financial year. The stock closed 7.23 per cent down at Rs 237.45 on NSE. 


Pfizer rises on Q3 numbersShares of Pfizer jumped 3.53 per cent to Rs 2,777, a day after it reported a 51.24 per cent rise in profit at Rs 131.94 crore for the quarter ended December 2018 against Rs 87.24 crore reported for the previous quarter ended December 2017. 


YES Bank extends gainsShares of YES Bank closed 2.11 per cent higher at Rs 219, extending the gains into the third consecutive session. The company has named Ravneet Singh Gill as the new MD and CEO to succeed Rana Kapoor, whose term ends on January 31. After a subdued set of December quarter numbers, global brokerage firm CLSA has maintained a ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 280. It added that clarity on new strategy and management churn is to be watched. 


DLF plunges 10% after CBI raidsShares of realty major DLF cracked 10.27 per cent to Rs 159.50 after CBI carried out searches at 20 locations in Delhi-NCR, including its offices, in connection with alleged irregularities in land allocation in Gurgaon in 2009. A PTI report said CBI has registered a new case against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda over glaring irregularities in acquisition of 1,417 acres land by the then Haryana government in Gurgaon in 2009. 


L&T falls 1% ahead of Q3 numbersShares of Engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro closed 0.56 per cent down at Rs 1,288 on Friday ahead of its third-quarter numbers. Post market hours, the company posted a 37.02 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in Q3 profit at Rs 2,041 crore over Rs 1,489.98 crore in Q3FY18. The numbers came as better-than-expected as analysts in an ET Now poll had estimated a profit of Rs 1,860 crore. 


110 stocks signal potential fallAdani Power, Punj Lloyd, JSW Steel, Zee Media Corp, United Breweries and Greaves Cotton were among 110 stocks that showed bearish crossovers on BSE, as per the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. Meanwhile, 35 stocks, including Vedanta, InterGlobe Aviation, BPCL, Kaveri Seed Company, Oberoi Realty and Pfizer, showed bullish crossovers on BSE.


Nifty Media top sectoral loserThe media index suffered a 16.37 per cent loss, owing to deep cuts in shares of Dish TV India, Zee Entertainment and Zee Media Corporation. Out of 15 components on the index, 11 closed the day with losses, 3 logged gains and 1 remained unchanged.


IT pack lone sectoral gainerThe IT index closed as the lone sectoral gainer on NSE. The index closed with a nominal gain of 0.45 per cent, backed by rise in shares of HCL Tech (up 3.02 per cent), TCS (up 0.94 per cent), Wipro (up 0.70 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (up 0.45 per cent)."

74,2019-01-30,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Energy’s consolidated net profit trebled in the third quarter, driven by better realisation on electricity sold both on the short-term market and through power-purchase agreements.

The Sajjan Jindal-led power producer posted a profit of Rs 146 crore in the quarter through December, compared with Rs 47 crore a year earlier. Consolidated revenue rose 20% to Rs 2,492 crore.

The company posted a comprehensive loss, a loss due to non-operational items, of Rs 330 crore for the quarter, against a Rs 189 crore profit a year earlier, as it took a mark-to-market loss of Rs 524 crore due to a decline in the value of shares it holds in group company JSW Steel.

“This kind of power demand growth, we have seen after a long time and it has also reflected in the higher plant load factor (PLF) for the industry; the thermal PLF for the industry has gone up 2% year-on-year,” chief executive Prashant Jain told reporters.

For JSW Energy, PLF of operational capacities improved to 60% from 58%.

The company is also upbeat on its acquisition plans and a proposed entry into electric vehicles.

“We expect more deals to happen for resolution of stressed assets in the next 12 months than in the last 12 months. The time has come when consolidation has to happen and we are keen to participate,” Jain, also the company’s joint managing director, said.

“Given the size of our balance sheet, we have a huge appetite for acquisitions but it does not mean we will only invest in that. We also have plans for electric vehicles,” Jain said.

He said the company would likely announce details of its products and plant for the electric vehicle business in the ongoing quarter. But the plan has undergone some changes so as to focus only on passenger vehicles, dropping that to look at commercial vehicles, battery storage and charging infrastructure. However, the initial planned investment of Rs 6,500 crore remains unchanged.

“We are not commenting on the earlier target of 2020 for electric vehicles; we may still be able to launch it by then. But we expect three-four years of time for the investments to be rolled out,” Jain said."
72,2019-01-30,JSW,"If investors on Dalal Street are jittery about share pledges, they have good reasons to be so. India Inc promoters had shares worth Rs 2.50 lakh crore pledged with their lenders at the end of December quarter.

That works out to about 2 per cent of total market capitalisation of BSE500 stocks at current market prices and was higher from Rs 2.40 lakh crore worth of share pledges recorded as of December 31, 2017.

Among Nifty50 companies, promoters of Zee Entertainment had pledged 59.40 per cent of their holdings as of December 2018. It was followed by Adani Ports (45.50 per cent), JSW Steel (43.60 per cent), IndusInd Bank (26.40 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (12.70 per cent) and Asian Paints (11.90 per cent). 



Zee Entertainment, JSW Steel, Sun Pharmaceutical and YES Bank saw promoters increase share pledge levels between September and December quarters.

Zee Entertainment last week hogged limelight after lenders sold some of the pledged shares. 

An elevated level of shares pledging is not considered good as a downturn in market can lead to invocation of such shares, leading to oversupply and severe correction in stock prices, while in extreme cases, it can even trigger a change in a company’s shareholding pattern.

Promoters of 50 BSE500 companies had pledged over 25 per cent of their holdings by the end of December quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed. At the top, promoters of CG Power & Industrial Solutions had pledged 100 per cent of their holdings, whereas those of Sterlite Technologies and Gayatri Projects had pledged over 90 per cent of holdings. 

For a lay investor, share pledging does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is in financial distress. Banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoters’ shares to advance loans.

Among other companies, whose promoters have pledged more than 80 per cent of holdings with their lenders were Jindal Stainless (Hisar), Jindal Stainless, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Power, GMR Infrastructure, Dish TV India and Max Financial Services. 

In the case of Coffee Day Enterprises, Suzlon Energy, Max India, Apollo Hospitals, Reliance Capital and Bajaj Consumer, promoters have pledged between 70-80 per cent of their holdings. 

In a bull market, share pledging may not be that important a factor for investors to consider. But when market sentiment turns risk off, it does. A high level of share pledging is undesirable and may signal a situation of distress. A decline in the level of share pledging may suggests a drop in stress. 

Among BSE500 companies, Eveready Industries, Indiabulls Real Estate, Coffee Day Enterprises, Jain Irrigation, Infibeam Avenues, and Jindal Steel and Power saw promoters increase share pledge levels by 13-45 percentage points in Q3 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.



The extent of pledging is definitely a matter of concern for an investor. Pledging in a capital-intensive company is highly risky. Promoters generally pledge for a mix of both for their personal needs as well as for reinvestment in their businesses. Pledging should always be a matter for concern. In a bull market, no one sees the level of pledging. Technically, promoters only know everything about their companies. Investors should always be wary of promoters’ share pledge levels. Temporary pledging of 10 per cent or so or for the first time is okay, but if it is a habit to pledge shares quarter after quarter, then that is definitely a warning sign, says Hitesh Agrawal, Head of Retail Research, Religare Securities.

Companies like Fortis Healthcare, Suzlon Energy and Advanced Enzyme saw a drop of over 10 percentage points in promoters’ share pledge levels during December quarter.

 “Generally, share pledging cannot be taken as a good sign. Promoters pledge shares either for their personal use or for the company’s needs. So, the objective of pledging is crucial,” said Sanjeev Jain, AVP, Ashika Stock Broking.

In some cases, banks normally ask promoters to pledge their shares as margin in case they are doubtful about the health of their businesses. “Investors need to watch the size and period of holding of such share pledges. Pledging in large volume is not a good sign. In a bad market, lenders may sell the pledged shares if the promoter does not meet the margin shortfall, which may mount pressure on stock price,” Jain said."

1,2019-02-01,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty opened on a cautious note ahead of interim Budget on Friday.

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal will present the interim Budget in the Lok Sabha today.

There are expectations that the government may announce measures to address agrarian distress along with tax sops for the middle class and the corporates.

Positive Asian peers helped Indian market stay on a steady path.

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was 81 points, or 0.22 per cent, up at 36,337.50, while Nifty was at 10,851, up 20 points or 0.19 per cent.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.50 per cent and 0.37 per cent up, respectively.

Hero MotoCorp, Bharti Airtel, HCl Tech, Bajaj Finance, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto were leading the pack of Sensex gainers.

On the other hand, Vedanta, ONGC, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among the top losers in the Sensex index.

Among the sectoral indices, BSE Metal cracked 4 per cent on losses in shares of Vedanta (down 18.35 per cent), Hindustan Zinc (down 5.97 per cent), NMDC (down 2.27 per cent) and JSW Steel (down 2.02 per cent).

Vedanta on Thursday posted a 26 per cent drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,574 crore in the third quarter ended December 31, 2018 (Q3FY19) against Rs 2,114 crore in Q3FY18, hit by lower commodity prices and disruption in its copper smelter operations at Tuticorin. 

Besides, Cairn India Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, has bought an economic interest in Anglo American Plc. from Volcano Investment (same promoter group) worth Rs 1,431 crore which is 0.7 per cent of Anglo American market capitalisation, which is a negative as per analysts.

""We believe this is negative for Vedanta as the company transfers Rs 1,431 crore cash to group company given that it has a net debt level of Rs 19,000 crore even after accounting cash and investment balance of Hindustan Zinc, which is Rs 23,333 crore, is not usable by the company. Post the transaction Cairn India Holding does not have voting right in Anglo American Plc. The voting right remains with Volcan Investments (Promoter Group) and the funds might be used to buy further voting rights in Anglo American Plc.,"" said Sameer Kalra, Founder and market research analyst at Target Investing.

BSE Auto climbed over 1 per cent, backed by gains in shares of Hero MotoCorp (up 3.28 per cent), Eicher Motors (up 1.45 per cent), Tata Motors (up 1.30 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (up 1.08 per cent)."
2,2019-02-01,JSW,"MUMBAI: Enhancing liquidity in the hands of the rural consumers as well as the middle-income earning group is likely to have a positive ripple effect on the demand for steel, Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel said, adding however that there is a mismatch in the government's assumption of GDP growth rate vis-a-vis the tax buoyancy, which could be a point of concern. 

""The three schemes (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Mega Pension Scheme and direct tax benefits) have left more than Rs 1 lakh crore in the hands of rural India and also the middle income group which will stimulate consumption and be good for the steel industry,"" Rao told ET. 

Among other announcements, finance minister Piyush Goyal announced the introduction of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, under which marginal and vulnerable farmers with cultivable land of up to 2 hectares will be given Rs 6,000 per year; a scheme that will touch about 12 crore farmers and cost the state exchequer Rs 75,000 crore. 

Another scheme that the government launched was the Pradhan Mantri Shram-Yogi Maandhan Yojana under which both organised and unorganised sector employees with monthly income of up to Rs 15,000 are entitled to a pension of Rs 3,000 per month once they retire a the age of 60. 

The above two along with direct tax benefits equaling Rs 23,200 crore that entails full tax rebate for individual tax payers with taxable income of less than Rs 5 lakh as well as the raising of standard deductions from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000, will together lead to a rise in consumption of refrigerators, air conditioners, passenger cars and tractors, fuelling the demand for steel, said Rao. 

However, he observed that the government's assumption that overall tax base growth at 13.5% while estimated GDP growth for FY20 is kept at 11.5% shows a mismatch. 

Similarly, the assumption of CGST growing at 21% while 18% in the overall GST growth rate is an aggressive assumption. 

""This inconsistency in the assumption of GDP vis-a-vis the tax buoyancy is not matching which is a point of concern. It will have to be seen whether they are able to manage to maintain the growth in the tax collections and then restrict the fiscal deficit,"" Rao said."
3,2019-02-04,JSW,"Bhushan Power & Steel’s promoter, Sanjay Singal, has unveiled a last-minute bid to save his company from going under the hammer by offering creditors a proposal to repay their entire dues of Rs 47,151 crore.

The unexpected turn of events comes a day before a judgement is expected in one of the keenly watched insolvency proceedings that began 18 months ago.

Tata Steel, JSW Steel and UK’s Liberty House are vying for the asset which initially generated tepid interest, but has since become a hotly contested one following an operational turnaround that saw capacity utilisation of 90% and sales growth over the past six quarters.

A majority of its lenders had voted in favour of JSW Steel’s offer of Rs 19,300 crore for the company in mid-October.

An appellate bankruptcy court is likely to pick the winner on Monday.


Agencies
Singhal has become the second promoter after the Ruias of Essar Steel to make such an offer post the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), considered a remedy for the ballooning bad debt problem in the banking industry.

In a formal January 29 letter to the two main creditors of the company, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, Singhal sought the withdrawal of the insolvency proceedings invoking provisions of Section 12 A of the IBC — it allows for the withdrawal of such proceedings if an expression of interest has not been issued to a prospective buyer. ET has seen a copy of the letter.

His proposal seeks conversion of Bhusan Power’s debt of Rs 47,151 crore from banks into cumulative redeemable preference shares, to be issued to the lenders which they can start redeeming from the beginning of next year.

Singhal promised payment to operational creditors over a period of three years and said claims that were disputed in courts would be cleared once they had been adjudicated upon by the courts. He also promised full payment of arrears to the government, workers and of statutory dues.

A State Bank of India spokesperson said in response to ET’s queries: “It is a policy of the bank not to comment on individual accounts and its treatment.” PNB and Singhal did not respond until press time Sunday to ET’s questions. Mahender Khandelwal, the bankruptcy court-appointed resolution professional for Bhushan Power, said “the matter is sub judice” and declined to comment further.

In his letter, Singhal cited a recent Supreme Court judgement and argued that withdrawal of proceedings was accepted in certain exceptional cases, such as of Brilliant Alloys, even after an expression of interest was issued to a prospective suitor.

He stated that the resolution process was still active as a ruling by the bankruptcy court was still awaited in a dispute between two of the bidders, Tata Steel and Liberty House. “As such, there is no delay and the present proposal under Section 12 A of the insolvency and bankruptcy code is well within time,” he wrote.

Blaming external factors such as cancellation of coal blocks by the top court in 2014 that forced the company to import coal at three times the price, dumping of steel by China and a slowdown in the domestic steel industry during 2014-2017 for the woes at the company, Singhal urged the lenders to consider his proposal claiming that it was in “public interest” and “seeks to meet the objective of maximisation of value”.

Ruias’ proposal to offer a full settlement to Essar Steel’s lenders by repaying Rs 54,000 crore, more than that offered by ArcelorMittal, was recently turned down by the bankruptcy court. The Ruias are widely expected to challenge the decision at an appellate tribunal.

In his letter accompanying the proposal, Singhal claimed that he was “one of the few industrialists who took the business risk for the nation at large … when other much-bigger business houses were disinterested in setting up the plant”, referring to his decision to build a steel factory in a backward district of Odisha 17 years ago."

6,2019-02-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Over 50 stocks on NSE look set to rally in the coming days, technical indicator MACD suggests.

This, when NSE benchmark Nifty50 is facing strong resistance near the 10,985 mark. Analysts see higher chances of the index moving towards the lower end of the 10,800-11,000 range in the coming days.

Data suggests 55 stocks have showed an upward bias on NSE, as suggested by momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The list included a few PSUs such as ONGC, NHPC and MOIL, and blue chips like Hero MotoCorp, Ambuja Cements and JSW Steel.

 The technical indicator has signalled an upward crossover, meaning a bullish signal, on these counters. This, coupled with the fact that many of the stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, is adding credibility to the emerging trend.

Data showed RBL Bank, which last week reported a 36 per cent jump in December quarter earnings, looks strong on the technical chart. Sun TV Network, which is looking to invest Rs 300 crore in Bengali and Marathi entertainment channels, also looks firm on the charts.

Just Dial, whose profits doubled in December quarter, could be gearing up for a rally in the coming days, the MACD chart showed.

VIP Industries, Kansai Nerolac Paints, Bajaj Electricals, Tata Sponge, Coromandel International and Jubilant Life Sciences are some of the companies showing a positive trend.

“Traders are advised to trade Nifty with a positive bias, but should follow strict stop losses below 10,800 level for existing long positions. A move beyond the 10,987 mark would unfold the next leg of rally. In such a scenario, a lot of recent beaten-down counters would see a sharp short covering,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking. 





The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. 

 A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 25 stocks showed bearish crossovers on the daily charts. The list included stocks like Petronet LNG, Aurobindo Pharma, Care Ratings, Satin Creditcare and Dr Lal Pathlabs.



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' call using a single valuation ratio.
Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As far as Nifty50 is concerned, only a few index stocks are pushing it higher, which is a sign of worry. 

“The overall structure suggests there is a higher probability of Nifty breaching the lower end of the range i.e. 10,800. Broader market indices, especially the smallcap benchmark, highlighted inherent weakness in the market. The psychological mark at 11,000 shall continue to keep any rise under check,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. 


UNDERSTANDING MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of ONGC showed whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has showed a upward momentum and vice versa."
5,2019-02-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI/ KOLKATA: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has turned down a plea by Tata Steel to consider its bid for bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel as the only legitimate bid for the company at a ruling on Monday.

Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya ruled that Tata’s plea was “premature” and “unmaintainable” and upheld the right of the committee of creditors to update, amend, modify or annul resolution plans with respect to conditions outlined in a process document.

The judgment is significant as it clears the air on the controversial issue of the sanctity of belated bids for bankrupt companies.

The Tatas had approached NCLAT on the grounds that UK’s Liberty House, a suitor that submitted a belated bid for Bhushan Power and Steel, should be disqualified from the bidding process because it did not adhere to the guidelines laid out in the process document.

Tata submitted its offer well within the deadline of February 8 last year for submission of financial bids for Bhushan Power and Steel, a company that was among RBI’s first list of 12 troubled accounts that were submitted for proceedings under the new bankruptcy laws.

Its offer was the highest at the time it was submitted.



The NCLAT order has come as a major shot in the arm for JSW Steel, which was the only bidder to submit a revised offer for the company in July last year. JSW Steel submitted an offer of Rs 19,300 crore at the time, beating previous offers from Liberty House and Tata Steel, both of which chose to stick to their original bids.

Sources said the BPSL resolution professional may issue a Letter of Intent (LoI) to JSW Steel within a week or a fortnight. However a lot would depend on whether the Tatas decided to appeal at the Supreme Court.

Commenting on the development, JSW Steel group CFO Seshagiri Rao said: “We would have to wait and watch and see how the CoC reacts. Even in the NCLT, after resolution plan is submitted, we have to keep our fingers crossed as to outcome of various litigations that may come.”

If JSW Steel manages to acquire BPSL successfully, it will be its first major acquisition at the NCLT-led auction for stressed steel assets. While it bagged the 1 million tonne (MT) Monnet Ispat for Rs 2,875 crore jointly with Aion Investments, BPSL with a 3.5 MT capacity, is a bigger play. It would also compensate for the setback suffered by JSW Steel when it failed to grab Bhushan Steel, losing out in the race to the Tatas who acquired it for Rs 35,200 crore.

The appellate bankruptcy court directed the resolution professional, Mahender Khandelwal, who is tasked with administering the company, to submit the best proposal to the National Company Law Tribunal for its approval.

Bhushan Power and Steel’s promoter Sanjay Singal has unveiled a surprise last minute bid for the company, ET reported on Monday, that promises to pay off the creditors entirely leading to recovery of all their dues. Singal has offered to convert the entire debt of the company into redeemable preference shares that can be redeemed from the beginning of next year."

As a result, saleable steel sales volume for the quarter stood at 3.68 million tonnes, which was lower by 7 per cent YoY,” the company told exchanges. 

The company said that global steel prices have softened during the ongoing quarter, driven by weaker demand and destocking. Chinese steel production and exports moderated during the quarter.

“Tailwinds of recent decline in crude oil prices in late 2018, moderating inflation and easing liquidity are clearly visible. However, escalating international trade tensions are headwinds to exports,” the company said."

15,2019-02-07,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel reported a decline in its December quarter net profit and the outlook for the steel industry may be clouded by rising imports and higher input costs.

Net consolidated profit suffered a decline of 9.6 per cent at Rs 1,603 crore even as standalone net profit reported a growth of 68 per cent. The acquisitions of Acero Junction in the US and Aferpi in Italy led to a surge in interest cost by 26.5 per cent. Cost of inputs also went up by 19.8 per cent, affecting net profit.

The sharp fall in exports, resulting from global trade barriers, played a role in the management’s decision to marginally lower the sales guidance. The performance at home remained resilient but exports fell to 10 per cent of sales from 30 per cent a year ago, and the volume guidance for FY19 was lowered to 15.7 MT from 16 MT.

Still, thanks to its financial discipline and low costs, JSW Steel appears better placed than local peers but the outlook for the industry remains weak, with exports declining and imports rising. Also, rising coking coal and iron ore prices could hurt the overall profitability.

In the December quarter, JSW’s production was in line but its sales volume fell to 3.6 MT, below the average of 4-4.2 MT and down 7 per cent year on-year. Globally, steel prices were down, but the company’s realisation per tonne remained flat due to long-term contracts.



Even as the third quarter enjoyed high domestic steel prices, softening of the prices starting late December have been a cause of worry for steelmakers. However, Seshagiri Rao, joint MD and group CFO of JSW Steel, said that the prices have bottomed out and will remain buoyant for at least the next six months.

“We don’t see prices falling further because of two reasons; first, internationally we are already seeing an uptick of $40 per tonne across geographies. Second, a surge in input prices will also drive selling prices up,” Rao said.

The company’s EBIDTA/tonne was resilient at Rs 12,063 against Rs 12,141 in the preceding quarter and Rs 8,994 in the previous December quarter. However, higher production and lower sales led to inventory build-up and higher working capital, resulting in an increase in debt and financing costs.

The global steel outlook remains unfavourable. Over the past year, US, Canada and Europe increased import duty on steel to 25 per cent. India has a duty of 12.5 per cent and no duty on steel coming from countries such as Japan and South Korea. As a result, industry exports are down 40 per cent and imports up 8 per cent.

The company’s net debt at the end of the quarter stood at Rs 46,000 crore and its consolidated net debt to EBITDA ratio has come down to 2.32x from 2.35x at the end of the last quarter.

28,2019-02-12,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Equity barometer Sensex extended its losing streak into the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday, shrugging off the rally in global stocks, as banking, financial, auto, IT and FMCG heavyweights suffered losses.

Globally, shares and bonds saw a renewed surge in risk appetite on Tuesday, as investors showed optimism about US-China trade talks and cheered Washington's deal to avoid another government shutdown, Reuters reported. 

Local investors kept their powder dry, awaiting IIP and retail inflation prints due later in the day. Moreover, they avoided fresh bets on Indian equities in the runup to general elections, while muted third quarter earnings have failed to boost the risk appetite.

Sensex suffered a loss of 241 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close the day at 36,153, while Nifty lost 57 points, or 0.53 per cent, to finish at 10,831.

The BSE Midcap index closed with a nominal loss of 9 points, or 0.06 per cent, at 14,108, while the BSE Smallcap index ended 58 points, or 0.43 per cent, lower at 13,392.

Hindalco's Q3 numbers fail to impressShares of Hindalco Industries closed 0.38 per cent down at Rs 198.60 on BSE after the company reported a 47 per cent YoY rise in consolidated December quarter profit at Rs 713 crore. The numbers included results for Utkal Alumina.

30,2019-02-13,JSW,"JSW Steel Tuesday went procedurally a step closer to acquiring an asset in bankruptcy-induced ownership change after the administrator overseeing the sale of Bhushan Power and Steel issued a letter of intent (LoI) in favour of India’s biggest maker of the alloy.

JSW Steel had made a Rs 19,650-crore offer, which included upfront payment of Rs 19,300 crore, with another Rs 350 crore earmarked for operational creditors, according to sources close to the development. After JSW Steel accepts the LoI, the resolution professional will submit JSW Steel’s plan to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for its approval.

“JSW has been issued the LoI. The resolution professional will file the matter before NCLT for its approval on Wednesday,"" a senior industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter told ET.

Mahender Kumar Khandelwal, the resolution professional overseeing the sale, declined to comment on the matter.

In this resolution case, JSW Steel came from behind and bettered its initial bid to trump Tata Steel's Rs 17,000-crore offer. The Sanjay Singal-owned company has Rs 47,000 crore of debt. While JSW had earlier acquired the one million tonne Monnet Ispat for Rs 2,875 crore jointly with Aion Investments, Bhushan Power and Steel is bigger with a 3.5 million tonne capacity.

If JSW Steel is successful, this acquisition would also compensate for JSW Steel’s failed bid for Bhushan Steel (now renamed Tata Steel BSL), which went to the Tatas for Rs 35,200 crore.

“However, JSW Steel can hope to bag Bhushan Power and Steel only after its resolution plan is approved by the NCLT. It also has to contend with some more litigation before clinching the deal since promoter Sanjay Singal has also approached the court,” a top source said, adding that the transaction is likely to be completed by March 31.

Significantly, if JSW wins Bhushan Power and Steel, it will secure a much needed beachhead in India’s mineral-rich east, where its nearest rival Tata Steel has a strong production footprint across Odisha (Kalingangar and Tata Steel BSL and Jharkhand (Jamshedpur).

Earlier this month, the decks were cleared for JSW’s acquisition of the stressed asset when a court of appeals turned down a plea by Tata Steel to consider its bid for the bankrupt steel firm as the only legitimate offer and disregard competing, belated requests."
36,2019-02-14,JSW,"Any company that belongs to the the largecap space, the Nifty50 space, in metal and infra sectors, should be 
  
  
  generally a buy at this juncture, Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICap Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

There is an overall consensus that we perhaps may see the range-bound trend continue in market for the next couple of months or at least till the elections. Would you agree or do you feel this is momentary?
At least till the end of February, we think the market will move sideways. The good news so far has been that in February, FII flows have been pretty strong. Even with that positive news in the background, the markets have not really moved much, but going forward, at least for the next couple of weeks we should be moving sideways. Thereafter the markets move will be determined by two things – one is the US-China trade talks and the second is the sentiments around elections.


What is the sense that you are getting when it comes to the banking space? 
Now it is a secular story. It is no longer just private banks and corporate banks, PSU banks kind of theory. It has become secular for the banks because overwhelmingly we are seeing that the credit growth is back into the system, number one. NPAs are going away from the system. We are in the last leg of the NPAs downturn cycle and so we should be going up from here on.

We are in a low-interest rate environment right now if you go by what the RBI is trying to tell us in terms of its change of stance, which would augur really well for the banking sector as a whole. So irrespective of whether it is PSU or private bank, whether it is a corporate or a personal bank space, most of the banks should generally do well. You have to be a little consistent in terms of what you want in your portfolio from the banking side. We have to pick the best ones without saying, but most banks would do well in this cycle now.


What would your strategy now be on Yes Bank and what are you making of the news?
As far as Yes Bank is concerned, there was a lot of things that typical fundamental analyst would not be comfortable with in terms of what is happening on the bank side. There was NPA divergence to begin with. There was uncertainty related to the management in the past and we even now do not know what is the strategy going to be as far as the bank in terms of its growth. It was very difficult for a fundamental analyst to take a view. 

But now that all these things are kind of settled, we should see a positive direction coming in for the bank. There is growth for all the banks and Yes Bank should be able to get better growth than most other banks. Having said that, valuations were very cheap after all this mayhem that we had seen. So, going into next few months, the valuations appear very attractive. It is a no-brainer as far as Yes Bank is concerned.


What would you suggest when it comes to the aviation pack? Would you be cautious or would you still go for one?
Aviation is a very volatile sector. It is not a sector that we recommend to retail investors. Only informed institutional buyers should be, if at ,all positioning themselves in these counters. You have rightly said that the fluctuations of the business -- not just in terms of revenues, but also in terms of profits -- is too large and there is marked seasonality, dependence on currency in terms of the exchange rate, on crude oil amd certain critical routes and network spread which includes rights in terms of lending slots as well as rights in terms of your parkings.

The associated other costs that you generally have particularly on the maintenance side influence the business to a large extent. It is very difficult to pin-point and forecast the business dynamics accurately. Therefore, we typically do not advice our investors to get into these stocks. Having said that, the good part about the aviation sector so far has been that at least two airlines -- IndiGo and SpiceJet -- have become profitable and are maintaining a profitability streak even in harsh trends. Jet is finding it a little difficult and is overburdened already but the restructuring should probably get it back into the black going forward.


If you are anticipating that NPA levels would start declining, what is your comfort level in metals and infra spaces? 
In the metal space, there have been a slew of M&A activities due to the IBC process itself and the stronger ones are emerging even stronger. They are able to get cheaper assets. Tata Steel is actually one that has come out stronger. JSW Steel is also coming up stronger because they are also in the forefront in terms of bidding for assets. 

On the infrastructure space, particularly on the construction side, it is becoming a little difficult because the business model has over a period of time undergone many changes. Earlier, it was over bidding or excess bidding on the BOT side, then you moved to hybrid annuity kind of model and because there is risk aversion, most of these construction companies are also now depending on EPC contracts more and more. 

The change in the business model for construction companies is something that we find very unstable at this juncture. We would not recommend any on the infrastructure side. But yes, of course, there are large companies out there. So any company that belongs to the the largecap space, the Nifty50 space, within these two sectors, should be generally a buy at this juncture."

35,2019-02-14,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Mutual funds were seen churning their portfolios in information technology, consumption and private banking sectors during the month gone by, even as they were busy buying into a couple of metals and m ining names ahead of the Interim Budget 2019.

The domestic institutional investors offloaded shares of Wipro and HCL Technologies but accumulated those of Infosys. In the banking space, they dumped shares of private lenders IndusInd Bank and YES Bank to accumulate shares of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. They also showed preference for consumer stocks such as ITC, HUL and Asian Paints over discretionary plays such as Maruti Suzuki. Farm play M&M, too, was on the radar of these funds.

In addition, fund managers showed preference for oil marketing major IOC over BPCL. Besides, they also dumped several NBFCs and telecom stocks, data suggested.

January was the third straight month when inflows into equity funds slowed down. In fact, inflows shrank 60 per cent to Rs 6,158 crore in January over the same month last year. Lack of returns in last one month and cautiousness ahead of the general elections were seen as major reasons for the slowdown in inflows.

“Churning was evident across sectors. Akin to the trend of last few months, select private banks were in demand followed by IT and consumption names. Fund houses also reduced exposure to select auto and cement names,” Edelweiss Securities said, adding that the market has entered a wait and watch period ahead of the all-important general elections.


Select private banks saw MF buyingData suggests ICICI Bank was the biggest buy, with funds buying 4.41 crore shares of the private lender during the month. On a net basis, their exposure to the counter increased by Rs 1,606 crore during the month. HDFC Bank and Axis Bank saw mutual funds buy additional shares worth Rs 1,402 crore and Rs 1,127 crore, respectively.

In his Budget speech, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal adhered to the path of fiscal prudence by projecting a marginal 10 basis points slippage in FY19 fiscal deficit to 3.4 per cent of GDP, compared with the market expectations of 3.5 per cent. The government had initially targeted a fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent for FY19.

Post last week’s money policy review, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said if one were to go to the second decimal point, fiscal deficit would be 3.37 per cent for FY19 and 3.35 per cent for FY20, which is broadly in alignment with the path of fiscal consolidation. 

This less-than-expected slippage and the recent drop in inflation persuaded RBI to cut policy rate by 25 basis points last week. Among stocks seeing brisk buying among mutual funds, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank were the top two preferred picks of CLSA.

“The recent earnings from ICICI Bank and Axis Bank give us more confidence that the NPL cycle has indeed peaked out for these two,” CLSA said in a note. IndusInd Bank and YES Bank saw selling by mutual funds.


Agencies

Tractor maker saw buying, car makers losersThe Interim Budget 2019 was special as it was the last Budget for the ruling NPA ahead of May general elections. It was expected to appease farmers and the middle class, and it did.

Ahead of the main event, MFs were seen buying shares of tractor maker M&M to the tune of Rs 171 crore. But they sold shares of Maruti Suzuki worth Rs 218 crore in January. CLSA has cut its weightages on both stocks. 

Maruti Suzuki, like other car makers, is seeing a slowdown in auto sales growth. The largest carmaker saw its December quarter profit drop 17.21 per cent to Rs 1,489 crore.


NBFC, telecom on sell radar; metals saw buyingBajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance were a few NBFCs that saw selling by MFs during the month.

Ambit Capital in a recent note said credit growth for NBFCs would decelerate to 12 per cent in FY18-21E from 18 per cent CAGR in FY14-18, with borrowing cost rising by 35-40 basis points. It, however, noted that auto and consumer financiers are better placed than housing finance companies (HFCs) and wholesale lenders.

Metals & mining stocks Hindalco, Coal India and JSW Steel saw buying interest, but selling was seen in telecom stocks Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India. 


Funds dump Wipro, HCL for InfosysMFs bought 11.65 crore shares of Infosys in January, increasing their exposure to the IT major by Rs 1,238 crore. CLSA has increased its weight for the stock in its model portfolio. Domestic funds’ exposure to Wipro fell by Rs 383 crore, and in HCL Tech by Rs 220 crore."

33,2019-02-14,JSW,"Goldman Sachs believes that it is time to buy JSW Steel again. The valuation of the stock has fallen below historical levels after correcting more than 20 per cent in the last six months, said Goldman Sachs, upgrading the stock to a ‘buy’ with a target price of Rs 315.

The stock ended down 1.56 per cent at Rs 267.55, but the target price set by Goldman Sachs would mean a potential upside of 18 per cent from current levels.

Shares of JSW Steel have fallen 21.7 per cent in the last six months, while the Sensex has fallen 9.6 per cent during the period.

Goldman believes that the stock corrected due to softening domestic steel prices and expensive valuation.

Going forward, the stock is likely to rerate due to the possibility of limited downside in domestic steel prices, the firm said.

“Current prices are at a 3 per cent discount to import parity from China vs a 4 per cent premium historically. The accident at Vale, floods in Australia are likely to push global raw material prices higher, lending support to global steel prices,” said Goldman Sachs.

“A combination of supported prices, capacity expansion and an improving iron ore landscape drive our FY21 EBITDA to 12 per cent higher than consensus,” it added.

JSW is trading at 5.9 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA and the risk-reward is skewed towards the upside, said Goldman Sachs."

44,2019-02-17,JSW,"The government will examine domestic steel companies' demand for imposing minimum import price (MIP) on the metal, an official said.

In a meeting on February 6, major steel players, including state-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and JSW Steel, requested the steel ministry to impose an MIP on all steel products, amid a surge in imports from countries such as Indonesia and rising raw material costs, which are putting pressure on margins.

The MIP is the rate below which no imports are allowed.

""The situation has to be examined carefully. The ministry will first examine then only take some action,"" a steel ministry official said when asked whether the ministry is in favour of imposing MIP on steel imports.

The official, who did not wish to be named, added: ""Everything happens after examination. If there is a requirement, we will definitely do it. If not required, we will not do. There has not been any due diligence yet.""

In the meeting, the companies requested the steel ministry to implement and enforce an MIP on all steel products as implemented in February 2016.

The players have said steel imports have increased due to trade diversion from China, Japan and South Korea. As a result, India has become a net importer of steel in 2018-19 despite being the second-largest producer of the metal in India.

In February 2016, India had imposed MIP on a number of items with a sunset clause of one year.

India has already imposed anti-dumping duties on several steel products to protect the interest of local industry from dumped imports."

54,2019-02-20,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Ending its longest losing streak in nearly eight years, equity barometer Sensex made an impressive comeback on Wednesday, as investors lapped up shares at relatively cheaper prices. 

A 404-point rally for the Sensex came on the back of across-the-board buying, mirroring a positive bias in overseas markets. Most Asian markets climbed higher on hopes of a US-China trade deal and expectations of the US Fed’s soft money policy stance.

The US dollar softened against its global peers ahead of the release of Fed’s January rate review minutes. A stronger rupee and a fall in Brent crude prices rekindled investors’ risk appetite.

Sensex closed 404 points, or 1.14 per cent, higher at 35,756, with only four stocks - Hero MotoCorp (down 0.56 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (down 0.30 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 0.16 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (down 0.08 per cent) - ending in the red.

55,2019-02-20,JSW,"New Delhi: Moody's Investors Service Wednesday said it has revised the outlook on JSW Steel to positive from stable, citing improving credit situation.

Moody's also affirmed JSW Steel's Ba2 corporate family rating (CFR) and the Ba2 rating on the company's senior unsecured notes, it said in a statement.

The corporate family ratings (CFRs) are opinions of a corporate group's ability to honour all of its financial obligations, according to Moody's.

""Moody's has changed the outlook on JSW Steel's ratings to positive from stable. It has also affirmed Ba2 CFR and the Ba2 rating on the company's senior unsecured notes,"" it said.

Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice President, said the positive outlook reflects the improving trajectory of the company's credit metrics mainly due to its competitive and efficient production costs, solid domestic demand conditions and Moody's expectation for a supportive ongoing price environment.

""The positive outlook also incorporates our expectation that the company will remain selective in any acquisitions, funding them with a prudent mix of debt and equity.

""We expect that any such acquisitions will be earnings accretive and help in rapid deleveraging, leading to at most only a temporary spike in adjusted debt/EBITDA leverage,"" said Chaubal.

JSW Steel's CFR continues to reflect the company's large scale and strong position in its key operating markets.

It also shows the company's strong product offering with a rising share of high-margin value-added products catering to key end-markets, such as automotive and domestic construction and infrastructure, Moody's said.

The CFR also reflects the inherent cyclicality of the steel industry and the steel maker's limited raw material integration, although this risk will be somewhat mitigated following the commissioning of its five iron ore mines, which once operational will meet up to 15 per cent of its total iron ore requirements, it said.

JSW Steel's use of advanced technology towards maximizing raw material efficiencies underpins its competitive conversion costs and high profitability, says Chaubal.

""JSW Steel's cost of production is among the lowest when compared with other leading Asian steel companies, and supports EBITDA and EBITA margins of 22 per cent and 26 per cent respectively.

""The company's EBITDA/tonne has consistently improved over the last year and remained above Rs 12,000, the highest level in 10 years,"" Moody's said.

JSW Steel is a leading manufacturer of a wide range of steel products in India. It has an installed capacity of 18 million tonne per annum."

63,2019-02-22,JSW,"We still believe that in the banking space, some of the corporate facing private banks will be delivering better 
  
  
  numbers in coming quarters than what they have delivered in last three, four quarters, Siddharth Sedani, Head - Vice President - Equity & Portfolio Advisory, Anand Rathi, tells ET Now. Havells and UPL are Sedani’s top midcap picks.Edited excerpts: 

What to do with aviation amidst reports that SBI and PNB are going to provide emergency funding of Rs 500 crore to Jet Airways? With crude prices spiking up to a three-month high, would you find comfort in any of the aviation names?
Aviation space is not at all meant for investments. Technical trading and short-term positional calls can always be taken but for investment purposes, it is complete a no-no because crude is a very big factor which impacts the entire space. We know that crude has come up from $50 to $65 odd today. This would be definitely hurting all these companies. 

Despite posting numbers that were a little better than what it was last quarter, Jet Airways has posted losses. I would advise investors not to get into the aviation space and look out for other sectors with a six to 12-month horizon.


How are you looking at some of the other sectors? The blanket call when it comes to the metal space seems to be that one should avoid it due to cyclicality. What is the sense that you are getting?
The dollar will be a little stronger going forward. Apart from that, crude has gone up. So global cyclicals and commodities are again coming back to the business. We believe metal will be getting a push globally. Metals always react to some of the global factors. Coming to the Indian metal industry, we understand that the government will provide support. In terms of their pricing, realisations are getting better. 

In the metal space, respite can be seen because we have seen a big correction over the last three months. If I pick and choose a particular stock in terms of our preferred bets, then I would like to pick up JSW Steel. Realisations are better, capacities have been increased, augmentation in capacities will be done in the next one year and we believe overall operational efficiencies are improving for JSW Steel. Let us not forget they have good domestic operations also where there is quite good support as far as pricing is concerned. JSW Steel can be the only preferred bet in the entire metal space.


There is news about GVK being in the race for picking up stake in the airport. What is the sense that you are getting on the infrastructure space as a whole? How should investors play this sector?Whichever government comes in power, infrastructure will remain the need of the hour for us. We would like to play infrastructure but very selectively with very selected leaders. 

Of course, these plays like GVK or GMR have their own problems in terms of debt levels, operational efficiencies and execution levels. Although they may be in race for getting awarded for new airports, overall I would still like to play with L&T, the proxy to Indian infrastructure. It is the largecap stalwart and we believe that there are a lot of good tractions in terms of their order book.

In fact, the management is quite confident about delivering in terms of revenues in coming quarters. L&T would be the only play we like in infrastructure. In fact, we have a good upside to L&T, we have around 1894 as a target price to be precise and we believe that L&T can be the mainstay story of 2019.


You are saying in your note that you have revised your estimate upwards for the earnings but we have not seen any major positive surprises in this quarterly earnings. On what basis have you revised your earnings on the upside? 
Well I will give you a very good example. Out of Nifty 50. there are around 20 companies who have beaten their estimates with a variance of 5%. If I talk about in in terms of beat as well as in terms of weakening of the estimates, I would say this quarter has been a better quarter compared to Q2.

Having said that, the BFSI banking space has really done good in this quarter compared to the last quarter. In last three quarters, it has been the non BFSI segment which have been delivering growth for Nifty 50, but this quarter it was BFSI which delivered growth. 

We still believe that in the banking space, some of the corporate facing private banks will be delivering better numbers in the coming quarters than what they have delivered in three, four quarters back.


What about the defence theme? Do you like this play?
We like this play but there are very specific stocks which we like in this play. We know Bharat Electronics and BEML but what we are looking at now are the private players which will be participating in defence. We like one of the companies -- Bharat Forge -- which has been beaten down since last two three months because of the losing streak in terms of Class A trucks in US.

The second part of the story for Bharat Forge would be defence and we still have that understanding that Bharat Forge can be the biggest player in the private sector where it can participate with the government in terms of defence is concerned. So this would be the one stock which we are looking at both ends.

The auto ancillary play is a little weak as of now but I think it will improve in a quarter or so. With an investment perspective. we like companies like Bharat Forge in the private space.


What are you making of these reports that Axis Bank maybe looking at an acquisition route to insurance right now?
Absolutely I would assume it as more of a neutral event unless and until a few names crop up and we understand that at what valuation things can happen or an acquisition can happen. At the current stage, I would be looking at Axis or ICICI to see if they sustain the kind of asset quality which they have and that slippages do not come further. 

In fact, if there is the improvement in terms of numbers or asset quality happens in the coming quarters then that confidence of corporate facing banks will be again back into the market and then they can consolidate going forward. 

However, with these news it would be really premature to comment but as and when the news or the name of the companies come up, it would be wise to comment on this. 


What is the outlook on the oil and gas space? CLSA believes that the Asian GRMs falling to a 10-year low is a worry in Q4 and oil marketing companies are possibly building a buffer ahead of elections and that we could see petrol and diesel prices remaining at near record levels. What is it that you like within this space?
Only six months ago, crude prices touched $80. Our upstream companies especially the public sector units like ONGC or Oil India were not a performer. And it is really unfortunate that despite oil being up, still they did not perform. This time also, I am a little sceptical and doubtful that these companies will be performing.

Oil has come up from $55 to $65 odd whereas the evergreen stock of all Reliance, saw the refining margins dipping. But Reliance’s other plays are chipping in well like petchem or retail or telecom for that matter. So Reliance is a different story altogether and let us not mix it up with crude oil prices. 

But for OMCs, this is a big concern for me and I would like to stay away from OMCs particularly as, they would not able to pass on the oil price hike with the elections round the corner. Maybe they have to absorb it.

So other than a three-six months’ investment, I would like to stay away from OMCs.


I am sure at Anand Rathi you guys would have a couple of stocks where you are having a conviction buy on midcaps. Name those two midcap stocks for us.
We predominantly look at midcaps. After the fall, we have seen lot of value propositions in midcaps. One of the value propositions which we are looking at is Havells. Although Havells has not corrected big time, but the kind of numbers they have been posting, are encouraging. The cable segment has been really doing good. The lighting segment has been seeing expansion in margins and in fact they have branded stores of themselves called Havells Galaxy which already have 500 stores and are planning to expand ever further. 

We believe this is a brand franchise we can bank on. These companies will be really performing well operationally. Valuations can be steep but overall perspective growth is flowing because at the end of the day, we hardly find few companies which have been really posting good earnings. So Havells is one of the plays we like in the midcaps category, with a target of Rs 788. 

In the agrochemical space, we like UPL. Margins has expanded around 2%. We have seen international revenues growing up to 24% and the recent acquisition which they have done is of a big magnitude of around $4.2 billion. As and when synergies work in next two-three quarters, this company is there to post good set of numbers. In fact, this quarter also was a good set of numbers. So, UPL also is one of the plays in the midcap category with a target of Rs 950."

The rupee, too, saw a bounce, opening 11 paise higher at 71.03 against the US dollar amid some selling of the US dollar by banks and exporters.

However, a rise in crude oil prices, which jumped near their highest since mid-November, restricted the gains in domestic stocks.

Investors are also treading cautiously ahead of the release of key macro data prints, including GDP and infrastructure output numbers.

Technical analysts see stock-specific opportunities in the market. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Gajendra Prabu, technical analyst, HDFC Securities
M&M | Buy | Target price: Rs 690 | Stop loss: Rs 624The stock has validated the Doji candle pattern formed on the daily charts (moved above the candle’s high), confirming the bullish reversal. The stock has been forming higher tops and bottoms in a smaller degree, which is a bullish continuation structure. Apart from this, the stock is attempting to cover the gap witnessed on February 11, 2019, between Rs 673 to Rs 678. In addition, a positive divergence has emerged on the RSI oscillator, which could give strength to the bulls. “Traders may look to buy the stock at current market price and add on dips up to Rs 630 level for an upside target of Rs 690. Place a stop loss at Rs 624 on a closing basis,” Prabu said.


Reliance Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,322 | Stop loss: Rs 1,190This stock has completed a Three Wave decline from Rs 1,264 to Rs 1,211, which is major Wave D with internal strong irregular Wave B. It is now in the process of forming a Wave E, which could ideally make a new lifetime high above Rs 1,321, which is slightly above the previous lifetime high. At the end of internal Wave C (Rs 1,211), a Morning Star candle pattern has emerged, which is a bullish reversal sign. The stock has been maintaining higher tops and bottoms. In addition, it is trading above all key moving averages, such as 21, 50 and 200-day EMAs. “Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price and add on dips to Rs 1,215 for the upside target of Rs 1,322. Place a stop loss at Rs 1,190 on the closing basis,” Prabu said.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher
Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,950 | Stop loss: Rs 2,560The stock has witnessed a decent erosion recently from the peak of Rs 2,960 and bottomed out at around Rs 2,580 level to make a double bottom formation pattern on the daily chart. The formation of a positive bullish candle has made the chart look very attractive and has improved the bias. ""With the RSI showing a trend reversal from the oversold zone, the stock has given a buy signal and with good volume participation, we recommend a buy rating on this stock for an upside target of Rs 2,950, keeping a stop loss of 2,560,"" said Parekh.


JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 330 | Stop loss: Rs 260This stock has eroded much of its gain in the past four to five months from the peak of Rs 427 and recently showed signs of bottoming out around Rs 255 level. A bounceback has made the chart look promising for further upward movement. The RSI has slowly started rising to maintain a positive bias. “With consistent volume activity seen, we recommend a buy rating on the stock for an upside target of Rs 330, keeping a stop loss at Rs 260,” Parekh said.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager, technical analysis, YES Securities
Maruti Suzuki India | Buy | Target price: Rs 7,215-7,350 | Stop loss: Rs 6,700On the daily chart, Maruti Suzuki India has turned north after taking support at the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level, which is placed at Rs 6,700. Further, a sustained trade above Rs 6,950 will extend the rise to Rs 7,215-7,350 levels. The RSI has turned upward after taking support at the lower end of the bull zone i.e. 48- level, and has formed a positive reversal on the daily chart, suggesting bullishness on the counter.


Dabur India | Buy | Target price: Rs 460- 477 | Stop loss: Rs 418On the daily chart, Dabur India has turned upward after taking support at the lower end of the channel pattern, indicating higher levels in the coming sessions. It has turned upward above its previous support low of Rs 417, affirming strength in the stock. Moreover, the RSI has turned upward from the 40-level after forming a positive reversal, indicating bullishness.


Pfizer | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,150-3,250 | Stop loss: Rs 2,900On the daily chart, Pfizer is on the verge of a breakout from a bullish flag pattern neckline placed at Rs 3,030. A sustained trade above Rs 3,030 with healthy volumes would trigger a bullish breakout, taking the stock higher to the levels of Rs 3,150-3,250. On the weekly chart, it has broken out from a sideways consolidation phase, confirming the bullishness. Moreover, RSI has turned higher from the 50-level indicating that bulls are in control of the stock.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Ashok Leyland | Buy | Target price: Rs 89 | Stop loss: Rs 77
The stock registered a reversal formation a couple of days back on relatively much higher volumes. After a big single-day upward move, the stock has undergone correction and consolidation and formed a decent base around Rs 80 from where a pullback rally can be expected.


Exide Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 227 | Stop loss: Rs 202After a decent correction from the highs of Rs 273, this counter has found buying interest around Rs 203, as for the last couple of sessions, it was stable around this level and looks on the verge of a pullback rally.

JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 308 | Stop loss: Rs 272This stock has seen a breakout from the downtrend line as well as from an inverse head and shoulders pattern.

68,2019-02-27,JSW,"MUMBAI: The outlook for the Indian steel sector is bright with key brokerages hiking target price and upgrading stocks on the back of strong demand and rising prices.

In the past few days, Morgan Stanley has upgraded the ratings of Jindal Steel to overweight from underweight and increased the target price to Rs 188 from Rs 174. It also upgraded the ratings of JSW Steel and Sail to equalweight from underweight and increased the target price of JSW Steel to Rs 296 from Rs 278 and Sail from Rs 53 to Rs 54. Goldman Sachs also upgraded the ratings of JSW Steel to buy from neutral with a target price of Rs 315.

Analysts increasingly feel that large steel stocks currently trading at marginal discounts to long term average EV/EBITDA could be best bets. “Indian steel industry on the cusp of a multi-year run,” said Chetan Phalke, CIO – Alpha Invesco. “It’s a time to take a contrarian bet due to strong domestic steel prices, rising capacity utilizations, de-leveraging of the balance sheets and governments anti-dumping duties till 2022”.

Jindal Steel & Power, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Sail have underperformed the Sensex between 15 per cent and 50 per cent in the past one year. These stocks now trade between 5 and 6 times FY 2019 estimated EV/EBITDA as against the historical average of 7x.



Demand has been strong in India but production has been affected by sluggish exports. Rating agency ICRA said recently that Indian steel demand will grow at over 7 per cent while World Steel Association last year upped its 2019 India growth forecasts to 7.3 per cent from 6 per cent.

Steel prices have firmed up on the back of these government measures and firm domestic demand while international prices too have recovered. Monthly production growth has accelerated in the last two months after a long stagnation.

The favorable risk-reward scenario has prompted the upgrades, analysts said.

“Demand recovery from recent lows and price rises led by global steel prices and domestic demand should support earnings growth for Indian steel companies and drive stock performance,” said Ashish Jain, equity analyst, Morgan Stanley India. “Stock valuations too are supportive, with large steel stocks now at marginal discounts to longterm average EV/EBITDA and a modest premium on price-to-book of 20 per cent now versus 50 per cent three months ago”.

Domestic demand grew 7.5 per cent in December 2018 quarter and while it moderated in January 2019. Analysts expect demand recovery on the back of industrial capex and some pick up in consumption demand. The industry has raised steel prices by 4 per cent or Rs 1,500 per tonne in the past month. With Indian steel prices now at a marginal discount to the import parity price vs an 8 per cent premium in Nov-18, price risk is skewed to the upside, according to analysts.

“We expect divergent near and medium term steel price trajectory in CY 2019 with an expected near term upswing led by higher iron-ore prices due to Vale disruption, restocking in China and strengthening CNY/US$,” said Abhishek Poddar, analyst, Kotak Securities."
69,2019-02-28,JSW,"Kolkata: A 30% surge in global iron ore prices to $90 a tonne this month following disruption in supply at top producer Vale’s mines in Brazil, is expected to benefit Indian miners, according to industry analysts.

With steel demand estimated to grow at a robust rate of 5.5-6.5%, domestic miners are poised to maintain strong prices through the first half of 2019, a recent Crisil Research report said.

India Ratings & Research (Ind-Ra) also said revocation of the licence at the Brazilian mine would be favourable for Indian miners and steel producers in the short term.

Local miners have announced price hikes of Rs 600-700 per tonne for 62% Fe fines and Rs 800-900 per tonne for pellets in February. “We foresee domestic iron ore prices rising 3-4% during calendar year 2019. This would have a direct bearing on 62% of the steel production that is based on supply from merchant (non-captive) miners,” said Prasad Koparkar, senior director of CRISIL Research.

“With domestic steel prices expected to soften following global cues, there would be pressure on margins of steel makers, especially long steel producers, who do not have captive iron ore supply impacting their gross spreads by 2-4%,” he added.



Ind-Ra said it expects ore prices to firm up since imports would now be expensive and importers in India might source the raw material from domestic miners, leading to a demand-supply mismatch. It added the rise in ore prices could put pressure on the margins of steel players like JSW Steel, Jindal Steel & Power and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam that do not have captive mines, unlike Steel Authority of India and Tata Steel.

Ratings firm ICRA, however, estimates domestic ore output to touch 211 million tonnes in the current fiscal year with an oversupply of around 25 million tonnes, thereby limiting any price hike. It added that the situation was unlikely to change materially until around March 31, 2020 when most of the merchant mining leases would expire. Crisil felt iron ore mining auctions of 80 million tonnes in April 2020 will slow the price tempo from Q4FY20 as merchant miners maximise output before the deadline.

While India’s iron ore imports rose one-and-a-half times to about 11.8 million tonnes between April and December 2018, it is likely to be a short-term phenomenon, Crisil said, citing firm global ore prices during H1FY19 and a ramp-up in captive production by large players."

1,2019-03-02,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel has entered into a 5-year Advance Payment and Supply Agreement (APSA) with Duferco International Trading Holding (DITH) for a consideration of 700 million dollars in a move that will help the steel company in funding its growth plans, the company announced on Friday.

JSW Steel will be required to provide ""committed exports of steel products"" to the Swiss steel trader DITH for the said period that will assure the latter of a ""captive supply of various steel products from JSW"". 

This arrangement between the two parties makes it the largest trade finance deal to have been arranged in the Indian steel sector and is inked at a time when JSW Steel has emerged as the winning bidder for the stressed steel company Bhushan Power and Steel for which it has reportedly offered Rs 19,650 crore. 

“The structured long-term trade finance transaction is an important deal in diversifying the sources of financing for JSW Steel,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel said in a release. 

""This not only enables JSW to raise funds at competitive rates but also assures incremental volume of sales in export markets leveraging the wide spread global network of the DITH Group Companies. This transaction is a win-win for both the organisations,"" Rao added. 

The deal has been arranged and financed by global banks like BNP Paribas, Citibank, Credit Suisse, ING, Mashreqbank, Natixis, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered Bank acting as Mandated Lead Arrangers and bookrunners. 

""...(the deal) corroborates our faith in the sustainability of steel trading and indeed is a material statement of confidence in the reliability of our partner JSW. We look forward to facilitating JSW’s existing and future steel exports to a diverse and multinational customer base,"" Matthew De Morgan, chief executive at DITH Group said. 

DITH Group is an independent trader and a major distributor and processor of steel products and associated raw materials. JSW Steel and Duferco had earlier had a prepayment deal in 2006 for $150 million for a period of seven years."

5,2019-03-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Weak global sentiment extended to the Indian equity market as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty opened in the negative territory on Tuesday in the absence of any major domestic trigger.

Renewed concerns over slowing global growth as China cut its economic growth target and signs of a slowdown in the US economy weighed on investor sentiment even as the ongoing US-Cina trade talks are yet to bear any fruit.

Asian shares stepped back on Tuesday, weighed by US growth concerns and as China cut its economic expansion target amid growing challenges from rising debt and a dispute over trade and technology with the United States, Reuters reported.

However, a fall in crude oil prices and rupee's tepid gain against the US dollar capped the losses for the market.

The rupee was trading 6 paise higher at 70.85 against the US dollar due to some selling in American currency by banks and exporters.

Sensex fell over 130 points in early deals but pared most losses and traded 42 points, or 0.12 per cent, down at 36,021.60 around 9:30 am. The Nifty index was 11 points, or 0.10 per cent, down at 10,852 at that time.

Meanwhile, midcaps and smallcaps outpaced Sensex, rising 1 per cent each.

Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Coal India and Hero MotoCorp were leading among the Sensex gainers. On the flip side, Larsen & Toubro, Bharti Airtel, Mahindra & Mahindra, HDFC and Bajaj Finance were among the top losers. Among the 31 stocks (including Tata Motors DVR) in the Nifty kitty, 15 were in the green and 16 were in the red. 

BSE Metal index jumped over 1 per cent, leading the pack of sectoral gainers. All components of the index were trading with gains. Nalco, SAIL, Jindal Steel, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and NMDC climbed between 1 per cent to 4 per cent.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 198.38 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 117.05 crore, data suggested. 

Meanwhile, MSCI India’s weight in the MSCI Emerging Market index is likely to fall 20 basis points by end of November this year to 8.2 per cent, assuming a 50 per cent inclusion factor for China A- Shares, said Goldman Sachs. 

“This could lead to potential outflows of $3.8 billion (active + passive) from MSCI EM tracking funds,” said Goldman Sachs in a note, retaining 'market weight' stance on Indian equities."

13,2019-03-06,JSW,"Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO, YES Securities, believes that there will be a derating of most of NBFCs by rating agencies and analysts. He laid bare the preference for corporate finance banks such as ICICI and Axis. He spoke to ETNow. 


Edited excerpts:


Within large caps, would you say it is going to be more a broad based move or again the move is going to be narrow, the six-seven stocks are performing?

So, we have chosen sectors. Let me not say sectors, it is stocks that we like in this space. We continue to like the corporate finance ones, which are your ICICI and Axis, and the preference is given to Axis because of the focus towards growth rather than sustenance that ICICI is trying. they are basically trying to maintain and not falter too much whereas Axis has decided to put growth path on their radar. 

Then you have L&T as a pick in the same space, thanks to also the infra spending that has happened and the fact that their businesses are more broad based and their credit cycles have become shorter. It is a more lucrative business. They have cut margins, but they have made sure the cycles are shorter which is core of the business that they have functioned with. Lastly, in the space that is there, it is a momentum move that has continued in the steel sector and so we are bullish on JSW Steel in that space. 

We have stuck to the largecaps, but specific ones. I do not think it is sector wise that we have gone ahead with. There is only one midcap that we have in our pick at this point of time and that is Birla Corp and that too because of the fact that they are central India focussed and they have a lot of infra projects that have come in out there. That is more or less the basket we have gone ahead with.



Let us take a look also in terms of what we are seeing in the IT pack and a lot of strength that seems to be building out there. What is your take on that in terms of the potential going forward, whether or not it is a defensive play or there is genuinely scope here to see more room for growth as well?

In the IT sector, you have two picks that we have when we continue to have over the last quarter or so, which has given results for most of our clients. It remains TCS in the large cap space that we have taken and Persistent in the midcap space, both because of the futuristic move they have made towards products. Because that is where the margins are going to lie, that is where demand lies, that is where you are going to make sure the differentiation between you and the next player. 

You stick to these sectors because of the simple fact that it is not a three-month or a six-month view. This is a good two-year view. They have managed to transform themselves at TCS. They had hardly around 4-5 per cent of their top line coming in from their businesses which were apart from services. 

Around 23-25% of their top line now comes in from their product businesses and allied businesses, the digital business that they have talked about. So interesting stories to play out and it will continue to hold good for some more time.


I understand you are suggesting to buy corporate banks and the mess through which NBFCs have gone. The one beneficiary pocket of this mess has been corporate banks because that is where more lending would start because NBFCs are dealing through their problems. Going through your note, you are saying liquidity issues in NBFCs will get better now. I understand you have hands-on experience of functioning of NBFCs. Just for our viewers, please explain what is happening in the NBFC space at this point when it comes to liquidity and also if you feel that liquidity pressure is going to ease. Which are those NBFCs and let us not get into consumer NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv of the world? Which are the NBFCs which would capitalise on this liquidity enhancement which would happen in the near future?


What clients need to understand is that the last two quarters have gone by post around September when the crisis actually started off. Most of the NBFCs were lending for a long term, but they had been borrowing for short term because they get cheaper rates to borrow either from a bank or a mutual fund or by CPs that they had issued or by way of NCDs. 

So you have a six-year book, 10-year book based on whether it is a housing loan that you have given or whether it is a car loan or some other short term loan. 

So how do you start lending again, how do you build a book, how do you comeback into growth, those are the concerns that NBFCs have which will continue over the next one odd quarter. By the time the situation will ease off, there is no default and there will be confidence which will come back into the money markets and there will be lending which will start again to this sector. 

It is a crucial segment, it is practically around 30-35 per cent of the retail lending space which is catered to by these players. So it is a crucial area, it needs to be watched. 

Actually one of the NBFCs we have is CanFin Homes. It is a pure retail lending play in the NBFC space. It is among the very few that we have chosen apart from obviously the large ones like HDFC Ltd. because of the pedigree and the way they have been able to manage raising funds and deploying it also.

Does the move so far and especially the kind of broader market recovery that we have seen of late, does it look deceiving and do you think it is going to falter soon or is it looking a little bit more convincing this time?

So the good portion is that it has given a lot of relief to a lot of HNIs which have been beaten black and blue as far as midcaps and smallcaps are concerned. There is a lot of relief on that side. But it is a little too premature. 

There are still events that are supposed to flow out in the next quarter or so, which includes the elections, liquidity push and as far as NBFC is concerned, they have still not seen an end to it and lastly the pickup of economy which is the last portion of it. In this, elections seems to be moving towards a consensus and that will firm up the moment your election season is over. 

As far as liquidity is concerned, the NBFCs that we have spoken to have managed to tide over the short-term crisis. Now the growth will happen, but there will be a derating of most of NBFCs by the rating agencies and analysts. So you will have some pain there. My belief is that you are in the top end of the spectrum as far as valuations are concerned. 

You will again see a range between 10,400 and 11,100-11,200. In that range, your markets will ease off and it will start picking up from the bottom post the Q1 getting over anywhere. It is around that period that we will expect the markets to start taking off and you should build up a portfolio for the long term in the midcap space. The next quarter is a largecap space that I will stick to because midcaps have run up way ahead of their fundamentals at this point."
12,2019-03-06,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Shares of state-owned steel producer SAIL surged 15 per cent in the past three trading sessions, given its 15-year low valuations and captive iron ore mines, with investors becoming bullish about the prospects of the primary infrastructure alloy.

International steel prices have risen 15 per cent since January on the back of a surge in global iron ore prices. Spot iron ore prices have climbed 30 per cent after Vale, the world’s largest iron ore producer, shut its Brazilian mines due to a dam collapse, causing supply disruption. Analysts are assuming a near 45 MT net production loss in 2019, which could keep iron prices rather high.

SAIL, which owns 100 per cent captive iron ore, is not affected by the rise in raw material prices. While the situation is turning favourable, the stock is near 15-year low on valuations despite improving operational performance. EBITDA per tonne for SAIL in December was Rs 7,965, the highest in last eight years. At the current price of Rs 54, the stock is trading at 0.5 times price to book. This has put the stock on the radar of many traders.



The reason for higher per tonne EBITDA is control on high wage costs. Employee expense has been coming down consistently since FY15 – down by over 10 per cent from FY15 to FY18. Employee cost to sales in FY18 was down to 15.5 per cent from 25 per cent in FY16. In the first nine months of FY19, it was 13.5 per cent. Analysts expect lower employee costs to sustain.

Also, over the last few years, SAIL has disappointed on the capex growth – delay in setting up blast furnaces and rolling mills. However, the company addressed this issue with the completion of a Rs 70,000-crore capex and is producing 16 MT annually.

Still, several industry experts believe that products of its peers could be superior, constraining potential realisations at SAIL. Its first nine month sales fell by 14 per cent as compared to other companies such as JSW Steel, which saw only a 7 per cent drop in volumes. Analysts expect a 10 per cent jump in volumes for SAIL in FY20, and that could be at risk. Also, in that case, debt to EBIDTA could touch as high as 4. The company has net debt of about Rs 44,000 crore.

The rise in sales in the December quarter was due to higher average realisations (steel prices started falling only after October). For the December quarter, its sales increased by 3.3 per cent to Rs 15,836 crore. EBIDTA grew by 79 per cent to Rs 2,526 crore.

Macros turning in favour of the company could take the stock price higher, something traders would cheer. But long-term investors should do a detailed analysis before buying at the current market price."
16,2019-03-08,JSW,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Friday directed the Delhi bench of the NCLT to decide over JSW Steel's bid for the debt-ridden Bhushan Power & Steel by March 31. A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya has also directed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to hear the representatives of operational creditors, promoters along with dissenting banks also. 

""We expect adjudicating authority (NCLT) to decide the case at an early date to ensure that the matter is decided before the end of this financial year,"" the appellate tribunal said.

During the proceedings, Bhushan Power promoter Sanjay Singal through his counsel offered to settle all dues of the lenders. 

On this, the appellate tribunal has directed NCLT to also take a decision over Singal's offer to settle. 

""Liberty is given to adjudicating authority to decide who should be heard as representative of operational creditors or promoters or dissenting financial creditors, if any,"" it said. 

Earlier, on February 4 the NCLAT had dismissed the plea of Tata Steel and upheld lenders' decision to approve resolution plan of JSW Steel for Bhushan Power & Steel. 

Tata Steel had challenged an NCLT order that had allowed the CoC of Bhushan Power and Steel to the resolution plan submitted by Liberty House Group. Tata Steel had contended that NCLT cannot provide numerous opportunities at the belated stage. 

The NCLAT had said the Committee of Creditors' (CoC) decision was well within its rights to negotiate better terms with resolution applicants. 

JSW Steel had revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore and later to over Rs 19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at Rs 17,000 crore after it had refused to revised its bid."
15,2019-03-08,JSW,"IT pack is now showing good strength with growth ranging from 3% to 6% on constant currency growth quarter on quarter, said 
Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts: 


Would the prospects of Arvind Fashion interest you?
There are quite a few good brands available in that segment. But enterprise value and EV to EBITDA as the profit margin for FY19, if we consider the full year, is not much and on the top line basis, it is hardly 6% as a bottom line in comparison with any of the listed companies. There are very few companies in a similar sector, similar category or the industry sector. 

We believe it would not be prudent enough to comment right now and on an enterprise value basis, it is quite expensive if we consider what the opening price would be. But then also, on the EV to EBITDA basis and debt to EBITDA basis, it is quite expensive. We believe one should wait and watch rather than jumping into the bandwagon right now on the listing day.


We were just looking at the prospects for Tata Motors and again this seems to be a bit of cagey situation. Just when Chandra was talking about strategy for Tata Motors and prioritising JLR, the fact that ECB has pegged down its own and global growth forecast does not spell good news for JLR?
We also believe that earlier Tata Motors had a concern with the US and now it is a concern with Europe vis-a-vis Brexit and China post the US-China trade war problems, So, that is now a dampener. The Tata Motors sales numbers which came out yesterday show 4-4.5% decline on the wholesale side. The way they have projected the third quarterly numbers and when there is a one-time write off of Rs 26,000-27,000 crore and the visibility for JLR is not so promising on the global front right now will create a hurdle for the company though the domestic scenario has improved a bit. But remember, 85% of the balance sheet is from the global side. 

We believe that at Rs 190-195 odd, it leaves very limited room for upside unless and until we see good growth over next two-three quarters and post it may we revisit but at Rs 190-200, it seems that it will be fairly priced considering the balance situation or positions right now.


How will the currency factor play out for IT sector? Nasscom’s projections are coming in. How will all of this news impact the IT sector and which are your bets?
The IT pack is now showing good strength with growth ranging from 3% to 6% on constant currency growth quarter on quarter. The numbers which have delivered in the third quarter as well shows strong momentum with multi-million deal wins by even Infosys.

Even TCS and Tech Mahindra seem to have a very stable kind of earnings growth and probably the EPS growth would be in the range of 10% to 12%. Cost rationalisation and digitisation will give a strong push to this business vertical. We believe all these are companies where top pick would remain Infosys. 

All these companies are cash rich and they are doing buybacks and that is additional advantage for investors so that gives a strong confidence for the investors on the growth story as well as the investment rational. We believe Infosys would be the top pick in largecap category and in mid to largecap category, Tech Mahindra would be the best bet.


How are you reading into the block deals that we are anticipating. We were talking about ICICI Pru and how with the promoters are looking to sell stake in this one. Reports indicate that the Azim Premji Trust is looking to sell nearly 26 million shares. What is your take on both of these stories?
On the first part, in Wipro, the promoters’ stake is nearly about SEBI’s preferred guidelines of 75%. They are selling it for the stake monetisation. But we believe on the business side again it is growing with 6% to 7% growth rate and a strong case of investment can be made from here. Since it has a Rs 56,000-odd-crore reserve for FY19 and FY20 would be a little more than that, the PAT is growing again by 8 to 10 percentage. 

On the block deal side, at Rs 355-360, whatever the price may be, around this level again it will be a good opportunity for investors to get into the stock. It has got ex-bonus and so it is available at Rs 255-260. But again, post ex-bonus, it is a strong case for buyback in near future. I would say that at around Rs 250-260 levels, it will be a good opportunity for investors to get into.

Secondly on ICICI Pru: ICICI Bank needs to restructure their balance sheet on the NPA numbers and to do away with these provisions. They need to sell the stake in ICICI Pru which was expected in near future which has come off recently. We believe that the third quarter results or in the first nine months of ICICI Pru, there was a dip into the market share in the overall peer category. Secondly, on private players, both the sides they have lost the market share significantly and new business premium is also slowing down to 9% to 10% level. 

We give two times embedded value and also on the higher side, it could be Rs 400 on FY21 basis. So at around Rs 300 or sub-300 would be a good opportunity to get into as an investment.


Do you believe that one would be a tad circumspect on the metal sector’s prospects given what is going on globally? It is a fairly cyclical space and there has been a bit of under performance within this pack as well?
For the metal sector, we believe growth is now plateauing and aluminium or steel demand is not growing. The capacity which has already been built globally as well as domestically. The businesses are available at a very reasonable prices right now post the correction, we believe strong projections and growth story for the domestic infrastructure and the construction businesses post in the second half or may be the early start of 2020 will drive demand. 

It seems that post the correction, it gives us strong case of investment even in Hindalco, even in JSW Steel or the Jindal Steel Power where the debt level are reasonable rather than Tata Steel. We believe this is a good strong point for investment here in metal sector from current price looking at more than one to two years kind of a horizon and not on the immediate basis."

18,2019-03-09,JSW,"Last week, the world’s largest private residential ship docked in Mumbai. Called ‘The World’, it has 165 luxury residences on board, owned by wealthy businessmen from across the world. The owners often spend a part of the year on the ship and others can book the residences during the remaining period. Only housekeeping comes free on the ship run by a Florida-based company flying the flag of The Bahamas.

Of the 165 residences, some are owned by Indian-origin businessmen. The ship travels across the world — the route decided after a vote among the residents — and offers entertainment, sports and a choice of half-a-dozen restaurants. This year, the ship made four stops in India before sailing for Oman. A businessperson, who recently attended a dinner onboard the cruise ship, says there was a palpable interest among the residents about India as a manufacturing hub, and some said they were already buying more from India than from China.


 The Nikkei Purchasing Manager’s Index that indicates the degree of confidence in the manufacturing sector also signals a revival in factory output in India. For February, the PMI was at 54.3 — a 14-month high. It has been going up for three months now.

Not only manufacturing PMI but services PMI too along with overall business confidence index have moved up in the last three months. Predictions are that the indices will go higher as the country enters poll season.

But the question is: can India’s private sector make the most of these tailwinds? And is it in a position to do so? Will this lead to fresh capital investments?

Consider the impact of a significant drop in GDP growth rate. Economic growth for the current financial year touched a six-quarter low of 6.6% in the September-December period, dropping from 8.2% in April-June and 7.1% in July-September.

Ajit Ranade, chief economist at the Aditya Birla Group, told ET Magazine that he is seeing signs of revival of the capital expenditure cycle of companies in India but there are some drags such as a slowdown in China. Businessmen are adept at making the most of a chequered field but only if their businesses are fighting fit. Many marquee names of India Inc are in no shape to start big investments.




Rise & Fall with TidesA crackdown by the Reserve Bank of India on loan defaulters has virtually changed the face of India Inc.

Consider Essar steel, Reliance Communications, Electrosteel Steels, Bhushan Steel and Jaypee Group. All are facing action at the National Company Law Tribunal. ArcelorMittal is also set to take over Essar Steel. Or take Jet Airways, the one-time leader in Indian aviation which is now unable to manage its debt burden of `8,000 crore and contemplating a change in management. Around 23 of its aircraft — nearly a fifth of its fleet — have been grounded by lessors. Or consider Vedanta and its problems with its copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu and its iron ore mining operations in Goa.


 The Chinese slowdown Ranade points to, for instance, may open up opportunities for Indian companies, it is also creating its own share of problems. Some Indian businesses were running on the back of the Chinese boom too.

Tata Motors’ scrip price rose and has now slipped as the performance of JLR, its subsidiary that accounts for the bulk of the automaker’s valuation, has slackened. In market capitalisation, Tata Motors tops the list of the Nifty companies with the biggest drops in the last two years.

R Gopalakrishnan, a former director of Tata Sons and author of several management books since retirement, says the problems of India Inc began with a period of hubris and misjudgment, where meaningless league tables of the ‘richest’ and the ‘biggest’ were bandied about.

“When the tides rose, every ship rose,” says Gopalakrishnan, recalling a 2012 speech by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where he called for the release of “animal spirits” in business. “If you are on the dance floor, you have to keep tapping your feet. But suddenly, the music stopped and the carpet too was pulled out,” says Gopalakrishnan.


 Industrialist Harsh Goenka calls the decade-ago period as one of “adventurism” and says the action following implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is the best thing to have happened to India’s economy. “No promoter thought he would lose his company and many also created hurdles in the process.” Goenka says he expected capacity utilisation in India’s manufacturing sector to hit 85% by this time. (It is around 75% now, according RBI data). He also says businesses are forced to make capital investments when capacity utilisation touches 85% and expects that time to come by the end of this year.


Domino EffectTo make matters worse, the banking and financial sector saw a series of debacles in 2018. It began with the Letter of Credit scam at Punjab National Bank involving jeweller Nirav Modi followed by a default on debt payments by IL&FS, an infrastructure sector-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC), and ending with a housing finance meltdown towards. This year, Chanda Kochhar was sacked as CEO of ICICI Bank over allegations of misdemeanour.

The IL&FS default brought the country’s entire shadowbanking sector to its knees after other NBFCs faced a bank credit squeeze. As a result, short-term lending by NBFCs and mutual funds to companies whose promoters pledged their shares as security against borrowing came under the scanner. The selling of pledged shares by lenders led to a crash in scrip prices of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) as well as companies of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. To induce stability and bring back confidence in the management Subhash Chandra, promoter of ZEEL, and the Wadhawans, promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, promised to induct strategic equity partners in their companies. There are few business groups in the country today that are ready to invest, except probably Gautam Adani-led Adani Enterprises, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.


 Kolkata-based SREI Group, promoted by brothers Hemant and Sunil Kanoria, had to bear the brunt of the IL&FS crisis. The scrip of SREI Infrastructure tanked in the aftermath of the crisis and the group had to abandon its plan to list its equipment finance subsidiary.

“There is no long-term funding available for infrastructure projects or for other greenfield projects. Going forward, banks will not be in a position to indulge in term-lending,” SREI vice-chairman Sunil Kanoria told ET Magazine.

The tried-and-tested model of banks, flush with saving and current account deposits, funding large infrastructure or capacity addition by companies, has outlived its utility. There is no way to go back. Kanoria says that a new form of funding led by institutions, especially the ones in development finance, has to be developed.

It is a view echoed by Sandeep Upadhyay, MD of Centrum Infrastructure Advisory, an investment banking firm. He feels much of India’s infrastructure funding requirement will have to be catered by the likes of foreign sovereign and pension funds since they are better aligned to the sector’s riskreturn profile. “While many of these long term investment funds are evaluating buying out operational assets in India, there is limited interest to invest in greenfield projects. I guess it may take another year or two for these pension funds to cultivate interest in greenfield opportunities.”

Easy availability of credit in the last decade had led to a model where infrastructure projects were running on 75-80% debt funding. Much of the equity too was also debt money borrowed by the parent entity and infused into projects as equity, effectively increasing the debt component.

IL&FS itself was ticked off recently by accounting firm Grant Thornton that was asked to look into the lender’s books. The problem with highly leveraged financing is that there is little buffer left for miscalculations, and this is what afflicted India’s infrastructure and power sector leading to series of bankruptcies.


Not Full SteamSo if we ask: How is the mood inside India Inc and how many are raring to go and take up new opportunities, there are unlikely to be any straightforward answers.

Mining is a key area that brings in heavy investments. In an earlier interview to ET, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that while allocation of natural resources had become more transparent, his group preferred a state-by-state approach as different states acted differently and their risk profiles varied.

A senior banker, who spoke to ET Magazine on condition of anonymity, agrees about the investment cycle restarting only in the third quarter of 2019-20 after a new government is in place. He said there is a fear psychosis, but the IBC, although imperfect, has brought in a sigh of relief.

There are structural issues too that companies needs to sort out amid the Income Tax department and the Enforcement Directorate coming down hard on corporate irregularities. Recognising this problem, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has been asking its members to sign a model code of conduct and business ethics document.




“Many actions of the government have helped. The Mauritius route of bringing in your own money has been virtually plugged. It has become tougher to do shady deals,” says Piruz Khambatta, chairman of Rasna and chairman of CII’s Western Regional Council. Khambatta is someone looking ahead at the election months. Summer is near, and for soft drink maker Rasna, it is an important season.

But every industrialist ET Magazine spoke to prefers to wait out the elections, and hopes for a “stable government” before taking any major decision.

BK Goenka, chairman of Welspun Group and president of Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, feels bold decisions need time to settle down and businesses too need time to adjust to a new paradigm that excludes overleveraging. “If we get a stable government, the next five years can be golden years.”"
17,2019-03-09,JSW,"KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: The appellate bankruptcy court has directed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to pronounce an order in the Bhushan Power & Steel insolvency case by March 31.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) issued the order on Friday, responding to an appeal by the company’s creditors who expressed concern over a delay in the insolvency process. Almost 1,800 operational creditors have approached the NCLT with their grievances.

JSW Steel, which has offered an upfront payment of Rs 19,300 crore to the lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel, has the overall approval of over 90 per cent of the committee of creditors. JSW’s offer includes another Rs 350 crore earmarked for operational creditors. Following the CoC’s nod, the resolution professional had issued a letter of intent to JSW Steel on February 12. JSW’s resolution plan remains to be approved by the NCLT.

The resolution process has been delayed on account of the appeals of operational creditors and a surprise last-minute bid by Bhushan Power & Steel’s promoter Sanjay Singal, who has offered a settlement to the lenders to clear their dues.

Singal has filed the settlement offer and demanded that the NCLT hear his plea."

24,2019-03-18,JSW,"KOLKATA: The Indian Steel Association (ISA), which represents top local makers of the alloy, has urged New Delhi to take immediate steps to ban imports from Iran after a near five-fold increase in shipments that might be traced back to the Persian Gulf nation.

Imports have increased after the imposition of US sanctions on Tehran, the ISA said last week, adding that the trend may have serious implications under CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act).

Furthermore, surging imports from Iran via the UAE at ‘predatory’ prices have added to the worries of Indian steel companies, the ISA said in a letter to steel secretary Binoy Kumar.




“Steel imports, whether directly from Iran or via transhipment (through) the UAE, should be banned since this trade is in grave violation of US sanctions, which can attract retaliatory measures by the US against India,” ISA secretary general Bhaskar Chatterjee said in the letter seen by ET.

ISA members include JSW Steel, Tata Steel, JSPL, Steel Authority of India and Essar Steel.

Over the past eight years, Iran has steadily raised output while demand locally has shrunk for the tenth largest global producer of the infrastructure alloy. Surplus capacity has climbed to 12.2 mt, or 36%, even as per capita consumption has gone down by 14%. Iran exports 30% of its steel to ASEAN, posing a threat of diversion to India.

While imports from Iran into India went up 66% in 2017-18, in 2018-19 there had been nil imports until December 2018. However, imports were reportedly routed via the UAE with change in country-origin. “It is alarming to note that exports from the UAE, a net importing country, have suddenly surged 390%, including 65,000 tonnes of flat steel products, for which the UAE is conventionally a net importer. This establishes the linkage of transhipment of Iranorigin steel via the UAE,” the steel association said.

Iran’s top three steel companies, which have a 64% share of production, belong to state-owned Iranian Mining and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organisation on which US sanctions apply, ISA said."

Board meetings



Analyst calls

• Kotak Securities has recommended to buy Engineers India with a target price of Rs 153 as they believe EIL stock is trading at cheap valuation at PER 14x FY 2020 core earnings. EIL management reiterated positive outlook on the domestic order inflows driven by brownfield expansion of refineries, set up & integration of petrochemical plants with existing refineries and greenfield refinery expansion- including Maharashtra Refinery. 

 • Morgan Stanley has upgraded the rating of Kotak Mahindra Bank to overweight and raised the target price to ₹1,600 from Rs 1,365. The key factors, according to Morgan Stanley for the upgrade includes return of pricing power at private banks, partly helped by higher rates in wholesale markets and the funding crisis at NBFCs, improving credit risk situation in the corporate/SME segment. 

 • Reliance Securities has maintained its buy recommendation on ACC with a marginally revised target price of Rs 1,720. The brokerage continues to maintain their positive view on ACC owing to its deep penetration in the rural markets and consistent focus on premium products. 

• Geojit has downgraded the rating of Cadila Healthcare to hold with a revised target price of ₹358 based on 18x FY21E EPS. Highly leveraged balance sheet post Heinz India acquisition, which was funded largely through debt, remain a near term concern. 

• ICICI Securities has downgraded the ratings of Sterlite Technologies to hold and cut the target price to ₹230 per share citing pricing pressure. Some rub-off of steep correction in fibre optic cable prices in China and in other geographies may result in some downward revision of prices when they come to renegotiation, said the brokerage.

27,2019-03-19,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty opened with healthy gains on Tuesday as investor sentiment remained positive on hopes of that the US Fed will sound dovish in its policy meet.

37,2019-03-25,JSW,"One invests in the market either by buying individual stocks through a broker or by putting money in equity funds or exchange traded funds. Brokerages are now offering investors a chance to buy an entire portfolio of stocks, built around a curated theme, in one shot. Can investors benefit from this emerging alternative?Based on a platform created by Bengaluru-based Smallcase Technologies, this avenue allows investors to take exposure to professionally researched, diversified theme-based portfolios with their existing trading and demat accounts. Seven brokers are offering this platform at present, including HDFC Securities, Kotak Securities, Edelweiss, 5paisa, Axis Securities and Zerodha. The underlying securities are held in the demat account and investors have complete control as the smallcases are integrated with the trading accounts.How it worksFirst, access the smallcase platform offered by the broker. Next, choose a theme of your liking. You can see what stocks make up the portfolio and in what proportion, and the investment rationale. You can customise the smallcase, by adding or removing stocks. For instance, if you are keen to build a portfolio of companies benefiting from rural consumption, you can invest in the Rising Rural Demand smallcase, a readymade portfolio of around 15 stocks that derive a chunk of revenues or volumes from the hinterland. While some brokers offer curated smallcases, others allow investors to create their own smallcases.Once you have finalised the selection, you can buy the smallcase. The minimum amount depends on the price and weightage of individual stocks in the portfolio. The platform will place buy orders for all stocks, which will be executed immediately depending on liquidity. In case a few orders are not fulfilled owing to illiquidity or other reasons, the investor will be given the option to ‘repair’ the smallcase later, where fresh orders are placed for stocks whose orders were unfulfilled. Repairing is required to ensure the portfolio matches the original theme.Brokers charge a one-time fee of Rs 100 when you first invest in a smallcase. The transaction also attracts the usual brokerage charges. There will be no additional fees for further orders in the same smallcase, apart from cost for executing the trades.Best performing smallcase Bargain Buys gave 135% returns in the past 3 years    Company  Weight in portfolio   Birlasoft 10%   SJVN  10%   Take Solutions 10%   Meghmani Organics 10%   Gujarat State Fertilisers 10%   Gujarat Alkalies 10%   Time Technoplast 10%   MOIL  10%   National Aluminium  10%   NMDC 10% But Growth at Fair Price gave 43%, lagging behind the Nifty and average equity fund    Company  Weight in portfolio   DCM Shriram  11.11%   Insectidices India  11.11%   Navin Fluorine  11.11%   GM Breweries  11.11%   JSW Steel  11.11%   Muthoot Finance  11.11%   Parag Milk Foods  11.11%   Sonata Software  11.11%   West Coast Paper Mills 11.11% Source: Smallcase.comAll smallcases are rebalanced periodically— mostly quarterly—to ensure the portfolio only constitutes companies that remain true to the broader theme. Existing investors can rebalance the portfolio by buying the incoming names and selling the outgoing companies in one shot. The investor can also exit the entire smallcase at any time or sell individual stocks within the smallcase separately. Investors can set up a SIP in each smallcase, where they can put a fixed amount every month in the chosen portfolio after the initial investment.Should you considerWhen buying stocks directly from brokers, investors retain control on what goes into the portfolio but have to execute trades separately. Identifying good quality stocks can be tricky. Taking the mutual fund route provides convenient access to a well-researched and diversified set of stocks, but at a higher cost. It also does not allow any control on the portfolio composition. Investing through smallcase is a middle ground. Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities, says, “This gives greater control and flexibility to the investor to modify the portfolio, enhancing his ability to influence the return.”This may be a worthwhile option for investors who wish to participate in themes or ideas not adequately represented in mutual funds. For instance, some of the initial smallcases launched by this platform included GST Opportunities, Smart Cities and Affordable Housing, when participation in these themes was not afforded by mutual funds. This also provide a good starting point for first-time investors who want to pursue a long-term approach to creating wealth. Returns from smallcases have been a mixed bag

Nandkishore Purohit, Head, Digital strategy and analytics, HDFC Securities, says the facility to rebalance the portfolio at regular intervals solves a big question for direct equity investors—knowing when to sell. “By providing for timely rebalancing, the platform ensures that the investor sells stocks at the right time and enters better stocks,” he adds.However, being thematic in nature, this avenue is more suited to savvy investors who can keep track of trends and understand the underlying themes. “The focused exposure to a theme, even through a diversified basket of stocks, can backfire if it doesn’t play out as expected,” cautions Thukral.For investors who are less involved, mutual funds should remain the preferred route to equities."

Analyst calls

• Emkay Global has a sell rating on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 18,000. Royal Enfield volumes suffered a 10 per cent year-on-year decline over November 2018 and February 2019 despite the absence of negative one-off factors such as production losses due to labor strikes, said Emkay. 

• Citigroup has a neutral rating on Info Edge (India) with a target price of Rs 1,715. Info Edge reported muted EBITDA growth in the third quarter owing to elevated ad spends across recruitment, property and matrimonial businesses, said Citi. 

 • Kotak Securities has downgraded KNR Constructions to add from buy and revised target price to Rs 282 from Rs 239. The company has bagged around Rs 10 billion worth of new projects in the last one month and is on track to meet its guidance of adding Rs 20 billion of new orders in 3-6 months timeline, said Kotak Securities. 

• HSBC has initiated coverage on Aster DM Healthcare with buy rating and target price of Rs 205. Aster is among the largest healthcare providers in the Gulf Cooperation Council and India through its hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, said HSBC. The firm has estimated Aster’s GCC EBITDA to double in five years despite the current macro weakness in the region. 

• CLSA has a buy rating on Sadbhav Engineering with a target price of Rs 340. While the stock is up 45 per cent in the last one month led by risk on rally, CLSA sees more legs to the stock. One of the key catalysts is potential divestiture of 9/11 of 12 operating NHs in favour of a global strategic investor, said CLSA.

0,2019-04-02,JSW,"Mumbai: Ratings agency Standard&Poors (S&P) has revised Tata Steel's outlook from stable to positive based on the the stability of international steel prices and lower likelihood of the company acquiring Bhushan Power and Steel which will keep its credit profile strong. 

The outlook has been revised as the prospects of Tata Steel acquiring the debt-laden steel company Bhushan Power and Steel grow dimmer with JSW Steel already have gotten the letter of intent (LoI) for the asset. The agency has also affirmed its BB- long term issuer credit rating on Tata Steel and its subsidiary ABJA Investment Co. Pte as well as on the various US dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes issued by the subsidiary. 

""Continued stable outlook for Indian steel prices is likely to keep Tata Steel Ltd's earnings robust over the next 12 months,"" S&P said in a note. 

""We no longer expect Tata Steel to be able to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel. Therefore, Tata Steel's credit ratios are likely to move above our upgrade trigger in the next 12 months,"" it added in the note. 

The ""deconsolidation"" of the company's low-margin European businesses are further positives for the company's credit positioning. 

""As a result, we expect the company's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt to improve to 15%-17% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020,"" the note said. 

The agency expects Ebitda to stabilise in between Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 27,000 crore owing to benefits that the company is likely to get from stable international prices flowing through domestic prices. With demand looking robust, the company is expected to produce and sell at near peak capacity utilisation.

Steel prices have been on an upward swing owing to costlier iron ore. 

Separately, Tata Steel has also been divesting from its non-core assets as well as certain assets in Europe to allay antitrust concerns arising from its merger with thyssenkrupp. The deconsolidation of the assets is credit positive as the European assets have been a drain on the company's balance sheet. 

Tata Steel's consolidated net debt has been ballooning and has exceeded the Rs 1 lakh crore mark. Merger with thyssenkrupp will take off Rs 20,000 crore worth debt into the JV, lightning the company's balance sheet by the said amount. 

Acquisition of Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin last year had further added to the company's leverage. 

S&P said any further acquisitions will be risky for the its estimate for the company although it views the risk to be low. A fall in steel prices is another negative to look out for."

2,2019-04-03,JSW,"Kolkata | Mumbai: India Corporate response to the Supreme Court’s decision to quash the Reserve Bank’s circular on insolvency of large stressed assets has been uncharacteristically muted and mixed, though the majority reaction was one of relief.

“The circular was like a draconian sword hanging over lenders’ heads,” an official at a leading corporate group in Mumbai told ET. “Now that is gone and they will be free to decide how to recover the debt.”

The quashing of the RBI circular issued in February last year, setting deadlines for banks to initiate resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against all stressed loans of Rs 2,000 crore and more, gives corporates some breathing space, a senior official at a prominent cement company said. This is particularly crucial when the default is due to external reasons, the person said.

“You have to look for the real reason behind the default or there will be another airlines going down under,” he said. “As far as credit discipline goes, the IBC has already led to promoters getting disciplined when it comes to paying back loans.”

Seshagiri Rao, joint MD of JSW Steel, said the central bank still has the right to direct banks to take certain companies to the bankruptcy court “the way it did with its first list of 12 companies”.

JSW Steel has acquired Monnet Ispat under the IBC and is also likely to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel. Both companies had featured in the list of 12 accounts that the RBI had released.

The head of a steel company that has run its course in the IBC criticised the SC’s stance, saying it is a “non-event”.

“You cannot cut off the regulatory body’s hands with such a verdict,” the person said on condition of anonymity. “Even though this may again lead to ever-greening of loans, at the end of the day its about the balance sheet management and how well corporates are able to play with it.”"

Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained its hold rating on Coal India with a target price of Rs 243 as e-auction premium will dip given the inventory buildup in the upcoming summer months. Coal India’s shipments in FY19 surpassed the 600MT mark for the first time ever; the 4.7% YoY increase was broadly in line with our expectation, says brokerage. 

• Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on Godrej Agrovet with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹610 as the company is riding on the back of crop protection and the palm oil business. The diverse nature of of the company’s various businesses de-risks its operations, enabling it to focus on growth, optimise capital efficiency and to maintain its competitive advantage, said the brokerage. 

 • IIFL has maintained its reduce rating on United Spirits with a target price of ₹540 citing moderate sales growth in January-march 2014 quarter. Our industry checks suggest that United Spirits would witness 5% sales growth in 4Q, as the key markets of Maharashtra, Karnataka and UP face demand headwinds, said the brokerage. 

 • ICICI Securities has maintained its buy rating on Kaveri with a target price of ₹598. We note Kaveri has created strong value over the past decade and we remain positive on the medium-term growth outlook, said the brokerage. It expects the company to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 7.6% and 9.4%, respectively over FY18-FY21. 

 • Emkay has maintained its buy rating on Kajaria Ceramics with a target price of ₹628. We expect 12% volume CAGR in FY18-21E and expect OPM to improve to 16.7%/17.2% in FY20/21E vs. 15.4% in FY19E, said the brokerage. Gas prices have come down by 12% in Q4FY19, which should help in margin expansion, it added. 

 • Kotak Securities has initiated coverage on Welspun Corp with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹161, valuing stock at 4.5 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA. Given its strong manufacturing and execution capabilities, strong order backlog coupled with robust bids in the pipeline, we believe, Welspun is better placed compared to its peers, to take advantage of renewed pipe demand globally and in the domestic market, said the brokerage.

In the Nifty index, Bharti Airtel (up 1.60 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (up 1.05 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (up 0.81 per cent), Asian Paints (up 0.74 per cent) and UltraTech Cement (up 0.71 per cent) were among the top gainers.

9,2019-04-04,JSW,"NEW DELHI: A 25 basis points rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India failed to li ft the gloom that has set in on Dalal Street following weather forecaster Skymet’s projection of a below normal monsoon.

RBI’s downward revision in FY20 GDP growth estimate to 7.2 per cent further weighed on sentiment. 

“The rate cut was already factored in. What disappointed the market slightly was the status quo on policy stance. The market was expecting it to be changed to accommodative from neutral,"" said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities.

Rupee's plunge against the dollar also spooked investors. Around 4 pm, the domestic unit traded 62 paise down at 69.05 to the US dollar.

10,2019-04-04,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel, India's biggest maker of the alloy, is set to raise $500 million by selling dollar bonds, ending a year-long wait for garnering debt funds overseas.

The company would use the proceeds to expand production capacity at its Vijayanagar plant in Karnataka, said two people with direct knowledge of the financing plans.

The bonds may be of five-year maturity, and investors outside the US can invest in those debt securities. The company is likely to make a formal announcement soon.

“The company is expected to begin roadshows in Singapore, Hong Kong and other parts of the world early next week,” one of the persons cited above told ET.

JSW Steel declined to comment on the matter.

First Abhu Dhabi Bank, BNP, Citi, JP Morgan, and Standard Chartered are among the lenders helping the company raise the funds.

Such bonds, marked as “high-yield”, should be priced between 5% and 5.5%, dealers said. International rating companies Fitch and Moody’s have rated the company BB and Ba2, respectively, one notch below the investment grade, with stable and positive outlook.

JSW Steel has a total debt of about Rs 46,000 crore as on December 31, 2018.

The company is planning to expand capacity at its Viajanagar plant. It is expected to increase the capacity by at least 6 million tonnes, said an executive involved in the process.

The company would invest Rs 15,000 crore this financial year and ?14,687 crore in the year on largely brownfield expansions.

JSW Steel recently commenced iron ore mining from three captive mines in Karnataka, seeking to reduce reliance on imports.

With falling US Treasury yields, overseas borrowing has become relatively cheaper for Indian companies as has the cost of currency hedging."

ANALYST CALLS
• Elara Capital has reiterated its buy rating on Parag Milk Foods with a target price of ₹366. The brokerage expect 18% sales growth in FY19-21, led by high double digit growth in value added dairy (VAD) and distribution expansion in the north and east regions. The stock is currently trading at PE of 15 times and EV/EBITDA of 8 times its FY20 estimated earnings. 

• Sharekhan has upgraded its rating on Federal Bank to buy with a revised target price of ₹110. Bank’s efforts to diversify its income source by investments in related businesses, adding new streams to fee and other income are bearing fruits, albeit slowly, said the brokerage. The stock is currently trades at 1.2 times its FY 2021 estimated book value, which is attractive, according to Sharekhan. 

• Motilal Oswal has maintained its buy rating on Amara Raja Batteries with a price target of ₹861. While the industry structure remains largely duopoly, the company has emerged as a formidable challenger to leader EXIDE, with a market leadership in telecom and UPS segments, and a fast gaining share in autos, said the brokerage. 

• SBICAP Securities recommend hold rating on Dabur with a target price of ₹500. We like Dabur as diversification not only makes it safe and less vulnerable to sudden competitive, regulatory, inflationary and growth issues in any category but also ensures stable growth, said the brokerage.

• Reliance Securities has recommended buy rating on Maruti Suzuki with target price of ₹7,750, valuing the stock at 21 times FY21 estimated EPS. Maruti has been banking on success of its new launches and the brokerage expects increase in first time buyers from healthy rural demand post election amid government’s rural focus.

12,2019-04-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Metal shares were trading in the positive zone in Friday's morning session.

Shares of APL Apollo Tubes (up 2.04 per cent), Hindustan Copper (up 1.75 per cent), Tata Steel (up 1.03 per cent) and JSW Steel (up 0.57 per cent) were the top gainers in the index.

Jindal Steel & Power (up 0.50 per cent), National Aluminium Company (up 0.27 per cent), Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (up 0.16 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (up 0.12 per cent) too were trading with gains. 

The Nifty Metal index was trading 0.21 per cent up at 3078.25 around 11:16 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 19.15 points at 11,617.15 while the BSE Sensex was up 48.48 points at 38,733.20. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 27 were trading in the green, while 23 were in the red. 

Shares of Tata Motors, SAIL, YES Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Ashok Leyland, BHEL, DLF, Cipla, Indian Oil Corp, ITC, ICICI Bank and BEL were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
13,2019-04-05,JSW,"Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Ba2 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by JSW Steel Limited (Ba2 positive).

The outlook is positive. The proposed notes rank similar to JSW's existing senior unsecured notes and are therefore rated at the same level as these notes, and also at the same Ba2 rating as JSW's corporate family rating (CFR).

The global ratings agency had upgraded JSW’s nearest domestic rival Tata Steel’s CFR to Ba2 from Ba3 in February this year.

""The Ba2 CFR continues to reflect JSW's large scale and strong position in its key markets, good product and end-market diversification, and increasing focus on value-added products and retail sales,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's vice president said. ""The company's credit metrics retain their improving trajectory, principally due to competitive and efficient production costs, solid domestic demand conditions and a supportive price environment, even as input costs register a slight increase,"" he added.

The CFR factors in the “inherent cyclical nature of the steel industry and JSW's limited raw material integration,” it pointed out adding JSW’s annual capital spends of around Rs 15,000 crore is likely to constrain free cash flow generation over the next 12-18 months. The proposed issuance constitutes JSW's proactive approach in raising long term financing before incurring capex, diversifying funding sources, and optimizing interest costs.

“The proposed notes are rated Ba2 and rank pari passu to the company's $500 million senior unsecured notes maturing in November 2019 and the $500 million senior unsecured bonds maturing in April 2022”, Moody’s said.

Secured debt constituted 50% of JSW’s total debt as on December 31, 2018, down from 71% in March 2014. With the proposed bond issuance, Moody's expects that the proportion of secured debt to total debt will fall further. 

Proceeds from the issuance will be used towards retiring some of the company's debt, as well as funding capital expenditure. 

The positive outlook also incorporates Moody's expectation that the company will remain selective in its acquisitions — funding them with a prudent mix of debt and equity. A sharp shift in industry conditions leading to slide in sales volumes and price and profitability would pressure the ratings as would any large debt-financed acquisition without an immediate effect on earnings."

15,2019-04-06,JSW,"Talking to ETNOW, Kunal Bothra, Independent Market Analyst, says he is bullish on two metal stocks and one auto stocks for next week.
Edited excerpts: 



The week was a much needed breather for the market but the good thing is we have not fallen.
Absolutely. The mix of the market was very good this week. In the first half, you saw a bit of volatility coming in. One of the strongest sectors in March was the Bank Nifty or the banking sector, That sector took a bit of a breather. The Bank Nifty corrected 650 or 700 points from its recent swing highs. But what was supportive for the markets this week was the emergence or the re-emergence of new sectors. 

Cement stocks made a very strong comeback in the fag end of the week. We saw auto stocks like Eicher Motors, Tata Motors also trying to make a very good comeback. To top it up, on Friday we saw very good recovery into the metal pack. Net-net, I believe that this week was more of a consolidating week for the Nifty but the internals shaped up pretty well and all of that indicates that this is a sign of a new trend in the making for the broader markets and the benchmark indices.


What would be your bet in the auto pack? What do you think happened over there? 
As the saying goes, at the bottom, the news is always negative but the prices are at their multi-year support levels. I would look at purely chart patterns and then looking at the patterns, last week we saw very good mix up happening into names like Hero MotoCorp which was making a comeback. Maruti, Tata Motors also improved. When you see a weaker index or a weaker stock rallying by 10-15% and supporting these benchmark indices at a time when the stronger sector underperforms, that is a very credible comeback. 

One of the patterns which we have seen in every phase of bull markets is that the weaker stocks are the last movers and when you see mild recovery in the weaker sector, that itself is a strong trend. In terms of names, Tata Motors is one of the stronger candidates for a strong breakout on the upside, then followed by Maruti as well as Eicher Motors, which is trying to make a very strong price pattern on the weekly timeframe.


Metal stocks rallied this week after poor performance in last 30-40 days or maybe even one quarter. Is this a start of a trend, not only in India but also in global metal names?
So yes the push is coming across from the global markets for the sector but in terms of open interest built up on the futures and options segment for the metal stocks, or whether it is a cash or delivery data, the volumes on intraday or daily basis, there is a strong sense of a credible comeback for metal stocks. More important part is the way the sector has performed. 

Largecap stocks like Tata Steel, JSW Steel made a very strong comeback and midcap names like SAIL and Jindal Steel also made a very good comeback in the last two weeks. Net-net, with the structure and the health of the sector improving in terms of volumes and open interest, there is a very credible trend in the making for metal stocks.


When we talk about the metals pack, what is the trend that has been seen generally? Do you think that if the trend reverses, the move could be quite phenomenal? 
Yes, sectors like metals and realty are very high beta spaces. When you see a new trend in the making, those trends do not last for one, two, three weeks. They go into a multi-week, multi-month, multi-quarter rally and I believe the metal stocks are showing signs of those kinds of trends. It was led by Tata Steel which bottomed out first in the metal pack and then it led to the midcap names also participating. I believe that there is a new trend in the making and given the high beta nature of these stocks, there is much more upside left in the short to medium term.


Any stocks that are looking interesting to you?
Yes and since the markets have raised the bar, even I will raise the bar and rather than giving two stocks, I will give three stocks. Two from the same sector and that is metal stocks we have been discussing earlier. SAIL is a very strong buy. It shows inverse head and shoulder chart pattern. The stock is showing beautiful traction. Volumes on the weekly charts are extremely strong. So, it is a buy on SAIL, targets revised to Rs 66 and stop loss could be tailed to Rs 56.

Tata Steel is another buy. The stock is trying to make a very good comeback. We saw swing breakouts for Tata Steel and that is also a buy, targets of Rs 580, stop loss at Rs 535. 

From the auto pack, I have picked up Eicher Motors. It is showing bullish hammer pattern on the weekly charts. That stock should make a strong comeback, Rs 22,000 as a target on Eicher Motors, suggesting a buy with stop loss Rs 20,250."
18,2019-04-08,JSW,"India has begun a probe into alleged dumping of aluminium and zinc coated flat products from China, Vietnam and Korea following a complaint from a domestic player.

The commerce ministry's arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) initiated the investigation on an application filed by JSW Steel Coated Products.

The company asked for an anti-dumping probe and imposition of duty on imports of flat rolled product of steel, plated or coated with alloy of aluminum and zinc, from these countries.

If established that dumping has caused material injury to domestic players, DGTR would recommend imposition of antidumping duty on the imports.

In a notification, DGTR said it has found ""sufficient evidence"" of dumping of the goods by these countries.

""The authority hereby initiates an investigation into the alleged dumping, and consequent injury to the domestic industry...to determine the existence, degree and effect of alleged dumping and to recommend the amount of antidumping duty, which if levied, would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry,"" it said.

The investigation would cover the period from October 2017 to September 2018. However, the directorate would also cover the data of 2015-18.

The product offers resistance to corrosion, and is used in many applications and sectors including solar power projects, roofing, white goods and appliances, furniture and substrate for colour-coated steel.

In international trade parlance, dumping happens when a country or a firm exports an item at a price lower than the price of that product in its domestic market.

Dumping impacts price of that product in the exporting country, hitting margins and profits of manufacturing firms.

According to global trade norms, a country is allowed to impose tariffs on such dumped products to provide a level- playing field to domestic manufacturers. The duty is imposed only after a thorough investigation by a quasi-judicial body, like DGTR in India.

In its probe, the directorate has to conclude whether the dumped products are impacting domestic industries.

Imposition of antidumping duty is permissible under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime.

The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters."
17,2019-04-08,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Metal shares were trading on a mixed note in Monday's morning session.

19,2019-04-08,JSW,"Earnings growth is expected to shrink for steel companies due to falling prices amid US- China trade concerns with signs of a slowdown in China adding to the weakness. Base metal companies too are likely to see a similar trend in March 2019 earnings, according to a leading brokerage house. 

“Earnings growth is expected to decline on the back of lower spreads with aggregate PAT expected to be lower by 34% year on year,” Motilal Oswal said in its latest Metals Sector March 2019 Results Preview. Average EBITDA is expected to decrease by around 14% turning negative after eleven quarters of y-o-y increase, the report added. Metals companies under its coverage include Hindalco, Hindustan Zinc, Jindal Steel & Power, JSW Steel, Nalco, NMDC, SAIL, Tata Steel and Vedanta mong others.

In particular, the brokerage said it expected JSW Steel’s realisations to drop 10% q-o-q due to lower realisations. SAIL’s EBITDA is expected to decline by around 2% q-o-q to Rs 25.2 billion. JSPL’s EBITDA is likely to increase by around !5 q-o-q to Rs 21 billion on higher volumes and improved subsidiary performance while Tata Steel’s EBITDA is also likely to grow by 1% q-o-q to Rs 68.1 billion led by higher steel volumes and offset by lower realisations.

For mining major NMDC, EBITDA is tipped to go down by 17% q-o-q to Rs 19 billion on lower prices. Among base metals, a 2% q-o-q appreciation in USD -Rupee is likely to have a negative impact, the report said. Vedanta’s EBITDA is likely to drop by 2% q-o-q to Rs 55.5 billion, while Hindalco and Nalco’s EBITDA will be impacted by lower prices on the benchmark London Metal Exchange (LME), it added.

Average flat steel prices were down 9% q-o-q to Rs 41,660 per tonne while average long products prices remained unchanged at Rs 37,500 per tonne. Since start of Feb’19, flat prices have recovered by Rs 2000/ tonne, the report said. While domestic steel demand growth was at 5% in Jan-Feb 2019 according to JPC estimates, the reports said sale volumes are expected to recover q-o-q basis, as Q3 witnessed deferment of purchases due to price volatility and on companies looking to reduce their excess inventory. Price of base metals, barring aluminium, were higher on a q-o-q basis while zinc prices increase by 3% to $2694/ tonne and lead was up 4% to 2039/ tonne. While copper was up 1% to 6202/ tonne. Alumina prices declined by 12% to $ 387/ tonne due to increasing supply from China, upcoming facilities at Emirates Global and lifting of sanctions a Rusal. Aluminium prices went down by around %% to $ 1949/ tonne."
16,2019-04-08,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Signals of more stimulus in China and improved US payrolls data rekindled risk appetite among investors helping Asian stocks climb to seven-month highs on Monday.

Indian stocks took cue and rose in early trade, but a jump in crude oil prices and rupee's fall against the US dollar proved a drag on the market. 

After jumping almost 180 points, Sensex traded with a nominal gain of 36 points at 38,898 around 10:15 am.However, analysts see stock-specific action. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks.

TechM logs nominal gainsTech Mahindra said it would acquire 18.1 per cent stake each in Infotek Software and Systems (ISS) and Vitaran Electronics for a consideration of up to Rs 13 crore. However, news of the company's stake acquisition failed to cheer market as the stock closed with a nominal gain of 0.24 per cent at Rs 788.95 in an otherwise bullish market.

100 stocks signal potential fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 100 counters on BSE, signalling potential fall for them in the coming sessions. Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were SBI, BHEL, Adani Enterprises, Syndicate Bank, Asian Paints, Usha Martin and Apollo Tyres. On the other hand, Indiabulls Real Estate, Orient Paper, Cipla, Hindustan Unilever, SBI Life Insurance and Prestige Estates Projects were among the 66 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on BSE."
20,2019-04-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: The resolution professional (RP) of Asian Colour Coated Ispat (ACCIL) has petitioned the Delhi bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking an extension of the bid deadline for the asset even as the company received a lone bid from JSW Steel last month.

The extension is being sought a month after the bid deadline expired on March 8, to accommodate the interests of TPG Capital, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Blackstone-backed International Asset Reconstruction Company (IARC). The said players have shown fresh interest in the asset and are likely to bid if NCLT allows the extension, said two people aware of the development. A hearing is scheduled to take place on April 10.

ACCIL owes Rs 5,000 crore to lenders whereas JSW Steel has offered Rs 1,200 crore for the asset that includes Rs 800 crore for secured lenders and Rs 400 crore for unsecured lenders. Accepting this bid will lead to the creditors taking a 76% haircut which is why the RP and CoC may want to apply for an extension and go for a fresh round of bidding, one of the people said. The 270-day deadline for the company’s resolution expires on April 16.

To be sure, out of the three players, only Kotak Mahindra Bank had submitted an initial expression of interest (EoI). The other two have shown fresh interest in the company; this could raise a concern as when a second round of bids were being called for Essar Steel, only the players that had submitted EoIs were allowed to bid.

A senior JSW Steel official said that the company has no information about the extension for the bid deadline “but for any asset under resolution in IBC, processes laid down need to be followed as such extensions when they take place a month after the bid deadline would be challenged on multiple levels surpassing the 270-day deadline.”

TPG Capital and the RP Kuldip Kumar Bassi declined to comment. Mails sent to Kotak Mahindra Bank and IARC did not elicit a response till the time of going to press.

ACCIL has a 3 lakh tonnes capacity in making cold rolled, galvanised and colour-coated steel products. ArcelorMittal had also shown interest in the company but has refrained from bidding until the acquisition of Essar Steel gets through, said a source."
25,2019-04-10,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities lost ground on Wednesday as sentiments remained fragile due to political uncertainty ahead of the first phase of voting in the general elections. 

“The market will zigzag till the election results are out. Stability will come back when the picture gets clear,” said G Chokkalingam, the founder of Equinomics Research & Advisory.

A rise in crude oil prices and lacklustre Asian markets after IMF cut global growth outlook were other immediate causes behind the selloff.

Sensex lost 354 points, or 0.91 per cent, to close at 38,585, whereas Nifty finished 88 points, or 0.75 per cent, down at 11,584.


Let's take a look at the movers and shakers of Wednesday's session:

Wipro jumps 3% on nod to buybackWipro got Sebi go-ahead for its largest share buyback ever, worth Rs 12,000 crore. The news gave a boost to the stock as it settled 2.76 per cent higher at Rs 281, extending the gains into the fourth successive session. The company said its board will consider the buyback proposal at a meeting on April 16. 


Vodafone Idea shares fall 3%Falling for the second straight day, shares of Vodafone Idea closed 3.25 per cent down at Rs 16.35 even as its Rs 25,000 crore rights issue opened. Promoter groups Vodafone and Birlas have confirmed their participation in the issue worth up to Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 7,250 crore, respectively.


HDFC Bank shares fall 2%Shares of HDFC Bank closed 2.07 per cent down at Rs 2,242 after multiple block deals on the counter. While names of all the buyers and sellers were not known, ET on Tuesday reported that KKR was to offload 0.42 per cent stake in the bank via block deal.


Hindalco slips over 2%The stock closed 2.47 per cent down at Rs 211.40 after a spillage incident at its alumina refinery at Muri caused it to suspend operations temporarily.


Lakshmi Vilas Bank cracks 4%The market downplayed fundraising plans of Lakshmi Vilas Bank as the shares of the bank extended losses into the second consecutive session, closing 4.49 per cent down at Rs 88.35. In a BSE filing, the bank said its board would meet on April 12 to consider raising of capital through issuance and allotment of Basel III-compliant Additional Tier-1 debt instruments in the nature of bonds.

26,2019-04-10,JSW,"We believe midcaps would be very stock specific but index wise also, it will be not as negative as what we have 
  
  
  seen last year, said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President - Equity & Portfolio Advisory, Anand Rathi Financial Services, in an interview with ETNOW. Deepak Nitrite and Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail are his top two midcap picks.Edited excerpts:


Split right in the middle -- not in greed zone, not in fear zone. I had a reading of 50. Which way do you think the needle would move -- towards greed or towards fear -- as we election and earnings season begin?
Looking at the market condition today, we know that elections are starting from tomorrow. It is more of a neutral to positive zone where we are seeing the markets. The reason is of course the election is starting and we have biggies of the result season starting from Friday. I would say results will also raise volatility concerns along with elections. As far as FII fund flows are concerned, there would be hiccups here or there. From the overall perspective, the market is looking neutral to positive.

Would I like to jump in and buy something? The answer is no. One has to be a little cautious because of the volatility. The best strategy right now is to buy on dips. Any good quality companies where numbers are coming good in terms of quarterly numbers are buy on dips with a medium to long-term horizon.


What is the approach to the big three within the telecom space? Bharti Airtel as well as Vodafone-Idea are gearing up to take on Reliance Jio. What is your view here?
Our view remains the same. Voda-Idea and Bharti Airtel situation is much better off than it was a year back, but I believe the disruption is still on. 

We are sceptical on all the telecom service providers and believe there is still a lot of pain left in the system. We would rather like to be in the optic fibre side, something which is a supporting system to the industry like Sterlite Technology. We know that 5G rollout is going to come very soon. The optic fibre side, Sterlite Technology, looks very interesting. 

One of the key risks with Sterlite Technology is promoter-pledged shares, but once those things are sorted out in due course of time, business-wise, looking at the strong order book Sterlite Technology looks very interesting with a 25% odd upside with a medium to long-term horizon. 


The currency trajectory for the past month or so has seen quite a bit of appreciation versus the greenback. Some sort of a pullback is now kicking in. What do you expect for export oriented themes?
Currency again depreciating would be a big factor. Crude is also heading northwards and that could be one of the reasons we do not see much volatility in currency as of now. We believe the currency will be more or less stable. Q4 happens to be the weakest quarter for export-oriented sectors like IT. if the numbers come out well, IT will be the main theme we would be looking at. 

We are very constructive on some of the midcap IT companies along with pharma. Pharma is a very selective play. We like Biocon where numbers are really consistent in terms of biosimilar drugs. They have been getting good revenues and going forward also, the contribution of biosimilar drug in the revenue will be much higher than what it is today. In terms of export- oriented sectors, we are very constructive on IT and partially on pharma.


Defensives seem to be making a bit of a comeback. In today’s session, pharma both on account of being a defensive play as well as a currency play, showed some movement across the board. Where do valuations lie in this segment of the market?
Valuations are quite cheap in pharma if I talk about something like a Sun Pharma or Dr Reddy’s. But there is a growth factor involved in the valuation also. We are not looking at something which is very bright or any of the biggies of the pharma space. 

From some of the expensive stocks like Biocon to companies like Sun Pharma. there is growth. In the pharma space, we would like to chase growth rather than being at a value proposition. That is why we like Biocon. Our target price would be Rs 823. 


You have said to avoid small housing finance companies (HFCs) but do you like any other particular stock in the broader markets or would you say it is safer to stick with bigger names?
There are better value propositions in the broader market which we are eyeing in speciality chemicals. To be precise, Deepak Nitrite is one of the plays in specialty chemicals where we are very constructive. There is a value proposition if I compare it with last four quarters’ revenue. It has around Rs 400 crore quarterly revenue, which the company has been posting over the last four-five quarters. 

Going forward, because of the new phenol and acetone plant operational in Dahej. An additional revenue of Rs 550-600 crore will come. Revenue also may jump in FY20 considerably because we believe that Deepak Nitrite has a very good positioning in the market. 80% of this chemical is imported and it attracts anti-dumping duty by government. So Deepak Nitrite is in a very sweet spot. Our target is Rs 346.


What is the expectation from Infy and TCS as they are set to release their numbers on Friday?
In terms of dollar revenue growth, we are expecting around 1.5-2%. This is the seasonally weak quarter but if they meet up these expectations, TCS would be better off than Infosys in terms of dollar revenue. 

Guidance-wise, Infosys will keep the guidance that they have kept for FY19 for the entire year. Infosys may keep the same guidance for FY20. In the in the largecap arena, HCL Technologies number would be a cut above the rest.


Beside Deepak Nitrite, where are you identifying opportunities within mid and smallcaps? 
In midcaps, last year, we were 15% to 16% negative. Historically, midcap indices do not remain negative for back-to-back two years. The broader market can either be volatile or a little corrective but I have a conviction that in 2019, the broader markets and midcaps would be outperformers compared to the biggies of the world. 

We believe midcaps would be very stock specific but index wise also, it will be not as negative as what we have seen last year. One should keep that conviction going and look out for value propositions. This can be a year of midcaps.


What else do you like besides Deepak Nitrite within the mid and smallcap universe?
We like a lot of companies in the retail space, something like Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail. We know in terms of same store growth for Pantaloons, last quarter has shown strong same store growth. Apart from that, Madura Lifestyle, Van Huesen, Peter England brands also has been getting good volumes over a period of time. The management is very confident in terms of promoting their innerwear brands and improving their market share in the innerwear brand. 

Overall, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail since three quarters has been a turnaround story and we believe this company has a strong potential to post good numbers in the coming two-three quarters from here on. 


Coming to the metals basket, is there a glimmer of hope?
Of course. Metals being a global commodity. Looking at Fed’s dovish stance, US-China trade situation, it appears metals will be doing good in 2019. In Indian context, JSW Steel looks the most interesting mainly because of two factors; capacity expansion and better realisations. Of course, if this government again returns to power, the kind of protection this government can give to the metal industry would also be supportive. So, with a long term perspective we like JSW Steel. But if I talk about a shorter term perspective of maybe two-three months, on a techno-funda basis, we like Steel Authority of India (SAIL). In the short term, SAIL can also see good momentum on the upside."
27,2019-04-10,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel, India's biggest maker of the alloy, Wednesday completed raising $500 million by selling dollar bonds, marking a revival in global debt issues by large local companies.

The company received subscriptions worth $1.75 billion, about four times the quantum of bonds on offer, two people with direct knowledge of the sale told ET.

The dollar-denominated bonds, maturing in five years, offered 5.95%.

On April 4, ET reported that JSW Steel was set to raise $500 million through overseas bonds. The company would use the proceeds to expand capacity at its Vijayanagar plant in Karnataka.

Deutsche Bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, BNP, Citi, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are among the investment bankers that helped JSW Steel raise the funds.

“Quite frankly, even after the strong re-opening of the international bond markets for Indian high-yield issuers, the response to JSW Steel has been overwhelming,” said Amrish Baliga, MD & Head Financing, Deutsche Bank, one of the lead bankers to the issue.

The order book reflected the quality of this credit instrument, which was well articulated to an international audience, said Baliga.

Fitch and Moody’s rated the steelmaker’s bonds BB and Ba2, respectively, one notch below the investment grade, with stable and positive outlook."
28,2019-04-11,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 25.50 points, or 0.22 per cent, higher at 11,677.50, indicating a positive start for the Nifty50. Here are a few stocks which may buzz the most in today’s trade:

Jet Airways: Five companies are said to have submitted expressions of interest in picking up stakes in Jet Airways. However, the lenders have extended the Wednesday deadline by two days, in the hope that Etihad Airways, which hasn’t submitted an EoI, will show interest.


Vedanta: The company has moved the Supreme Court seeking access to its now-shut copper plant at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu to repair & maintain it, citing the high court’s inordinate delay in hearing the case despite repeated requests by the firm.


JSW Steel: India’s biggest maker of the alloy has completed raising $500 million by selling dollar bonds, marking a revival in global debt issues by large local companies.


Bharti Airtel: The telecom major has fixed April 24 as the record date for determining shareholders eligible to apply for its upcoming Rs 25,000-crore rights issue.

Board meetings
 

Analyst calls
 • Credit Suisse has retained neutral rating on Maruti Suzuki with a target price of ₹6,100. Maruti's market share, which stood at 52% in first half of FY19, has slipped to 50% in second half of FY19 with a 150 bps market share loss coming on account of lower sales of the compact sedan segment, said Credit Suisse. 

• Antique Stock Broking has maintained buy rating on State Bank of India with a target price of ₹385. The brokerage expects SBI's earnings to rebound to ₹370 billion by FY21 versus ₹27 billion in FY19. The sharp swing in earnings is largely the effect of risk-adjusted NIMs reverting towards its mean to 2.1%, said Antique. 

• Jefferies has retained underperform rating on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company with a target price of ₹285. Even with capital markets recovering, the loss of HNI customer base in the past year to be a hurdle to business growth, capping further improvement in persistency and slower fixedcost amortization, said Jefferies. This may act as a drag on VNB margin, with any improvement coming out of a higher protection mix, it said. 

 • CLSA has downgraded Century Plyboards to sell from buy and cut target price to ₹174 from ₹195. The brokerage sees limited upside in Century Plyboards shares with headwinds across product segments, particularly in the MDF and plywood segment. 

• Nomura has downgraded Havells India to neutral from buy and increased target price to ₹750 from ₹636. Havells is a compelling story in the electricals and consumer durables space and the outlook on key segments also remains sanguine, said Nomura. However, with a strong run over past year, valuations are no longer undemanding, the firm said.

32,2019-04-16,JSW,"In the past five years, the infrastructure sector has received a great deal of attention from the government. The total awarding of road contracts from the Ministry of Roads, Transport and Highways and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has grown eight times to 24,452 km in the past five years ending FY18. During the same period, the pace of road construction per day also improved from 15.9 km in FY13 to 27 km in FY18, which, in turn, has strengthened the order books of construction, cement and certain roads companies in the broad infrastructure theme.

According to various estimates, there are a bunch of construction companies which have visibility of revenues for the next four years. Given these factors, it makes sense to be with mutual fund schemes which have a special focus on infrastructure. One such scheme is L&T Infrastructure Fund.

Soumendra Nath Lahiri, the scheme’s fund manager, has not only constructed a portfolio which is properly geared towards the infrastructure theme but has also maintained consistency in the scheme’s performance. In the past five- and 10-year periods, the scheme has given 17.4% and 13.2% returns, while its category has given 12% and 11.3 %, respectively, in the same period. Investors must consider investments in the scheme with a minimum five-year view in mind.

Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar

The fund is one of the few infrastructure schemes that invest purely in infra-related stocks with zero exposure to sectors such as financial services. Lahiri runs the fund with a multi-cap style and constructs a reasonably diversified portfolio to reduce the overall risk. He is an excellent stock picker, which reflects in the long-term performance of the fund."

Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

Minda Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 470 | Stop loss: Rs 350
Minda Industries is one of the strongest stocks in the market currently. It rallied smartly last week on the back of above average volumes and closed at a seven-month high in the process. Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock trades above its 13-day and 50-day simple moving averages. Intermediate momentum readings are in the rising mode, and are not signalling overbought condition.


APL Apollo Tubes | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,920 | Stop loss: Rs 1,380
APL Apollo Tubes rallied smartly last week on the back of huge volumes and closed at a new seven-month high. In the process, the stock reversed the recent intermediate downtrend and broke out of a recent narrow trading range. Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock trades above the rising short-term (13-day SMA) and medium-term (50-day SMA) moving averages. Intermediate momentum indicators like the 14-week RSI are in the rising mode and is not overbought yet. 


Kkunal Parar, Senior Technical Analyst, Choice Broking

Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,910 | Stop loss: Rs 2,645
On the daily scale, this stock has seen a breakout from its upper band of Falling Wedge formation, which is pointing that the stock is positively biased for the coming trading sessions. Daily momentum indicator RSI reading is at 61.50 with a positive divergence along with a positive crossover, indicating positive breath on the counter. 


HUL | Buy | Target price: Rs 1820 | Stop loss: Rs 1700

Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst, Angel Broking

Quick Heal Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 254 | Stop loss: Rs 217
After the sharp rally seen from Rs 171 to Rs 240 levels, this stock went into a consolidation phase last month. On the daily chart, the stock has now closed above the higher range of consolidation and seems to have resumed a primary uptrend. The aforesaid breakout is supported by a bullish candlestick pattern and increasing volume. On the oscillators’ front, after forming a base around 50 level, a smoothened RSI has given a fresh ‘buy’ signal with its average supporting our positive bias. 


JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 325 | Stop loss: Rs 284
In the recent broader market rally, this heavyweight metal counter had no major contribution. However, after breaking above a consolidation range of last three months, the stock is likely to end its slumber and may show outperformance. The resistance for the above-mentioned consolidation phase coincides with 89-EMA and a close above the same with a bullish candle and increasing volume can give credence to our optimistic view. In addition, RSI is in positive zone supporting our buy call.

Time period given by the analyst is two weeks and he recommended keeping a stop loss at Rs 285.

""For last couple of trading sessions, this counter appears to be moving in a range of Rs 300–285. Price behaviour of last session is looking quite interesting as this counter moved sharply after almost testing the lower end of said consolidation range on relatively higher volumes.

43,2019-04-22,JSW,"Mumbai: Lenders to the distressed steel assets of Uttam Value Steels and Uttam Galva Metallics on Sunday approved a Rs 2,400-crore resolution package in a staggered payment plan that requires banks to take haircuts of more than 60% on the loans.

Two people aware of the resolution plan said the offer includes equity commitment of Rs 100 crore. Of the total amount, about Rs 650 crore will be paid immediately, with the remaining spread over the next five-six years, said one of the executives aware of the payment plans.

A consortium of lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), has Rs 6,113 crore of loans outstanding in these two accounts. Other banks with significant exposure to the assets include Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and Andhra Bank.

The resolution professional, Rajiv Chakraborty of PwC, now has until May 7 to get the plan of CarVal Investors and Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil) approved by the dedicated bankruptcy court. 

An email sent to Chakraborty remained unanswered.

Focused on distressed and credit-intensive assets, CarVal is the investment arm of food and agriculture conglomerate Cargill, which is also the biggest closely held US company by revenue.

Its earlier offer was around Rs 2,000 crore.

The assets, which are associate companies of Uttam Galva Steels, comprise onemillion tonne hot-rolled production capacity of Uttam Value Steels at Wardha in Maharashtra, for which the former purchases pig iron from Uttam Galva Metallics.

Utilisation levels could be raised to the rated capacity in six months, a person aware of the developments said.

JSW Steel and Liberty House had earlier sought to invest in these assets. However, final bids came in only from CarVal and another consortium led by SSG Capital Management.

The 270-day deadline for the assets ended on April 3 but the company got 20 more days to complete the resolution."

 The last time Indian companies sold more junk bonds was in 2014, when total volumes for the year were $4.1 billion, the data showed.

 ""We've got quite a long pipeline of Indian issuers looking at the market as they take advantage of the market this year as financing costs are more attractive versus last year,"" said Amy Tan, head of debt capital markets origination, Asia ex-Japan, at JPMorgan.

 On the basis of benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, interest rates have fallen almost 70 basis points from their peak in 2018.

 Investors are pouring funds into emerging markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled U.S. interest rates may not rise this year.

 Sales of junk bonds in Asia reached a record $27.5 billion in the first quarter, Refinitiv data shows, much of it driven by Chinese property developers.

 Indian issuers have also jumped into the market.

 Miner Vedanta Resources Finance sold $1 billion in four- and seven-year bonds earlier this month - the largest junk bond sale out of India this year.

 Steel company JSW Steel Ltd raised $500 million in five-year bonds, while Shriram Transport Finance Company Ltd sold $900 million in three- and three and a half-year bonds.

 In a tumultuous 2018, rising U.S. interest rates and weak markets pummelled emerging markets, shutting out many borrowers, so the strong start to this year has come as a relief to bankers and many investors.

 India only saw one high-yield deal last year, while some Chinese property borrowers were forced to pay double-digit coupons for two-year borrowings.

 ""Markets just weren't there last year. If you look at Indonesia, ASEAN, China non-property, there was very little supply,"" said Rishi Jalan, co-head of debt syndicate for Asia for Citigroup.


RELAXATION OF RULES
 The Indian central bank's decision to relax offshore borrowing rules also boosted the sale of junk bonds and higher-grade dollar debt by Indian issuers.

 Borrowers can now raise an unlimited amount of funds from offshore markets for at least three years. Previously, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had imposed a $50 million ceiling.

 ""The two key reasons for the resurgence of India high yield is, firstly, the change in Fed policy stance leading to Asia high-yield markets reopening, and secondly, the RBI relaxed the external commercial borrowing regulations, increasing the universe of potential borrowers,"" said Sameer Gupta, head of debt capital markets, India at Deutsche Bank.

 Gupta added that hedging costs had fallen significantly thanks to swap auctions conducted by the RBI, making it less expensive to raise U.S. dollars.

 Indian debt also provides investors with diversification from China, where real estate developers have issued the bulk of Asian junk bonds this year, with several of them having conducted two or three bond sales in 2019.

 ""Given the amount of China and China property supply that's come out, India is providing a good diversification angle, which investors like,"" Jalan said."
45,2019-04-23,JSW,"Steel imports are growing and that is a concern for the overall steel industry in India, said Seshagiri Rao, Joint MD & Group CFO, 
  
  
  , in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


What is your outlook on steel demand given that every day we wake up to a different view from China or US? What is happening to the global steel market? 
The numbers for CY2018 have come. The steel demand growth globally was 4.9%, which was quite encouraging for last year. At the same time, the Chinese steel demand in CY2018 was 7.9%. So there was a very good demand for steel growth in 2018. But considering the slowdown which we see across the globe, the outlook released by world steel association for the CY2019 will show a moderation in steel demand. They expect the steel demand growth for CY2019 to be 1.3%, At the same time, even China it is expected to have 1% steel demand growth. So, there will be moderation in steel demand globally. But interestingly, there will be 1.3% growth on overall base of close to 1.7 billion tonnes.


The Indian steel market is dramatically different. Artificial duty protection has protected against dumping of steel. China also has mothballed a lot of capacity. How do you see these two scenarios playing out because China is now increasing capacity and the artificial fence which the Indian steel companies have, may not last for long.
This statement may not be correct. As far as India is concerned, whatever trade remedial actions have been taken by India in the last few years are not very effective. That is getting reflected in March 2019 numbers. The imports went up by 46% and at the same time, the exports have fallen by 16% in March. So, imports are coming into India in a big way because of the trade diversions. 

If you look at the USA Section 232 imposition or Canada or Turkey or other Asian countries including Europe, almost 1.4 to 1.5 million tonnes of steel imports have been cut by Japan, Korea, Russia and China. At the same period, in India, it has grown by 0.9 million tonnes. So imports into India is growing and that is a concern for the overall steel industry in India.

Our steel demand last year was 7.5% which is also very good steel demand compared to what happened globally and even in FY19 and FY20, despite a slowdown in the auto industry, the overall steel demand is expected to be in the range of 7%, driven by government expenditure, construction industry, metro, road, bridges, tunnels etc. A reasonably good steel demand is expected in FY19-20.


Since you are a converter, the current volatility in global prices should not really be impacting you as much. Is that the case?
Global steel prices corrected and we are seeing a bit of stability or some uptick majorly driven by the raw material prices. Iron ore prices are quite strong. It went up because of the disruptions both in Australia and Brazil. Steel prices are quite reasonable in my view. But as far as India is concerned, domestic steel prices are tracking the global steel prices. The landed cost of imports, particularly from China adds a 12.5% duty. The domestic prices are at a discount. Considering that I expect the margins may not be as we have seen in the last year, it will get moderated this year but they will be reasonable in the FY19 and 20.


What is the outlook is with respect to your capacity? What is going to be your overall capacity, is that completed now?
We had 18 million tonnes installed capacity. We are expanding our capacity to 24 million tonnes and that will be completed by 31st March 2020. At the same time, our downstream capacity is going up from 5 million tonnes to 9 million tonne. Part of this capacity will get commissioned in 2019 and 2020 and that benefit would accrue to the company. But the real volume growth from 18 to 24 million tonne we will see the in year FY20 and 21.


How will the new capacities start adding to the top line and what kind of spreads would you enjoy?
The new capacity that is coming up is very efficient capacity in terms of investment per tonne of installed capacity and they are very efficient in terms of fuel efficiency and also other factors. Therefore, the profitability from the new capacity will be far better than what we have right now. 

In addition to that, we are making investments in power plants, batteries, pipe conveyors, slurry pipelines for cost reduction. There are a lot of initiatives which the company is taking to reduce our cost further. We are a converter and therefore, notwithstanding the volatility in the steel prices, we will continue to be profitable. That is one positive.


What about coal availability? Coal imports have started again. How are you likely to bridge coal requirement gap?
You have to look at the steel industry’s requirements in two parts – one is coking coal and the second is thermal coal for power plants which operate as a part of captive units. Thermal coal prices globally corrected quite steeply in the last few months. That is one positive for the captive power plants of the steel industry. 

As regards to coking coal prices, India continues to be dependent on coking coal imports. The overall demand-supply scenario with regard to coking coal is not much imbalanced. I do not think there will be a problem with regard to overall coking coal supplies required by JSW Steel. We have also taken a lot of proactive measures in terms of diversifying the sources of importing coking coal and so our dependency on Australia has been reduced substantially. 

We also import from Canada and other countries. That will give some stability as regards to overall import of coking coal for JSW Steel even at an enhanced capacity of steel production.


What are the three sectors where demand for steel is coming back? 
Government expenditure is one of the major drivers. Steel consumption last year was 97.5 million tonnes. 60-65% of steel is consumed by infrastructure and construction and real estate sectors. Of these three sectors, other than residential real estate, other sectors are doing quite well. 

State and centre governments together are spending close to Rs 7-8 lakh crore in infrastructure projects. General engineering and capital goods are the sectors where yellow goods are doing reasonably well driven again by the mining industry. The only industry where I am seeing a bit of slowdown is the auto sector. 

The growth in auto sector for next year is expected to be in the 2-4% range. As the auto industry association has mentioned, they are not facing a structural slowdown, it is a temporary slowdown. We expect things to return to normal once the liquidity situation improves and the banks and NBFCs start lending again."
46,2019-04-23,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Falling for the third day in a row, equity barometer Sensex closed in the negative territory on Tuesday as banking, financials and auto stocks proved to be the top drags.

Analysts said rising crude oil prices and a falling rupee were main reasons behind the fall. There was also caution amid the ongoing elections and fourth quarter earnings.

""Crude oil is creating havoc in the market. This move has mainly affected a few Asian countries, including India, which are major importers of Iranian oil and they will now have to look for newer avenues to source oil,” said Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.

Sensex closed 80 points, or 0.21 per cent, lower at 38,564 while Nifty settled 19 points, or 0.16 per cent, down at 11,575.

In the last three sessions, both the indices have come off by nearly 2 per cent.


Here is a quick look on the key highlights of Tuesday's session:

Lupin shares jump 4%Shares of drug maker Lupin got a shot in arm after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to overweight from equal-weight and raised the target price by nearly 40 per cent to Rs 1,094 from Rs 783. The scrip closed 3.94 per cent higher at Rs 864.30.


Capacite rises after two-day lossesBreaking their two-day losing run, shares of Capacite Infraprojects closed with a tepid gain of 0.24 per cent at Rs 229.45 after it bagged two orders worth Rs 342.38 crore from private sector clients for construction of commercial and residential buildings at Mumbai. 


HDFC Bank extends fallShares of the private lender fell for the third consecutive session, sliding 1 per cent on Tuesday to close at Rs 2,245. In last three sessions, the stock has retreated 2.56 per cent despite a majority of brokerages maintaining ‘buy’ ratings on it after the company reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings on Saturday.


RIL shares climb 1%Shares of heavyweight Reliance Industries (RIL) closed 1.38 per cent higher, gaining on the buzz that the company was in active discussions with Tokyo-headquartered SoftBank for an equity participation in its telecom business.


Essel Propack extends gainsRising for the second consecutive session, shares of Essel Propack closed 0.64 per cent higher at Rs 133 after reports that Blackstone has agreed to buy 51 per cent of promoter stake in the company for Rs 134 per share. The transaction will trigger a mandatory open offer for purchase of an additional 26 per cent stake. 


Jet shares zoom 10%Shares of Jet Airways surged 9.90 per cent to Rs 169.90, snapping the losing streak of last three sessions, during which the stock came off 41 per cent. The stock has caught the attention of high-risk investors as a solution to the financial troubles of the company looks remote. ""The stock has got into a zone where risk-reward has become favourable for high-risk investors,"" said Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing. 


RCap surges after 3-day slideAfter losing for three successive sessions, shares of Reliance Capital closed 6.13 per cent higher at Rs 143.80. Axis Trustee Services sold 51.81 lakh shares, or nearly 2 per cent of equity of Reliance Capital worth Rs 71 crore on Monday through bulk deals, NSE data showed.

On the other hand, ONGC, DCB Bank, Linde India and Vardhman Holdings were among the 30 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on BSE."
47,2019-04-24,JSW,"Kolkata/Mumbai: The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the bankruptcy court to hear the promoters of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. who claimed that the lenders did not provide them with the details of a resolution plan involving JSW Steel’s offer for the company.

The court passed ex-parte orders on April 18 directing the National Company Law tribunal to hear the plea of the BPSL promoters. A copy of the orders was reviewed by ET.

JSW Steel, which offered about Rs 19,300 crore for BPSL, is awaiting approval of the plan. It emerged as the winning bidder for BPSL after a hard-fought contest that saw Tata Steel and Liberty House competing for the stressed steel asset.

BPSL director Ravi Prakash Goyal said in the petition that the company’s board of directors was not provided complete details of JSW’s resolution plan despite directions from the appellate tribunal.

At a hearing on Tuesday, the NCLT heard Mukul Rohatgi, advocate for BPSL promoter Sanjay Singal, and reserved its orders in the matter.

JSW Steel is “following the developments closely,” a company official said.

Goyal argued that the plan presented to the BPSL board was a redacted version, which did not disclose all the information that it was entitled to receive. He requested that the process and the proceedings before the NCLT be quashed and started afresh.

The BPSL board could not effectively participate before the committee of creditors and the “whole process has been vitiated,” he said.

The board had “repeatedly requested” for a copy of the resolution plan but on July 26, 2018, it was allowed a limited inspection of some resolution plans. However, various pages were missing, he said.

The plan passed by the CoC is a revised resolution plan of October 2018, of which neither a copy nor any inspection was offered to the board.

The Sajjan Jindal-led group trumped other bids for BPSL by putting up the Rs 19,300 crore offer in addition to provisions for paying operational creditors and statutory dues of the company. BPSL owes Rs 47,151 crore to a consortium of 34 banks. In a formal letter to the two main creditors, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, on January 29, Singal offered to pay the company’s entire dues in a staggered manner. However, the creditors rejected the offer because there was no upfront payment."

49,2019-04-25,JSW,"Nirmal Bang Securities has a buy call on JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 349.

The current market price of JSW Steel is Rs 290.60.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when JSW Steel price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage-

Focuses more on backward integration for secured raw material supply over cost: JSW is aiming to address the disadvantage of limited backward integration by acquiring iron ore mines to backward integrate itself and be self reliant for the basic raw material when the mining leases are due for renewal in FY20. This will additionally help JSW improve the utilisation of its conveyor belt which currently has carrying capacity for 20mtpa of iron ore.


Focus on higher conversion factor to help maintain spread even in a challenging environment: JSW also has an edge over its competitors with a better conversion factor. The key aim of the company is to maintain the higher spread with a sharp focus on improving the conversion factor (besides the price differential) paying attention to the three pillars such as: a) Automated systems. b) Dynamic multi-sourced raw materials and efficient and controlled cost of capital.


Dynamic earnings stream with a focus on value-added products: Unlike its domestic peers, JSW focuses on high-yielding flat products (71 per cent of the sales volume). The quality of earnings is highly maintained besides earnings traction and this helps in maintaining an edge, even in a downcycle when the spread is under stress. Further, from FY15 the company has shifted its focus more on value-added and special products with sales of retail and branded products now forming 55 per cent of the total volume.


Domestic and global macro situation points towards a favourable change: The global as well as domestic macro parameters point towards a favourable change for the steel industry and JSW will be the key beneficiary of steel sector tailwinds. Most of the steel demand comes from infrastructure, construction and automobile sectors which are currently doing well in India. Flat products are used mainly in automobile, capital goods and consumer goods where JSW has a strong presence.


Capital expenditure to expand upstream and downstream capacities with the focus on cost of capital: JSW has focused on capacity addition consistently and maintained the balance in expansion of upstream and downstream capacities. The company has an aggressive capital expenditure plan for the next two years costing Rs320bn. This expansion includes 1mt steel-making capacity addition at the Vijayanagar unit which will be commissioned by March 2020, taking the total capacity at the facility to 13mt (allocation of Rs23bn/US$330mn) and doubling the steel-making capacity at Dolvi unit to 10mt by March 2020E (Rs150bn/US$2.1bn). The sizeable contribution from the expanded capacity will start from FY21.


Valuation, catalysts and risks: We have assigned 7.0x multiple to FY21E EBITDA of JSW to arrive at our target price of Rs349 (upside of 17 per cent from the CMP). The multiple is at +1 standard deviation to factor in the improvement in quality of earnings in the next couple of years, JSW has laid sharp focus on limited leveraging of the balance sheet (1.0x FY21 D/E and ~ 2.5x debt/EBITDA) and maintaining/improving the market presence with its aggressive capital expenditure plan. We have not factored in any contribution to its operating earnings from its recent domestic and overseas inorganic growth. Additionally, we are not factoring in any further inorganic growth while arriving at our earnings estimates. Factoring in the above, we have assigned Buy rating to the stock."
54,2019-04-26,JSW,"Other than Reliance, corporate banks and auto are what Nischal Maheshwari, CEO, Centrum Institutional Equities, is 
  
  
  recommending to his clients. Maheshwari was in conversation with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

The Vodafone-Idea rights issue sailed through very smoothly and I am talking about the non-promoter part here. It tells us that institutional investors are backing it. So, what has changed for telecom?
Institutions do not invest just for the next quarter or two. They are looking for the next few years. As far as telecom is concerned, in the last two years, since Jio has come, everybody has suffered. But one important thing which has happened is basically it has consolidated the industry. 

We used to have more than five to six players in each of the circles. Today, there are not more than three. This is a very welcome change as far as the industry is concerned. So, competition has come down. Jio at the moment, has reached 300 million customers. At the beginning of the launch of Jio, Mr Ambani’s dream was to achieve 400 million customers over a period of five years and they have done a phenomenal job reaching that within three years. 

Once that comes through, the market expects that the pressures on the pricing will ease off. Otherwise also, the stocks are decimated. Vodafone and Idea are two large companies and have deep enough pockets to back it up. Basically, most of the institutions think that over may be a year or two, these stocks would be worth taking a bet on. That is also my view.


We are not going in with gung-ho expectations on the profit front in the auto sector, There is margin pressure as well. What is your view on some of these names?
The market does not expect much from Hero Moto. It has been a tepid quarter for them. I do not expect great numbers out there as far as Hero Moto is concerned. 

The whole lot of the auto sector has been pretty weak in last quarter. Having said that, one has to start looking at what kind of valuation these stocks are quoting at and sometime back also, the two-wheelers at these prices seem to be pretty good. Hero Moto is around 7.5 times EV to EBITDA. It is quoting closer to some of the commodity companies.

These are stocks which basically will be looked at positively from the institutional point of view. May be a couple of quarters is going to be weak, but these are good prices to enter these stocks.


What areyou telling your clients to invest and buy in the current market even before elections?
We are in an advisory position only, so we do not invest ourselves. But I will tell what I have been advising my clients and two or three things have remained pretty steady in the last six to nine months. 

Reliance has been our top pick and it continues to be there and we have been continuously recommending Reliance to be bought at these prices. 

The second has been the corporate banks with ICICI, Axis and Yes Bank in that order are the three banks which I have been recommending. Now, HDFC Bank also seems to be getting in there, given that last quarter has been phenomenal for them. It has been doing well in last three-four quarters. 

The third one which we are recommending is autos, In autos, I believe, the worst is already priced in. For a quarter or two, you are going to see some kind of pressure coming in but I am very positive on the outlook on autos because as more and more money gets spent on or after the election, basically comes into rural hands. 
I believe the two-wheelers is going to be the first one which will take off. These are two or three sectors which we have been recommending to people.


Would you buy Maruti or are you worried about what they are trying to do in terms of their diesel engine phasing out strategy?
If I look at the pricing, there is some way to go as far as Maruti is concerned. 

As far as the diesel engine issue is concerned, it was quite expected because the prices go up dramatically for diesel cars under BS VI and that is why it is a right move on their part. We have to whether they have enough options as far as the petrol engine is concerned. But it is a bold move as far as Maruti is concerned.


Is the downturn in autos a buying opportunity or would you say it is a long and hard road of recovery for autos?
I do not think so. This is a long drawn out process basically because most of the stocks are down almost around 40% to 50% from the tops. Hero Moto is available around 7-7.5 times EV to EBITDA. JSW Steel is quoting at same kind of valuations. One should start look up these companies unless there is a decline in business and I do not believe there is a decline in business as far as two-wheelers or autos are concerned.

While penetration levels of two-wheelers is full, in four-wheelers, there is a huge scope for penetration. This is a good time to keep on accumulating these stocks."

A strong surge in market-wide rollovers suggests traders are largely pricing in a favourable election outcome and paying little heed to the weakening macro-economic indicators. 

The market-wide rollovers stood at 83 per cent. Nifty futures rollover stood at 81 per cent, which were way above 63 per cent rollovers seen in the last three series. 

Besides, FPI inflow also influenced the mood. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 3,785.73 crore worth of domestic stocks on Thursday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 4,069.98 crore, data suggested. 

Indian rupee gained some strength against the US dollar following a slight fall in crude oil prices. The domestic unit inched up by 16 paise against the dollar in early trade. However, it turned almost flat soon after some buying of the greenback by banks and exporters.

It was followed by Axis Bank which gained nearly 3 per cent. The private-sector lender too had posted its March quarter numbers on Thursday. The bank moved back in the black as asset quality of the lender improved for the fourth straight quarter in Q4FY19 coupled with double-digit fall in provisions.

63,2019-04-27,JSW,"Mumbai: Tata Steel’s stabilising debt profile has prompted analysts to increase their target price and upgrade profit estimates after the fourth-quarter earnings. The stock, analysts believe, could give returns of up to 60 per cent in the next one year with continued reduction in debt from internal accruals and divestment of noncore businesses.

The March quarter consolidated EBITDA increased 12 per cent QoQ and 16 per cent YoY to Rs 7,510 crore, surpassing consensus estimates, mainly driven by heavy destocking across the group and higher margins in Europe. Margins, however, contracted in India. The company repaid Rs 10,100 crore of debt in the quarter.

The stock, which rallied 10 per cent so far this year, ended 6.67 per cent higher at Rs 545 on Friday. Currently, Tata Steel is trading at 6.31 times its trailing 12 months earnings, cheaper compared with peers such as JSW Steel and SAIL.

Due to the combined impact of EBITDA upgrades and lowerthan-expected debt, several analysts have increased their price target.

“Tata Steel remains our preferred play on the steel cycle, given the stabilising debt profile and impending Tata Steel Europe-Thyssen JV,” said Ashutosh Somani, analyst, JM Financial.

According to the management, the company’s net debt is expected to come down by another Rs 2,300 crore with divestment of SEA operations. However, debt taken to buy Usha Martin's steel business could offset the impact of the reduction in net debt through divestments.

Bloomberg
Tata Steel incurred capex of Rs 9,090 crore in FY19 and has guided for an FY20 outlay of Rs 8,000 crore, with the primary expenditure on the KPO-II project. It approved the merger of Tata Steel BSL with Tata Steel. Tata Steel BSL, along with Usha Martin, is expected to deliver an additional 1MT of steel volumes in FY20.

Investec raised its target price from Rs 750 to Rs 800, and JM Financial from Rs 683 to Rs 715. Motilal Oswal Securities has raised the target price by 45 per cent to Rs 533 whereas IIFL has raised it to Rs 621 from Rs 618. JPMorgan and Credit Suisse maintained their targets at Rs 880 and Rs 628, respectively.

“Going ahead, we see value enablers for the stock, such as restructuring of European operations, cash accretion of $327 million from part divestment of southeast Asian operations and enhanced focus on profitable domestic operations,” said Amit Dixit, analyst, Edelweiss Securities. “We believe domestic operations are better placed compared with peers to tide over the current subdued operating environment.”"
64,2019-04-28,JSW,"Traditionally Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) have been known to draw the heftiest salaries and the biggest perks. Not anymore. Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) have begun to overthrow CEOs as the top earners in companies as the increasingly volatile world puts CFOs centrestage.

An ETCFO analysis of the compensation structure of the top 1600 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) reveals this rising trend. Our study found that CFOs of 50 companies in the list, or about 3%, were paid higher compensation for the 2017-18 period.

Half of these organisations have their finance chiefs drawing higher income than the business heads. A couple of reasons could explain the higher pay: 36% of these finance heads joined the company earlier than the business heads; 41% of them are a promoter in the company. The remaining 23% of the finance chiefs neither joined ahead of their MD and CEO, nor are they a promoter director. Surprisingly, most of the companies that house the latter 23% of finance chiefs have their promoters working as MD and CEO. This anomaly can be explained.

“Sometimes promoters take less salary, and they earn through dividends,” says Amit Agarwal, Managing Partner with an executive search firm, Stanton Chase India. 

In the case of the other 25 companies that see the finance chiefs taking home the most pay, it turns out that the MD and CEO of these firms is also the Director Finance. 

The research shows that infrastructure and manufacturing firms tend to pay the top bucks to retain their finance heads. The top five companies who pay their CFOs the highest are JSW Steel, Rural Electrification Corp (REC), Oil India Ltd, National Aluminium and Jyothy Laboratories.

JSW Steel’s Sheshagiri Rao is the highest paid CFO. He drew Rs 21.10 cr last fiscal, almost 72% higher than the compensation paid to the steel maker’s CEO, Vinod Nowal.

He is followed by Ullas Kasaragod Kamath, joint MD and CFO of Jyothy Laboratories, who earned Rs 7.29 cr while his Chairman and Managing Director, Ramachandran Panjan Moothedath, earned Rs 4.02 cr.

These are the top five companies where the CFO weighs more than the MD and CEO. 


EVOLVING ROLE
The role of the CFO has evolved rapidly in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis as companies grapple the spiralling volatility, complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity (VUCA) in the world, experts say. The advent of technology has only added to the expectations from a CFO. And so has their salaries.

“When roles evolve you have to pay for that skill set. Every CFO will not have that capability, but the ones who do they ask for a premium,” says Shailja Dutt, Founder & Chairperson, Stellar Search, an executive recruiting firm.

The CFOs of the new world are expected to de risk the business and adapt to the changing environment. Their roles have expanded to managing not just the fiscal aspects but also the business/operational aspects of the company. 

Our survey looked at listed entities. However, this trend of CFOs earning the most is seen across the business ecosystem, even among unlisted companies and MSMEs, experts say.

“There are almost 20-25% companies (in the unlisted universe) where CFOs are really well paid, more than her peers and in some cases more than the CEO,” says Stellar Search’s Dutt.

As the financial world gets more complex and the compliances increase the role of the CFO will only increase. An agile CFO who can quickly adapt will be in high demand.

“There is a new concept called CFO++, she will be the most trusted person in the company,” says Kris Lakshmikanth, Founder CEO & MD of the boutique executive search firm, The Head Hunters.

His firm now conduct two searches, one for a traditional CFO and the other for CFO++, he says. But, what is CFO++? Lakshmikanth says the CFO++ will have to interact with multiple external agencies like private equity, media and venture capitalists. He cites JSW Steel’s Seshagiri Rao as an example of CFO++.


DEMAND-SUPPLY MISMATCH
As demand for highly agile CFOs grows, recruiters are realising that there are not enough candidates who meet the rising expectations of the corporate world. Agarwal of Stanton Chase, who specialises in CFO hiring, says though companies are ready to pay higher salaries they are still not getting the right person. 

Companies are hungry for funds and one of the biggest expectations of a CFO is that she brings in the funds. “CFOs good at raising funds is still an important skill, but there is not enough talent out there,” Agarwal says.

He acknowledges the fact that in the current economic situation there is lack of funds in the market.

Recent changes like demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax has only served to dramatically change the business environment in India. As compliances increase, this trend of CFOs earning the most is likely to grow. 

“So, in the good old days, the market was not competitive in India but depending on the industry, circumstances and the environment CFOs salary can be more than the CEO,” says Lakshimanth.

65,2019-04-29,JSW,"KOLKATA: Banks would realise just about a quarter of their claims from 12 corporate debt resolution cases in the January-March period, dashing hopes for higher bad loan recovery in the last quarter of the fiscal.

The lenders will receive merely 17% of the Rs 29500 crore dues from Alok Industries, raising doubts over the future realization.

“This is a matter of serious concern. This shows that either there are no tangible assets to back the loans or the assets were overvalued,” United Bank of India chief executive, Ashok Kumar Pradhan, said.

The overall bad loan recovery through bankruptcy courts has remained dismal in the first two years of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Banks could realise 43% of the claims in 94 loan default cases that have been resolved after the corporate insolvency resolution process came into effect from December 2016, data from Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India showed.

However, the extent of recovery has been a concern ever since. JSW Steel offered about Rs 19,300 crore for Bhushan Power & Steel which was saddled with debt of Rs 47300 crore, while Electrosteel Steels’ Rs 13300 crore debt was resolved at Rs 5300 crore.

About 1858 corporate debts have been admitted into National Company Law Tribunals by end of March, 2019. Of these, 152 have been closed on appeal or review or settled, 91 have been withdrawn; 378 have ended in liquidation. Just about 94 cases have been resolved or 13% of the total cases admitted for resolution.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India said 75% of the companies ending in liquidation (283 out of 378) were earlier with BIFR or defunct with no economic value in most of them.

In the March quarter, the realisation by banks was 24% of their claims, in comparison to 43% overall.

“The 24% does not mean banks had to write off 76% of their claims,” explained Vinod Kothari, a senior chartered accountant. In fact, he said, a large part of the claims might have been provided for by way of bad loan provisions over time.

Most banks have provided 75-100% for bankruptcy cases and therefore recovery against such cases would add directly to their profitability to the extent of provision made.

“Once the deadwood of the past is cleared the rate may improve,” Kothari said."
70,2019-04-30,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market trod water on Tuesday, as investors resorted to profit booking on disappointment over March quarter earnings of select bank and auto heavyweights, including YES Bank and Hero MotoCorp. 

Weak global sentiment, a 1 per cent rise in crude oil prices, caution ahead of US Fed policy review and speculation over key macroeconomic data such as March fiscal deficit and infrastructure output data were the other key factors that hit investors’ risk appetite. 

Gains in IT shares, including those of Infosys, HCl Technologies and TCS, despite a stronger rupee, helped the market pare much of the losses. 

""Investors resorted to profit booking as weak results from banks and auto hit investor sentiment. However, a late recovery in IT and metal stocks helped minimise losses,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Sensex closed 36 points lower at 39,031 while Nifty settled 7 points down at 11,748.

68,2019-04-30,JSW,"Next two quarters may remain challenging but from a 12-months’ or a 18-months’ perspective, the stock remains quite 
  
 
  attractive, said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Head Equity Sales & Advisory, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW.  Edited excerpts: 


Yes Bank is on everyone’s radar after posting the abysmal numbers. The provisions have come in nine-fold higher at Rs 3,660 crore and a net loss of Rs 1,500 crore. Are you looking at this as a start to cleaning up the mess that was left behind or do you see this as a major challenge for Yes Bank in terms of capital raising exercise?
It was clearly a big disappointment from the financial space. These numbers clearly show that the clean-up process has begun. Just to give you a perspective, the stock already had corrected in August from about Rs 404 to Rs 150 or thereabouts in November itself. Now it is on course to revival. What remains to be seen from our perspective is how the new management is able to adapt to its business model. 

If you look at the overall growth over the last three to four years, it was largely led by the advances to certain highly sensitive, high-risk sectors and now that they will have to really go a bit slow and a calibrated approach will have to be taken. The growth over the next few quarters will remain muted. More importantly, one has to see how the management is able to change their liability franchise which is not so great compared to some of the other banks. 

The next couple of quarters are going to be extremely crucial for the stock price performance. We believe that the stock has corrected and is looking attractive. Next two quarters may remain challenging but from a 12-months’ or a 18-months’ perspective, the stock remains quite attractive. We have kept a hold rating on the stock with a target price of about Rs 275.


What is in store for steel as a sector in terms of earnings?
The Tata Steel numbers are not so great, particularly their India numbers. Operating profit per tonne was okayish and our belief has been that though European business has shown a bit of an improvement, there is not much clarity in terms of how the overall environment for steel will pan out over the next one year or so, given that we are seeing a bit of a weakness in Chinese data points. 

At the same time, iron ore prices have seen some kind of an uptick. Our belief is that the companies which are more integrated in nature like Tata Steel or SAIL, are not that well placed whereas a JSW Steel has been our preferred stock. So, within the steel sector, we would go with JSW Steel which has a much better balance sheet and management capabilities to deal with volatility in the steel cycle. 


What are your expectations from Kotak? Do you think commentary as well the spat with RBI may take the centrestage?
We are looking at a very stable set of numbers from Kotak Bank. We are looking at about 21% growth in net interest income. The overall net interest margins will remain in the at 3.6% or thereabouts. We might be able to see a very healthy loan growth of 24%. Kotak has been growing with a very decent rate with a very good asset quality and franchise of other portfolio and fee income. We are extremely positive on Kotak Bank both from a quarterly numbers perspective as well as from investment perspective over the next 12 months. It remains our preferred pick.



At what price would you like to buy Yes Bank? Or would you rather focus on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank?
It is difficult to pinpoint a specific price level but the way we look at the whole Yes Bank episode is that the stock has corrected more than 60% from August till November. Now, there is a new management in place and they have started the clean-up process. So, next two or three quarters are going to be challenging. 

Particularly with respect to their liability franchise and focus on the working capital part versus the risky business that the companies was doing, the overall growth expectations are going to be muted. At the same time, at this particular valuation, once you see some kind of improvement in the numbers, the stock will start reacting very fast because it is a high beta stock. 

Just to give you a parallel, when Axis Bank reported extremely high NPLs in the watch list, that was a time that the stock made a bottom. It is going to be extremely difficult for anybody to finetune and when the management starts reporting better numbers, over the next two quarters, it is going to be very tricky. But the downside from current level in Yes Bank would not be more than 20-22%."

About 1,858 corporate debts have been admitted into the National Company Law Tribunals(NCLT) by end of March, 2019. Of these, 152 have been closed on appeal or review or settled, 91 have been withdrawn; 378 have ended in liquidation. Just about 94 cases have been resolved or 13% of the total cases admitted for resolution.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India said 75% of the companies ending in liquidation (283 out of 378) were earlier with BIFR or defunct with no economic value in most of them.

“The 24% does not mean banks had to write off 76% of their claims,” explained Vinod Kothari, a senior chartered accountant. In fact, he said, a large part of the claims might have been provided for by way of bad loan provisions over time.

Most banks have provided 75-100% for bankruptcy cases and therefore recovery against such cases would add directly to their profitability to the extent of the provision made. “Once the deadwood of the past is cleared the rate may improve,” Kothari said."

15,2019-05-02,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Paints will rely on captive consumption from JSW Steel colour coated business to generate initial demand for the newly created venture that aims to earn Rs 2,000 crore worth revenue in the next three years.

Launched on Thursday, the Sajjan Jindal-led JSW group’s JSW Paints entered the highly competitive paints industry in India with an initial investment of Rs 600 crore. The company has built two facilities- a 25,000 kilo litres coil coating facility at Vasind in Maharashtra for industrial demand and another 100,000 kl water-based decorative paints facility in Vijayanagar in Karnataka.

The latter will ramp up capacity to 200,000 kl in the next 18 months over which time the company's investment will also increase to Rs 1,000 crore, Parth Jindal, MD of JSW Paints, told reporters at the launch. 

Initial industrial demand is secured from group company JSW Steel's growing demand for coil coating paints as it is nearly tripling its colour coated steel capacity to 2 MT over a year and a half. The company alone will need 40,000 kl of paint in a year, amounting to revenue contribution of about Rs 1,000 crore to the new paints venture.

""We would be catering to JSW Steel's requirements as well as that of other steel players like Uttam Galva, Essar Steel etc… We believe that with continued growth in the colour coated (steel) segment and with JSW Steel being the market leader there, JSW Paints has a right to win in that area,"" Jindal said. Industrial segment will contribute 25% of the business' revenue with the major contribution coming from the decorative segment.

The company is looking to launch in all markets of west and south India by September with a pan-India presence planned to be achieved in the next three years. The revenue target will be met over three years when it achieves full capacity utilisation.

India's organised paints industry is expected to cross Rs 50,000 crore by value by 2020 with CAGR of 15% and this price-sensitive space is dominated by majors like Kansai Nerolac and Asian Paints. By 2025, JSW Paints aims to break into the top 3 paints brands with a market share of 10% and its strategy is to position itself as a paint maker that offers eco-friendly products with a uniform competitive pricing across the colour spectrum. With this venture, the group has added another vertical to its consumer facing businesses that already includes JSW Cement and JSW Furniture launched last month."

9,2019-05-02,JSW,"NEW DELHI: NSE barometer Nifty50 has been consolidating in a broad range between 11,550 and 11,850 since March-end. The lower end of this range has offered strong support on multiple occasions, but there has been lack of confidence at higher levels

Analysts say the index could soon attempt to break above the range. This may bode well for stocks across sectors.

At the market close on Tuesday, 30 stocks on NSE were showing a bullish bias on the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, charts.

The momentum indicator signalled bullish crossovers -- a sign of bullish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at possible upsides in the days ahead.

Many of these stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included ICICI Bank, JSW Steel, BPCL, Oil India, PVR, Hathway Cable and Havells India. Hexaware Technologies, FDC, DIC India, Mangalam Cement and Emmbi Industries also formed part of the list.





MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD to indicate ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data also showed some 86 stocks are showing bearish trends. The list included FMCG giant ITC, two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp, drug maker Biocon, debt-ridden Jaiprakash Associates and plastic product maker Jain Irrigation Systems.

Other stocks on this list included Adani Gas, Reliance Nippon Life, Gati, Rain Industries, Info Edge and Ajanta Pharma.









The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

For Nifty50, the hourly charts showed the index has formed a triangle within a triangle. “As per the overall structure, the pattern implication is likely to be bullish. This means the patterns can eventually break on the upside, allowing Nifty to head towards the 12,000 level in the short term,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan.

The daily Bollinger Bands are looking to expand after a sharp contraction, suggesting that the consolidation is near its maturity and a sharp move can be around the corner, Ratnaparkhi said.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of ICICI Bank shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip closed at Rs 405.75, down 0.36 per cent on NSE."

7,2019-05-02,JSW,"We are in the middle of probably one of the slowest auto cycles we have seen in a while, said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, Centrum Wealth, in an interview with ETNOW.  Edited excerpts:


In autos, how much of the current slowdown news is already in the price?
Considering most of the stocks have fallen by 40-45%, I would say the market was pre-empting it. But having said that, the commentary that we are hearing is it is not just a one month kind of a phenomena and FY20 is appearing to be fairly slowish kind of auto season. 

Keeping that into account, probably some of the stocks will remain subdued and we will also have to understand that considering the 125-130 crore population in India, the auto demand can be delayed, but cannot be denied. At some point, the demand will come back due to the sheer size of the population.

Keeping that into account, the whole cycle may be delayed by three months, six months or nine months. It is very difficult to predict at what point, the cycle will bottom out and demand will come back. There is a very good chance that if the stocks fall further from here, one can start accumulating purely as a contrarian opportunity, from next three-four years point of view. But yes, we are in the middle of probably one of the slowest auto cycles we have seen in a while.


What about cement? Barring ACC, both UltraTech and Ambuja have delivered ahead of street estimates. Is there still a buying opportunity here?
Definitely. After a while, cement is staging a comeback. Even though cement was expected to outperform. there was a clear slowdown and a clear lack of leadership from cement for a while. But UltraTech and Ambuja let us hope that this time, whatever they deliver will sustain and also in some regions, the pricing power is coming back. 

If there is a rub-off of the overall government push in the infra side on to cement demand as well, there is a very good chance that cement stocks can surprise. Stocks like Ambuja have not done anything in terms of the stock price performance for last few years. They are now available at fairly stable levels. If there is any surprise, it may be more on the positive side.

This is a good space to keep an eye on. It may not be as strong as select banks but nevertheless, it is a good space to be in. After a long time. we are seeing good action in the cement.


What is your take on some of these real estate names and Godrej Properties which has come out with a fantastic set of numbers? Which side of the fence are you in?
Real estate is very difficult space to be considering. There were so many pockets of damage in real estate for so many years. If somebody wants to play the interest rate cycle going down, then you want to play real estate. But then, banking is a lot more easier space to play that thing. We are not that comfortable on real estate as a theme. However, if somebody wants to bet on the space, names like Godrej Properties will stand out head and shoulders above the remaining players considering it is a relatively national brand and also has the backing of an industrial house. 

In India, it is rare to see an industrial house entering the real estate space. Keeping that into account, Godrej Properties is a fascinating space to be. If you look at their business model, they are not buying the land and rather are entering into tie ups with land owners. That way, they are keeping the capex low and they at best will be spending only the development portion. 


What is the view on steel? The LME index overnight has seen its second worst day of 2019 but Tata Steel came out with good numbers and that has brought about some flurry of activity across JSW Steel as well. Is this a space one can buy on dips?
Global trade and economies are almost in clear slowdown with loads of macro indicators. But if China and US end up signing the agreement in the next one or two months, there is a good chance that steel may see a tactical up move because of the anticipation that things may settle down in the largest two economies.

Locally, the government has been increasing its infra spending to stimulate the GDP a bit and for even election-related developments. Post election, if the government continues spending, there may be good demand for steel locally as well. Keeping all those things into account, steel has a lot to look forward to in the next two to three months.

Tata Steel has pleasantly surprised in terms of performance but at the end of the day, it is better at some point to keep booking the profits. It is highly linked to the global economic cycle and the global economy is not out of the woods."

27,2019-05-06,JSW,"A commodity or cyclical business is directly linked to the economy and global factors. If you are planning to time the market considering the outlook given by economists or market experts, think twice. 

In an interaction with ETNow, NYU Stern professor Aswath Damodaran said if someone buys cyclical and commodity companies to play the cycle, then she is asking for trouble.

“The history of people predicting commodity price cycles is not a good one. When is the last time you heard an oil price expert actually get a forecast right? I do not know even why we listen to these guys anymore,” he said.

“Buy a good cyclical company for the right reasons. If you are buying an oil company, buy it not because you think oil prices will come back, but because it looks cheap at today’s oil price,” said Damodaran, considered an authority on valuations globally.

Metals and oil majors have delivered mixed returns to investors in last five years. While shares of NMDC, Oil India, JSPL, ONGC and SAIL plunged between 10 per cent and 35 per cent during May 2014-2019, others like Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco, JSW Steel, IOC and HPCL more than doubled investor wealth in the same period.

There is a perception that revenues of cyclical and commodity businesses normally increase during expansions and vice-versa.

The Indian equity market, where the benchmarks recently hit their all-time high levels, is looking expensive to investors from a price-to-earnings perspective. Sensex traded at a P/E of 28.90 times on May 3 against a five-year average of 21.60 times, indicating overvaluation at index levels.

So is it the right time to pick stocks? Damodaran said mean reversion works about 90 per cent of the times, and it is a fancy way of saying when things revert to the way they used to be.

However, he also cautioned that when structural models change, mean reversion stops working. “When you look at the Shiller PE, it looks like it worked really well for that century, which was the 20th century. There are still people out there who feel stocks are overpriced and they used the Shiller PE to back it up,” he said.

“My reacion to them is that the model might have changed and using the Shiller PE or any other historical number as your basis for investing is extremely dangerous. So one thing I had asked people to look at is whether they think the world today is different than it was 20, 40 or 50 years ago. The answer is, ‘absolutely’. If the world is different, there is a danger here to assume that history will repeat itself,” Damodaran said."

While the market is in negative terrain, analysts are advising a calculated, stock-specific approach. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 10 stocks that analysts say can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks. 


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking


Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,700 | Stop loss: Rs 2,490
On the daily chart, this stock has bounced from the strong demand zone formed in the Rs 2,500 – 2,515 range. The said levels twice acted as strong reversal points in last five months and a bullish hammer formation on the weekly chart at these crucial levels does create optimism. In addition, we are witnessing a positive divergence with prices making a lower low. However, the RSI oscillator is not making a lower low, indicating accumulation in the stock at lower levels.


JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 337 | Stop loss: Rs 293
After consolidating in a range for more than three months, this stock has broken the range on the upside, confirming a bullish reversal ‘Cup N Handle’ pattern on the daily chart. The said breakout is supported with a bullish candle and increasing volume. In addition, momentum indicator RSI is placed in positive zone supporting the buy call. “Looking at all the above evidence, a strong upside from the current levels cannot be ruled out. So, we recommend buying this stock at current levels for a target of Rs 337. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 293,” Bhosale said.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in 

Exide Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 227 | Stop loss: Rs 209
After the recent correction, this counter appears to have reached its critical supports at Rs 209 on short-term charts from where it rallied in the past. In Friday’s session, it almost tested the said support with a low of Rs 210 and smartly rebounded. ""Positional traders are advised to plan a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on dips between Rs 212–210. Look for a target of Rs 227 and keep a stop loss at Rs 209,"" said Mohammad.


DLF | Buy | Target price: Rs 197 | Stop loss: Rs 169
This counter appears to have posted a near-term bottom around Rs 170 after retracing 62 per cent from the lows of Rs 143 to Rs 209 levels. Moreover, with Friday’s strong price action on the back of relatively higher volumes, this counter closed above its nine-day ema which curtailed the upmove on the intermittent pullback attempts. ""Sustaining above Rs, 170 this counter can stage a decent recovery and positional traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 197 with a stop loss of Rs 169,"" Mohammad said.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

Bharat Forge | Buy | Target price: Rs 535 | Stop loss: Rs 455
This stock has made a double bottom formation pattern on the daily chart, taking support near Rs 456 and has produced a positive bullish candle in the daily chart to signify strength and has potential to rise further in the coming days. The RSI has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy. ""With favourable indicators supporting the positive bias, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 535, keeping a stop loss of Rs 455,"" said Parekh.


Reliance Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,520 | Stop loss: Rs 1,350
This stock has almost given a breakout above the previous peak level of Rs 1,412 and has indicated a positive bias with a rising trend which can take the stock to the new highs in the coming days. The RSI is rising with favourable indicators which have made the chart look attractive.

Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities

Tata Motors | Buy | Target price: Rs 232 | Stop loss: Rs 195
The recent downtrend in this automobile stock seems to be ending in the short-term. Currently, the stock is in the process of forming a near-term bottom reversal pattern. A positive sequential movement, like higher tops and bottoms, is observed and the present decline could be in line with the new higher bottom formation at Rs 200 level. The present decline is also expected to take support on the neckline of the inverted head and shoulder pattern at Rs 200 level. This is a positive indication and one may expect a sharp upside bounce from near the support in the coming week. 


Kotak Mahindra Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,535 | Stop loss: Rs 1,335
This stock was in a sharp trending upmove over the past few months. It has moved up as per the positive sequence of higher tops and bottoms. It witnessed an upside breakout of a range movement last week and sustained above the hurdle of the previous high at Rs 1,425 of July 2018. Volumes rose during the upmove and the weekly 14-period RSI currently shows a positive indication. The overall positive chart set up in the Kotak Mahindra Bank signals a long trading opportunity.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager- Technical Analysis, YES Securities

Federal Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 104-109 | Stop loss: Rs 92
On the daily chart, Federal Bank has broken out from a bullish flag pattern on high volumes, triggering a start of fresh upmove in the stock. Further, on the weekly chart, it is on the verge of a breakout from an inverted head and shoulders pattern suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions. The RSI has turned upward after forming a positive reversal on the daily chart suggesting bullishness dominant in the stock.


KNR Constructions | Buy | Target price: Rs 270-280 | Stop loss: Rs 228
On the daily chart, KNR Constructions is on the verge of a breakout from a falling wedge pattern neckline placed at Rs 248. A successful breakout backed by healthy volumes can trigger a bear trend reversal taking the stock higher. Moreover, following a sharp rally from the levels of Rs 195 backed by healthy volumes, the stock has witnessed minor correction on thin volumes which resulted in indicators cooling off from the overbought territory of 83 to 50 now. The RSI has formed a positive divergence at the 40-level and turned north, indicating bullishness in the stock.

The percentage of pledged promoter holdings declined to 2.83 per cent in the March 2019 quarter compared to 2.98 per cent in December 2018 quarter, the Kotak Equities report said on Q4 Pledged shareholding report.

Outstanding promoters pledged shares were Rs 1.95 lakh crore, which is about 1.38 per cent of the total BSE-500 Index's market capitalisation in March 2019.

Promoters of 116 companies pledged their holdings among BSE-500 Index. Six companies had more than 90 per cent of their promoter holdings pledged.

The report said that pledging of shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoter shares.

The main highlights of March 2019 pledged holding disclosures as per the report are companies whose promoters pledged more than 95 per cent of their holdings are CG Power and Industrial, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital and Sterlite Technologies.

The highest increase in pledged promoter holdings are JK Tyre & Industries, Reliance Capital, Reliance Infrastructure, Dish TV India and VA Tech Wabag.

Companies in which pledged promoter holdings declined included -- Granules India, Strides Pharma, Reliance Communications, Coffee Day Enterprises and Bajaj Consumer Care.

Zee Entertainment and Dish TV, the companies from the Subhash Chandra-led Essel group, have their promoter pledging 66.2 percent and 94.6 percent of the ownership pledged, respectively and lead the chart.

A report by brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities comes amid issues over pledged shareholding of promoters after the NBFC crisis that began with the defualts of IL&FS last September, where massive share price erosions have led to a slew of unprecedented actions, including the financiers being dragged to courts for taking precautionary measures.

Promoters typically raise money for their other businesses by pledging a part of their holdings in listed entities as a security. The Anil Ambani-led Reliance group and Essel group have had the going tough.

The promoters have pledged 98.3 percent of the holding in Reliance Infrastructure and 96.9 percent in Reliance Capital, the report said.

The report, which is based on an analysis of top 500 listed firms on the BSE, said percentage of pledged promoter holdings by value has come down in the March 2019 quarter in comparison to the preceding December quarter.

The percentage of pledged promoter holdings declined to 2.83 percent in March quarter from 2.98 percent in the December 2018 quarter, it said.

However, one Anil Ambani-led company, the bankrupt Reliance Communications, has seen a decline in the quantum of shares pledged by the promoters during the quarter, the report said, adding Granules India, Strides Pharma, Coffee Day Enterprises and Bajaj Consumer Care also saw a dip.

From the companies that make the 50-share benchmark Nifty, Zee Entertainment leads with the highest pledge at 66.2 percent, followed by Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel at 46.3 percent and Gautam Adani-led Adani Ports & SEZ at 42.3 percent, says the report."
30,2019-05-08,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel, the lone bidder for Asian Colour Coated Ispat Ltd., has increased its offer for the company by 25% to Rs 1,500 crore, a person aware of the development said.

The revision came after ACCIL’s resolution professional reached out to JSW Steel, following which a meeting was held in New Delhi last week.

JSW Steel had initially offered Rs 1,200 crore, of which Rs 800 crore would go to secured lenders including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank and Rs 400 crore would go to unsecured lenders led by Axis Bank.

ET reported last month that the resolution professional had sought an extension of the bid deadline, even after JSW Steel had already made a binding offer for the asset. People aware of the matter told ET that resolution professional Kuldip Kumar Bassi found the bid unsatisfactory because banks would have had to forgo 76% of their loans to ACCIL, which has debt of Rs 5,000 crore.

The resolution professional had also received fresh interest for the asset from TPG Capital, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Blackstone-backed International Asset Reconstruction Company even as the 270-day period expired on April 16.

The New Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal is scheduled to hear the matter on May 13. Voting on JSW Steel’s revised offer may take place on Thursday or Friday, the person said. Bassi and JSW Steel declined to comment.

JSW Steel is almost tripling its colour coated steel capacity to 2 million tonnes over a year and a half as demand for the value-added product rises. ACCIL makes cold-rolled, galvanised and colour coated steel products and the acquisition of its 300,000-tonne capacity fits into JSW’s strategy of enhancing its downstream capacity.

ArcelorMittal had also initially shown interest in ACCIL but refrained from bidding until the acquisition of Essar Steel goes through."

Board meetings (Full list)



Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on KEC International with a target price of ₹350. KEC's fourth quarter numbers were a mixed bag-while revenue and EBITDA missed estimates, balance sheet improvement was encouraging, said Edelweiss. While order book and order pipeline are healthy, the management's 15-20% revenue guidance for FY20 looks a tad on the lower side, probably indicating persistence of a few domestic execution challenges, the brokerage said..

• Anand Rathi has maintained buy rating on Visaka Industries with a target price of ₹495. Higher selling and branding expenses along with losses due to a delay in the Jhajjar plant commencement and losses in ATUM resulted in Visaka’s restrained operating performance in the fourth quarter, said Anand Rathi. The yarn division’s better performance is another positive, said Anand Rathi. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Shriram Transport Finance Company with a target price of ₹ 960. The brokerage expects a pick-up towards second half with 14%-15% growth in AUM in FY20-21. Asset quality showed some improvement with a fall in stage-3 loans to 8.4%, but the brokerage is concerned by aggressive growth in rural markets and business loans. Clarity on the group structure is awaited and may be a medium-term overhang, said CLSA. The stock ended up 0.29% at ₹1,030.85 on Thursday.

• Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Titan Company with a target price of ₹1,100. Titan continues to execute strongly in terms of design aspect, new customer acquisition and store expansion coupled with strong market share gains continuing since demonetisation given industry headwinds, said Jefferies. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained buy rating on Brigade Enterprises with a target price of ₹290. Brigade ended FY19 with a strong performance on the residential business, with 83% YoY growth in pre-sales at ₹16.5 billion and an exit quarter performance of ₹5.2 billion, aspiring for a 30% YoY increase in FY20 on the higher base, the brokerage said.

39,2019-05-10,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The US-China trade war turned uglier on Friday, with the US hiking tariffs to 25 per cent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods even as talks continued in pursuit of a trade deal.

Hopes of a trade deal helped most Asian and European markets traded in the green. But the Indian market failed to mirror that hope, as local factors, including uncertainty over poll outcome and mixed March quarter numbers kept sentiment depressed. 

""While the US-China trade war remains a concern, the domestic market is reacting to local factors, especially the uncertainty over the election outcome,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICIdirect. 

We walk you through the highlights of Friday's session:


Investors' losses inflateIn the last eight days’ market fall, investors have lost nearly Rs 6.42 lakh crore as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed stocks dropped to Rs 1,46,66,587.70 crore from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on Friday, April 26. On Friday, investors lost around Rs 24,000 crore. 


186 stocks hit 52-week lowsVodafone Idea, Thyrocare Technologies, Shriram City Union Finance, Motherson Sumi Systems, Hindustan Copper and Graphite India were among 186 stocks that hit 52-week lows on BSE, while DCM Shriram, MT Educare, 63 Moons Technologies and Solara Active Pharma Sciences were among 27 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


Metal pack worst hitThe BSE metal index lost 1.54 per cent to finish at 10,701, emerging top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE. Out of total 10 components, only two – SAIL (up 0.77 per cent) and JSW Steel (up 0.61 per cent) –ended in the green. Tata Steel (down 6.10 per cent), Vedanta (down 1.27 per cent) and Jindal Steel & Power (down 1.07 per cent) led the losers. 


SBI shares jump 3% on Q4Shares of State Bank of India closed 2.94 per cent higher at Rs 308 after the bank posted Rs 838.40 crore profit for March quarter against a Rs 7,718.17 crore loss reported for the corresponding quarter last year. Analysts showed faith in the prospects of the bank. ""A decline in credit costs, improving asset quality profile, and better loan growth prospects should result in normalisation of earnings from next financial year. A modest credit-deposit ratio at 75 per cent will additionally aid margins. We maintain our positive stance on the stock,"" said Mona Khetan, Banking Analyst, Reliance Securities.


Tata Steel meltsShares of Tata Steel fell 6.10 per cent to Rs 487.30, extending their losing run into the seventh session. In the last seven sessions, the stock has come off 12.43 per cent. Shares of the company extended the losses after reports that Germany’s Thyssenkrupp has called off the proposed joint venture deal with the company. 


PNB Housing Finance surges 12%Shares of PNB Housing Finance surged 12.08 per cent to Rs 782.35, ad day after it posted a 47 per cent jump in March quarter profit on stronger net interest margin and lower provisions. 


HCL Tech cracks 4%Shares of HCL Technologies closed 4.07 per cent lower at Rs 1,086 on disappointing FY20 guidance. Global financial firm Morgan Stanley maintained its underweight view on HCL Tech with a price target of Rs 931, highlighting that revenue growth was better during the quarter while margin was weaker. Phillip Capital maintained a ‘neutral’ view on the stock but cut the price target to Rs 1,020 from Rs 1,040 earlier. 


49 stocks ready to look upMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 49 counters on BSE, signalling that these stocks may see some upside in the coming sessions. Among them were Karur Vysya Bank, PNB Housing Finance, Banaras Beads, Den Networks and Chemcrux Enterprises. However, ONGC, Ruchi Soya Industries, PVR, Dr Reddy's Labs and Trident Texofab were among the 38 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.


53 stocks in the oversold zoneMomentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 53 stocks in the oversold zone on BSE. Among those stocks were Escorts, Mercator, Eveready Industries, Jyothy Laboratories and Birla Cable. On the other hand, DCM Shriram, Ashari Agencies, Esaar (India) and Source Natural Foods were among the 20 stocks that appeared in the overbought zone."
40,2019-05-11,JSW,"Coal is dirty. Really dirty. There is no getting around that fact.

It is responsible for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. Mining coal wreaks havoc on the environment and on the people who live there. Besides CO2, burning coal produces pollutants like mercury, sulfur dioxide, which is linked to acid rain, and particulate matter, which causes respiratory illnesses.

Tackling climate change is impossible without reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, especially coal. The problem is, coal is cheap and developing economies like India prefer low-cost fuel sources.

Coal is the largest source of electricity in the world. Coal-fired plants generate 72% of India’s electricity. This, combined with the growth of coal-consuming industrial sectors like steel, is why the solid fuel source will continue to be integral to India’s economy in the next couple of decades. This is despite the government’s ambitious plans to increase generation of renewable energy.

According to BP Energy Outlook 2019, coal’s share in India’s primary energy consumption will decline from 56% in 2017 to 48% in 2040. But that is still nearly half of the total energy mix and way ahead of any other source of energy. Oil’s share, the second largest, will decline from 29% to 23%, and the contribution of renewables will rise fivefold to 16%. Even the NITI Aayog, which replaced the Planning Commission, in a 2017 report estimated the share of coal in the energy mix in 2040 to be at least 44%. “There are scenarios where the share of coal can even increase,” says Rahul Tongia, a fellow with Brookings India, a think tank. One such scenario is if India falls well short of its ambitious targets in renewable energy.



India wants to increase its installed renewable energy capacity from 78 GW to 175 GW (1 GW = 1,000 MW) by March 2022. Of that 175 GW, 100 GW is supposed to be solar power. Moreover, India wants to nearly double the share of renewable power in its total installed capacity to 40% by 2030.

However, issues related to land acquisition, funding and policy continue to come in the way of these plans. Experts have said that it was unlikely that India would achieve these targets. Hence, the reliance on coal is not going to go down soon.



India was the world’s second largest producer of coal in 2017, the latest year for which data is available, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The country produced a tenth of the world’s coal, while China topped the list with 45% of global production. India was also the second largest coal importer, with a 16% share. China accounts for nearly half of global coal consumption, with India’s share at 13%.

Electricity generation is responsible for two-thirds of India’s coal consumption, steel and washery industries 7% and cement 1%, according to data from the ministry of coal. While the power sector uses non-coking or thermal coal, steel manufacturers use coking or metallurgical coal in the iron ore smelting process. Non-coking coal is also used by cement manufacturers as an energy source.



Around 87% of India’s proven coal reserves of nearly 150 billion tonnes is noncoking coal. That means India has to turn to imports to meet four-fifths of its coking coal requirements. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, says with India’s coking coal requirement more than tripling to 180 million tonnes (MT) by 2030, our reliance on imports will continue. Indian coking coal is of poorer quality than the imported variety, forcing certain industries to import a better quality of the commodity.

Even a fifth of our thermal coal requirement is imported. Union governmentowned Coal India, the world’s largest coal miner, accounted for 84% of India’s coal production of 675 MT in 2017-18. Coal demand outstrips domestic supply and will continue to do so, though the share of imports is expected to decline, according to rating agency CRISIL. Coal India aims to have an annual production of 1 billion tonnes in five years, a target it was originally expected to meet in 2019-20. This would be a key step to pare down our import dependence. But land acquisition, environmental and forest clearances stand in the way of reaching that milestone.



Questions sent to Coal India went unanswered. Coal-fired plants generated 72% of India’s electricity in 2018-19, according to the Central Electricity Authority. The thermal power sector, which includes coal- and gas-based plants, has had a difficult few years, especially in the private sector.

Lack of assured fuel supply and agreements to sell the power they generate, among other reasons, plunged the sector into a seemingly insurmountable crisis. The Union government last year identified 34 “stressed” coal-based projects with a total capacity of over 40 GW (India’s installed coal-fired capacity is 194 GW). These projects had outstanding loans of Rs 1.7 lakh crore.

Less than half the capacity has power purchase agreements and three-fourths have coal linkages. The government is looking to resolve the issues in the projects to keep the loans from turning bad. It has its task cut out. This mess has made industry wary of the sector as a whole. Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL, says most of the capacity addition in thermal power will be in the public sector.



A spokesperson at state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation, India’s largest thermal power producer, says while coal will remain the mainstay of the power sector for at least a decade, the focus will be on “competitive, environmentally complanit and flexible power generation from coal plants.”

There is an effort to make coal-fired plants more efficient by bringing down the amount of coal required to generate 1 MW and to make old coal-fired plants compliant with environment norms. JSW’s Rao says the company’s requirement of coking coal will not go up in proportion to the increase in steel production capacity due to the use of bigger and more efficient blast furnaces.

Aluminum is another sector that uses coal for its energy needs; 40% of its production cost goes into generating power. Rahul Sharma, CEO of Vedanta’s alumina business, says aluminium manufacturers should ideally be able to meet half their coal needs with captive coal blocks, with the rest being assured through linkages. Currently, the group has just one captive coal block with a capacity of 1.6 MT per annum, while its requirement is 25 MT. The block was awarded to Balco, a subsidiary of Vedanta.



CRISIL expects the plant load factor (PLF) of thermal power plants to increase from 61% in 2017-18 to 72% in 2022-2023 in response to demand for electricity growing at around 6.5% annually. PLF is the actual average power produced as a percentage of the maximum power that could have been generated in that period. India’s per capita electricity demand of 1,150 kilowatt hours is only a third of the global average. India’s peak electricity demand in 2018-19 (up to February) was 177 GW, most of which was met. India’s peak deficit has declined from 12.7% in 2009-10 to 0.8% in 2018-19.

Till battery technologies to store solar power improve and become cost-effective, the country’s peak electricity demand will have to be met by thermal power, especially as the outlook for hydel and nuclear power is not all that rosy. Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, says if the government has to provide 24X7 power for all, around 25 GW of capacity will have to be added.



One of the key reasons for the woes of the thermal power sector was the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision to cancel 204 coal blocks allocated since 1993, calling the allocations illegal and arbitrary. In 2015, the Union government passed a bill to award these blocks through auctions and allotments. The government has so far awarded 85 coal mines, including 24 captive blocks to the private sector, under the Coal Mines (Special Provision) Act, 2015. But CRISIL’s Prithiani sounds a note of caution: “For private companies that have won mines in auctions, their weak financial position and lack of PPAs is a bigger challenge than environmental issues.” In February 2018, the government decided to end the monopoly of Coal India.

Private companies could now bid for mines not just for their use, but also to sell the coal to others, which only Coal India could do till now. This was the biggest step in freeing up the sector since coal mines were nationalised in the early 1970s.



Though it has been more than a year since the announcement, there has been no auction yet for commercial mining and the terms of the auction are not yet clear. “For commercial mining to work, there should be no cap on prices. If there is a cap, there will be less competition,” says Vinay Prakash Goel, CEO for coal and mining businesses at Adani Enterprises, which operates nine coal blocks given to PSUs under the mining developer and operator model.

A Coal India official, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media, says commercial mining by the private sector will make the miner more competitive. “But we have seen what has happened with mines auctioned to the private sector. Getting things moving on the ground is very difficult.”

Even with its continued reliance on coal, India is expected to meet its commitment made under the Paris Agreement on climate change to cut emissions relative to the GDP by a third by 2030 from 2005 levels. India is the third largest CO2 emitter among countries but per capita, its emissions are only 40% of the global average, according to the IEA.



If the Indian economy is to continue to grow at 7%, the rise in electricity demand from industry and households cannot be met by wishing away coal-fired power, especially not till renewable energy becomes a reliable and affordable alternative to thermal power."

41,2019-05-13,JSW,"MUMBAI: With the plan to merge Tata Steel Europe (TSE) with German giant Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit in the continent abandoned, the brass at Tata Sons and Tata Steel may seek to recalibrate the latter’s highly leveraged balance sheet through sizeable asset sales. This may include exiting some international markets, said top officials close to the development.

The other immediate option would be to offload Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares as has been done before, one of the officials said.

Analysts are concerned about the minimal options available to Tata Steel, which has a total debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore.


'No Plan B in Place’
Having banked on transferring TSE’s debt of Rs 19,000 crore to the JV from its own balance sheet, Tata Steel’s growth plans could get disrupted, they said.


“About two years ago, the company had a rights issue, and if in trouble they could have another,” said one of the persons. “At the current price of Rs 487, Tata Steel’s share price is below the rights issue price of Rs 510 and significantly below the partly paid price of Rs 615 of shares issued in February 2018. The stock went to a high of Rs 720 then. This will really upset the minority shareholders who participated in the issue.”

Tata Steel officials didn’t respond to queries.

The two companies said on Friday that they were scrapping the merger plan because it wasn’t likely to win regulatory approval from the European Commission.



Tata Steel acquired Corus in 2007 for $13 billion at the peak of the previous steel cycle and at a high valuation. Its acquisition of Bhushan Steel’s assets last year was at the peak of the latest steel cycle, although the valuation was not as high, analysts said. Still, Tata Steel’s offer for Bhushan’s assets at Rs 35,200 crore did raise some eyebrows, they said. However, it was part of the wider strategy to focus on the domestic market.

The company had hoped to gain room to raise money for expanding its India business, which had become the priority, offering higher growth, greater profitability and, most importantly, better regulatory protection, analysts said.

Tata group officials said the plan’s failure meant that the enormous effort that went into the exercise since September 2017 had been a waste. “The M&A team at Tata Sons and the top management at Tata Steel had hoped to close the deal in March 2019. Worries started cropping up as the delay began. The group had no Plan B,” said a senior executive seeking anonymity.


COMPLICATED PLAN
Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their steel businesses in Europe to create a 50-50 joint venture company that would be the continent’s second-largest steel company after LN Mittal’s ArcelorMittal. Experts said investors such as ArcelorMittal and Liberty seemed to have done better on the acquisition front.

“The Tata group’s virtues are becoming its limitations. They bought assets at a premium whereas they should have bought it at deep discount like Mittal,” said a top fund manager seeking anonymity, adding that the merger plan with Thyssenkrupp was too complicated a deal. “There were far too many clearances required where they could get tripped. Thyssenkrupp too had been under attack by activist investors.”

A Tata group executive close to the development said, “Tata Steel will just have to monetise some of their good assets. What has happened is sheer bad luck.”

Steel prices are trending down with Chinese producers flooding global markets, having dropped by over 15% since peaking at the end of last year.

“Global scrap prices are at a three-month low. Scrap prices are good lead indicator for future price direction,” said Rahul Jain, metals analyst with Systematix. “Scrap weakness is a bit surprising given that iron ore prices are at highs. Also, in domestic markets, demand is weak, especially for flat products, of which auto is a big end user.”

Auto sales in India have slumped over the past year.

Analysts are worried that the European business will drain cash generated by profitable operations elsewhere.

“We are still upbeat on Tata Steel’s domestic story with a decent possibility of incremental capex being funded via own cash flows,” said Amit Dixit of Edelweiss. “However, the operating environment in Europe is challenging and with the European business back in the fold, we believe profitable domestic operations may have to support the European business, which is not cash neutral.”


EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S OBJECTIONS
Lowering the amount of money Tata Steel owes would improve its estimated debt to Ebidta (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) ratio from four times to three, providing room to borrow more and invest in the Indian operations. Tata Steel’s immediate peer JSW Steel has a debt to Ebidta ratio of two times. The scuttling of the JV plan could slow the company’s expansion plans. Tata Steel’s capital expenditure was Rs 9,000 crore in FY19 and it had guided another Rs 8,000 crore for FY20 (excluding Europe operations).

The European Commission had opened an “in-depth” investigation into the proposed merger in October last year over concerns that the deal between the two may reduce competition in the supply of various high-end steels. Following an agreed extension last month for further negotiations, Thyssenkrupp confirmed that it had submitted a “substantial” offer to the European Commission, the executive arm of the economic bloc.

Tata Steel had said on Friday that based on the feedback received from the agency, “it is increasingly clear that the Commission is not intending to clear the proposed joint venture as it expects substantial remedies in the form of sale of assets of the proposed venture”.

The proposed joint venture, Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel was to have a total workforce of 48,000 employees across 34 sites, producing about 21 million tonnes of steel a year with revenue of around 15 billion euros."
43,2019-05-14,JSW,"NEW DELHI: India fears China could soon start flooding excess steel into its market after the United States raised tariffs on Chinese products due to the escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies, according to three government sources and four industry officials.

 As a result, the Indian steel industry has asked the Indian government to put in so-called safeguard duties of as much as 25 percent to protect it from growing imports. These would be imposed on steel that the government determines has been dumped in India at prices below the cost of production.

 Since last year, China and the United States have been locked in a trade conflict as Washington seeks to fix the trade balance, currently tilted in favour of Beijing. The two nations have raised or threatened to raise tariffs on each other's goods, moves that could re-draw trade flows and that have threatened to derail the global economy.

 ""China has excess (steel) capacity and there is a concern they could re-route it through other countries like Vietnam and Cambodia into India,"" an Indian government source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

 ""Steel sector is vulnerable,"" the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitive nature of discussions.

 India, the world's second-largest steel producer, turned net importer in the year ended March 31, 2019 after a gap of three years. That is because the country lacks the capability to produce high-quality steel and has lost some of its global clients to cheaper exports from China, Japan and South Korea.

 ""China, Japan, Korea which are major exporters to U.S., Europe and Canada, because of trade actions, they are also diverting steel into India,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at JSW Steel Ltd, told Reuters.


DEMANDED SAFEGUARD DUTIES
 ""It is very much essential for government of India to increase the safeguard duty to 25 percent as soon as possible,"" said Rao. Currently, there are a range of such duty levels.

 Last month, steel companies JSW, Steel Authority of India , Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power - controlling over 45 percent of India's total steel production - met with government officials to ask for safeguards, according to a source who attended the meeting.

 During the meeting, Steel Secretary Binoy Kumar, the top bureaucrat in the Ministry of Steel, also said that the steel industry was at risk from global excess capacity, the source said.

 Kumar said India need to act soon to protect its fragile steel industry from predatory imports as it would be difficult to revive it if the situation was allowed to deteriorate for three-to-four years. However, he said a decision on safeguard duties has not yet been taken.

 The steel ministry did not respond to Reuters' emails and phone calls seeking comments. Neither did SAIL, Tata and JSPL.

 ""What we are seeing is that part of displaced exports is already making inroads,"" said Arnab Kumar Hazra, assistant secretary general at the Indian Steel Association, which represents major steel producers. There was therefore every reason to argue for safeguard duties given the perceived threat, he said.

 India had imposed a slew of safeguards in 2015-2017 on several steel products to curb cheaper imports and protect local industry, prompting Japan to refer India's behaviour to the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute panel.

 India's trade deficit with China jumped more than a nine fold over the past decade to $63.05 billion in the year ending March 2018.

 With the latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, India fears Beijing could also re-route exports of electronic items, toys, furniture and organic chemicals to India through other Southeast Asian nations.

 New Delhi and Beijing have been negotiating over greater market access as China wants to exports milk products and apples to India while New Delhi wants to sell China bovine meat, sources said."
48,2019-05-15,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market failed to hold the gains that it had logged on Tuesday as investors took money off the table amid mixed global cues.

YES Bank shares crack 8%Shares of YES Bank suffered a strong loss of 8.01 per cent to end the day at Rs 143.65 after former Reserve Bank Deputy Governor R Gandhi was appointed as additional director on the board. “Probably the market has taken the development negatively, thinking that the regulator wants to have a close watch on the books of the bank,” said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Global Securities. 


Jet shares extend fallShares of Jet Airways fell for the third consecutive day, ending the day 4.18 per cent down at Rs 123.70, in the wake of a series resignations by the company’s top brass. CEO Vinay Dube, CFO Amit Agarwal and head of human resources Rahul Taneja quit within a span of 24 hours, raising serious doubts over the revival of the debt-laden airline. In the last three days, shares of the company have come off nearly 19 per cent.


SpiceJet, IndiGo gain on Jet's miseryShares of SpiceJet jumped 7.59 per cent to Rs 131.15 while those of InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) climbed 2.93 per cent to Rs 1,608.55, gaining from the misery of the rival airline Jet Airways. Jet's troubles have offered opportunities to SpiceJet and IndiGo to fill supply gaps. A Care Ratings data showed Jet's market share fell from 19 per cent in 2016 to 10.3 per cent in 2019 before it ceased operations.


DHFL declines 8%Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) plunged 7.74 per cent to end at Rs 107.95 after the rating agency Icra downgraded the company's payouts or pass through certificates (PTCs). Icra has downgraded the PTCs issued under six mortgage loan securitisation transactions by DHFL from BBB (SO) to AA -(SO), a PTI report said. The rating agency revised the rating on the commercial paper worth Rs 850 crore of DHFL from A3+ Watch with Negative Implications to A4 Watch with Negative Implications on Monday.


Lupin shares fall after Q4 nosShares of Lupin closed 3.22 per cent down at Rs 783.10 even as it reported a strong set of March quarter numbers. The company said its standalone net profit for the quarter ended March 31 stood at Rs 542.78 crore, up 85.6 per cent, against Rs 292.46 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Meanwhile, the company said it is reviewing the details of a lawsuit filed in a US court accusing 21 generic medicine producers of hatching a conspiracy to fix prices.

46,2019-05-15,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Tata Steel has not given up on its plans of merging its business in Europe, a top company official said while terming the European Commission's feedback on the proposed joint venture with Thyssenkrupp as a ""speed breaker"".

The company's aim is to make European business stronger for which it will continue to explore various business options including merger, Tata Steel Managing Director T V Narendran said.

""This was something we were working on for last few years but European Commission based on the market feedback decided that it can not recommend JV...So (its) fine. I look (at) it like a speed breaker. These things happen,"" Narendran said on the collapse of Tata Steel's proposed joint venture (JV) with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp.

On May 10, Tata Steel and the German conglomerate decided to call off their proposed steel JV, expecting the deal to be rejected by the European Commission (EC) over ""continuing concerns"".

Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp had signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their steel businesses in Europe to create a 50-50 pan European joint venture company which could have formed the continent's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal.

Narendran said that Tata Steel Group has been performing well despite challenges in Europe.

Tata Steel termed the proposed JV as an important strategic initiative for the company to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, and now it being thrown off-track, it said, it would explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future.

""The journey of de-leveraging continues and creating structurally strong enterprise continues, (however) the JV could have made it a bit faster in terms of reducing our debt,"" he said.

He further noted that in Europe, the main players for the auto industry are ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp and because of this the EC got adverse feedback from the automobile majors about the merger, as instead of three strong suppliers the automobile majors would have had two strong suppliers.

""We have already made significant investments in Netherlands to supply to the auto industry. So we continue to be a strong player in auto industry,"" he noted.

While answering to a question on whether Tata Steel's options also include any acquisition plan like JSW Steel, which had acquired a plant in Italy, Narendran said, when the company looks at options, it will not be to grow its footprint in Europe, it would be to find a partner like Thyssenkrupp because Europe is not about growth, it is about making the business stronger.

Currently, around two-thirds of Tata Steel's business is in India. With the commissioning of the 5 million tone phase 2 of the Kalinganagar plant in the next 30 months with value added product mix, its share of business along with its profitability is expected to increase further."

Board meetings (FULL LIST)



Analyst calls• Elara Capital has retained buy rating on Parag Milk Foods with a target price of ₹366. Parag Milk Foods has reported high growth by expanding into north and east India while keeping working capital under control, said Elara. As the company reduces skimmed milk products salience and increases liquid milk or VAD salience in FY20, margin should move up to 10%, said Elara. 

• Morgan Stanley has retained equal-weight rating on Dalmia Bharat with a target price of ₹1,176. EBITDA miss in the fourth quarter reflects lowerthan-expected volume and higher costs, said Morgan Stanley. While Dalmia Bharat's growth in the east will be constrained by captive clinker availability, management expects overall growth to be in line with industry, said Morgan Stanley. Deleveraging is on track, but uncertainty remains on investments, it said. 

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on Inox Leisure and revised target price to ₹394 from ₹365. Recently completed preferential issue to the promoters and Inox’s strong balance sheet puts it in a strong position to drive both organic and inorganic growth, said CLSA. The brokerage raised FY20/21 estimates by 7-8%. Valuations at 9.5 times one-year forward EV/Ebitda, which is at a 20% discount to five-year average, appear reasonable, said CLSA. 

• Jefferies has maintained underperform rating on Vodafone Idea and revised target price to ₹12 from ₹13. The brokerage said Vodafone Idea's fourth quarter results were better than expected. Jefferies said price hikes are unlikely in FY20 and can happen only once Jio becomes a dominant player with 40% plus market share, which is likely in FY21. Jefferies expects Vodafone Idea's market share to fall to 20% and Bharti to remain steady at 30% by FY22, it said. 

• Citigroup Global Markets has maintained buy rating on ITC and raised target price of ₹370 from ₹360. The cigarette business continues to deliver healthy volumes, enabling a base for price hikes in the medium term, said Citigroup. The brokerage has raised EPS estimates marginally by 1%-3% on 32 times September 2020 estimated EPS. ITC is trading below its 5-year mean P/E valuation and 30-35% discount versus peer group is compelling, said Citi.

44,2019-05-15,JSW,"Mumbai: A proposed innovative employee benefit scheme facilitating acquisition of company shares by certain eligible employees of JSW Steel has fallen foul of proxy advisory firms such as SES that has asked shareholders to vote against the approval of the proposed plan, calling it ""non-compliant"" and ""failing the test of fairness and transparency"". 

The proposed scheme -- 'JSWSL Employees Samriddhi Plan 2019' – helps employees from grade L01 to L15 to buy equity shares of the company from an open market by availing a loan provided by a lender and a broker identified by the company to facilitate the acquisition. Banks can sell the shares if the employee is unable to repay the loan amount after two years. 

75% of the interest burden is borne by the company while the remaining borne by the employee that can acquire a maximum of 0.517% of the issued share capital of the company through this scheme. The plan will be administered by JSW Steel Employees Welfare Trust.

In a report issued by Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES), the firm has said the scheme is designed to ""operate in a regulatory vacuum"" and is non-compliant with Sebi regulations that stipulate acquisition of shares from secondary market to be via a trust that should hold the shares for a minimum of six months before transferring it to the employees. But here employees are acquiring the shares directly with the role of the trust being unclear. 

Also, questioning the objective of such a ""complicated scheme"", SES said the proposed plan falls short of governance standards as with a lock-in period of 2 years, an employee is forced to hold on to the shares even if their price is falling. 

""The scheme is in the interest of employees and legally complaint,"" JSW Steel said in a statement. 

In the notice of the postal ballot issued by the company to shareholders, JSW Steel has said that the scheme aims to ""create a sense of ownership among its employees"" as well as to ""retain talent in the organisation"". Since the Employees Stock Ownership Plan (ESOPS) approved by the company in 2016 only covers employees in the grade of L16 (associate vice president) and above, the plan is an effort to cover employees in the lower grades."

56,2019-05-21,JSW,"KOLKATA: Domestic steel production would be significantly affected if there is delay in auction of mines which would complete 50 years of operations by March 2020, according to ratings agency India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra). With around 60 million tonnes of actual production of iron ore from these mines likely to be disrupted, this would impact the credit profile of non-integrated steel players like JSW Steel, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited and merchant miners. This could also trigger an increase in imports though given the high cost of importing ore, Ind-Ra said it does not expect import volumes to go up substantially.

The license of about 288 merchant mines will expire by March 2020, out of which 59 mines are under operations, according to Ind-Ra’s assessment. A majority of these –some 59 mines -- are iron ore mines situated in Odisha and Karnataka with around 85 million tonnes of approved annual capacity. Ind-Ra said it estimates that around 60 million tonnes of the actual production of iron ore from these mines could be disrupted. “Considering that the auction process on an average takes three to six months to complete, a delay in initiating them until the latter half of 2019 due to the Lok Sabha elections in the country could affect the timely auction of mining lease,” the report said. 

Steel players such as JSW Steel, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited and other steel companies, which are either under stress or referred to National Company Law Tribunal are expected to increase their production in 2020, Ind-Ra said. However, absence of domestic iron ore supply may make force them to increase import of iron ore mix, leading to a potential hike cost of production.

While the largest domestic miner, NMDC Ltd may be able to increase the volumes to 4-5 million tonne per annum (mtpa) with evacuation facilities being placed at its captive mines, its 7 mtpa Donimalai operations can re-start after the settlement of a dispute between the government agencies on premium payment, the report said.

Imported iron ore is at least 150% of the domestic procurement prices. India Iron ore imports are less than 10% of the overall requirement (estimated 13mtpa for 180mtpa requirement). The iron ore prices have already gone up due to the disruption at Brazilian mining major VALE Ltd; however, Ind-Ra said it believes the situation to normalise in the second half of FY20, as international prices soften due to improved global supplies. Since import is an expensive option, Ind-Ra does not expect the import volumes to go up substantially. To ensure limited disruption to volumes, the government agencies may plan to extend expiry deadlines for mines along with awarding of licenses."

66,2019-05-24,JSW,"Public sector banks (PSBs) have recovered close to Rs 1.2 lakh crore from stressed assets during the financial ended March, primarily helped by resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), an official said.

During the first half of the previous fiscal, banks recovered Rs 60,713 crore from bad loans.

""Due to non-resolution of some big accounts referred under NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal), PSBs could not achieve the resolution target of Rs 1.80 lakh crore. But, these accounts should be resolved in the current financial year,"" the official said.

Banks recovered close to Rs 55,000 crore from the NCLT resolution, the official said.

""Compared to Rs 74,562 crore in 2017-18, the recovery in the previous financial year nearly doubled to Rs 1.2 lakh crore,"" the official said.

Two large accounts of Essar Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd are still pending to be resolved.

It is expected that these two accounts should be resolved in the next few months and recoveries from these could be around Rs 50,000 crore.

JSW Steel had revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore and later to over Rs 19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at Rs 17,000 crore after it had refused to revise its bid. ArcelorMittal has made a bid of Rs 42,000 crore for Essar Steel.

According to the official, consolidation among public sector banks and higher recoveries by state-owned lenders will be on the government's agenda in the current financial year.

Referring to the liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), the official said that there are issues with both solvency and liquidity in these companies.

""The government and the Reserve Bank of India will take adequate measures to address the issues plaguing the NBFC sector,"" the official said.

Many NBFCs, including DHFL and Indiabulls Finance, came under severe liquidity pressure compelling them to bring down their reliance on commercial papers.

Ever since the IL&FS crisis erupted, banks have been averse to lending to the sector, which has put them in a tight spot. There are concerns that NBFCs may run out of money, which will lead to defaults."
67,2019-05-24,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel reported a 48% decline in net profit in the fourth quarter after higher costs squeezed margins. The company’s board approved new capital expenditure worth Rs 5,700 crore.

Profit fell to Rs 1,495 crore in the three months ended March compared with Bloomberg estimates of Rs 1,487 crore. Net sales increased 4.8% to Rs 22,368 crore, JSW Steel said in a statement on Friday.

Weak domestic demand, reflected in subdued steel prices, was compensated by a rise in exports, which stood at 22% of the company’s total standalone sales volumes, up from 20% last year. 

Ebitda came in at Rs 4,440 crore, while average sales realisation witnessed a drop of 2% over last year as steel prices remained under pressure from weakening demand driven down by the automotive industry as well as rising imports.

Of the new capex of Rs 5,700 crore approved, Rs 1,000 crore will be invested in downstream facilities, Rs 2,200 crore will be spent on cost-saving projects and the remainder will be set aside for mining and sustenance.

The expansion initiated at the company’s facilities in Dolvi and Vijayanagar are under way. The company plans to spend about Rs 34,300 crore over the next two years. Funding for this year’s spending has been tied up, said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at JSW Steel.

The company’s net debt increased 21% from a year earlier to Rs 45,969 crore at the end of March. The net debt-to-Ebitda ratio rose to 2.43x compared with 2.32x in the third quarter.

Finance costs increased 18.5% to Rs 1,046 crore from a year earlier. Rao pointed out that a “liquidity crisis” in banks and NBFCs and the lack of credit continues to be a source of risk for the company and the industry.

Trade tensions between the US and China also reflected in rising imports.

""Looking at FY19, more than half a million tonne has come from Japan and Korea as the countries were not able to sell in US and elsewhere. There is a trade diversion clearly established by these numbers,"" Rao said. 

The company estimates production of 16.95 million tonnes in FY20, a 1.5% growth from the previous financial year.

JSW’s domestic steel sales for the year were led by a 20% on-year growth in the auto segment. However, the last quarter saw a weakening in auto demand. Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel, said auto demand is expected to improve from the second half of the current financial year, with the clearing of inventory by most automakers complete and expectations of consumer sentiment improving with the renewed political mandate for the ruling BJP."

Khaitan Electricals, Page Industries, Raj Rayon Industries, Videocon Industries and Vardhman Polytex also featured among the stocks that touched their 52-week lows on NSE.

Analyst calls 
• Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on Sun TV Network and lowered target price to ₹690 from ₹740. Till the time the flux gets settled, impact from TRAI’s tariff order along with mounting pressure on viewership share and margins, warrants a discount to the average multiple, said Motilal Oswal. 

• CLSA has retained sell rating on Ashok Leyland with a target price of ₹65. Truck industry growth has slowed down in the last six months and there is high likelihood of a downturn ahead after five years of upcycle and new axle norms raising capacity of existing fleet, said CLSA. Falling share of highertonnage trucks in volumes is a further drag, said CLSA. 

• ICICIdirect has maintained reduce rating on eClerx Services with a revised target price of ₹860. Healthy growth trajectory in managed services and improving deal pipeline are key positives, said ICICIdirect. However, client specific issues in some buckets and limited visibility of margin enhancement levers is expected to keep profitability muted for the next two years, the brokerage said. 

• Phillip Capital retained sell rating on ITD Cementation India and revised target price to ₹90 from ₹115. ITDC delivered a disastrous March quarter, with loss at EBITDA level, the brokerage said. The loss, attributable to the Bengaluru metro project, is expected to dampen the FY20 margins too, the brokerage said.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Dabur India and revised target price to ₹470 from ₹500. Dabur has the bestpositioned staples portfolio in India, said Morgan Stanley. That said, execution on new product launches over the past two years has been weak, the brokerage said.

74,2019-05-28,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Technical analysts are optimistic on Dalal Street. They expect Nifty50 to touch the 12,000 mark on a closing basis sooner than later, with the positive momentum broadening to second-rung stocks.

Technical charts are signalling broader participation, and nearly 120 stocks on NSE now look set for a strong rally, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover – a sign of bullish undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible upsides.

These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included shares of steelmakers like SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL and banks such as South Indian Bank, Union Bank, IDFC First Bank, Karnataka Bank and Bank of Maharashtra.

Among others, Coal India, HDFC Life, InterGlobe Aviation, Future Enterprises and Torrent Power are a few other names on the list.









The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed seven stocks are showing bearish trends. They included Manpasand Beverages, Page Industries, L&T Infotech, Blis GVS Pharma and Bajaj Consumer Care. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As far as Nifty50 is concerned, daily strength indicator RSI is moving upward and above its reference line, signalling a positive bias. Besides, the formation of higher top and bottom on the daily charts indicate that Nifty supports are shifting higher.

After a dull start to the quarter, rupee bond sales by Indian companies are set to revive as borrowing costs have declined to the lowest in a year following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s landslide election victory.

Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Grasim Industries Ltd. and UltraTech Cement Ltd. plan to raise a combined 7.5 billion rupees ($108 million) selling five-year bonds. State-owned NLC India Ltd. priced 14.75 billion rupees of debt Monday -- its first issuance in a decade -- as average yield for 10-year AAA paper fell to 8.31 per cent, the cheapest since last May.

“Yields have come down and corporates waiting to refinance will borrow,” said Sandeep Bagla, associate director at Trust Group in Mumbai. “Issuance will pick up pace as clarity on the regime improves business sentiment.”

JSW Steel Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest producer, plans to raise 70 billion rupees via bonds and State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, is considering raising as much as 50 billion rupees through notes on Wednesday, according to exchange filings.

Local-currency issuance in the three-month period that began April 1 is about 700 billion rupees, or 25 per cent of the total raised in the March quarter, as companies held off fundraising during the six-week election process that ended May 19. Corporate bond sales in the year to March 2020 may be between 6.75 trillion rupees to 7 trillion rupees, up from 6.5 trillion rupees a year earlier, according to Care Ratings.

The potential for reforms after Modi’s comprehensive victory is likely to improve the flow of foreign capital to corporates, according to S&P Global Ratings. That’s good news for India’s credit markets, which have suffered from a crisis of confidence after shock defaults since last year by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and a string of downgrades at mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. and Reliance Capital Ltd."

78,2019-05-29,JSW,"Bengaluru: Sajjan Jindal-controlled JSW Steel has got caught in the political crossfire between the Janata Dal(S)-Congress government and the BJP in Karnataka.

State BJP President BS Yeddyurappa has urged the government to revoke the cabinet’s decision to sell 3,666 acres of land currently leased to the steelmaker in the mineral-rich Sandur taluk of Ballari district. Senior Congress leader HK Patil too has made a similar demand.

Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy’s cabinet on Monday decided to execute an absolute sale deed in favour of the Mumbai-headquartered company, which operates a 12-million-tonne steel plant on the sprawling campus, saying that the firm had fulfilled all the commitments it had made under the lease-cum-sale agreement. Yeddyurappa told reporters that he had no objection if the government were to extend the lease period, but was opposed to an absolute sale. The party would launch an agitation if the government were to sell the land at a “low price in the iron ore rich region” to the steel firm, he said.

Congress leader Patil, in a letter to Kumaraswamy, said the government’s new industrial policy (2014-19) provides for granting plots of land to industries on long-term lease of up to 99 years. Earlier, the cabinet sub-committee on mining had recommended to the government to consider the long-term impact to the state exchequer from grant of land in mining areas. Patil, a former minister, asked the government to drop its decision forthwith.

Revenue minister RV Deshpande maintained that the cabinet discussed the subject threadbare and cleared the proposal in line with legal opinion. “There is no question of favouritism to anyone. The decision is in line with our policy, and there has been no breach of any condition by JSW Steel. In fact, they have invested more than they were supposed to,” he added.

JSW Steel deputy managing director Vinod Nowal described the opposition to the cabinet decision as “political”. “We signed the MoU with Karnataka in 1995, and paid the price for the land as fixed by the government, and provided jobs to land losers. We have fulfilled all conditions, and the sale transaction was delayed because of elections,” he told ET.

The state government allotted the land in two instalments of 2,000 acres in 2006 and 1,666 acres in 2007 at Toranagallu in Sandur taluk."
82,2019-05-30,JSW,"As Dalal Street continues to speculate over a potential earnings revival time for India Inc, some 125 out of over 1,200 firms listed on NSE have doubled March quarter profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. 

Among the top grossers, textile player Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing posted 114 times or over 11,345 per cent YoY increase in profit for the quarter, while Kanoria Chemicals, Yuken India, Hathway Cable & Datacom, Linde India, EID Parry, TVS Electronics, Alfred Herbert, Bhagyanagar Properties and Shriram City Union Finance reported profit growth in the range of 10-55 times, or 1,000 to 5,250 per cent.

Except for Hathway Cable (down 9 per cent), Linde India (down 16 per cent) and TVS Electronics (down 95 per cent), net sales of these firms have increased from 8 per cent to 1,472 per cent during the quarter.

Is it worth looking at stocks of some of these companies to invest?

""Sustainability of profit growth should be the key determinant; make sure these are not one-off surprises,"" says Siddharth Sedani, Vice-President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

“Many companies would have reported strong numbers in Q4. Some of them delivered exceptional gains in terms of profitability. However, investors should look at the sustainability of those earnings and see how these numbers were in the past four to five quarters. One can consider companies with good management and promising earnings. However, global factors will continue to impact Indian markets,” he said.

India Inc’s March quarter earnings season has entered the last leg, with 48 companies from the Nifty pack and 28 from the Sensex pack having already declared their numbers till May 29. 

In the 50-share Nifty, as many as 33 companies have posted an increase in bottom lines, while 15 have reported a drop in profit.

Among others, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Globus Spirits, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TV18 Broadcast, Aro Granite Industries, Kirloskar Industries, Asian Hotels, Hatsun Agro and The Jammu & Kashmir Bank and Kakatiya Cement posted 500-965 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of TV18 Broadcast, Kirloskar and Kakatiya Cement increased over 50 per cent YoY for the quarter. 

Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on J&K Bank post Q4 results with a price target of Rs 80. “At 0.6 times on March 2021 adjusted book value (ABV), the valuation is reasonable given healthy loan growth and margins outlook, robust liability franchise, controlled asset quality and waning capital concerns,” the brokerage said.

Among Nifty companies, Ultratech Cement and Cipla posted 131 per cent and 106 per cent year-on-year rise in profit on a 17.38 per cent and 22.17 per cent YoY sales growth, respectively.

Dr Reddy’s reported 67 per cent YoY profit growth. It was followed by Grasim Industries (up 59 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 57 per cent), NTPC (up 48.70 per cent), Adani Ports (up 38.69 per cent) and Wipro (up 37.74 per cent). 

Reliance Securities has upgraded UltraTech to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ post Q4 results. Centrum Broking maintained ‘buy’ rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 640. 

Axis Bank and SBI posted net profits of Rs 1,505 crore and Rs 838 crore, respectively, for the quarter against net losses of Rs 2,188.70 crore and Rs 7,718.20 crore, respectively, in the same period last year. 

Yes Bank posted Rs 1,506.60 crore loss for Q4FY19 against net profit of Rs 1,179.40 crore posted for the same period last year. 

Among others, Tata Steel, UPL, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, JSW Steel and Tata Motors reported 77 per cent, 72 per cent, 62 per cent, 53 per cent, 49 per cent and 47 per cent YoY drop in profit for the quarter.



While commenting on the ongoing earnings season, Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interaction with ET Now said that only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. 

“The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60 per cent of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space,” he said.

DCM Shriram, Orient Cement, Godrej Agrovet, Nectar Lifesciences, Usha Martin, Sagar Cement, Insecticides (India), Brigade Enterprises, Godrej Properties, Bharat Forge, Procter & Gamble Health, Bluestar, Phoenix Mills, Butterfly Gandhimathi, Marico, Indiabulls Ventures and Orient Paper were among other companies on the NSE that reported over 100 per cent YoY profit growth for March quarter."

0,2019-06-02,JSW,"Young, highly driven, risk-taking, and probably sleep-deprived. That’s the image most people associate with startup leaders. But it no longer captures the evolving scene of new technologybased businesses. People in their late forties, fifties and even sixties, tired of traditional ways of working, are joining the ranks of founders amid growing support for startups.

This crop of “elder” entrepreneurs may get second glances, but public perceptions have not deterred them, or their new ventures, from making a bold entry in sectors such as health tech, AI, GPS tracking, biotech and B2B commerce, among others. Many of them have found success. The fact that they have more to lose at this stage of their life than a college grad is winning them more admiration.

Dr Sivaram Pillai, founder and CEO of Proklean Technologies, started the probiotics venture at the age of 56, seeking to replace toxic chemicals in factories with safer substances. “Years of professional experience helped me persevere with the venture even after my work was almost wiped off in the 2015 Chennai floods,” says Pillai, stressing on the importance of experience even in an industry where the new takes precedence over the known.

Veteran IT professional Anjani Mandal, who is in his fifties, went through numerous industry cycles before co-founding logistics tech platform Fortigo. He says in the medium to long term, corporate value is bound to be higher in businesses led by experienced hands.

Research supports his theory. A 2018 study in the Harvard Business Review found that average age of software entrepreneurs in successful ventures in the US was 40 and that there were fewer younger people in deeper tech ventures, where the average age was closer to 47.



Varied life experiences, greater fiscal responsibility and strong connections give an edge to older entrepreneurs. “With age, experience and street smarts on our side, we are able to do more with less money,” says Sai Pattabiram, who started drone solutions firm Sree Sai Aerotech in his 50s and works with large corporate clients on GPS tracking and driverless technology.

Dr Geetha Manjunath, who is in her late 40s, cofounded AI-based breast cancer detection tool Niramai. “Most of my friends are decision-makers in different organisations and that helps in business development and building a partner ecosystem,” says Manjunath, who is also the firm’s CEO.

For most of the senior entrepreneurs, making a difference is a far bigger consideration than creating a hype while developing a product.

Bengaluru-based IBSFINtech took the fintech route in in 2013, long before it became fashionable. The treasury products company is headed by an unlikely trio of bankers with over 20 years of experience in the public sector and counts HCL Corp, JSW Steel and Maruti Suzuki among its clients. “Our batchmates are all EDs and MDs at large banks today. From working in a public sector unit to running a startup, we have been able to do it all because of our passion,” says co-founder CM Grover.

Passion may take you a certain distance, but when it comes to fundraising, most seniors-led ventures face challenges. They say ageism is a reality and most investors tread with caution.

“There have been instances where investors loved our idea and experience but felt that we might not be able to compete with younger entrepreneurs as our ‘prime’ years were behind us,” says Ram Srinivasan, co-founder of Zasti. Incubated in IIT-Madras’s research park, Zasti develops predictive AI tools. Its three co-founders have about two decades of work experience each.

“Investors have asked me how long I plan to carry on, and I fully appreciate their concern,” says Ashim Roy, 66, co-founder of health tech startup CardioTrack. The company’s leadership is a combination of experience and energy: its other cofounder, Avin Agarwal, is 35.

Senior entrepreneurs say young founders tend to inspire confidence among investors, but they may not necessarily have a sense of fiscal responsibility, which is a crucial factor.

“Many investors have explicitly suggested (to me) about bringing a ‘young’ cofounder on board,” says Niramai’s Manjunath.

Two investors told STOI that founders’ age played a role in their decisions. “For ‘late bloomers’, launching a startup is either a “forced-to” or “keen-to” option, and we look for the latter kind,” says one investor. Another points out: “There’s a risk that those coming from a long corporate stint might not be able to throw away their old working styles and adapt well.”

Vivek Tiwari of Medikabazaar, which counts Japan’s Mitsui Sumitomo VC and HealthQuad among its backers, says many investors also look forward to working with experienced professionals. “It’s all about finding the right partners,” he says.

Vaitheeswaran K, a serial entrepreneur who made a fresh start at 56 with Again Drinks, says a senior professional compensates for energy with level-headedness. “At this stage, I approach my business with complete equanimity and that only comes with age,” he says.

Some older entrepreneurs agree that navigating the fastpaced startup life can be challenging and they need to learn and unlearn constantly. “A college grad-turned CEO will probably gel well with a young team and understand their concerns better too,” says Manjunath.

Ashim Roy of CardioTrack thinks young founders have another advantage: “They tend to be fearless and have a can-do attitude, which can take them to great heights.”"
1,2019-06-02,JSW,"Mumbai: Indian industry's borrowings from foreign markets fell by nearly 20 per cent to USD 3.16 billion in April 2019 compared to the year-ago month, according to the Reserve Bank data. Domestic firms had raised USD 3.92 billion from overseas markets in April 2018.

Of the total external commercial borrowings (ECBs) in April 2019, USD 2.66 billion was raised through the automatic route, USD 500 million through approval route while the rest of USD 304,462 came through the issue of rupee denominated bonds (RDBs), the RBI data showed.

Under the automatic route, Shriram Transport Finance Company (USD 750 million on sub-lending), Dhamra Lng Terminal (USD 600 million for rupee expenditure), Indian Railway Finance Corporation (USD 300 million for infrastructure development), and Ikea India Pvt Ltd (USD 257.82 million as working capital loan) were among the major borrowers.

Tata Motors Finance Ltd (USD 150 million for on-lending), Performance Speciality Procducts (India) Pvt Ltd (USD 89.91 million as working capital funding), and Johnson Matthey India Pvt Ltd (USD 64.82 million for new project requirement) tapped funds under the automatic route.

JSW Steel Ltd was the only firm that raised USD 500 million through the approval route to channel capital for modernisation. While, Biosense Technologies Pvt Ltd was the sole firm that floated RDBs or masala bonds overseas to raise USD 304,462 for new project needs."
5,2019-06-04,JSW,"MUMBAI: Steel and sponge iron makers of the country have asked the government to not delay the auction of 288 iron ore blocks whose leases are set to expire in March, 2020, so as to create a level playing field for iron ore users and prevent an extensive loss of public revenue from taking place. 

ET has seen the letters that user industries have sent to the government after private merchant miners last week made a plea to extend leases until March, 2030 to prevent a supply crisis of the ore in the market till the auction gets completed. 

According to ore users that include JSW Steel, Kalyani Steel, Tata Sponge Iron, among others, that stand to win mines through these auctions, private miners have already benefited from a lease extension of five years since 2015 when the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 was amended. The amendment had said that post expiration of mining leases that were granted before 2015, the mines will have to be put up for auction but private non-captive lease holders were granted an extension of 5 years until March, 2020 to ""complete necessary procedures to bring the mines to auction"", a letter addressed to Niti Aayog said. 

It also said that by further extending the leases, the government stands to lose huge mining revenue through premiums. The companies estimate a loss of Rs 79,500 crore to Odisha government alone where 16 working iron ore mines with a capacity of 53 MT are nearing expiration. 

Also, a committee formed under the chairmanship of the secretary of ministry of mines has recommended certain amendments in the MMDR act that can assure that the auction process is completed before the mines expire. Another suggestion that calls for the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) to extend environment clearance with existing mines for another three years as well as transfer forest clearance to new lessees can make sure the transfer of mines is smooth, the letters said. 

India Ratings has estimated that out of the 288 mines set to expire, 59 are operational with around 85 million tonnes of approved annual capacity. Around 60 MT of production could get disrupted if the auction process was not initiated in the latter half of 2019, said Ind-Ra."

ANALYST CALLS
• CLSA has maintained buy rating on J Kumar Infraprojects with a target price of ₹315. The key message from J Kumar Infra’s fourth quarter was its pick-up in new orders despite election-led, slowdown fears and robust execution, said CLSA. 

• HSBC has maintained buy rating on Finolex Industries and revised target price to ₹680 from ₹750. The stock is currently trading at a consensus FY20 PE of 15.1 times, a 30% discount to historical levels, said HSBC. The market is not appreciating the prospects of a better PVC resin cycle and the scope for a re-rating given earnings growth from the pipes segment. 

• Citigroup has maintained buy rating on Apollo Hospitals and revised target price from ₹1,800 from ₹1,640. Apollo Hospitals is now well into a consolidation phase, with mature beds, new beds as well as AHLL and retail pharmacies seeing steady topline growth and healthy margin improvement - translating into higher cash generation and return ratios, said Citi. 

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on ITC with a target price of ₹400. The appointment of Dr Vardhan as health minister brings back the memories from 2014 and also brings about uncertainties, said CLSA. Efforts to implement past unfinished agenda (eg, plain packaging, restrictions on point-of-sale ads) could impact the industry, though implementation remains the key, it added.

• ICICI Securities has maintained add rating on Repco Home Finance and revised target price to ₹430 from ₹385. Valuations at 1.4 times FY20 estimated P/BVPV might appear attractive but given the growth impediments and the concentration in Tamil Nadu, should be looked upon with caution, said ICICI Securities.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
3,2019-06-04,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Latest earnings of the top metals companies show that earnings cycle for the sector has peaked out in 2019. In the March quarter, top seven metal companies reported a decline in earnings after consecutive strong seven quarters, primarily due to metal prices coming off. Going forward, earnings could come under further pressure given the weak global demand and overhang of global trade war.

Out of top eight metal companies which include JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Hindalco, Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, SAIL, Tata Steel (after adjusting for Bhushan Steel) and Jindal Stainless witnessed 8 per cent to 28 per cent earnings(EBIDTA) decline. Lower earnings and high debt of most metal companies could put these companies under severe pressure. Some of the companies including SAIL and Jindal Steel already have debt to EBIDTA of near 5 times. Considering this, any bounce back in their stock prices could be a good opportunity to exit.

The earnings of Indian metal companies are primarily linked to steel, aluminium and zinc prices. Despite the sharp bounce back from the lows of 2018, steel prices are still 15 per cent down from the peak of previous year. Analysts expect the steel prices to remain under pressure owing to cheap imports in India after trade restrictions in the US. This is negative for Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL and Jindal Steel & Power. While the recent acquisitions of Bhushan group’s assets have risen the debt of Tata Steel and JSW Steel and hurt their profitability in the coming quarters besides rising leverage. Other steel companies Jindal Steel and SAIL are already heavily leveraged. LME Aluminium prices are at two-year lows (near 30 per cent down from a year ago levels). This is negative for Hindalco and Vedanta. While the debt does not appear high for these companies on the consolidated levels, the groups remain heavily leveraged as cash from one subsidiary to other leads to heavy tax leakages thus impacting debt paying abilities.

With the recent developments, analysts have turned negative and this could result in earnings downgrades.

“Domestic steel demand remains muted in May 2019, due to slower demand growth in auto and demand postponement in infra. Declining import offers amidst slow demand kept domestic prices under pressure. Domestic producers will try to increase prices in June to offset part of hike in iron ore prices, but it would be difficult for the market to absorb the hike,” said Ashish Kejriwal with IDFC securities in a recent note.

Amix Dixit, lead metals analysts with Edelweiss Securities, too, has a similar view and is concerned about the profitability of metal companies. “We expect profitability to come under further pressure as steel/aluminium prices have eroded further and global demand is placid,” he said."
6,2019-06-05,JSW,"Bengaluru: The opposition to Karnataka cabinet's decision on sale of 3,667 acres of land to JSW Steel intensified Wednesday with senior Congress MLA and former minister H K Patil coming out publicly against the deal and faulting party colleague and Industries Minister K J George. 

Patil, who has earlier written to Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy against parting with the land in Ballari district, accused George of 'hiding facts' about 'dues' owed by the company to state-owned Mysore Minerals Limited (MML). 

He claimed JSW owed Rs 2,000 crore, including interest, to the MML and this was 'ignored' while making the leased land freehold in favour of the lessee. 

""This makes the government's decision to benefit the company seemed suspicious,"" he said in a letter to George, a copy of which he shared on Twitter. 

Patil's latest missive comes days after George at a press conference maintained that JSW Steel did not have any dues. 

The state unit of the BJP too has attacked the government on the issue, alleging that the decision to allot the land at a ""cheaper"" rate to JSW was taken by the coalition in a ""hurry"" to ""fill"" their coffers and out of fear that they might lose power in the state. 

The cabinet on May 27 decided to make freehold of 3,667 acres of land, given to the steel major's plant in Vijayanagar in Ballari district in 2005-06 on lease-cum-sale, at a cost of Rs 1.5 lakh per acre. 

As per the agreement the lease had to be converted to sale after ten years, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byre Gowda had said. 

""You being the member of cabinet while reacting to my (earlier) letter (to CM) tried to mislead people by giving falseinformation on outstanding dues,"" Patil said in the letter to George. He also cited excerpts of a CAG report to substantiate his claim about JSW's dues. The Congress MLA said the government's decision should be transparent when it pertained to giving away public property, insisting that the pros and cons as well as the profit and loss to the exchequer must be taken into consideration. Patil said such decisions should be legitimate and all documents should be scrutinised before taking a final call. 

On May 30, George had said the government was not hiding anything and the JSW did not have any dues. 

Both JSW Steel and MML were fighting a legal battle in the court over royalty payments, he had said adding if the court orders JSW's property worth Rs 50,000 crore would be attached. 

The steel companyhas claimed the charges were false and misleading. ""The said land was leased to JSW Steel for expansion of its steel plant capacity at Vijayanagar and the lease hold land shall become a free hold land as per the terms of original lease on expiry of specific period of lease. 

""Theinformation that is being spread is false and misleading,"" a spokesperson of JSW Steel had said in a statement. Opposing the cabinet decision, BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa had alleged the sale ofland at a 'throwaway price' was an example of ""open loot"" by thecoalition government. ""You all know well. It's not a small issue. The governmentgave 3,667 acres of land at a throwaway price. After losing 25 Lok Sabha constituencies,this government has indulged in daylight robbery. We condemnit,"" he had said recently. 

The land was having high quality iron ore and its price was bout Rs 15 crore to 20 crore per acre, he had said. 

State BJP general secretary C T Ravi has alleged the decision was driven by fear of collapse of the JDS-Congress ministry. 

He had claimed the previous Congress government had deferred a decision on this matter as several cabinet members, including H K Patil, had opposed it."
7,2019-06-06,JSW,"MUMBAI: Courts and banks should expedite the resolution process of Essar Steel, which has been going on for more than 20 months, said Sajjan Jindal, chairman at JSW Group that failed in its bid to acquire the prized steelmaking assets through the bankruptcy court.

In an exclusive interview to ET, Jindal conceded that the entry of European steel giant ArcelorMittal, which has won the race for Essar Steel, will bring discipline in the Indian steel market and make it more organised.

He, however, felt the near-$10 billion (Rs 69,272 crore) cheque that the Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal may be writing for Essar Steel — accounting also for the price it will ultimately pay for ports, pipelines and Uttam Galva’s dues — may not be viable. If JSW were to acquire Essar Steel, even an offer worth $5 billion would have been a tad too steep, Jindal said.

“...but beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder,” he said.

Jindal, however, warned that delaying the handing-over of Essar Steel might force Lakshmi Mittal to change his mind. “Given that there are global headwinds to the steel industry and with ArcelorMittal’s global presence, its margins are under tremendous pressure,” he said. “At this stage if the courts and the banking system continue to delay the matter then my worry is that ArcelorMittal may find some way to get out of the deal.”

JSW Steel had actively participated in the sale of stressed assets that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has facilitated. However, it could not bag the asset it wanted the most — Bhushan Steel — which would have given the company a five million tonnes ready steel capacity and a foothold in the east market. Rival Tata Steel won the race for Bhushan Steel.

Defending his seemingly conservative approach in bidding for Bhushan Steel, Jindal said though JSW Steel felt it had bid the “top dollar” for the asset, Tata Steel ended up bidding higher than they could have anticipated.




‘Govt Should Fix Liquidity Crisis’
“It is because their investment per tonne is higher than our investment per tonne that they paid more,” he said.

After losing out on Bhushan Steel, JSW Steel had also tried to enter the fray for Essar Steel, but by that time “it was too late”, Jindal said. A failure to submit expression of interest on time kept his firm out of the contest for the Hazira-based fully integrated flat carbon steel maker with a capacity to produce 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa).

Out of the crop of 12 highly stressed steel assets sent for insolvency proceedings, JSW Steel has bagged Monnet Ispat and Energy. It also pipped Tata Steel in bidding for Bhushan Power and Steel, though the final order on its acquisition is still awaited.

Apart from aggressively expanding its steel capacity that is estimated to reach 40-50 mtpa by 2025, the $14-billion JSW Group is also diversifying into newer, consumer-facing businesses. In 2017, its power arm JSW Energy had announced a plan to enter the electric vehicle industry. However, in March this year, JSW Energy announced it has abandoned the plan due to “high uncertainties associated with the business”.

“We were very keen to pursue the business, but then, later on, we realised that we don’t have the core competency in that and also the technology for it is still developing and a lot of changes might still take place,” Jindal said. He confirmed that talks of acquiring General Motors’ Talegaon plant for the project had been “almost finalised”.



Asked whether he would review his decision to enter the EV space, Jindal said, “Never say never.” He, however, conceded that it is difficult to look at the business again in the future.

For now, the group is focusing on entering the retail household consumers through its newly launched paints and furniture businesses that require smaller investments.


ON LEVERAGE
JSW Steel, the flagship company of the group, currently sits on net debt of almost Rs 46,000 crore. It has announced brownfield expansions of both its Vijaynagar and Dolvi plants and is also doubling its value-added capacity.

Jindal said with all the investments going towards newer capacities, this year the company’s Ebitda multiple might stretch in comparison to its net debt, but it will get corrected next year when these projects start earning. The company’s net debt to Ebitda ratio is 2.4x currently.

Jindal also said that over the next six months, he plans to wind down his share of pledged holding that currently stands at close to 50%.

Much like other captains of India Inc, Jindal also batted for the government to “fix” the liquidity crisis. He also exhorted the government to set a target to grow at 12% by announcing big-ticket projects and boosting spend on infrastructure as it would create more jobs.

He also said the government should only control strategic assets such as oil and gas, and nuclear power, while others like steel, aluminium and airlines should be given in the hands of the private sector or strategic investors that could run them more efficiently.

Jindal said if the state-run National Aluminium Company (NALCO) and Steel Authority of India (SAIL) were put on the block, he would certainly have a look at it.

He said by 2025, close to 95% of JSW Steel’s targeted 40-50 million tonnes assets will come from India while the rest will come from the global assets. “After that, we have not yet made plans and they will depend on the demand in India, how it is growing and what is the role of other steel companies,” Jindal said."

BOARD MEETINGS
 

ANALYST CALLS• Anand Rathi has retained its buy recommendation on Heidelberg Cement with a higher target of ₹263. Aided by strong price environment and concentrated efforts towards cost optimisation, company reported strong performance. Its shorter lead distances, an increasing share of premium cement volumes and higher utilisation will continue to aid the company to good performance, said the brokerage. 

• JM Financial has maintained its buy rating on Asian Paints with a target price of ₹1,475 as they continue to see Asian Paints as a compelling long-term investment theme that quite justifies the premium that it commands. While the business did witness headwinds on input-costs during the year plus increase in costs-base on account of the commissioning of two large greenfield facilities, it still managed to sustain its ROCE and ROE in FY19 at 21.3% and 24.1% vs 21.6% and 24.6% in FY18, said the brokerage.

• Geojit Financials has maintained its accumulate rating on KNR Constructions with a target price of ₹324 citing pick up in execution as projects are getting financial closure and appointed date. Healthy balance sheet, strong execution capability with better operational margin to support valuation, said the brokerage. 

 • Narnolia Financial has maintained its neutral stance on Cipla with a target price of ₹565 citing strong US growth partly offset by weak tender business. Going forward, as the company is progressing well in its initiative to build a strong specialty pipeline; clinical trials for such specialty products will add to the costs and would put pressures in the margins, said the brokerage. 

• Karvy Stock Broking has recommended to sell Havells India shares with a target price of ₹800 citing growth across segments offset by lower margins. Havells to trade at premium valuations due to its strong brand, highly penetrated distribution channel, efficient working capital management and cash flow generation, said the brokerage.

9,2019-06-07,JSW,"In an exclusive interview with ET, Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Steel, the largest Indian steelmaker by market capitalization, said that his budget for the alloy-maker may have been just about half of what the European steelmaker is paying.

Going by that valuation yardstick, it might not be incorrect to say that even JSW Steel could be overpaying for Bhushan’s assets.

ArcelorMittal’s bid for Essar Steel’s 10 million tonne (MT) asset values it at Rs 50,000 crore. JSW Steel has offered almost Rs 20,000 crore for Bhushan Power’s 3 MT capacity. Tata Steel paid Rs 35,200 crore for Bhushan Steel and Power’s 5.2 MT capacity.

Analysts believe that all the bidders may have ended up paying more. The steel cycle has reversed over the past few months and this could stretch the balance sheets of the acquirers. Steel prices have corrected more than 15% from their peaks of 2018 and are expected to further fall. According to analysts, fair valuation, given the industry situation and falling earnings, would be 5.5 to 6.5 times EV/EBIDTA, depending on the assets.

As Essar Steel is unlisted, its financials are not publicly available. However, analysts estimate that while acquiring its assets, EBIDTA/ tonne of Rs 7,000- Rs 7,500 must have been assumed. The products are low-value (hot rolled coil) and the iron ore mines are not close to the plants.

Of Essar’s 10 MT, 8.5 MT is fully operational and the remaining 1.5 MT may need some capex. Assuming these calculations, ArcelorMittal has paid 7.8 times EV/EBIDTA, which is expensive in a downcycle. ArcelorMittal’s earnings have dropped to less than a third in just three quarters to $537 million in March.

But analysts also believe that this acquisition would give Arcelor the much-needed meaningful entry into India, justifying the premium. The capacity gives Arcelor a 10% market share.

Tatas considered EBIDTA/tonne of Rs 10,000 for Bhushan, analysts said. This acquisition was valued at 6.8 times EV/EBIDTA, which too appears steep. Bhushan has higher value-added products, mainly for cars. However, it has been affected due to slowdown in auto demand.

JSW Steel may be able to achieve Rs 8,000 per tonne EBIDTA, given proximity of iron ore mines for the 3 MT acquired capacity. Valuation in this case comes to 7.7 times EV/ EBIDTA. However, JSW has also got large land parcels, which it could use to expand into the north."

12,2019-06-08,JSW,"BENGALURU: Amid the row over the proposed move to sell 3,667 acres of government land in Ballari district to JSW Steel after expiry of lease period, the company Saturday said it never does anything ""illegal"" or ""disadvantage"" the people of Karnataka.

""JSW Steel will not do anything which is illegal, which will disadvantage the state or the people of Karnataka,"" JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal told reporters in Ballari district.

He was responding to a query on the land deal.

The MD maintained that he would not get into the argument with those questioning the sale of land, previously allotted to it on lease.

""If anybody is raising any question or linking anything with anyone, I cannot get into the discussion, because I am not qualified to discuss, but JSW never does things which are illegal,"" Jindal said.

The state cabinet had on May 27 decided in its meeting to part with the land in favour of the company after the lease period was over.

The decision was taken as per the agreement between the Karnataka government and the company that once the lease period was over, the land should be sold to the company as freehold.

However, a slew of conditions were also attached, which have been violated, alleged Congress MLA and former minister H K Patil.

Patil has been objecting to the government's decision, saying the JSW owed Rs 2,000 crore, including interest, to the state-owned Mysore Mineral Limited and this was 'ignored' while making the leased land freehold in favour of the lessee.

The BJP too said it would hold agitation against the decision statewide."

19,2019-06-11,JSW,"Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Tuesday asked Deputy CM G Parameshwara and Industries Minister KJ George to re-submit the subject related to sale of land to JSW Steel to the Cabinet for detailed discussion in view of protests by the BJP.

He discussed the issue with the two senior ministers and, asked them to bring it before the Cabinet. The steel unit, contrilled by billionnaire Sajjan Jindal, has been caught in the political crossfire between the JD(S)-Congress coalition regime and the BJP in Karnataka.

State BJP president BS Yeddyurappa and senior Congress leader HK Patil had urged the government to revoke the Cabinet decision to execute an absolute sale deed for 3666 acres of land in the mineral-rich Sandur taluk of Ballari district to the steel behemoth. 

The Cabinet had, last week, decided to execute absolute sale deed in favour of the JSW Steel on grounds that the firm has fulfilled all commitments. The Mumbai-headquartered company operates a 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) steel plant on the sprawling campus it got under a lease-cum-sale agreement. 

Meanwhile, the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) on Tuesday warned the State Government that the controversy surrounding the sale of land to the JSW Steel would send wrong signals to investor community in both India and overseas.

The BCIC, in a press release, urged the JD(S)-Congress regime to work towards early resolution of issues related to such land transactions with major industrial houses in Karnataka. Over the last three years, the government not taken a policy decision on regularising land lease for industrial use.

BCIC president Kishore Alva said: “The facilitation of industry to setup shop in Karnataka is one of the most important tasks of the Government of Karnataka. The present controversy over regularisation of land lease of JSW Steel is unfortunate as well as unnecessary. We understand that political colour has been given to the legitimate use of land by a large industry to setup its plant and facilities."""
18,2019-06-11,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The Commerce and Steel Ministries Tuesday assured engineering exporters of making all the efforts to ensure the sector's outbound shipments reach USD 200 billion by 2030.

The issues being faced by engineering sector were discussed in detail during a meeting which was attended by Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, senior officials of both the ministries, top steel makers and representatives of engineering export sector.

""...Ministries of Commerce and Industry and Steel will make all efforts to ensure that engineering goods exports double in the next five years and reach USD 200 billion by 2030,"" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

The challenges being faced by the steel sector and import-export trends were also discussed in the meeting.

The protectionist measures being imposed by other countries and the under-utilised capacity in steel manufacturing in India were also discussed in the meeting.

Both the ministers discussed at length the measures that both ""may take to reduce unnecessary imports and boost exports,"" it said.

Engineering exporters are seeking supply of steel at concessional prices so that MSME sector can compete in international markets.

The meeting was attended by Steel Secretary Binoy Kumar, DGFT Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi, senior officers of both the ministries, SAIL Chairman Anil Kumar Chaudhary, members of Indian Steel Association, steel makers including JSW Steel Chairman and Managing Director Sajjan Jindal.

16,2019-06-11,JSW,"Industry body, the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) on Tuesday warned the Karnataka Government that the controversy surrounding the sale of land to Sajjan Jindal-controlled JSW Steel would send a wrong signal to investor community in both India and overseas.

The JSW Steel is based out of Vijayanagar (Toranagallu) in Ballari district, and Karnataka Cabinet decision to execute absolute sale of the land the listed company currently holds on lease has run into issues with the Opposition BJP and senior Congress leader HK Patil. The BJP is holding a dharna in protest of the decision. 

The BCIC, in a press release, urged the JD(S)-Congress regime to work towards early resolution of issues related to such land transactions with major industrial houses in Karnataka. Over the last three years, the government not taken a policy decision on regularising land lease for industrial use.

BCIC president Kishore Alva said: “The facilitation of industry to setup shop in Karnataka is one of the most important tasks of the Government of Karnataka. The present controversy over regularisation of land lease of JSW Steel is unfortunate as well as unnecessary. We understand that political colour has been given to the legitimate use of land by a large industry to setup its plant and facilities.""

He said the State Government were to take a rigid stand, it will send a wrong signal and no industry would think of investing in the State and Karnataka would stand lose out to the more aggressive neighbouring states.

The Mumbai-headquartered JSW Steel operates a 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) steel plant on the sprawling campus it got under a lease-cum-sale agreement, and awaits the status of 3666 acres of land to change from ""lease-hold"" to ""free-hold"" with necessary land registration formalities.

JSW Steel Deputy MD Vinod Nowal, in a recent chat with ET, said: “We signed the MoU with Karnataka in 1995, and paid the the price for the land as fixed by the government, and provided jobs to land losers. We have fulfilled all conditions, and the sale transaction was delayed because of elections.”

The state government allotted the land in two instalments of 2,000 acres in 2006 and 1,666 acres in 2007 at Toranagallu in Sandur taluk. “The company has invested about Rs 50,000 crore to build the steel facility, ancillary units, township and other infrastructure, and provided jobs to 25,000 people,” Nowal said. “We are the largest exporter of high-grade steel in India, and pay about Rs 7000 crore in taxes a year,” Nowal added."

Hopes that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates as early as next week boosted global stock markets.

Throughout the day, the ADAG stocks were in focus after Anil Ambani tried to soothe investor concerns, saying Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group was fully committed to meeting all its debt obligations.

Analyst calls
 • Edelweiss has maintained a buy rating on Eicher Motors with target price of ₹23,036. The brokerage has acknowledged risks to near-term earnings due to regulatory cost pressure and weak demand.

 • Nomura has downgraded Housing Development Finance Corporation to neutral from buy and increased target price to ₹2,300 from ₹2,000. HDFC’s business model remains most resilient among NBFCs/HFCs and it has been able to weather the NBFC crisis better, said Nomura.

24,2019-06-13,JSW,"BENGALURU: The BJP Thursday took out a protest rally in the city accusing the state government of being lenient towards financial fraudsters and selling precious land to JSW Steel at a throwaway price.

Holding placards and waving party flags, hundreds of BJP workers thronged the Maurya Circle and staged a demonstration.

They raised slogans against the state government accusing it of being insensitive to people's problems.

Leading the protest, former deputy chief minister R Ashok referred to the IMA Jewellers' case.

The firm's owner Mohammed Mansoor Khan is reportedly absconding following emergence of an audio clip, purportedly of him, in which he is heard threatening to commit suicide.

""They (fraudsters) decamped with the money of 30,000 Muslims... the owner of the firm has escaped,"" Ashok said, addressing the gathering.

Seven directors of the firm at the centre of an alleged financial fraud that left thousands of investors in the lurch have been apprehended.

The state government has formed an 11-member special investigation team to probe the case.

BJP MLC N Ravi Kumar said ""...broad daylight robbery is happening here. Muslim brethren are being exploited right under the nose of the Congress-JDS coalition government by one after another fraudster companies.""

The protesters also raised the JSW Steel land sale issue.

They accused the government of being hand in glove with JSW Steel as it allotted the land to the company at a ""throwaway price.""

While welcoming the government's decision to review the land sale, they said the government should make sure that every inch of the land is recovered.

Caught in a bind over the controversial land deal, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy Tuesday said the government's decision on sale of 3,667 acres to JSW Steel will be reconsidered and placed before the cabinet once again for discussion.

After the protest rally, the BJP leaders and workers proceeded to stage a sit-in at the Vidhana Soudha, the state secretariat complex, when they were arrested.

Later, they were released, police said."

26,2019-06-14,JSW,"Bengaluru: Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy will expand his 13-month-old Cabinet in some time from now by inducting two independent MLAs to consolidate his grip over the JD(S)-Congress coalition regime which faces threats of exits from sections of dissident Congress MLAs. 

Two independent MLAs – R Shankar (Ranebennur) and H Nagesh (Mulbagal) – will be inducted as ministers. The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah is said to have extracted a commitment from Shankar that he will join the Congress as associate member ahead of his induction into the ministry. It is not known yet if the JD(S) has put any such condition to Nagesh, who actually won the polls on the Congress support. 

As the CM made preparations for the swearing-in, the BJP leaders gathered near Vidhana Soudha to protest the Cabinet decision to sell land to JSW Steel in Ballari district. At Mysuru, however, JD(S) leader H Vishwanath met BJP MP Srinivasa Prasad sparking off all kinds of speculations, and giving some tense moments in the JD(S) camp. In Bengaluru, Congress MLA (Chikkaballapur) Dr. K Sudhakar said he would take a call on watching the developments after taking to his party leadership. The Congress MLAs, he said, were not in a position to face immediate polls to the Assembly in view of the recent drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls.

 Seven-time Congress MLA R Ramalinga Reddy is unlikely to be inducted, they said, although Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah had said a few days ago that Reddy would be made a minister. He is keeping a low profile.

Though the idea behind filling in the Cabinet positions is to quell dissidence in the Congress, it is to be seen if the exercise douses the anguish among senior Congress MLAs or triggers a new wave of public resentment. Reddy, a former home minister, had recently said that Congress leaders had ignored seniors in their bid to woo newcomers, a reference to the importance the two independent MLAs are getting.

There are three vacancies in the cabinet, one of which caused by the death of Congress minister CS Shivalli and another by the resignation of BSP minister N. Mahesh. While there are two vacancies in the JD(S) quota, the Congress has one. 

Shankar will take the berth that fell vacant owing to Shivalli’s death, while Nagesh will take the position vacated by Mahesh. It is to be seen if the JD(S) will keep one position vacant or fill it with party MLC BM Farooq, who met the CM this morning and apparently pleaded his case.

The JD(S) and the Congress leadership are, however, not worried about any imminent threats from the BJP. The BJP central leadership, it is learnt, is not in a hurry to topple the JD(S)-Congress regime, but it will not prevent if the regime were to fall on its own on account of internal fights and conspiracies. It is to be seen if sections of disgruntled Congress MLAs will switch to the BJP camp and weaken or topple the government. The BJP, said a second person, would welcome MLAs from the rival parties if they were ready to join without any condition, or without expectations of a cabinet position if the BJP were to form government later.

After the Narendra Modi-led NDA returned to power with a thumping majority, talk of the BJP’s ‘Operation Lotus’, aimed at getting MLAs from rival camps to switch over, has receded to the background, offering a breather to the JD(S) and Congress camps."
27,2019-06-15,JSW,"On one hand, the defensives have been doing well in the last couple of weeks and all of a sudden, a high beta sector is coming out, says Kunal Bothra, Market Expert, on an interview with ETNOW.  Edited excerpts: 


What is your view on Nifty Bank and any particular stocks in that index that attract your attention given the way they have been the big movers and shakers in that index this week?On the Bank Nifty front what transpired on Friday was interesting because we were tutoring for the last two weeks in a range on the index, but we did not break any key support levels or even resistances for that matter. But on Friday, especially in the last half an hour, the markets tried to dent some key support levels. 

For Bank Nifty, it was at 30,600-30,650 level. We managed to just about trade below those kind of levels for Nifty 11800 which has been more of a talking support for the index. That also got tested on Friday. It all depends on how the markets shape up on Monday and whether you see a gap down opening and then a follow through selling.

If that happens, then the index opens up legs on the downside and that could be almost to the tune of 3 to 3.5% in a matter of one to two weeks. The markets are a bit concerned over here because if we break those key support levels, then you could expect one more round of selling. In terms of individual names on the banking side, you could probably be expecting that names like Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank which has been one of the major losers in the last three or four days of the previous week, could be the ones which could see some acceleration in selling.


We are seeing quite a bit of outperformance in the metal space even though the markets were being a bit circumspect, especially Tata Steel. The weekly graph saw a 4% rise. What are your recommendations?So yes, Tata Steel. Vedanta. They did pretty well last week and the interesting part was the timing of metal stocks. On one hand, you have the defensives which have been doing pretty well in the last couple of weeks and all of a sudden, you see a high beta sector coming out and you are seeing more volumes and more price action which I think is a bit contrary.

Generally markets respect momentum and when you see a momentum tripping up into a sector like metal stocks and that too almost all the names like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, the markets take cognisance of the fact and that sector sees continuation of momentum. Tata Steel could be one of the stronger names in terms of price performance going forward as well. but I believe that there is potential in names like Vedanta and Jindal Steel, in that order.


Based on the way the charts have moved, what would you recommend or advocate as trading strategies for the coming week?The caveat is that whatever transpired on Friday, on Monday also sees a repeat when the market opens. If that happens on the downside, then there will be two sell calls. The first one is a sell on Jubilant Food. I believe the stock has opened some downside trends on the indicator front, especially on the hourly charts and the stock could drag lower. We saw the stock dropping on Friday’s trading session and I would go for the carry forward sell on Jubilant Food with a target of Rs 1,265 and stop loss to be kept at Rs 1,332.

The second would be a sell on Bajaj Auto, after a steady uptrend in the last two months-three months a bit of a outperformance you know there is this rising channel pattern for Bajaj Auto but last week the stock broke down for that rising channel pattern and that could probably indicate a reversal of sorts for the stock price. Hence a sell on Bajaj Auto as well with targets at Rs 2,800 and stop loss at Rs 2,920."
28,2019-06-16,JSW,"Bengaluru-Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy Sunday offered to hold talks with opposition BJP on issues raised by it even as the saffron party workers courted arrest while attempting to proceed towards his official residence despite police barricades.

As the state BJP, led by its chief B S Yeddyurappa, intensified its two-day sit-in over issues, including sale of land in Ballari to JSW Steel at a ""throw away"" price, drought and farm loan waiver, Kumaraswamy, in a letter to the opposition leader, said he was prepared to discuss all matters.

""I am always ready to discuss with you. Steps will be taken to seek your time as per your convenience,"" the chief minister said in the letter to Yeddyurappa, a copy of which was released to the media.

However, the BJP went ahead with its plan as the leaders and workers, who were on a round-the-clock sit-in at Anand Rao circle here since Friday, attempted to proceeded toward the chief minister's residence despite heavy police presence and barricades in the area.

The protesters were stopped by police and huddled into buses as they tried to break through the barricades.

In the ensuing melee, a few BJP leaders including, former deputy chief minister R Ashok, suffered some bruises.

The protesters were taken to a nearby police ground and let off later, police said.

In his letter, Kumaraswamy informed Yeddyurappa about the measures taken to tackle the drought situation and added the loan waiver scheme for farmers in progress.

Regarding the sale of land to JSW Steel company, the chief minister said the matter would be referred to the cabinet sub-committee.

Speaking to reporters onboard a bus, Yeddyurappa accused the state government of ""ignoring"" the sufferings of people and said the BJP's protest would continue.

The BJP leader also demanded that the state government completely drop the sale of land to the JSW steel.

The Karnataka cabinet had recently decided to convert the lease of 3,667 acres of land in Ballari district to JSW Steel into sale, in accordance with the initial agreement.

Caught in a row, the state cabinet Friday decided to refer its decision to a cabinet sub-committee for reconsideration, which Yeddyurappa termed as ""eyewash"".

Responding to the chief minister's message, the BJP tweeted, ""After (former chief minister) Siddaramaiah became the coordination committee chairman, you too got the disease of sleeping. You woke up only now though the opposition (BJP) leaders were holding a sit-in demonstration since Friday morning.""

""Invitation for talks just ahead of laying siege to chief minister's house is a commitment or a publicity stunt?"" it asked in the tweet."
32,2019-06-17,JSW,"The US and India have strengthened their ties in a number of key areas like defence, counter-terrorism, trade and energy over the years and would continue to take the cooperation to ""new heights"", a top American diplomat has said.

The US sees India as a strategic partner, ""leading power"" and what former prime minister (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee correctly called ""natural allies"" in the Indo-Pacific region, US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster said, describing the country as a potential regional trade hub for American businesses.

""US-India relationship today is as broad, complex and rich in substance as any bilateral relationship in the world. It encompasses the entire spectrum of issues in international affairs,"" Juster, who was the keynote speaker at the 20th annual gala of Indo-American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston (IACCGH), said.

Texas imported USD 3.6 billion worth of goods from India while exported USD 5.1 billion in goods to India, he said, adding the state accounts for over 15 per cent of all US exports to India.

The US fully appreciates India's growing energy needs and look forward to helping meet those needs with US energy products, he said.

""Indian companies are expanding business in the US and Texas has been a prime beneficiary. For example, JSW Steel is investing USD 500 million in nearby Baytown to refurbish and expand a steel plant.

""Wipro and Infosys have opened technology centers in Texas and Mahindra's headquarters is in Houston. These Indian investments create jobs in this country, provide quality products to our consumers and contribute to our economy,"" Juster said, adding that the US-India strategic relationship is strong and on an upward trajectory.

Juster said that four strategic challenges India may face over the next decade - managing the rise of China; dealing with terrorism; promoting economic growth and modernising the military.

A number of US companies have reported ""increasing difficulties"" in conducting business in China. Accordingly, some companies are downgrading their operations there, while others are looking with great interest at alternative markets.

""India can seize the strategic opportunity - through trade and investment - to become an alternative hub for the US business in the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said.

Mentioning the Sri Lanka and the Pulwama attacks, he said: ""Recently the US and India convened a meeting in Washington DC of our Counterterrorism Joint Working Group, which sketched out next steps in our bilateral cooperation. We led efforts at the UN to successfully designate Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

""Eliminating the scourge of terrorism is a key challenge for a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and one on which we will continue to work closely with India,"" Juster said.

A major part of Juster's speech was on ways to enhance economic and commercial relations. However, he did not mince words while underlining that the US is concerned about the persistent trade deficits with India.

""US-India bilateral trade is over USD 140 billion, the increase in total trade in goods and services in 2018 was almost USD 16 billion,"" he said.

No country in the world has more advanced technology than the US and the STA-1 license exception opens the door for India to access that technology, he said.

""There are frictions and frustrations on the trade and investment fronts like limited market access for certain US goods and services, high tariffs, restrictions on the free flow of data and an unpredictable regulatory environment for investors.

""We are working with the Government of India to try to resolve these trade and investment issues, in order to fulfil the potential of our economic relationship and promote India's long-term growth,"" Juster said.

Resolving these concern and eschewing protectionist policies will send a powerful signal to US stakeholders as well as investors around the world that India is a world-class destination for commercial activities and an alternative business hub to China, the ambassador said.

""India is projected to spend as much as USD 150 billion on military modernisation over the next decade. India will find no better technology and defence partner than the US, should it decide to invest some of those resources in US equipment.

""Over the last 20 years, India has procured top-of-the-line US military equipment... This has contributed to India's military capabilities, while demonstrating the reliability of the US as a defence partner,"" he said.

Because of transparency associated with the US defense exports, there has never been any scandal associated with any of these procurements, he said.

The US companies are also increasingly working with the Indian partners to manufacture defence equipment in India, which builds out India's indigenous capabilities and projects a message of strength, the envoy said.

""We look forward to working with the new Indian government as we plan for the next 2+2 ministerial this fall. As we work with India on security issues in the Indo-Pacific region, we will continue to emphasise our belief that the US offers the best and most advanced defence equipment in the world.

""We also have the software and integrated networks needed for national defence. Our military-to-military cooperation and defence agreements with India, including the landmark COMCASA agreement, are increasing interoperability between our forces and ensuring that best-in-class US software and systems are available to India,"" Juster added."

37,2019-06-18,JSW,"The consensus trade after the thumping victory of the incumbent government, was to buy midcaps and smallcaps which has not played out, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


When Prime Minister Modi got re-elected, everyone thought India’s moment in the sun had arrived. The bulls were thumping the table thinking a stable mandate means good news for the market and the markets will go higher and not correct. But look at what is happening?Clearly after 23rd May, the sentiment had turned quite positive but one after one, the accidents which were happening earlier are not finding any conclusion. Starting from IL&FS to DHFL to the Yes Bank saga to even Jet Airways, there are so many accidents happening even within the Nifty stocks. Look at what is happening to the midcaps and smallcaps. The consensus trade after the thumping victory of the incumbent government, was to buy midcaps and smallcaps which has not played out. 

If you look at the last one month’s trade, a lot of midcaps and smallcaps have languished because of the prevailing liquidity situation. FIIs always want to buy market leaders or the top five or 10 stocks, which has been the story in the last one-one and a half years and that has continued even after elections. We are again seeing a polarised market with mid and smallcaps probably not going up. 

People are expecting something from the monsoon and also expecting that the government will come up with a stimulus in the form of consumption boost for the budget which would put something in the hands of the consumers, something in the hands of the farmers. People are also worried about how the government finds a solution to the NBFC crisis. All these questions remain unanswered. So, markets are temporarily experiencing a jolt in the wake of no good news, trade war and also the impending trade issue between India and the US. But the crude trading around $60 provides a bit of positive. In the next five years, we have a stable government in place and that is again a positive. 

In my view, there can be 3-4% correction in the market but use it to find your opportunities.


For the longest time, bulls have defended JSW Steel by saying this is a converter and if you buy a converter, you do not run the risk of commodity cycle?It has been the one stock which has always not followed the trend. The times are now such that globally there is a big impending slowdown. In a slowdown, it is very difficult for cyclicals per se and metals to do very well. If you look at a lot of numbers of Tata Steel or even other metal counters, it is going to be intrinsically difficult to justify how they would go up from here. 

If valuations do not go up, even the price points would be difficult to go up. My sense is JSW Steel can probably defy the trend for sometime but we would not like to touch metal counters at this point considering the global volatility. A lot of domestic centric plays are getting cheaper by the day and more correction can be experienced in the next month or two. 


If somebody buys tyre stocks, should one focus on the bad news coming from autos or good news coming from crude and good news coming from the raw material side?At a time where you are seeing auto stocks getting hammered, auto ancillaries, which depend on auto and are played as proxies when the auto sector performs well. My view is why not take a direct exposure in auto stocks which have seen huge correction? For companies like Maruti, Eicher, the world is not coming to an end but there are problems and the statement would look a little more superficial in the prevailing slowdown. In the last 6-8 months of big demand slowdown which could be extended for one more quarter, for a company like Maruti or Eicher which owns market share in their respective segmentations. 

I would say why not buy these stocks as they get inexpensive by the day. There will be a time when auto ancillaries would also play out as larger stories but a lot of tyre companies are also dependent on global demand. 

Of course, the OEM demand has been slack. The replacement demand probably does not slow down big time, but my sense is yes to answer your question. We would buy the auto stocks for a couple of years horizon and then something in auto ancillaries. A couple of tyre stocks will look good here also and even some auto components which have seen huge correction. Companies like Endurance Technologies look quite sound for a two-three year horizon."
38,2019-06-20,JSW,"Mumbai: Record high raw material prices may force Indian steelmakers to increase steel prices as it becomes difficult for them to maintain spreads, but weak demand in the short term with spiralling imports could be a challenge.

Companies had already raised prices of some flat and long products in the beginning of June, in the range of Rs 500 and Rs 750 per tonne in the monthly spot market and are looking at the response before they decide to raise prices further to “enhance the spreads”.

Iron ore price has shot up by more than half since the beginning of this year, touching the $110 per tonne mark in June while price of imported coking coal has also remained upward of $200 per tonne. The combined movements of the raw material has put pressure on the spreads. At the same time, a liquidity crunch in the market has affected demand while more than half a million tonne of steel imports are eating into the share of domestic steel every month.

“We have tried the possibility of increases in some products and need to see how it goes in various parts of the country and are watching the space as to how we can enhance the spreads a little better,” Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel, told ET.

He, however, said that these products had seen a correction in prices in April and May and with the cost increases, there’s an attempt to regain part of that loss, and that in the mid to long term, India is poised to be an “outlier” even as world economies battle low demand and financial risks.

Another senior official of a prominent steel company said it is looking at an increase of as much as Rs 1,000 per tonne, but is experiencing a “push back” from the market. The price of hot rolled coil is currently hovering around Rs 41,000-42,000 per tonne while prices for 6-month contracts inked with auto companies have come down in the April-September cycle.

“Chinese mills have reduced prices, yuan has also depreciated. Hence, on an import parity basis, there could be pressure on local steel prices, factoring in weak demand. In the prevailing scenario, we prefer integrated mills like Tata Steel,” said Ritesh Shah, lead analyst for materials at Investec India."

40,2019-06-20,JSW,"Nifty50 will remain in the range of plus-minus 300 points, as largecap companies are still on their feet and not showing any sign of correction, says Yogesh Mehta of Motilal Oswal Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 


ET Now: Overall market sentiment continues to be cautious. What would be your strategy in this market and what are you looking at in the near term ?


Yogesh Mehta: We have already corrected by almost 3.5% from the all time high scaled on 3rd June. The GDP numbers which are being revised by Fitch Rating and even RBI rate cut for the third straight time shows some cautious stance ahead for the rest part of 2019. And the Fed move which is now likely to have 25-50 bps rate cut in the later part of the calendar year, together with the slowdown in FIIs and automobile, consumption and the NBFC haunting does not paint a rosy picture.

Markets are likely to be cautious on the higher side but on the lower side, we do not foresee much negative trigger that market will crash. So the Nifty50 will remain in the range of almost plus minus 300 points because large cap companies are still holding on to their feet and not showing any sign of correction. We will have Budget in the first week of July so that may set the tone for the market going ahead.


ET Now: There has been a clear sense of the market sticking to some key names or defensive plays such as for TCS, ICICI or ITC. The market seems to be just holding on to a basket there. What else are you looking at even within the heavyweights?


Yogesh Mehta: Tech Mahindra can be looked at from here on as it looks very sound. Apart from ICICI Bank, RBL Bank would be the one where a significant correction has happened and therefore it looks promising with 30-35% growth rate in AUM for FY20 as well as FY21. This provides a good opportunity again at 2.6-2.7 times price to book. 

Even Titan, where the commentary from the management hints at a 20% growth rate in the jewellery segment as well as the overall revenue, gives confidence to the investors. This could be a good opportunity to lap up the stock though no correction has happened there. In the consumer segment, Hindustan Unilever or Britannia will be the two names one can clearly look at for the next six to 12 months. In the short term, Hindustan Unilever would be a better opportunity because the volume growth around 8-9% and higher ROEs will take care of the growth rate.


ET Now: As a house, Motilal Oswal always has been a fan of telecom. Is this a good time to revisit Bharti Airtel, because whatever could go wrong perhaps has gone wrong?

Yogesh Mehta: Yes, definitely. We like Bharti per se on the telecom side and now the ARPU has fallen to almost average of Rs 119 to 130 range from all time highs and this shows that the bottom is now in nearby vicinity because the tariff war with Jio may come to end by say next two-three months because they are also having an ARPU of around the same level. 

Secondly, the 5G auction which is taking place will be on the lower price tariff and that will be a positive for them. 

Third, the Africa IPO which has taken place, though it is at a 15-30% discount to the estimated price, it will take care of the good transition and balance sheet would be in better shape. And we believe that the data is taking over voice since the last two years and Bharti will continue to penetrate more. 


ET Now: In June, which has been the most popular trade at Motilal Oswal Private Advisory Group on the long side or on the short side. Which is the one stock where activity has been the highest?


Yogesh Mehta: The activity been the highest in three top rated stocks -- ICICI Bank, Axis Bank Bajaj Finance. These are the names where the highest comfort level was there during the June month even when the market was at all-time high and even the market has corrected.


ET Now: Three stocks where your firm has just been executing sell orders?


Yogesh Mehta: Sell orders were partially for booking profits into auto names where we were not so comfortable with the ongoing numbers one to three months down the line. So auto was majorly on the selling side with two wheelers as well as the four wheelers names. Apart from that, it was select NBFCs companies where we were not comfortable because of the slowdown and NBFC crunch, apart from Bajaj Finance. L&T Housing Finance was on the top side of the short side and we were booking profits on some of the pharma names as well.


ET Now: Would you have a view on metals? Are they a good investment proposition now?


Yogesh Mehta: Metals have always been cyclical, so we never like it as an investment proposition. The trade war is again hurting them on the production side or the capacity they are running like in the like European region or may be on the US side. So all this arbitrage opportunity for JSW Steel is now on the negative side so it is slowing down. Even Hindalco, the ramp-up of other minings are now on a slower side and the demand is not picking much. Tata Steel in the European region because of the Brexit is also facing issues, which does not give much of a comfort level to us on the metal side. I would not suggest anything on the investment for metals from here."

50,2019-06-26,JSW,"Mumbai: Indian steel prices have come under pressure due to weak global prices and some moderation in domestic demand, said foreign brokerage firm CLSA. Maintaining sell rating on Tata Steel and JSW Steel, the brokerage sees a downside risk to its below-consensus estimates. Tata Steel & JSW Steel stocks are trading at steep EV/Ebitda to global peers, said CLSA.

“Domestic steel demand has also softened in recent months led by funding constraints in government led infra projects around elections. This should improve but the September quarter is seasonally weak due to rains and an uptick is likely to happen only by December quarter,” said CLSA. “Demand in other sectors such as autos and residential property remains muted,” the brokerage said. CLSA has retained sell rating on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 395. It has also retained sell rating on JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 225.


The brokerage said rising iron ore prices are seen as beneficial for Tata’s backward-integrated India business but have not manifested in higher steel prices so far. European steel industry margins have fallen sharply, which poses further headwinds, especially given the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp is not going through, said CLSA.

The brokerage said JSW Steel should see a sharp decline in earnings in FY20 given weak steel prices. Any disruption in India’s iron ore supply post the expiry of privately-owned non-captive mines in March 2020 also poses a risk, it added. JSW has turned aggressive for Bhushan Power, which could be value dilutive and stretch its balance sheet further, the brokerage said.

“Valuations for Indian steel companies are at a steep premium to global peers despite much higher leverage (net debt/ebitda). EV/ Ebitda multiples of global steel companies have come down from 5-6 times historically to 4 times now, while Tata and JSW still trade at 6.2 times and 7.4 times FY20 EV/ Ebitda,"" the brokerage said."

55,2019-06-27,JSW,"Bengaluru: Giving in to political pressure from within the Congress and the Opposition BJP, the state government on Wednesday notified a four-member Cabinet sub-committee to re-examine the propriety of the May 27 Cabinet decision on the sale of land to JSW Steel in Sandur taluk of Ballari district. 

Home minister MB Patil will chair the committee, which will also have cooperation minister Bandeppa Kashempur, rural development minister Krishna Byre Gowda and social welfare minister Priyank Kharge. The Cabinet has referred the subject to the sub-committee with a mandate that it should go through the issue thoroughly and give its recommendation.

“The Cabinet wants us to re-examine the decision. We will look into the objections raised and go to the bottom of the issue and submit our report early,” Kashempur told 
ET.

The Cabinet had, on May 27, decided to execute the absolute sale deed for 3,667 acres of land in Sandur taluk on the grounds that the firm had fulfilled all conditions under the earlier industrial policy.

The Mumbai-headquartered JSW Group operates a 12 million tonne per annum (MTPA) steel plant on the campus under a lease-cum-sale agreement.

Since the Cabinet decision, the steel mill, controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal, has been at the centre of a political crossfire between the JD(S)-Congress coalition regime and the BJP. The decision was first opposed by former Congress minister and MLA HK Patil, which set off a series of reactions and protests, much to the discomfort of the JSW Group and the ruling coalition. Another Congress MLA Anand Singh (Vijayanagara), along with former Congress MLA Anil Lad, too opposed the Cabinet decision.

The Opposition BJP, led by the party’s state president BS Yeddyurappa, ratcheted up the issue with overnight dharna and protest demonstrations for three days to bring pressure on chief minister HD Kumaraswamy to drop the decision. The party alleged kickbacks even after the government relented a bit and agreed to review its decision through a Cabinet sub-committee.

The state government allotted the land to the steel mill in two instalments of 2,000 acres in 2006 and 1,666 acres in 2007 at Toranagallu in Sandur taluk. The company says it has invested about ₹50,000 crore to build the steel facility, ancillary units, township and other infrastructure, and provided jobs to 25,000 people. 

In an earlier chat with the 
ET, JSW Steel deputy MD Vinod Nowal had described the opposition as “political” in nature. “We signed the MoU with Karnataka in 1995, paid the price for the land as fixed by the government and provided jobs to those who lost land. We have fulfilled all conditions and the sale transaction was delayed because of elections.”"

57,2019-06-29,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel has moved closer to acquiring distressed Asian Colour Coated Ispat with around 80% of the lenders represented by a committee of creditors (CoC) having voted in favour of the company's resolution plan on Friday, two people in the know of the matter said. 

JSW Steel is offering Rs 1,525 crore to the lenders of the asset, which makes up for a little more than 30% of the total dues of Rs 5000 crore that the asset owes to banks. Operational creditors that are owed a total of Rs 507 crore will be getting Rs 25 crore from JSW Steel. 

The plan will be submitted to the NCLT Delhi bench for approval soon. 

JSW Steel declined to comment while a mail sent to the resolution professional Kuldip Kumar Bassi remained unanswered. 

Asian Colour Coated Ispat that was admitted for insolvency last year in July, has a total 1 million tonne of galvanising and colour coated capacities in two locations in Maharashtra and Haryana. 

The asset will be a good fit for JSW Steel that is almost tripling its colour coated steel capacity to 2 million tonnes per annum over a year and a half as part of its strategy to augment capacities of value added steel products that are seeing a growth in demand and also earn the manufacturers higher margins. The company had initially offered Rs 1,200 crore for the asset but upped its bid by more than 25% in May."
1,2019-07-01,JSW,"BENGALURU: Congress MLAs Anand Singh (Vijayanagar) and Ramesh Jarkiholi (Gokak) resigned from the Karnataka Assembly on Monday, barely 48 after Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy left for the United States on a private trip to open a temple built by community members. 

Singh MLA said he was resigning in protest against the government decision to sell land to JSW Steel in Sandur taluk of Ballari district at low prices, and to protect the interests of people of his constituency.

Jarkiholi , who had earlier announced he would resign but not specified when, sent in his resignation letter by fax from Mumbai, precipitating the political crisis in Karnataka. 

Singh has placed a few demands before the government, and said he would consider withdrawing his resignation if the government accepted those demands. Water Resources Minister DK Shivakumar said the decision related to sale of land to JSW Group was first taken by BS Yeddyurappa when he was the CM, and that he was shocked by Singh's decision to resign. 

Sections of the disgruntled Congress MLAs are said to have become active soon after the CM left Bengaluru. Some of them have been planning to join hands with the BJP for some time, but have not been able to move forward for want of a signal from the BJP leadership. 

CM Kumaraswamy in a tweet from the US said he was closely watching the developments back home and that the BJP would not succeed in its attempts to overthrow his government. 

Opposition BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa said, ""I know about 20 MLAs are unhappy, and the government's future hinges on their decision. Let them come out first we will see."" 

He said the BJP would not make any attempt to destabilise the government, but would form the next government. if the Congress-JD(S) coalition falls.

Last month’s Cabinet’s expansion has left a section of Congress MLAs unhappy as they were jockeying for a Cabinet position, or at least chairmanship of a Board or a Corporation. Quite a few MLAs have switched off their mobile phones.

Two other MLAs who are close to Jarkiholi, B.Nagendra (Ballari Rural) and Mahesh Kumathalli (Athani) are also said to be planning to put in their papers. JN Ganesh (Kampli) and BC Patil (Hirekerur) too have been sitting on the fence. Patil had been an aspirant for a Cabinet berth, but he has been missing the bus. 

The CM added two independents to his Cabinet last month to save the regime from external shocks. 

The Congress had, in recent months, been postponing the Cabinet expansion on one pretext or the other fearing rebellion from MLAs and threats to the government’s survival post event. 

Soon after the BJP returned to power at the Centre with a massive mandate, the JD(S) and the Congress leadership probably were least worried as they saw no visible threats from the BJP. The BJP central leadership, it was thought, is not in a hurry to topple the JD(S)-Congress regime, but it will not prevent if the regime were to fall on its own due to internal fights and conspiracies."
0,2019-07-01,JSW,"Geojit Financial Services has given a buy recommendation on JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 310.

Shares of JSW Steel traded at Rs 275 around 1:20 pm on 1 July, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 

With general elections over, government spending is expected to pick up, increasing the demand for steel in India. 

Steel demand is expected to be at 6 per cent with limited supply additions among major steel producers. 

Steel prices are expected to rebound globally and domestically, with iron ore prices crossing $100 per tonne. 

Any potential delay in renewal of Odisha mines could see domestic iron ore prices further increase in FY21. JSW expects flattish steels sales volume in FY20 (up 1.5 per cent YoY) and announced new projects with capex of Rs 5,700 crore and capex of Rs 34,300 crore over FY20-21 which is likely to increase net debt. 

JSW trades at a 5.2 times FY20E EV/Ebitda. The company is among the lowest-cost global steel converters and is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing up-cycle in India steel. 

""We maintain buy rating and value the stock at 6 times FY21E EV/Ebitda and arrive at a target price of Rs 310,"" said the brokerage."

4,2019-07-02,JSW,"BENGALURU: The Congress in Karnataka has warned the Opposition BJP that the JD(S)-Congress coalition will not hesitate to do ""counter politics"" if the BJP does not realise the grand old party is ""keeping quiet"" in deference to its 70-year old value system.

""Silence is not a weakness,"" the party's state unit tweeted on Tuesday, with a warning that the ruling coalition not hesitate to counter the BJP's strategies in the interest of Karnataka government's stability. 

A source in the Congress claimed that five BJP MLAs were ready to switch sides if the ruling parties wanted to save the government from the resignations of dissident Congress MLAs. Interestingly, senior Congress leaders have maintained a measured silence, not offering much comments on the political developments. 

The coalition regime is battling a fresh crisis after two Congress MLAs quit their Karnataka Assembly membership on Monday throwing the 13-month regime into disarray, when Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy left for the United States on a private trip. 

Vijayanagar MLA Anand Singh has quit over a few issues including the sale of land to JSW Steel, and Gokak MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi resigned as announced long ago. Both are set to join the BJP, according to sources. 

With the resignation of two MLAs, the Congress strength in the Assembly has dropped to 77. Two independents, who the CM inducted into the Cabinet last month, however, are with the party. The BJP has 105 members, while the JD(S) has 38 members including the lone BSP member. 

Sections of the disgruntled Congress MLAs are keenly watching the political developments, and if political grapevine is any indication, some more MLAs may resign. Some of these MLAs have been planning to join hands with the BJP for some time, but have not been able to move forward for want of a signal from the BJP leadership.

13,2019-07-05,JSW,"KOLKATA: The budget proposal to raise customs duty on stainless steel items from 5% to 7.5% will rein in imports of semi finished products by unorganised sector of domestic producers but it leaves large integrated steel players both in stainless and carbon steel with little to cheer. The market response was immediate as most steel stocks were seen trading lower on the BSE after the budget.

K K Pahuja, President, Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) said: “This barely changes the scenario as there is little import of these semi-finished stainless-steel products in the country. Imports mainly are in stainless steel flat products, where imports market share is as high as 20% and needs protection.” It will not impact the likes of bigger organised players like, Jindal Stainless. ""It neither affects us nor benefits us. We had asked for a hike in duty to 12.5% from 7.5% at present. That did not happen,"" a JSL official said. Import of stainless steel particularly from Indonesia to India had grown nearly nine times from nearly 8,000 tonne in 2017-18 to 67,000 tonne in 2018-19, according to ISSDA.

Large integrated steel producers have also been disappointed. The US decision to impose tariff on Chinese and Vietnamese steel products has raised the threat of more steel being channelled into India. Indian Steel Association with members like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited, RINL, JSPL have been lobbying for increase in customs duty, at a time when India's own steel demand seems to have slackened due to a slowdown in automobiles sector and lower infra spends. This prompted the steel ministry to seek a duty hike from 7.5-12.5% at present to 15%. Most steel stocks went down on the BSE after the Budget with Tata Steel down more than 3% at Rs 480.45 at around 3 pm, while SAIL was trading at Rs 48.55 down 6.35%, the JSW Steel scrip lost 2.84% at Rs 267.65 and JSPL was trading at Rs 134.45 down 5.35% over their respective previous close. 

However, the budget proposal for bank capitalisation is likely to boost credit growth and help re-start the economy. Steel being a core infrastructure industry is likely to benefit as a result.

As Koushik Chatterjee, CFO-Tata Steel commented after the budget: “The Rs 70,000 crore bank capitalisation will help encourage credit growth rate. I can speak for Tata Steel. From an investment point, there are things to look up for since there is a focus on infrastructure the framework for next 2-3 years is in place,"" he said.

The FM’s proposal to reduce customs duty on certain inputs for making 'CRGO sheets' (Cold Rolled Grain Oriented) or electrical steels -- used in critical power equipment-- from 5 % to 2.5% from is aimed at encouraging domestic production of such steel products in the country. SAIL’s Rourkela Steel Plant is the largest producer of cold rolled non-oriented steels in India. More recently, JSW Steel, in co-operation with JFE Corp of Japan has been keen on developing CRGO steels in India. The steel ministry is spearheading a Rs 500-crore public-private R&D project for indigenous technology to produce CRGO steels in India, with Department of Scientific Industrial Research — National Metallurgical Laboratory (DSIR- NML), the ministry, Tata Steel and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam."

12,2019-07-05,JSW,"The Finance Minister's budget proposal to exempt customs duty on certain inputs for making 'CRGO sheets' or 'Cold Rolled Grain Oriented' steel sheets is aimed at encouraging domestic production of such steel products in the country. 

At present, few Indian steel producers produce this variety of value-added steels within the country. CRGO sheets --also known as 'electrical steels' -- are widely used in the power sector for making critical equipment like transformers. It also finds use in the telecom sector. Electrical steels, used in manufacturing static motors such as transformers, are priced higher at nearly Rs 1.5 lakh per tonne-- or nearly five times the value of hot rolled coils (HRC) that are used to make cars and consumer durables.

Steel Authority of India's Rourkela Steel Plant is the largest producer of cold rolled non-oriented steels in India. More recently, JSW Steel, in co-operation with JFE Corp of Japan has been keen on developing CRGO steels in India. Globally too, only a clutch of companies including the likes of German steel major, Thyssenkrupp produce CRGO and the technology is not easily available for assimilation.

Electrical steels, used in manufacturing static motors such as transformers, are priced higher at nearly Rs 1.5 lakh per tonne-- or nearly five times the value of hot rolled coils (HRC) that are used to make cars and consumer durables. 

According to the FM's budget speech, customs duty has been cut down from 5% to 2.5% on all inputs for CRGO steels. This inlcude Magnesium oxide coated or MgO-coated Cold Rolled steel coils (CRC), Hot Rolled Coils (HRC) and Cold-rolled MgO-coated and annealed steel as well as Hot Rolled annealed and pickled coils. 

Considering its critical requirement, the union steel ministry has taken up steps to encourage production of electrical steels in the country.The steel ministry is spearheading a Rs 500-crore public-private research and development project for indigenous technology to produce high value cold rolled grain oriented (CRGO), or electrical steels in India. 

The Indian project will involve the Department of Scientific Industrial Research — National Metallurgical Laboratory (DSIR- NML), the ministry, Tata Steel and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam.

A pilot plant was proposed to set up at NML premises in Jamshedpur for which engineering consultancy Mecon had prepared a detailed project report.

If successful, it would be a significant breakthrough since CRGO grade steels will be produced in India for the first time. Currently, bulk of the country's requirements are met through imports."

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
15,2019-07-08,JSW,"NEW DELHI: JSW Steel on Monday said its crude steel output grew 3 per cent to 4.24 million tonne (MT) in the quarter ended June 30. The Sajjan Jindal-led company had produced 4.12 MT during the corresponding period a year ago, JSW Steel said in a BSE filing. 

 During the April-June 2019 period, the company said its production of flat-rolled products grew marginally by 1 per cent to 2.91 MT from 2.87 MT in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. 

 The output of long-rolled products was at 1.05 MT, up 12 per cent from 0.93 MT in April-June 2018. 

 JSW Steel is the flagship company of the diversified USD 14-billion JSW Group having a leading presence in sectors such as steel, energy, infrastructure, cement, and sports, among others."
16,2019-07-09,JSW,"Bengaluru: The four-member Cabinet Sub-Committee set up by the State Government to give its views on the sale of land to JSW Steel in Sandur taluk of Ballari district has not arrived at any decision on the subject, Social Welfare Minister Priynak Kharge, who is a member of the committee, has clarified. 

“We held a meeting on Monday to get a broad idea about the issue and get clarifications from the officials. The officials were also present and provided us with necessary details. It was just a preliminary meeting, and we have not arrived any conclusion,” Kharge told ET. 

The four-member committee consisting of Home Minister MB Patil, Cooperation Minister Bandeppa Kashempur, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, besides Kharge went about its assigned job and met amid the confusion over the survival of the 13-month old JD(S)-Congress coalition regime in Karnataka.

In a tweet Kharge said: “A section of the media has reported that the Cabinet Sub Committee set up to loook into the Jindal issue has taken the decision to allot the land to them. 

This is absolutely false news. The sub committee has sought more details on various aspects of the issue.”

Giving in to political pressure from within the Congress and the Opposition BJP, the State Government last month notified a four-member Cabinet sub-committee to re-examine the propriety of the May 27 Cabinet decision on the sale of land to JSW Steel Limited. 

The Cabinet, on May 27, decided to executive absolute sale deed in respect of 3667 acres of land in Sandur taluk of Ballari district on grounds that the firm has fulfilled all the commitments laid down under the earlier Industrial Policy. The Mumbai-headquartered JSW Group operates a 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) steel plant on the sprawling campus it got under a lease-cum-sale agreement. 

Since the Cabinet decision, the steel mill, controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal, has been at the centre of a political crossfire between the JD(S)-Congress coalition regime and the BJP. The decision was first opposed by former Congress Minister and MLA HK Patil, which set off a series of reactions and protests, much to the discomfort of the JSW Group and the ruling coalition. Another Congress MLA Anand Singh (Vijayanagara), along with former Congress MLA Anil Lad, too opposed the Cabinet decision. 

The Opposition BJP, led by party’s state president BS Yeddyurappa, ratcheted up the issue with overnight dharna and protest demonstrations for three days to bring pressure on Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to drop the decision. The party even alleged kickbacks even after the government relented a bit and agreed to review its decision through a Cabinet sub-committee.

The state government allotted the land to the steel mill in two instalments of 2,000 acres in 2006 and 1,666 acres in 2007 at Toranagallu in Sandur taluk. The company says it has invested about Rs 50,000 crore to build the steel facility, ancillary units, township and other infrastructure, and provided jobs to 25,000 people."

As Budget blues take its toll on stocks, investors are hoping for some relief from June quarter earnings. The rupee's tepid rise against the US dollar also gave a leg up to market sentiment.

Here is a breakdown of key highlights of Wednesday's session: 


IndiGo plunges 11%Shares of InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) plummeted 10.73 per cent to Rs 1,397.75 as the feud between the promoters took a turn for the worse after one of the warring partners complained to Sebi about questionable corporate governance practices, alleging that even a

28,2019-07-11,JSW,"As the JD(S)-Congress coalition in Karnataka hangs by a thread, legal experts believe the stage is set for a constitutional crisis. 
 

The delay by Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar in processing the resignation letters of (initially) 13 MLAs may have given a breather to the ruling coalition. But with 10 rebel legislators moving the Supreme Court alleging that Kumar deliberately delayed accepting their resignations, it is checkmate again.

Supreme Court advocate KV Dhananjay said with the rebel MLAs’ number rising to 16, the government can no longer make any important decisions. “Yet, amidst this political crisis, business is happening, including the mass transfer of 826 engineers on a single day (Tuesday). The government is also trying to expedite the process of selling land to JSW Steel in Ballari. All these decisions cannot be taken when the government has lost majority,” he said.

Former advocate-general Ashok Haranahalli agreed that a constitutional crisis is at hand, especially due to the Speaker’s refusal to accept the resignations over “flimsy reasons.” “If the Speaker is convinced that the MLAs have resigned without being coerced, then he should simply accept it. It appears the Speaker is delaying the process for political reasons, which is leading to a larger crisis,” Haranahalli said.

While the Supreme Court’s decision on the rebels’ resignation (likely to be heard on Wednesday) could decide the fate of the coalition swiftly, the possibility of the Congress disqualifying the rebels and the governor’s intervention could decide the next course of action for the three major parties in the state, which includes the BJP. “The governor may direct the chief minister to prove his majority. This could happen on Friday when the Assembly reopens. If the ruling coalition fails to prove its majority, the BJP could form the government,” said former advocate-general BV Acharya.

After the 2018 Assembly election, the Supreme Court, while hearing a case filed by the Congress-JD(S), had asked the BJP to prove its strength without delay. The governor had given the BJP 15 days to prove its majority. “The same could be applicable this time, too,” Acharya said.

Congress leaders are exploring the possibility of disqualifying the rebel legislators to prevent the BJP from forming a government. The plan, it appears, is to delay the acceptance of the resignation letters, issue a whip on Friday and disqualify those who remain absent.

Even disqualification is unlikely to help the Congress. “Legally, it is not possible to invoke the anti-defection law as the legislators have only resigned from the Assembly and not from the party. In fact, the government will be a minority even if the anti-defection law is applied to the 16 rebels,” Dhananjay said.

When the anti-defection law was invoked against some Tamil Nadu MLAs, the Election Commission had clarified that the disqualified legislators could contest bypolls. “Disqualification does not prohibit members from contesting polls for six years. They are free to contest bypolls,” Dhananjay said.


BUSINESS NOT AS USUAL

Amidst the political crisis, business is happening, including mass transfer of 826 engineers (on Tuesday). The govt is also trying to expedite the sale of land to JSW Steel. All these decisions cannot be taken when the govt has lost majority

India’s steelmakers, more accustomed to securing raw materials such as iron ore and coal, are keeping another key resource in their sights: water.

Two of India’s biggest steelmakers — JSW Steel Ltd. and Tata Steel Ltd. — and metal producer Vedanta Ltd. have flagged risks due to water shortages in the past month as the world’s second-most populous country faces an unprecedented water crisis, with taps running dry in one of its biggest cities this year.

Competition for the resource is set to grow in India, where nearly a third of the country is water-stressed, increasing costs and risks for companies. A delayed monsoon, which accounts for 70% of the nation’s annual rainfall, has exacerbated the situation this year.

“The urgency surrounding water supply risks is not lost in our discussions with companies, but the talking is still happening behind closed doors,” according to Damandeep Singh, director at CDP, which runs a global disclosure system for companies and others to report environmental risks. “The problem is that when companies in India get water, they get it cheap. There’s no incentive to manage a resource when it is available so cheap.”

Water is shaping up to be a serious economic risk in Asia’s third-largest economy. Desertification, land degradation and drought cost India about 2.54% of gross domestic product in 2014-15, according to a study last year by India’s environment ministry. In a global survey of miners, just under half the respondents reported financial impact worth $11.8 billion over five years thanks to water-related problems such as droughts, increased water stress and flooding, according to a 2018 report from CDP.


Water Risks
India’s second-biggest steel mill JSW Steel has built a new water reservoir with 1.3 thousand million cubic feet storage capacity at its plant in the water-scarce southern state of Karnataka to ensure adequate supply for uninterrupted operations, the Sajjan Jindal-owned company said in its annual report on July 4.

Top producer Tata Steel is also investing in sewage treatment plants to process water for reuse and creating new rain water harvesting structures to improve the groundwater table. Water is used as a coolant in the steel making process and over 3 cubic meters of freshwater is required per ton of crude steel produced, it said in the annual report last month.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta performed a water risk assessment at 25 of its most significant business locations and found that its operations in Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu had a greater risk of shortages than elsewhere because of competitive pressures for water usage in those regions, the Mumbai-based company said in its annual report last month.


‘Ostrich in the Sand’
About 600 million Indians are facing high-to-extreme water stress and the situation is set to worsen as water requirements rise, according to a 2018 report by NITI Aayog, the government’s policy making body. Water demand is expected to be twice the available supply by 2030, implying severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people and an about 6% loss in India’s gross domestic product, it said.

Greater demand for resources and extraction of mineral reserves in often water-scarce locations, where stable supply of water is no longer guaranteed, continues to jeopardize existing and future operations, according to CDP.

“Companies including miners have been taking water for granted for the longest period,” CDP’s Singh said. “They are still taking an ostrich-in-the-sand approach.”"
39,2019-07-15,JSW,"JSW Steel on Monday told the National Company Law Tribunal that the company is not backing out from the ongoing resolution process of Bhushan Power & Steel despite reports of alleged fraud by its former promoters.

During the proceedings in NCLT, counsel appearing for JSW Steel informed the tribunal that it was anxious about the alleged fraud reports and needs to know what is going inside Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL).

A two member NCLT bench headed by the President Justice M M Kumar asked the Resolution Professional (RP) of BPSL to hand over a copy of the forensic report to JSW Steel.

NCLT said that alleged fraud reports will not have any impact on the insolvency resolution process and JSW's resolution plan for BPSL.

NCLT has to take a decision over the lenders' approval of the resolution plan of JSW Steel for BPSL.

Earlier on February 4, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had dismissed the plea of Tata Steel and upheld the Committee of Creditors (CoC) decision to approve JSW Steel's bid.

The NCLAT had said the CoC decision was well within its rights to negotiate better terms with resolution applicants and has had asked NCLT to decide over JSW Steel's bid by March 31, 2019.

However, the judgement is still pending before the Principal bench of NCLT.

JSW Steel had revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore and later to over Rs 19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at Rs 17,000 crore after it had refused to revise its bid.

Last week, state-owned lender Allahabad Bank had reported fraud of over Rs 1,774 crore by BPSL to the Reserve Bank of India.

Earlier, PNB reported a fraud worth Rs 3,805.15 crore by BPSL by misappropriating bank funds and manipulating its books of accounts.

Around 85 per cent of PNB's Rs 4,399 crore exposure to the company had been siphoned off.

Investigate agency CBI has already registered complaint in April names several other lenders.

According to the CBI, BPSL diverted around Rs 2,348 crore through its directors and staff from the loan accounts of PNB, Oriental Bank of Commerce, IDBI Bank and UCO Bank into the accounts of more than 200 shell companies without any obvious purpose."
36,2019-07-15,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Around 12 stocks rose to touch their 52-week highs on NSE in Monday's session.

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 24.05 points up at 11,576.55 while the BSE Sensex was trading 135.89 points up at 38872.12. 

Overall, 23 shares were trading in the green in Nifty50 index, while 27 were trading in the red. 

In the Nifty 50 index, Infosys, Sun Pharma, YES Bank, Tata Motors and Tech Mahindra were among the top gainers. 

While Indiabulls Housing Finance, ZEEL, Vedanta, JSW Steel and SBI were trading in the red."
40,2019-07-15,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Monday’s session was marked by stock and sector-specific action as healthy gains in IT, auto and financial stocks helped equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty to settle in the green.

“Stock-specific action is happening in the market. Infosys’ guidance for FY20 has influenced the sentiment in the entire IT pack. Pharma stocks performed, as the market is expecting a turnaround,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect. 

Reports that the government was considering some form of relief for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from the income-tax surcharge on super-rich also influenced the market mood. Positive Asian peers and a stronger rupee also offered support. 

The 30-share Sensex ended 160 points, or 0.41 per cent, higher at 38,896, with 14 stocks ending in the green. Nifty closed 36 points, or 0.31 per cent, higher at 11,588, with 23 stocks advancing and 27 declining. 


Here is a breakdown of key actions from Monday's session:


311 stocks plumb 52-week lows
While the benchmark Sensex ended with gains, as many as 311 stocks, including Force Motors, Jamna Auto Industries, Castrol India, Tata Elxsi, Nocil and New India Assurance Company plumbed 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, Infosys, Intellect Design Arena and SBI Life Insurance Company were among 35 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


216 stocks hit lower circuits
Overall 216 stocks, including Cox & Kings, Manpasand Beverages, Reliance Communications, Parsvnath Developers and Religare Enterprises, hit their lower circuits on BSE. On the other hand, 5paisa Capital, Kridhan Infra, Ashapura Minechem, Mangalam Drugs & Organics and Jaypee Infratech were among the 118 stocks that hit upper circuit limits.


Infosys shares jump 7%
Shares of Infosys jumped over 7.20 per cent to close at Rs 779.45, adding Rs 17,636 crore to its market capitalisation, buoyed by its positive FY20 guidance, which the IT major raised. The company on Friday maintained its margin guidance, despite some erosion in June quarter margins. It expects to return about 85 per cent of free cash flow to investors cumulatively over next five years. 


Allahabad Bank cracks 8%
Shares of public lender settled with a cut of 7.74 per cent at Rs 43.50 as it became the country’s second state-owned bank to report a major alleged fraud by bankrupt steelmaker Bhushan Power & Steel this month.


YES Bank loses steam
After jumping over 5 per cent intraday, shares of YES Bank lost steam to close 1 per cent down at Rs 93.20, falling prey to profit booking. Reports that a US-based PE firm is leading a four-member consortium to pick stake in the private lender had given the stock a shot in the arm. 


DHFL plunges 29%
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) plunges 29.15 per cent to settle at Rs 48.50 even as the NBFC issued a clarification over its Saturday’s gloomy commentary. On Saturday, the company said the recent developments have threatened its ability to continue as a going concern. The company said it is working with stakeholders and creditors to ensure resolution of liquidity issues, without any hair cut to the lenders. 


Sun Pharma gains 4%
Shares of the pharma rose 3.61 per cent to Rs 422.40 after Morgan Stanley doubly upgraded the scrip to ‘overweight’ on Sunday and set a revised target of Rs 505. The foreign brokerage is baking in an earnings revival from FY21 onwards, driven by steady growth in the base business coupled with plateauing of the current elevated cost structure which it believes will lead to positive operating leverage. 


Piramal Enterprises jumps 7%
Shares of Piramal Enterprises climbed 6.78 per cent to end at Rs 2,077.75 after reports that the company was on the verge of finalising a massive Rs 9,600 crore capital infusion deal with Softbank and one more party. Ajay Piramal, as well as his in-law Mukesh Ambani, have been discussing a new business together in which Softbank sees strong potential, reports suggested. 


100 stocks show fall imminent
Momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 100 counters on BSE, signalling an imminent or more fall for them in coming sessions. Among those stocks were MTNL, DHFL, Allahabad Bank, Bharti Airtel, Delta Corp and Petronet LNG.

43,2019-07-16,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Tata Steel were up 2 per cent in Tuesday's trade even as foreign brokerage Citi warned of a negative surprise in June quarter results. The brokerage is expecting Tata Steel to report weak numbers for the quarter on weak volumes.

The brokerage said it has opened a 30-day 'negative' catalyst watch on the steel maker. Tata Steel has indicated that liquidity issues in India have impacted demand, it said.

Citi said it has maintained its ‘sell’ rating on the scrip with a target of Rs 435, owing to weak steel price and China worries.

Domestic steel prices have fallen for the sixth consecutive week. They are below Rs 40,000 per tonne for the first time since December 2017. This has led to raw material spreads plunging to two–years’ low, said Edelweiss Securities. 

“Coupled with the onset of a seasonally weak demand period, we see further profitability headwinds, notwithstanding expectations of a weak Q1FY20,” Edelweiss Securities said in a note.

Credit Suisse, meanwhile, said EU steel prices have recovered Post output cuts by Arcelor.

“Expect more hikes as we enter strong August-September season,” it said while staying positive on Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL. 

ICICIdirect said that Tata Steel is focusing on stabilising its European operations while also focusing on other potential alternatives, post the cancellation of the proposed JV with ThyssenKrupp.

“The resumption of operations of blast furnace 5 at Port Talbot in January 2019 and investments made to increase the life and reduce maintenance costs is expected to reduce the overall operating costs auguring well for company,” it said.

The shares of the company closed 1.77 per cent higher at Rs 476.50 on BSE."
42,2019-07-16,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices have turned rangebound amid economic uncertainty and earnings jitters. Investors are in wait-and-watch mode to see earnings catch up with valuations, though analysts are not sure that is happening anytime soon.

Despite this, over three dozen largecap and midcap stocks on NSE could see strong price-wise action in the coming days. Some 41 stocks are looking strong on technical charts for a bounce, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. These counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Infosys, Asian Paints, Jindal Steel & Power, United Spirits, JSW Steel and UltraTech Cement besides HDFC Life Insurance, Equitas Holdings, DCB Bank, Quess Corp, GSPL, IGL, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Tata Sponge Iron, among others. 







The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile 69 stocks are showing a bearish trend. They Bharti Airtel, DHFL, Allahabad Bank, Indiabulls Real Estate, Colgate-Palmolive and Petronet LNG.

RBL Bank, UCO Bank, Radico Khaitan, PNB Housing Finance, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, VRL Logistics and The Mandhana Retail are also looking weak on technical charts. 







“Traders could find opportunities on both sides of the trade and, hence, one should remain stock-specific with a proper risk management strategy,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation based on a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, it has been consolidating and its earlier support at 11,640 is acting as a key resistance. “The index needs to convincingly surpass the hurdle in the 11,640-11,700 zone to regain strength. On the flipside, the 11,460-11,430 zone is the immediate support range to watch out for. The index is witnessing a time-wise correction. Unless we see a breakout on either direction, traders should maintain a stock-specific approach,” Chavan said.

The odds are in favour of the bears as long as Nifty50 trades below the swing high of 11,640, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. “The broader market indices are already reflecting inherent weakness. For Nifty50, the 11,500 and 11,461 levels will be the key levels on the downside below which it will be prone to a larger decline.”


Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of Infosys shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.3 per cent higher at Rs 781.85 on NSE."

44,2019-07-16,JSW,"Money managers on Dalal Street continued to shower affection on private banks for the ninth successive month as their exposure hit 19.90 per cent in June, up 370 basis points YoY and 20 basis points QoQ. 

There are hopes that large private corporate banks with adequate provisioning and fewer concerns over incremental slippages from select leveraged accounts could see a sharp improvement in return on assets going forward. 

Even in a tumultuous month for the equity market, mutual funds further increased exposure to the NBFC space by 10 basis points to 9.20 per cent. It was followed by technology (up 10 basis points to 8.70 per cent) and consumers (up 20 basis points to 7.60 per cent).

“Earnings growth has not been very impressive over the past few years. However, there are select quality companies – mostly among private banks, insurance, technology, energy, industrials, consumer, and media – which show potential,” Sanjay Singh, Head of Global Markets, BNP Paribas India, told ETMarkets.com.

June was a highly volatile month for the market, with Nifty surpassing the 12,000-mark to hit a record high at the beginning of the month. But the euphoria over the general election outcome fizzled out as investors woke up to ground realities, including a slowdown in the economy, concerns over liquidity woes for NBFCs, and a moderation in consumption, among others. 

Throughout the month, Nifty consolidated in the 11,500-12,000 range, in keeping with the volatile trend of the past two months. Nifty Private Bank index declined 1.86 per cent, while Nifty50 lost 1.12 per cent. 

Reliance Securities continues to prefer corporate banks, including ICICI Bank and SBI, with a strong liability franchise, fewer concerns over incremental slippages from corporate accounts and those that have adequate provisioning and are trading at inexpensive valuations. 

“Given a not-so-benign operating environment, conservative plays like HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank should continue to do well, even though they are trading at expensive valuation multiples,” the brokerage said. 

In the Nifty50 pack, mutual funds were net buyers of around 62 per cent of stocks, with Tech Mahindra, JSW Steel, Bharti Infra, Hero Moto and IndusInd Bank being their top picks. (See table).

On the other hand, they reduced stakes in select media, oil & gas, chemicals, infrastructure, chemicals, infrastructure, cement and auto stocks.

The auto industry has been going through a very difficult phase as marked by a 17.54 per cent slump in domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales in June and a 25 per cent drop in domestic car sales across categories, data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) revealed.

Motorcycle sales slipped 9.57 per cent to 10,84,598 units in June 11,99,332 units a year earlier.

The mutual fund industry’s average asset under management (AUM) increased for the second consecutive quarter in Q1FY20 (over 4.20 per cent QoQ) to touch a new high of Rs 25.6 lakh crore. 

“Investors continued to park money in mutual funds, with inflows remaining steady and the contribution of systematic investment plans (SIPs) remains stable at Rs 8120 crore,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report."
45,2019-07-16,JSW,"The government may impose a provisional anti-dumping duty of up to USD 199 per tonne on imports of aluminium and zinc coated flat products from China, Vietnam and Korea, according to a notification of the commerce ministry.

The duty was recommended by the ministry's investigation arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) after conducting a thorough probe, following a complaint from JSW Steel Coated Products Ltd.

Aluminium and zinc coated flat products are used in infrastructure projects, solar power plants, roofing, and white goods. The probe by the directorate concluded that there is a significant increase in imports of the goods from these three counties in absolute terms. DGTR also stated that the products have been exported to India from these nations at below their normal values due to which the domestic industry has suffered material injury.

""Having initiated and conducted the investigation into dumping, injury and causal link..., the authority is of the view that imposition of provisional duty is required to offset dumping and injury, pending completion of the investigation,"" DGTR said. The recommended duty ranges between USD 28.67- 199.53 per tonne.

The final decision to impose the duty will be taken by the finance ministry. ""The authority considers it necessary and recommends imposition of provisional anti-dumping duty on the imports,"" it said. A country conducts anti-dumping investigation on the basis of applications filed by domestic industry with prima facie evidence of dumping of goods in the country.

The probe is a quasi-judicial process and is allowed under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. India is a member of WTO which frames laws for global exports and imports.

During April 2018 to March 2019, DGTR initiated 24 anti-dumping (both fresh and review) investigations, and issued final findings in 50 such cases. Anti-dumping duties are levied to provide a level playing field to local industry by guarding against cheap below-cost imports."

49,2019-07-17,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel has planned fresh investment in adding tinplate capacity, which may help it overtake Tata Steel that has controlled the market for nearly a century through its subsidiary, Tinplate Company of India.

In the last financial year, JSW Steel spent ₹575 crore in building a 2.5-lakh-tonne tinplate mill with related facilities at its Tarapur unit. The company has decided to set up another mill of similar capacity at an estimated cost of ₹419 crore at the same location, JSW Steel said in its annual note to shareholders. It cited increasing demand for the sheet, used for making packaging material and other products, for adding capacity.

The proposed mill, when commissioned, will take JSW Steel’s tinplate capacity to six lakh tonnes a year, including one lakh tonnes from its 50% ownership in Punjab-based Vallabh Tinplate.

JSW Steel has not mentioned a timeline for commissioning the mill. Tata Steel’s Tinplate Company, with a capacity of 3.8 lakh tonnes per annum, had also said it was working on various growth options that needed to be finalised.

Tinplate Company is the country's oldest manufacturer of tinplate and has a 45% share of the market. In last year's annual report, Koushik Chatterjee, the chairman of Tinplate Company, said its margins might come under pressure in the near future with increased domestic competition and a growing level of substitutes. The company's net profit for the April-June quarter dropped 7% to ₹ 8.8 crore."

46,2019-07-17,JSW,"Kolkata | Mumbai: JSW Steel has sought immunity from future litigations against Bhushan Power & Steel for any illegal activity under the previous management amid reports of alleged bank fraud by former promoters of the troubled company undergoing debt resolution process.

JSW Steel, whose resolution plan under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has been approved by lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL), has approached the National Company Law Tribunal for relief in the wake of a series of fraud cases reported by banks including Punjab National Bank and Allahabad Bank against BPSL.

“We have represented to NCLT after PNB and other cases,” a top JSW official told ET on Tuesday. “We have sought relief so that we are not impacted by any litigation. We are waiting for the court order.”

JSW Steel has also asked for a copy of the forensic audit report on BPSL following these cases. PNB had recently reported a Rs 3,800-crore fraud by BPSL by way of misappropriating bank funds and manipulating its books. Allahabad Bank last week reported a Rs 1,774-crore fraud.

The JSW official, speaking on condition of anonymity, however, refuted speculation that the company would cut back its Rs 19,300-crore bid for BPSL due to the fraud cases. “We are not looking at reducing our bid, nor are we exploring the option to withdraw it,” the person said. “We have been pursuing BPSL under the IBC right form the time the resolution process was initiated and we continue to be interested in acquiring the company.”

BPSL was the sixth highest debtor in the Reserve Bank of India’s first list of twelve large defaulters. JSW Steel outbid Tata Steel in the race for the asset which was admitted to NCLT in June 2017. Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty House, too, was in the race.

BPSL owes more than Rs 47,100 crore to a consortium of 34 lenders led by State Bank of India. While opinion is divided over whether NCLT can provide relief as sought by JSW Steel, the official said the company’s appeal draws strength from Section 238 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code that says IBC overrides all other laws.

According to Ashish K Singh, founder of law firm Capstone Legal, the anxiety of JSW comes from the fact that assets of BPSL may be considered “proceeds of a crime” under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and other enactments."

55,2019-07-19,JSW,"Taking total investment in tin plate manufacturing to almost Rs 1,000 crore, JSW Steel on Friday began the roll out of JSW Platina to tap the growing opportunity for tinplate products demanded by India's packaging industry. 

ET had reported on Wednesday that the company has ramped up investments at its Tarapur works facility in Maharashtra by deciding to spend another Rs 419 crore to bring up a 0.25 million tonne tin plate manufacturing facility. Last year, the company installed and commissioned a 0.25 million tonne mill with a total expenditure of Rs 575 crore. The overall investment at Tarapur will take JSW Steel's total tin plate manufacturing capacity to 5 lakh tonnes per annum. Additionally, it also has a 1 lakh tonne per annum tin plate capacity in Punjab through Vallabh Tinplate in which the company holds 50% stake. 

With the ban of single use plastic in many states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, among others, demand of tin plate has gone up by more than 20% to touch 7 lakh tonnes per annum in the last financial year. JSW Steel said it is the first player in the country to introduce continuous annealing technology for making the packaging material. The technology will make the material tougher. 

""As the food storage and supply chain structure undergoes a trend in the country, the demand for tinplate is also expected to grow between 6-7%,"" Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel told ET. He added that in the segment that houses uses of tin plate for non-oil purposes like beverage cans, aerosol cans, food boxes etc, the demand growth is expected to be higher at around 9%. 

""As a hygienic & eco-friendly packaging product, JSW Platina can help reduce carbon footprint as India moves towards reducing plastic consumption by eliminating single use plastics over next few years. JSW Platina also offers packaging industry a Made In India alternative by offering continuous annealed tinplate which are, so far, entirely imported by packaging manufacturers. Our technologically advanced product is well-positioned to reduce the foreign exchange burden of these manufacturers through import substitution with JSW Platina,"" Acharya said. 

The domestic tin plate market is estimated to be close to Rs 6,000 crore and has been dominated by Tinplate Company of India, a Tata Steel subsidiary for almost a century. With the commissioning of the new line, JSW Steel may overtake Tata Steel in the production of the material. TCIL had earlier told ET that it is also working on a few growth options that need to be finalised. TCIL's current capacity is 380,000 tonnes. 

However, the market has also been under the threat of imports from both developed as well as countries with whom India has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with. Out of the 7 lakh tonnes current demand, 3 lakh tonnes are met through imports which are dominated by secondary and waste material products of inferior quality. Acharya said that its imperative to put in place a quality control order to rein in the imports of such materials as they are potentially hazardous when used for food packaging."

Disappointing quarterly earnings, sluggish monsoon and a sharp 2 per cent rise in global crude oil prices also weighed on investor sentiment.

64,2019-07-25,JSW,"Mumbai and Kolkata: JSW Steel, India’s second-largest private steel manufacturer, plans to raise $500-700 million from overseas investors as the company aims to lower borrowing costs amid declining yields. The funds could be raised either through loans or through a bonds issue.

The steel producer is appointing five-eight investment bankers for advise on its borrowing plans expected in the next few weeks, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter. The proposed bonds may be of five-year maturity.

The funds raised will be used primarily for refinancing, a move that’s expected to extinguish some high-cost debt. Some of the money may be used for expansion.

JSW Steel declined to comment on the matter.

The company is preparing to raise up to $700 million by issuing dollar-denominated bonds in the international market, a source close to the developments told ET, asking not to be identified. “The proposal will be placed before the JSW Steel board for approval when it meets on July 26 to consider earnings,” the source added. Explaining the rationale behind the move the source said: ""Banks in India are not in a position to provide long-term finance to core sector industries. Hence companies like JSW Steel have to keep exploring ways to raise funds from overseas.”

In April, the company mopped up $500 million through a bond sale, which offered 5.95 per cent with five-year maturity. Those bonds now yield about 5.05 per cent in the secondary market.

“This sharp plunge in yields has prompted the company to tap the overseas market at a cheaper rate,” said one person. In case it proposes to raise the money through loans, the company will have to pay a spread or differential over the LIBOR. In case of a bond issue, it could be categorised as Regulation S, which bars US investors from subscribing to them.

Fitch and Moody’s Investors Service earlier rated the steelmaker’s bonds BB and Ba2, respectively, one notch below investment grade, with stable and positive outlook.

Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and HSBC are in talks with the company to be appointed as investment bankers for the fund raising. The banks could not be contacted immediately for comment.

JSW Steel is expanding capacity at its flagship Vijayanagar plant and investing almost Rs 1,000 crore to add tinplate capacity and launch JSW Platina.

JSW plans to incur capex to the tune of Rs 34,300 crore on capacity expansion in the next three years, ICICI Direct said in a report on May 28. “This is expected to increase JSW Steel’s leverage in the current scenario of trade conflict between the US and China,” it said.

The company is awaiting the bankruptcy court’s final approval for the acquisition of Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL). It has approached the apex bankruptcy court seeking immunity from future litigation in the wake of a series of fraud cases reported against BPSL by Punjab National Bank, Allahabad Bank and Punjab & Sind Bank.

JSW Steel shares fell 3.1 per cent to Rs 255.10 at the close on the BSE on Wednesday, after touching a 52-week low of Rs 247. The BSE metal index fell 2.5 per cent."

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs were Brigade Enterprises, FCS Software Solutions, Grand Foundry, Mandhana Industries and Power Grid Corporation of India.

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 62.40 points up at 11,333.70 while the BSE Sensex was trading 219.08 points up at 38,066.73.

68,2019-07-25,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended flat in Thursday's trading session amid high volatility triggered by expiry of July futures and options contracts. 

The markets fluctuated between gains and losses throughout the day as Nifty witnessed its worst F&O series since October 2018. The benchmarks were dragged by PSU banks and metal shares while pharma and IT counters lent some support.

Analysts said that markets witnessed profit booking at higher levels and traders used 'sell on rise' strategy due to weak market sentiments. 

Analysts felt that concerns over an economic slowdown, weak corporate earnings, heavy foreign fund outflow and weak monsoon would continue to weigh on the domestic market in the coming days. 

Bajaj Finance was among the top losers in the Sensex pack slipping nearly 6 per cent on BSE as the company's record quarterly profits failed to cheer investors.

The company on Thursday said its consolidated net profit jumped 43 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to a record Rs 1,195 crore in June quarter. The NBFC had reported a profit of Rs 836 crore in the same quarter last year. The profit number came largely in line with ET Now poll estimate of Rs 1,200 crore. But, the provisions for the quarter surged 69 per cent YoY to Rs 551 crore from Rs 327 crore posted in same quarter last year. 

Investors are now keeping a close watch on Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Vedanta and JSW Steel, who are scheduled to announce their June quarter results tomorrow, for further cues. Analysts expect volatility to persist in the coming sessions, as the markets are expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings season.

On the global front, Asian shares closed with modest gains ahead of the European Central Bank meeting. Japan's Nikkei touched a near three-month high while Australian shares ended near a 12-year peak after its central bank chief stressed that interest rates could continue to fall. 

BSE Sensex closed 16.67 points, or 0.04 per cent, lower at 37,830.98. While NSE Nifty ended at 11,252.15, down 19.15 points or 0.17 per cent. 


Market at a glance 
In the 30-pack Sensex, 16 stocks ended in the green and 14 in the red with Tata Motors as the worst performer and Vedanta the best. Bajaj Finance, Tata Steel, YES Bank and RIL too joined Tata Motors on the losers list, slipping up to 5 per cent. 

Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank and Power Grid were among other Sensex stocks that advanced. 

The BSE Midcap index advanced 0.53 per cent outperforming benchmark Sensex while the BSE Smallcap index ended 0.09 per cent lower.

BSE Energy index recorded losses of 1.91 per cent followed by Oil & Gas and Metal index. BSE Healthcare and IT index were among the best performers. 

In terms of index contribution, TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank were the top support while RIL, Bajaj Finance, L&T and ITC were the top drag on Sensex."
69,2019-07-25,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel will not revise its bid for Bhushan Power and Steel, but has appealed to the court for ""complete protection"" from the outcome of the investigations that are on against the promoters of the company, chairman Sajjan Jindal said on Thursday. The stressed asset’s resolution process has taken ""unduly long"", he said.

""There is no plan to revise the bid whatsoever but what we do insist on is getting complete security from the outcome of the enquiries going on against the promoters,"" Jindal told reporters on the sidelines of the annual general meeting (AGM) of JSW Steel on Thursday.

Last week, ET had reported that JSW Steel has sought relief from the NCLT against any outcome of the fraud investigations. Company joint MD Seshagiri Rao said that the specific relief sought is that while looking into the reported frauds, BPSL's assets will not be accessed by any other authority or creditor through any intervention after it comes under JSW Steel.

A consistent drop in auto sales in the past few months as well as a general liquidity crunch in the wake of the NBFC crisis has led to a slowdown in the steel industry as well which has been exacerbated by high raw material costs and rising steel imports amid a global cooling of trade relations.

These recent headwinds have made many experts question whether the aggressive bids made for the stressed steel assets will still fetch the acquirers the expected returns.

""Steel industry is cyclical and decisions are not made on the basis of market conditions at a particular point in time. It’s a long term investment and so we don't get perturbed about what is happening in the market as we speak..."" said Jindal. In an earlier interaction with ET, Jindal had said that ArcelorMittal may have overpaid for Essar Steel."

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
71,2019-07-26,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Domestic benchmark indices started off on a cautious note on Friday, looking to extend their losing streak to the seventh consecutive session.

Global cues traded on a lackluster note with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.15 per cent and Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3 per cent. 

FII selling continued to keep market under pressure. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 126.65 crore on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 398.53 crore, data suggested. 

Markets would keep a close watch on stocks such as Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Vedanta and JSW Steel which will announce their June quarter results today. Maruti is seen reporting 32 per cent drop in profit. Vedanta may report a 10 per cent fall while JSW Steel a steep 57 per cent drop in the bottomline. Bajaj Auto may post a single-digit growth in net, consensus estimate suggests. 

At around 9:30 am, the 30-pack sensex traded on a negative note, down 117 points or 0.31 per cent at 37,714. Nifty lost 2.55 points or 0.023 per cent to trade at 11,250.

In the Nifty pack, 16 stocks gained and 34 stocks declined. Meanwhile, in the 30-pack Sensex, 11 stocks gained while 19 fell. 

M&M gained 1 per cent and was the top gainer. IndusInd, Axis Bank, SBI and Reliance Industries were other gainers.

Vedanta was the top loser, shedding 2 per cent on the back of of earnings uncertainty.

Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, ONGC, Maruti and Tata Motors were other losers.

BSE Midcap rose 0.08 per cent and BSE Smallcap lost 0.21 per cent.

On the sectoral front, barring utilities and bankex all other sectors lost. Oil & gas was the top loser, down 0.98 per cent.

Meanwhile, India Inc's deal activity in the first six months of this year encompassing both M&A and private equity transactions, stood at USD 32.1 billion, down 57 per cent over last year, a report said."
72,2019-07-26,JSW,"JSW Steel's net profit declined by more than half in the first quarter of the financial year hit by lower sales volume on account of softer public spending on infrastructure as well as weak demand from the automotive and consumer durables sectors. 

Consolidated net profit declined by 57% at Rs 1,008 crore as the company had to suffer losses on account of inventory pileup as sales fell in a quarter that was also marked by subdued steel prices. Last quarter too, the company had suffered a net profit decline of 48% due to high raw material costs. 

There was an increase in inventory by 300,000 tonnes during the quarter that led to widening of losses due to inventory pileup by 127% at Rs 1,053 crore. The inventory includes both finished goods as well as goods that are work-in-progress. Consolidated Ebitda fell by 27% at Rs 3,716 crore as sales volume declined by 3% at 3.66 million. 

Revenue from operations slipped by 3.44 % at Rs 19,812 crore even as the company tried to make up for loss in domestic demand by increasing focus on exports. Exports volume increased by 34% during the quarter. . 

However, the company does not have any plan to align its production to suit the weak sentiment of the economy. 

""We never align our production. We stick to our (production) guidance and going forward we will try to wind down the inventory,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint MD at JSW Steel told media at the company's earnings meet.

The weak results have also come on the back of a general lack of credit in the system that are affecting consumers' purchase decisions, especially bringing the automotive and white goods sector to a virtual halt. To be sure, auto makes for about 6% of the total steel demand in the country. 

""We are cautious on the automotive space due to the NBFC crisis as that may take time to wind up again but over the medium to long term that space is also good and will not change structurally,"" said Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel adding that he is optimistic about the infrastructure and solar space that will generate demand for the industry. 

Net debt to Ebitda stood at 2.72x. The company does not have deleveraging plans as it is undertaking an elaborate expansion plan to take its capacity to 24 million tonne by 2022."
73,2019-07-26,JSW,"Among midcaps, Deepak Nitrite in specialty chemicals and Aditya Birla Fashion in retail are favourites, says Siddharth Sedani, Head - Vice President - Equity & Portfolio Advisory, Anand Rathi. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What’s your take on Bajaj Auto numbers? It has been in line with expectations with a rub-off effect coming across two-wheelers. Auto experts say they are finding two-wheeler valuations incredibly attractive right now. Would you agree?Yes Bajaj Auto numbers were in line with expectations. I was expecting little more margins compared to what they have posted. However, having said that, we believe some kind of revival can be seen going forward because somewhere on the passenger vehicle front also, some of the commentary which has been coming where commodity prices are little getting capped. That is a good news for the entire auto pack and the demand for two-wheeler space can see a spurt before the festive season. I am a little positive on the two-wheeler space and passenger vehicle space with a three-six month perspective.


In auto, valuation is one factor and cycle is the second. It appears this particular slowdown cycle is deeper than what you have seen in the earlier cycle. Do you think investors will lose out patience if they do not see a pickup pretty soon?This has been the case always. If you go back in history, whenever the parliament elections have taken place, that year has been seen as the slump year for the auto space. With this, again confidence will be back with the investors but I do not think there is much to worry for the investors. if I talk about passenger vehicles or companies like Maruti where the numbers have been better than the expected although YoY we have seen de-growth. But we believe that one should stick to the quality plays. There value preposition is also available because we have seen a lot of correction. In this current market, one has to look at value preposition along with the franchise which they are owning.


How would you approach some of the sectors like pharma, IT? Is pharma a better space to be in?On a broader basis, we are not positive on pharma. We are very selective in pharma. In fact, most of the stocks has seen effect of pricing pressure in the domestic market as well as the international market, especially in the US. We are not that constructive on pharma although there is a thumb rule which says it is a safe harbour when market is in a shaky mood. But from the overall perspective, pharma has its own problems. 

Coming to good valuation picks from pharma, I would like to pick out Biocon, where the numbers were quite good. In fact, in terms of biologics also they have seen some kind of growth. So, if somebody wants to get into pharma, Biocon can be the only option with biosimilar growth coming up from US maybe with one-year perspective.


What about some midcap ideas? Yes, of course, there are some ideas in different pockets. In speciality chemicals, one of the idea is the Deepak Nitrite which we like. We know that the capacity which they have set up in November 2018 of acetone and phenol are at 90% capacity utilisation. The numbers can be good; revenue jump can be seen and margins also would be near to what they have posted last quarter around 23% odd. 

We are constructive over those kind of midcaps, select pockets like Deepak Nitrite. Add to this, Aditya Birla Fashion in the retail space. There also we are looking at a value preposition which is coming although last quarter was a little bit of a slump because of same-store growth not coming up for Pantaloons. But this quarter or coming quarters would be strong in terms of revenue. Aditya Birla Fashion is foraying into innerwear segment and the kind of strong franchise they have we believe Aditya Birla Fashion is also one of the good picks in the midcap segment. 


What is your perspective on Vedanta?We are not that constructive over Vedanta. In fact, in the same space, we find JSW Steel more interesting because of the capacity expansion which they have added to that realisations will be better on the steel space from JSW Steel. 

In Vedanta, there are lots of headwinds for the company. Of course, the cash flows because of this deal would be a bump-up for them, but there are a lot of headwinds in terms of their Tuticorin plant. In the steel segment, we are going with JSW Steel because of better realisations and capacity expansion.


Overall, will you be bullish on the metal pack?Broadly speaking, it will be very volatile on the back of the kind of trade wars we have seen between US and China although there is a pause in this entire exercise because of the G-20 Summit and the agreement but I do not think this will end up here. 

It will escalate later on. Broadly speaking, the metals pack will be definitely volatile, one has to keep that patience going because we know that it is cyclical in nature. So looking at the entire parameter, broad-based sector wise, we are very neutral to negative on the metals pack. But if I pick and choose a particular stock, then it would be only JSW Steel.


Let us talk about the Bajaj twins as well, what did you make of the earnings commentary? More than the actual numbers themselves which seem to be fairly consistent with the expectations, what did you make of the commentary from the management?I found the commentary quite positive because they are consistent in nature and on top of it, the stronger NBFC plays does not have much of a problem to worry although cost of borrowing has increased but the kind of franchise it has, the kind of distribution network it holds and the kind of smaller size loans which they give, are not a worry in these kind of companies, although I think that is more of an opportunity when the results come and provisioning increases the stock reacts. 

Today the stock has bounced back and has seen a good upside. So overall perspective is that these are the franchises which one can own with a long term perspective, one should not trade it out, one should keep it in the portfolio and keep riding the gains. These are the quality plays one should always have in their portfolios.


How would you look at the NBFC issue and especially when you look at some of the companies like Bajaj whose commentary has been decent versus some of the others who are pointing out that there could be a decent bit of disbursement slowdown, so how would you approach the sector?I would stay away from the NBFC space as of now. Selected plays are there as we discussed the last question is about Bajaj twins or something of HDFC Ltd. These kind of NBFCs look quite interesting to me because these are consistent performers and are beneficial in terms of flight to safety. The businesses which DHFL or other NBFCs plays in the housing finance space used to do, has been stopped more or less or has been shifting to the stronger players like HDFC. We are looking at these plays of course. The government is trying to support in terms of what we have seen in the provisions which they have given in the Budget but looking at some of the results, there is M&M Finance which has frontloaded the provisions for the entire year and the stock had been hammered. So on this basis, I would like to be very selective in NBFCs if I want to pick and choose I would like to go with HDFC Ltd with a target of Rs 2,500 and I would look more constructively towards the private banking space rather than NBFCs.


What is your view on some of the PSU earnings -- from BOB, PNB? There are expectations that BOB is on track and eventually will start to see a recovery post the merger; PNB also on the headline numbers seems to be in line with expectations. What was your takeaway from some of these numbers? If I compare these two companies. Bank of Baroda would be much better in terms of numbers are concerned. In fact, they are trying to raise some capital also between July and September. BOB after the merger looks quite interesting with a medium to long term perspective. 

PNB, again although headline numbers look a little bit inline but my confidence is still a little shaky. Unless and until I see some consistency in terms of quarter-after-quarter performance, I would not like to bank on these companies. 

In fact, if I want to go really with PSU bank space then the stock would be State Bank of India because SBI is also where the slippages are getting contained, growth has been looking good, operationally things are improving. In fact, some of the NCLT issues are also getting resolved. So State Bank of India, BOB rather than PNB."

77,2019-07-29,JSW,"By Swansy Afonso

Metal companies in India headed for the lowest close in more than two years after major producers reported weak quarterly earnings amid growing worries about a slowdown in demand in Asia’s third-biggest economy.
The S&P BSE Metal Index, moving toward the lowest close since December 2016, was among the worst performers on the Bombay Stock Exchange after JSW Steel Ltd. and Vedanta Ltd. plunged on Monday. Vedanta and JSW, the country’s second-biggest steelmaker, slumped by more than 5 per cent after both companies reported a sharp drop in profits on Friday.

India’s been struggling to revive consumer demand in everything from cars to bank loans and the economy remained sluggish in June, with the slowdown becoming more pervasive amid a slump in services and a plunge in exports, according to a cross section of eight high-frequency indicators compiled by Bloomberg News. Vedanta posted a 12 per cent decline in quarterly profit, while JSW Steel’s profit more than halved on lower prices and as sales declined on weaker domestic demand and lack of credit availability.


BloombergSlowdown is becoming more pervasive amid a slump in services and a plunge in exports. 

The slowdown in consumption and in the automobile sector amid issues such as elevated debt ”are keeping a temporary lid” on metal stocks, A.K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. JSW and Vedanta’s earnings are further weighing down the stocks, he said.

Vedanta pared some losses to trade 4.5 per cent lower at 156.50 rupees as of 12:50 p.m. in Mumbai, while JSW was down 3.4 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.7 per cent."
78,2019-07-29,JSW,"The realisations were lower by 8% year on year and quarter on quarter more or less. We could maintain the same NSR (net sales realisation) because of the change in product mix, says Seshagiri Rao, Joint MD, JSW Steel. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


It has been a tough quarter led primarily by the fall in steel prices. What were the average realisations?Average realisations year on year come down by 8%. The fall in prices in steel is in line with what is happening globally. In the first half of the calendar year, in the US, the steel prices fell by 30%. Similarly in China, Europe, it fell by 5% to 10%. So the fall in Indian prices are exactly in line with what is happening globally. The realisations were lower by 8% year on year and quarter on quarter more or less. We could maintain the same NSR (net sales realisation) because of the change in product mix.


You have noted that India has seen weak activity with auto as well as construction-infrastructure slowdown. Would Indian steel prices stay low for some time?Indian steel prices have already seen the bottom. That is what is happening globally because iron ore prices went up this year. 

Globally in the first half of the year, steel prices went up by 70% and for the quarter it went up by 38%, at a time when steel prices were falling. I do not expect the situation to continue. That is why we are seeing a lot of supply side adjustments. Some European companies announced production cuts. The same thing happened in the USA and even in China we have seen some production cuts. Once supply side adjustment starts happening, even though demand is slightly weak, we expect steel prices not to fall further.


China has ruled out blanket winter curbs this time around. Could this prove to be a headwind to steel prices?What is interesting as regards to China? Even though production went up close to 10% this year, their exports are not going up. The exports remained at the same level as that of last year or slightly lower. This clearly indicates that the domestic demand is quite strong within China, they are able to absorb even the incremental production that is happening over last year. 

Despite the highest ever production by China in May 2019 -- 89 million ton -- exports have not increased. So the stimulus which the Chinese government has announced for infrastructure projects is keeping the demand remain within China. That is a comforting factor for the global steel industry.


Do you think the coming quarters should see steel demand in India pick up and your own volumes pick up as well?We have given the guidance of 16.95 million ton production in this year and we are exactly on track. As regards to volume of sales, we were supposed to do four million ton in Q1, whereas we have done 3.75 million ton. So, there is a 250,000 ton shortfall. We are confident that we will be able to make it up in the following quarters. This confidence is stemming from the fact that last year also the entire steel demand was driven by government expenditure which slowed down in the first half of this year. 

Now with a stable government in place, a new budget approved, a lot of money should come into the infrastructure sector that would bring back the steel demand. At the same time, the credit availability to the industry should get revived. 

Both these factors caused the weakness in steel demand to get corrected and the demand pick up in the second half of this financial year. 


How are iron ore prices trending this quarter and what is the percentage that has been catered to via your captive mines?Iron ore prices in India also went up by 10% while global iron ore prices also went up. We have a total of six mines secured in the category C mines auction. Out of that, four mines became operational and our plan this year is to get around 4.5 to 5 million tonne from our captive sources to meet our requirement in Karnataka. 

That will reduce our cost and enable us to source capital. We are also participating in more auctions which happened in Karnataka very recently. In that, we could get three mines and those also become operational next year. With that our captive sources of iron ore will go up by almost 35% at the current allowed capacity.


How has JSW Steel managed to stay insulated from all the allegations of fraud at the newly acquired Bhushan Power?We are a successful bidder. Our evaluation plan has been submitted to NCLT for approval. In the meantime, whatever news items that is coming about the developments in Bhushan Power & Steel, we approached the NCLT for specific immunity from any other issues that may come up because of these developments. We are eagerly waiting for that. Once the judgement comes in the way we are expecting, we will go ahead.


You have also resolved to turn around Monnet Ispat in two years. What is the plan there?Yes, we will be able to do in two years. Two years will be over in next year September. By that time, we will be able to operate this unit on an integrated basis and complete the project. We would be able to operate from September 2020 at its full capacity.


The board has approved about $1 billion in fund raising. Will that be used towards the ongoing brownfield expansion?Yes. we have a large capex programme. If, at all, we decide to go ahead with the raising of funding either in India or overseas, that will be used for our capex programme.


Steel makers are against expanding the ambit of FTA countries. What are your concerns?India has earlier signed FTA with almost 12 countries. But the experience in the last eight to nine years is that these FTA countries, have got many advantages relative to India. We are not able to increase our exports to those countries but at the same time our trade deficit has widened with those countries. We have not got any benefit at all. 

If I look at Q1 which just completed, the FTA countries have dumped steel into India at zero percent duty which constitute 66% of the total imports. If we sign an FTA with China, which is in fact becoming surplus steel producer and they start putting steel at zero percent duty into India, it can hugely damage the Indian steel industry. That is why we are requesting not to sign RCP, RCEP and even if it is signed, to exclude steel as otherwise we will face similar problems as we are facing today with the FTA countries including Japan and Korea."

Market sentiment remained negative as concerns over liquidity squeeze, outflow of foreign funds, uninspiring earnings and deteriorating macro persisted. The recent news flows have aggravated the pessimism. ""The recent news flow related to Indiabulls Housing Finance and the founder of Cafe Coffee Day VG Siddhartha have added to the negative perception about the business environment,"" said Rusmik Oza, Senior VP & Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities. 


We walk you through the key highlights of Tuesday's session:

Investors lose Rs 3.09 crore in 2 days!
In last two sessions, cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,40,73,089.85 crore from Rs 1,43,82,243.21 crore last Friday, making investors poorer by Rs 3.09 lakh crore. On Tuesday alone, investors lost Rs 1.72 lakh crore.

79,2019-07-30,JSW,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 17 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

ICICIdirect has maintained hold rating on Bharti Infratel with a target price of Rs 275. The key risk for Infratel is on tenancy growth concerns, pricing and possibly in worst case, Vodafone Idea’s survival (it is an anchor tenant), said ICICIdirect. There will also be share price overhang as none of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Group or Vodafone-Idea, will be subject to a lock-in on their shareholdings postmerger, said ICICIdirect. Shares of Bharti Infratel ended down 5.2 per cent at Rs 256.3 on Monday.


Edelweiss has maintained ‘buy’ on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 585. Earnings in Q1 reaffirm conviction that ICICI Bank is expecting sustainable, prudent and profitable growth, said Edelweiss. Over the past decade, ICICI was caught on the wrong side of the cycle, it said. Now, its focused approach and structural changes underpin a sustainable franchise, said Edelweiss. Earnings consistency too instils confidence. Shares of ICICI Bank ended up 3.3 per cent at Rs 429.3 on Monday.


IDFC Securities has a neutral rating on Vedanta with a target price of Rs 201. The brokerage expects Vedanta to record EBITDA CAGR of 15 per cent in FY19-21 driven by volume growth in zinc, and oil and gas, and lower cost of production of aluminium. The unwinding of Vedanta’s structured deal with Volcan removes one layer of overhang on the share price, said IDFC Secs. Any move by the parent in deleveraging its balance sheet by monetising assets will remove overhang on Vedanta's share price. Shares of Vedanta ended down 5.1 per cent at Rs 155.70 on Monday.

Citigroup has maintained buy rating on Persistent Systems and lowered target price to Rs 540. Persistent’s revenue growth trajectory continues to disappoint versus peers. The brokerage expects investor sentiment to remain weak unless Persistent delivers growth in digital business and improve margins going forward. Shares of Persistent Systems ended down 5.3 per cent at Rs 534.9 on Monday.

CLSA has retained sell rating on JSW Steel and revised down target price to Rs 200 from Rs 225. JSW’s margin outlook remains weak and we expect a sharp 39 per cent fall in its EPS over FY19-21, said CLSA. Its capex intensity has also risen in a weakening steel cycle and the potential acquisition of Bhushan Power could stretch its balance sheet further, the brokerage said. Shares of JSW Steel ended down 3.2 per cent at Rs 241.55 on Monday."
81,2019-07-30,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel wants to consolidate the working capital-strapped downstream or value-added steel products industry in the country through its bids for assets like Asian Colour Coated Ispat and Vardhman Industries, a senior JSW official told ET.

Apart from showing keen interest in large steel companies like Bhushan Power and Steel and Monnet Ispat, the company has also kept an eye out for small assets that add value to primary steel products and earn at least 30% more in terms of margins against primary steel products like hot rolled coil.

""Most of the downstream (value-added) steel companies in India and internationally are facing a working capital crunch. While this is one market where demand is growing in double digits, from the supply side the sector is not growing. That is an area where we feel, because of our market penetration and by our ability to acquire assets, we will be able to consolidate much better,"" Jayant Acharya, director of commercial and marketing at JSW Steel, told ET on the sidelines of the company's earnings conference on Friday, adding that competition in that area is also moderate vis-a-vis other product areas.

Last month, its Rs 1,525 crore offer for stressed Asian Colour Coated Ispat received the lenders' nod and is awaiting the final approval from the NCLT. The company has a total of 1 million tonne of galvanised and colour-coated capacities in two locations in Maharashtra and Haryana, and will be a good fit for JSW Steel that is nearly tripling its colour-coated steel capacity to 2 million tonnes per annum over a year and a half. Acharya said demand for colour-coated steel is growing at about 16% per annum.

JSW Steel has also bid for Vardhman Industries that makes galvanised products. JSW Steel is the preferred bidder for the asset and has offered a total of Rs 63.50 crore to acquire it but the acquisition according to the company's terms is awaiting the nod of the Supreme Court.

On account of its own capacities, value-added and special products made for 53% of the company's total sales volumes in 2018. For Tata Steel too, beefing up value-added capacities is an important plank of its strategy. Both its acquisitions of Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin's steel business will help the company widen its offerings in the special products space."

85,2019-07-31,JSW,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."
86,2019-07-31,JSW,"KOLKATA: JSW Steel Limited has been declared as the Preferred Bidder for three iron ore mines with an estimated resource of around 92.97 million metric tonnes (MMT) in the auctions held by the government of Karnataka in July 2019.

87,2019-07-31,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Underpinned by gains in bank, metal and auto shares, equity indices Sensex and Nifty settled in the green on Wednesday, snapping the losing run of last two sessions. 

Analysts attributed the gains to the short covering in the recently beaten-down stocks amid hopes of a rate cut by the US Fed, as there was no explicit fresh positive trigger at home.

“The market reversed after testing the psychological level of 11,000 mark supported by short covering in bank and auto stocks after recent fall and prospects of a dovish Fed policy. However, investor appetite for midcaps and smallcaps is yet to grow even after a long consolidation,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 

The market breadth remained tilted towards negative as 1,355 stocks declined on BSE against 1,137 that logged gains. 

Sensex closed 84 points, or 0.22 per cent higher at 37,481 while NSE’s Nifty closed at 11,118, up 33 points or 0.29 per cent.

8,2019-08-03,JSW,"MUMBAI: A harassment tool or a better performance enabler? Indian companies are mostly anxious about recent changes in Companies Act making compliance with corporate social responsibility (CSR) norms more stringent. Some see more positive than negative.

CSR norms violations now may attract fines ranging between Rs 50,000 and Rs 25 lakh, and even imprisonment of up to three years for defaulting executives after Parliament amended the Companies Act, 2013, on Wednesday.

“The nature of the amendment is like penalising tax evaders but it may become tools in the hands of authorities who may use it to exert pressure on companies,” said a top executive of a prominent manufacturing company, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

“In the current scenario, there is a lot that is spooking businesses — people are reluctant to sit on boards as directors anymore due to increased scrutiny,” the executive said.

CSR rules mandate that every company with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, or turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or a net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, during any financial year has to constitute a CSR committee and has to spend 2% of the average net profit over the last three financial years on CSR activities.




Smaller Cos may Face Constraints
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Wednesday that the amendments seek to check the practice of companies “getting away” by providing an explanation on why they were unable to fulfil CSR norms.

Legal practitioners, however, believe that such clauses are harsh and can be misused. “Imprisonment for violation of CSR requirements is arguably too harsh. Penalties are more appropriate for such violations,” said Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S&R Associates.

But the new provisions may lead to better adherence by company executives. “Companies will have to proactively ensure compliance with CSR requirements and now boards will have to pay more attention to the deployment of CSR funds,” Mahapatra added.

Industry observers say most large-cap companies have adhered to the prescribed minimum in their spending and some companies spend more than what is required of them. Smaller companies, however, may have human resources constraint.

Seshagiri Rao, joint MD at JSW Steel, said that there should have been some relaxation for MSMEs that often lack an organised CSR unit to carry out the mandate, and that third parties or NGOs hired for this purpose by smaller companies may not properly fulfil the CSR mandate.

After the amendment, companies are allowed to transfer the money they fail to spend in a year to an “unspent CSR account” from which they can draw within next three years to spend on CSR activities. If a company is still unable to spend the amount within that period it can transfer it to a government fund specified in schedule 7 of the Companies Act, such as the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund, failing which the fines and imprisonment clauses will kick in.

“By and large the amendment is an enabling one, at least for CSR activities…it is being made to appear draconian but it is actually not,” said, Neelima Khaitan, CSR head at Vedanta. Through the amendment, the government has actually given companies time to spend any unspent money judiciously, instead of rushing to spend it in one financial year, she said."

10,2019-08-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The massive selloff in the stock market has eroded Rs 15,00,000 crore worth of investor wealth in last 30 days.

While broader market has been in pain for the entire first half of Calendar 2019, a selling spree by foreign investors post the July 5 Budget and earnings disappointment have ensured that largecaps no longer remain safe bets.

At Monday’s low of 36,443, BSE Sensex was mere 374 points away from erasing entire this year’s gains. The 30-pack index had closed at 36,068 on December 31. BSE’s total market capitalisation has fallen 10 per cent to Rs 138 lakh crore from Rs 153.58 lakh crore on July 5. Sensex has fallen 8 per cent during the same period. 

Reliance Industries, the second most valued stock on Dalal Street, dropped over 3 per cent on Monday after foreign brokerage Credit Suisse cut its rating by 26 per cent.

Recently, foreign brokerage UBS cut Maruti Suzuki India rating to ‘sell’ from ‘buy’ while CLSA cut M&M’s rating to ‘sell’. Tata Motors, UPL, IOCL, Axis Bank, Vedanta and Tech Mahindra are a few companies, which have missed profit estimates, triggering cut in price targets for these stocks.

A few of the large cap firms such as YES Bank and Tata Motors have even seen their ratings cut by rating agencies. Analysts said earnings have failed to cheer the market so far. With the government’s income-tax surcharge proposed on high income groups, falling rupee that hit 70-mark on Monday and global trade tensions at new high, India has started becoming an unattractive destination for FPIs. This has led to an outflow of Rs 15,000-odd crore of FPI money since the Budget. FPIs are known for their investment in Sensex and Nifty stocks. 

Shares of Indiabulls Housing have plunged 36 per cent in last one month. Tata Group stocks Tata Motors (22.67 per cent), Titan (19 per cent) and Tata Steel (18 per cent) have plunged up to 23 per cent. SBI has tanked 20 per cent. Coal India, JSW Steel, ONGC, and Vedanta have fallen between 14-18 per cent.

“There were no big bang reforms, or any major stimulus, in the Union Budget. On the contrary, an increase in income-tax surcharge and the proposal to raise public shareholding dampened investor sentiment and led to a sharp correction post Budget,” Kotak Securities said in a note.

Consensus Nifty EPS estimates have been seeing repeated cuts, with the momentum of downgrades spreading across stocks. Earnings of Nifty companies so far (two-thirds of the index weight) indicated Q1FY20 EPS growth of only 5 per cent YoY, Emkay Global said in a note.

“This contrasts with a steep 20-30 per cent growth rate built into consensus expectations for FY20/FY21. Despite the recent correction, we see Nifty valuations (17.5 times one-year forward) not factoring in further earnings risks,” the brokerage said."

13,2019-08-06,JSW,"Kolkata: Top metal majors like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Vedanta, SAIL, JSPL touched 52-week lows on Monday, when the Sensex fell 418 points. The scrips continued their downward slide due to low demand and fall in prices, which has taken the sheen off metal companies. Nearly a dozen-odd metal scrips, out of 15 stocks in the Nifty Metals Index, hit their respective 52-week lows in trade on Monday.

The stocks were also reacting to the US President Donald Trump’s declaration that the country would impose a 10 per cent tariff on $300 billion in Chinese imports which ended a month-long trade truce and China’s vow on Friday to fight back. This has deepened fears that the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries will lead to a spike in commodity prices and thus affect the metals sector.

Commenting on the meltdown in metals space, Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “In the domestic metal sector, there was expectation of a big push in government spend on infrastructure. This has not come and it is one the factors impacting metal stocks, despite benefits like lower raw materials prices.”

“In the global market, there was hope that the US-China trade war would end soon but it seems to be extending. This too is impacting sentiments,” Nair added.

Steel firms, in particular, have reported drop in profitability as they grapple with the slowdown in auto sector and lack of credit availability. The seasonal impact is also in play since the monsoon is a lean period for construction and this affects steel demand.

Vedanta posted a 12 per cent decline in quarterly profit. JSW Steel’s profit more than halved on lower prices and as sales declined on weaker domestic demand and lack of credit availability. “Lower realisations have hit profitability and the volumes growth too has come down. Demand, particularly from auto sector, has weakened and this seems to be hitting the metal stocks hard,” a senior analyst in one of the leading financial services firm told ET."

India’s biggest aluminum producer Vedanta is prioritizing controlling costs as it embarks on expanding capacity, according to the chief executive officer.

“Any expansion plans, we will do it with the strictest capital discipline and balance sheet focus,” according to Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, who was the CEO of Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. for five years before taking the helm at Vedanta in 2018. “We will control the purse strings quite tightly.”

Vedanta plans to double alumina capacity at its refinery in the eastern state of Odisha to 4 million tons over the next 2.5 years and raise aluminum smelter production capability by 30% to 3 million tons “at an all-in cost of less than $1,500 a ton,” Venkatakrishnan said in an interview by phone.

“Every business has to earn its right to spend the capital before we spend the capital ,” he said. “Hence, we said let’s first drive the cost down before we actually go ahead with the expansion.”

Owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, Vedanta plans to spend 550 billion rupees ($7.8 billion) to boost output across its businesses as it seeks to tap into the demand created by India’s ambitions of upgrading its infrastructure. Capital expenditure for the aluminum unit is estimated at $100 million in the year ending March, Venkatakrishnan said.

The company has been able to bring aluminum production expenses from $2,200 a ton last year to about $1,764 largely due to lower alumina prices and higher coal supply security, he said. “We are targeting coal security of around 90% of our requirement from around 72% now and that would see our cost come down.”

Metal producers in India have taken a hit to their earnings as consumption in the South Asian nation slows and companies face mounting strain from a liquidity crisis. That’s been compounded by the impact of the bitter and protracted U.S.-China trade war on commodities globally. Vedanta reported a slump in profit in the April-June quarter, while net income more than halved at India’s second-biggest steel mill, JSW Steel Ltd.

“I see the current slowdown as an opportunity,” Venkatakrishnan said. “We will use this opportunity to pull the costs down even further, improve efficiencies and widen margins, so that when the prices start to rally, you can actually cream the extra benefit that comes in and apply a fat chunk of it for a larger purpose.”

The company produces not only aluminum, but also copper, zinc, iron ore, oil and gas, silver and steel. It directly contributed about 0.4% to India’s gross domestic product in fiscal 2017-18 through revenues from its operations, according to the Institute for Competitiveness."

25,2019-08-12,JSW,"Mumbai: An increasing number of deep pocket private equity funds are teaming up with smaller companies to bid for distressed assets in the Indian market.

The mounting debt pile and bad loans have seen a fire sale in the India Inc. where a lot of companies or assets are now up for sale, offering a huge opportunity for private equity funds to invest in the $210-billion stressed asset opportunity in India.

Recently, TPG Capital, one of the world’s biggest PE funds, teamed up with Delta Airlines to possibly bid for troubled Indian full-service airline Jet Airways. Before that, India’s government-backed infrastructure fund NIIF teamed up with Canadian fund Roadis to bid for Jet Airways, news reports said.



 Significant headway has been made with Indian corporates tying up with PE players either through joint ventures between corporates and PE players to set up distressed asset funds or via partnerships formed to bid for a specific opportunity jointly.

Piramal Enterprises and Bain Capital’s India Resurgence Fund teamed up with Dalmia Cement to bid for Binani Cement. ICICI Venture and Apollo Group’s JV Aion had backed JSW Steel when they bid and won Monnet Ispat’s business. Similarly, SSG Capital had backed Synergy Metals and Mines to bid for a few assets in the metals and mining sector, home grown PE fund True North had joined hands with Ramco Cement to bid for Binani Cement.

Over the last two years, as India’s bad loan problem came to the fore, PE players have raised an estimated $4.5 billion, according to an internal analysis by Edelweiss Securities.

“In order to bid for distressed assets with conviction, the need to partner with Indian corporates operating in the same space will definitely arise,” said Gopal Agarwal, co-head, Investment Banking, Edelweiss Securities.

“Therefore, the formidable combination of PE players armed with a war chest of funds raised globally at minimal borrowing costs coupled with the on-ground efficacy of the Indian corporates can potentially become a knight in shining armour for many distressed assets in the country,” Agarwal added.

Globally, in developed markets, investment in distressed assets is a big opportunity where global funds can buy into troubled, unhealthy companies and turn them around. They ride the growth wave back from the bottom and sell it at a premium, making profits. The hypothesis is that once the problem of debt is resolved and with some financial reengineering a business can be turned around.

“There are certain good assets that are possibly under stress due to high leverage. Once the debt problem is resolved, and fresh equity is infused into the company, the business has a possibility of a sharp turnaround,” said an India head of a global PE fund.

Global investors have also invested in traditional asset reconstruction companies to buy bad debt from banks. More than half a dozen ARCs have seen global investors rushing to invest more than $1.3 billion in the sector in the last three to four years.

ICICI Bank has a joint venture with Aion Capital, JM Financial ARC is backed by Valiant Capital, SBI ARC has a joint venture with Brookefield Capital, ARCIL, one of the oldest ARCs in the country, is backed by Singapore’s GIC, Ankar Capital and Africa’s FirstRand Group. IARC is backed by PE fund KKR and Sabre Capital, Pegasus ARC by DE Shaw and Deutsche Bank and Encore ARC by IFC and ADV Partners.

The government has very recently cleared seven amendments on insolvency law and proceedings, a highlight of which is the extension of the 270-day resolution deadline to 330 days. With the culmination of all these factors and the IBC framework becoming more robust along the way, the interest from PE players will only continue to increase, said fund managers.

PE funds are not alone. There are several global hedge funds trying to partner ARCs and put in competitive bids for the companies that have been dragged to the bankruptcy court by the lenders.

As per the industry estimates, global hedge funds managing more than $100 billion of assets globally such as David Kempner Capital, Deutsche Bank, King Street, Varde Partners and SSG Capital have rushed in to capitalise on the opportunity bankruptcy cases offer to acquire marquee companies reeling under a huge debt pile."
26,2019-08-12,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: The Nifty 50 companies have disclosed receiving a cumulative 741 complaints of sexual harassment in their annual reports for the fiscal year 2019. These are the highest number of cases reported annually since FY15, the year from when it became compulsory for companies to make such a disclosure.

Experts attribute this surge in complaints to an increase in awareness, the MeToo movement, impact of mandatory training and companies realising the reputational risk involved.

Analysis by the ET Intelligence Group revealed that the number of cases jumped 14 per cent on-year in FY19 as compared to 3 per cent in FY18. Complaints have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 15 per cent in the past five fiscal years.

IT and banking companies, the biggest employers of women, have traditionally been the top recipients of such complaints. At 142 reported cases, IT giant Wipro topped the list, followed by Infosys (105 ) and Tata Consultancy Services (87). According to a Wipro spokesperson, the number of harassment complaints in the company of 170,000 employees reflected increasing awareness as well as greater conviction in the organisation’s process to be able to address these concerns. The robustness of the system allows employees to share their concerns confidentially, assured of a fair and just hearing, and without fear of retribution. Each case has its own context, and is addressed with full due diligence, confidentiality, neutrality, sensitivity and after assuring the employee of a safe workplace, the spokesperson said.

Banks are the next set of companies to report double-digit complaints. ICICI Bank tops the list with 59 complaints, followed by Axis Bank (51), Kotak Mahindra Bank (27), State Bank of India (26) and HDFC Bank (25).

Five Nifty companies — Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance, Grasim Industries, JSW Steel and UltraTech — have reported receiving harassment complaints for the first time in the past five years.

JSW Group’s spokesperson clarified that “the single complaint reported was found as not an act of sexual harassment but other grievance by the company’s internal complaints committee and was disposed of as such”. “However, it reflects the confidence of our woman employees in JSW Group’s policies and practices to create a safe work environment as well as enabling them to speak-up,” he added. The company undertook several initiatives including deployment of e-learning modules and forum theatre techniques to maximise awareness and highlight various nuances of sexual harassment.



“The biggest thing has been the Me-Too movement that has led to general increase in awareness about sexual harassment,” said Vishal Kedia, founder of compliance advisory firm Complykaro Services. “Organisations that were hesitant earlier have shed their hesitation. Companies realise that there is a reputational risk attached to this and it is no longer something that can be ignored. Several instances of not handling cases properly have led to negative consequences for companies. As a result, the companies are getting skilled people on the board to undertake sensitisation programmes,” Kedia added. According to him, even small companies are now aware and willing to invest in sensitisation programmes.

Among manufacturing firms, Tata Steel reported the highest number of complaints at 20, followed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories at 16. “We have strengthened our prevention of sexual harassment training, by holding small group sessions for our woman employees with a strong focus concentrating on assuring them of non-retaliation and confidentiality regarding complaints, thereby encouraging women to speak up without fear,” said a Dr Reddy’s spokesperson, adding, “In addition to the online training module, we have conducted a series of floor walks and in-person classroom sessions.”

From 21 firms receiving no harassment complaints in FY15, the number has dropped to eight in FY19.

“There is an uptick in demand for year-round communication — with companies wanting to maintain a steady flow of communication,” said Bhumija Saxena, a partner at Integrity Matters, a firm that provides POSH [Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act] training modules to companies. “Men have become wary of working with woman colleagues — an aspect companies are finding difficult to tackle. Companies want the training modules to be gender-neutral and depicting a balanced approach that negates the extremes of not hiring women on one hand and harassing them in any sort on the other,” she added.

According to SC lawyer Nidhi Mathur, increased awareness, stringent regulations, mandatory training, elaborate investigation and zero tolerance policy followed by companies have led to increased complaints over the years. “Young girls have become more confident now to speak up.”"

32,2019-08-17,JSW,"Sample gift boxes and wicker baskets are stacked in a corner of the conference room of Candor Foods’ offices in an industrial cluster of Navi Mumbai. The weeks leading up to Diwali in October will be the company’s busiest, as demand for its products - dried fruits and nuts - soars.

In a 30,000-sq ft facility on the same premises, Candor Foods will process around 8,000 kg of almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, dates, etc, to meet that demand, up from a current average of 4,500 kg now. “We expect business this Diwali to be around the same as last year,” says chief executive Yash Gawdi. Bags of raw nuts, fresh off a truck, await their turn to be taken in. A young man puts a lid on a plastic jar of trail mix, seals it with a machine and repeats the process with speed and precision.

Candor also makes cereal bars and flavoured peanuts. Gawdi’s forecast for Diwali may come as a surprise to many in the backdrop of the steady drumbeat of reports about a slowing economy and job losses. Plummeting vehicle sales, a rise in unsold apartments and a troubled shadow banking sector have caused the likes of Bajaj’s Rahul Bajaj, L&T’s AM Naik and HDFC’s Deepak Parekh to speak out about the gravity of the economic crisis over the past few weeks. The Indian economy grew at 6.8% in 2018-19 — its lowest in five years.

Their concerns were backed by more troubling data recently when industrial output in 11 of the 23 manufacturing segments contracted in April-June 2019, compared with the same period last year. But there were also sectors that bucked the trend, such as food production, apparel and steel, which grew at a faster clip than in 2018.


Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)
This is a clear sign that the slowdown narrative is not uniform across the manufacturing spectrum. Manufacturing accounts for over 16% of the Indian economy and employs 13% of the country’s workforce. The pockets of growth in manufacturing may disappear if some of the struggling sectors, which are also big employers, do not recover in the next few months. Companies like Candor might start feeling the pinch and Gawdi knows it. “The repercussions of the slowdown are definitely going to be there in other sectors, too. Since food is a basic commodity, it will be hit last.”


Source: Central Statistics Office (CSO)
Candor, which supplies to the likes of Amazon, Grofers and Future Retail, reported revenues of over Rs 50 crore in 2018-19 and Gawdi’s target is Rs 100 crore this fiscal. What works in Candor’s favour, according to Gawdi, is that dried fruits and nuts are increasingly becoming a part of the monthly shopping list for consumers. Candor sells under its own label and also produces for retailers’ private labels. Manufacturing of food products saw an annual growth of around 15% in April-June 2019 in the index of industrial production (IIP). The growth in the corresponding period last year was 12%. Food processing contributes around 9% to India’s manufacturing output, as per government data.

Amit Kumat, CEO of Indore-based Prataap Snacks, which makes the Yellow Diamond brand of chips, says more expensive foods like Candor’s will feel the effects of a consumption slump before his company, most of whose products are priced at Rs 5. DK Joshi, chief economist at rating agency Crisil, concurs. “Our sense is that companies which produce small-ticket items have a better chance in this environment.” But biscuit-maker Britannia Industries’ managing director Varun Berry was recently quoted as saying that consumers are thinking twice before buying even Rs 5 packs. Britannia saw its annual volume growth in the first quarter of 2018-19 halve to 6%, compared with the year-ago period. Hindustan Unilever, too, saw its volume growth slip to 5% from 12%. But Joshi cautions against jumping to conclusions from the performance of a few companies.

Another sector that clocked a similar growth rate was apparel— it had contracted 5% in the first quarter of last fiscal. Apparel exports stood at around $4.2 billon, or Rs 29,000 crore, in April-June 2019 — a 7% rise in rupee terms and a 3% increase in dollar terms, though there was a dip in June, according to commerce ministry data. But India still has a long way to go, with its share of the global apparel market at just 4% in 2017, compared with China’s 35%, Bangladesh’s 6.5% and Vietnam’s 6%, as per the World Trade Organization.

“The government should encourage exports of readymade garments instead of raw cotton and yarn. That’s where Bangladesh and Vietnam have an advantage,” says Raja M Shanmugam, president of Tirupur Exporters Association. He adds that there is also a growing domestic market, which is five times bigger than the export market. “The fact that many global brands are coming to India is an indication. Also, now people wear different clothes through the day— fitness wear, formal wear, social wear and nightwear.” Moreover, the rising number of people shopping online could also spur demand for apparel since the segment accounts for around 30% of e-commerce transactions, second only to electronics, which comprise half the total, according to the commerce ministry. But the threat India faces from other countries in the export market could hurt it in the domestic market too, according to Vijay Kumar, a garment-maker in Tirupur. “Indian retailers are increasingly sourcing from countries like Bangladesh because it is cheaper.” The primary reason for that, he says, is Bangladesh’s wages are a third of what it is in India. When discretionary spends start to go down during a downturn, what could be affected before apparel are mobile phones and consumer durables, as these have much higher price tags and are often linked to financing by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which have been staring at a severe liquidity crunch. But smartphone sales continue to be strong. Indians bought around 37 million smartphones in April-June, a 10% rise from last year, according to IDC, a research firm. IDC expects growth to continue in the rest of 2019. But it is a mixed bag in consumer durables, which reported a 2% growth in manufacturing output in April-June over last year.

Air-conditioners and refrigerators saw their sales rise 20% and 15%, respectively, in the same period, thanks to an unusually hot summer, according to Kamal Nandi, president of the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association. AC sales had declined 5% and TV sales had risen 3% in the first quarter of 2018-19. India had a heat wave for 32 straight days this year, the longest since 1988, according to Skymet Weather Services.

Television sales, however, did not grow despite the Cricket World Cup. Various reasons are being ascribed to it, including the shift of discretionary spending from TVs to ACs and the attraction of mobile phones over TVs as the primary media consumption device for the young. Nandi, who is also the business head of Godrej Appliances, believes the overall sentiment in the economy might impact consumer purchase behaviour. “But with interest rates going down, EMIs will also reduce.” The Reserve Bank of India earlier this month cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time this year. The rate is now the lowest since 2010. While consumer-led sectors like apparel and consumer durables bet big on Diwali, there are some manufacturing segments like steel, which rely on government spending for growth. Steel output grew 14% annually in April-June, compared with a 2% growth in the same period in 2018.

Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings, says the government’s infrastructure creation and affordable housing programme could be driving the demand for steel. The government plans to spend Rs 100 trillion on infrastructure in the next five years and build nearly 20 million affordable homes in the next three years. “We are cautious about the automotive space… but optimistic about infrastructure, solar power and appliances,” Jayant Acharya, director, commercial and marketing, JSW Steel, told ET last month.

Passenger vehicle sales saw their worst annual decline in 19 years in July and India intends to more than triple its installed solar capacity to 100 GW by March 2022. Auto contributes less than a tenth of the steel consumption in India, with more than 60% coming from construction and infrastructure. The affordable housing push and the Smart Cities Mission will also drive demand for commodities such as copper and aluminium, notes Sabnavis. The output of basic metals rose 16% in April-June. Cement output, on the other hand, grew only 1.2%. Real estate, which consumes two-thirds of India’s cement production, is ailing, in part due to lack of funds in light of the NBFC crisis. Around 1.74 lakh apartments across seven cities are stalled due to lack of financing or litigation, as per Anarock Property Consultants. “The muted growth in cement could also be because of the double-digit growth in April-June 2018,” says Sabnavis.

Another sector heavily dependent on real estate is furniture, whose output saw a 10% decline in the first three months of this fiscal. But the manufacture of wood, which is also used in packing and construction, saw an 18% jump. It could also have been helped by an 8% rise in exports in that period.

Tobacco products’ output also grew by 6% in April-June compared with an 18% decline a year ago. It is hard to look for corroboration in cigarettes, since they account for just a tenth of total tobacco consumption, and two-thirds of tobacco industry is unorganised. “Therefore, IIP numbers in the tobacco segment are not necessarily representative of the cigarette sector trends,” says a spokesperson for ITC. Legal cigarette volumes have been declining at an annual rate of 4% since 2010-11, even as illicit cigarettes sales have grown 5%, according to ITC.

Unlike the sectors dependent on consumption demand or government spending, pharma is relatively immune to a slowdown. Having medicines prescribed to you for an illness is not a choice like buying a phone or a pair of jeans.

Siddhant Khandekar, an analyst with ICICI Securities, expects the sector to grow at around 10% in 2019-20 — the same rate as last fiscal. The output of pharma products rose 7% in April-June. In addition to domestic demand for medicines, the easing of the pricing pressure caused by increased competition in the US, which accounts for a third of India’s exports, could also help. There is no looking away from troubling signs about the economy. But for now, some sectors within manufacturing are still growing, a few even at a higher rate than last year. But if consumers decide to hold back their spending further, fearing worse days to come, it could make a bad situation much worse."

35,2019-08-19,JSW,"Corporate India announced merger and acquisition deals worth USD 4.3 billion in July, down by 52.74 per cent compared to the year-ago period amid a subdued global growth and rising geo-political tensions, a report said on Monday.

According to Grant Thornton's monthly M&A Dealtracker, as many as 39 deals worth USD 4.3 billion were reported in July against 49 transactions worth USD 9.1 billion in the year-ago period.

 ""Subdued global growth, the continued Brexit-related uncertainty and the rising geopolitical tensions roiling energy prices, affected the overall deal sentiment,"" the report noted. 

 The report noted that though M&A values declined more than half as compared to July 2018, the month recorded significant rise in the deal values as compared to the previous month (June 2019), demonstrating a revival in the deal sentiment among the deal makers. 

 ""M&A transactions continued to witness a lackluster deal activity on the back of failing to record big ticket deals witnessed during July 2018. In addition, headwinds seen in the financial services space and slowdown in the core sectors have affected the M&A deal space,"" said Pankaj Chopda, Director, Grant Thornton India LLP. 

 Chopda further noted that emphasis of the Budget on the liquidity concerns in the NBFC sector, and constant efforts of streamlining the IBC norm, among others, are likely to boost the M&A deal activity. 

 ""Though the Union Budget has laid down a roadmap for growing the economy in a sustained manner with a focus on both urban and rural sectors, the impact on deal activity will depend on the measures and policies by the government to counter the slowdown, implement/ promote growth-focused investment plans and impact of global economic trends,"" Chopda said. 

 The start-up sector not only led the pack for M&A both in terms of deal values and volumes, but also recorded the highest monthly values till date driven by Oyo Rooms' USD 2 billion stake acquisition. 

 Retail, fin-tech, and gaming segments also remained active during the month. 

 The report further noted that the month of July witnessed deals pushed by IBC in the pharma sector with Dhanuka Laboratories-Orchid Pharma's USD 162 million deal and others in the pipeline across the retail sector with Patanjali-Soya Ruchi deal, and the manufacturing sector with Asian Colour-JSW steel deal."
33,2019-08-19,JSW,"Bhubaneshwar: The Forest Advisory Committee has agreed to the transfer of a clearance granted earlier to steelmaker Posco for its Odisha steel project in favour of greenfield plant that JSW Steel plans to set up in the state, people aware of the development said.

JSW Steel had pitched to build a the 13.2MT plant at the site in Jagatsinghpur once allocated to Posco for its proposed steel project.

In 2017, South Korea’s Posco had abandoned the project.

The state government had agreed to hand over 2,968 ha of this land in Jagatsinghpur to JSW.

The persons cited earlier said on the condition of anonymity that the minutes of the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) meeting are yet to be uploaded on the ministry of environment and forest and climate change (MoEFCC) website.

An official of state’s industry department said the FAC meeting was to take up the matter on August 16, and that he believed the transfer has been cleared.

JSW Steel could not be contacted for a comment on the matter.

The controversial patch had tested the strength and scope of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 when Posco had set out to build its plant. Naveen Patnaik’s government had not settled community or individual forest rights that the Act required it to implement, on the presumption that the largely non-tribal locals could not make such claims and the land, sand dunes on which betel leaves were being cultivated, was government-owned.

Years of resistance eventually ended with the MoEFCC granting the project a 30-year clearance on May 4, 2011 on “grounds of cooperative federalism”.

However, Posco abandoned its plan—at $12 billion, it would have been India’s largest FDI then—when the Narendra Modi government changed laws mandating auctions of iron ore mines. Posco had waited for 10 years to get exploration rights to the Khandadhar iron ore deposit. The 2015 amendment, however, killed its hopes.

JSW, with an 18-million tonne annual capacity of steel, requires 23 million tonnes of iron ore for its plants. It is expected to be a keen participant in the upcoming auctions of mines in Odisha. The company is already preparing to lay a 30-million tonne slurry pipeline to carry iron ore from mines in Odisha’s Joda and Barbil districts in the north to its pellet plant in Jajpur, Brahmani River Pellets, acquired in December 2017. It has also invested in two berths at the Paradip Port.

https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif 

The transfer, possibly a first for a industrial project, is believed to have taken a cue from the transfer of clearances granted to the quashed coal blocks.

The FAC, a body under the MoEFCC that vets applications for forest diversion, had earlier insisted on a no-objection certificate from Posco. The NOC has been submitted, claimed senior government officials in the state ministry of industries.

JSW Utkal, the subsidiary the company has set up for its Odisha plans, will build a 13 MT plant in phases, a captive power plant and a jetty at the mouth of the Jatadhari river. Resistance for the project this time around is almost muted."
36,2019-08-20,JSW,"NEW DELHI: An appellate tribunal on Monday dismissed appeals by some creditors of steelmaker Monnet Ispat & Energy against a Rs 2,875-crore resolution plan offered by AION Investments and JSW Steel.

The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved the proposal last year. Operational creditors Bharat Heavy Electricals, GAIL India and Bharat PetroResources, and financial creditor IFCI had alleged discriminatory treatment under the resolution plan.

Under the AION-JSW Steel resolution plan, operational creditors are entitled to Rs 25 crore against their total admitted claims of about Rs 450 crore.

IFCI had claimed that the plan discriminated against it relative to other financial creditors. IFCI had claimed that it was entitled to an additional Rs 70 crore over the Rs 95 crore that it was paid under the resolution plan, through its exclusive rights over an asset of Monnet Ispat. IFCI had a total claim of Rs 559 crore against a principal amount of Rs 250 crore.

Financial creditors got just 24% of their loans to Monnet Ispat, against which creditors had total admitted claims of around Rs 11,400 crore. JSW Steel-AION were the sole bidders for Monnet Ispat, which manufactures various steel- and Iron-based products and has a production capacity of around 1.5 million tonnes a year.

This judgement comes after recent amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, passed by Parliament in the Monsoon session, which have clarified that a committee of creditors has the right to take commercial decisions on the distribution of the proceeds of a resolution plan."

40,2019-08-21,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Shares of state-run NMDC, India's largest iron ore miner, slumped nearly 12 per cent on Tuesday after the Karnataka government decided not to extend the lease for its mine in Donimalai.

The Street is concerned as NMDC may have to pay a hefty premium for the mining block in the auction, which the state government is now planning to conduct. Besides, withdrawal of the approval given earlier to extend the mining lease of Donimalai could set a precedent.

Donimalai has a capacity of 6 million tones per annum, which could add nearly 20 per cent to its production once fully operational.

While most analysts were not factoring in much contribution from this mine given the uncertainty over it, now they are worried that NMDC may also lose leases of other existing operational mines.

“We expect NMDC’s profitability to be impacted by potential loss of leases in Chhattisgarh that are coming up for renewal soon,” said Amit Dixit, metals analyst at Edelweiss. The miner may also have to pay a huge premium if it chooses to bid for the mining blocks.

JSW Steel, one of the largest steel producers in the country, has been aggressively looking for iron ore mines and analysts believe it will be participating in auctions for all of the NMDC mines to ensure a steady supply of iron ore. They say it may be difficult to outbid the private steel player. “While we expect the company to appeal against the decision, we believe the road ahead will not be easy,” added Dixit.

In addition to these uncertainties, operational performance of NMDC has also been hit due to a slump in demand. In the June quarter, its sales volumes declined 15 per cent quarteron-quarter to 8.7 million tonnes. Due to this, its sales dipped 10 per cent to Rs 3,264 crore while net profit was down 6 per cent to Rs 1,280 crore.

This is despite a sharp surge in iron ore prices. Global iron ore prices jumped nearly 40 per cent in the first four months of FY20. NMDC’s realisation per tonne for the quarter was higher by 3 per cent over the preceding quarter, thanks to price hike of Rs 200-250 per tonne in May.

The company’s cash is estimated at Rs 6,000 crore, 20 per cent of its market capitalisation. This also shows NMDC has sufficient cash and room for debt to bid for the mines, but that would mean a sharp reduction in the dividend to the shareholders.

Last year, the company gave a dividend of Rs 5.52 per share. At the current price, dividend yield is 6 per cent."
39,2019-08-21,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Harsh reality is beginning to tower above dwindling hope on D-Street. Earnings downgrades are becoming the norm every quarter, and circumspect ratings are no longer restricted to select financials or debt-heavy companies.

Bloomberg data showed that earnings per share (EPS) projections for the Nifty dived 4.2 per cent in the past three months, the cut ranking rather high among top global markets by value. Nifty’s 12-month rolling projected EPS dropped to Rs 654 on August 20, compared with Rs 678 at the end of June. Autos, metals and telecom stocks have led the downgrades in earnings estimates.



Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Indiabulls Housing, JSW Steel and Vedanta saw the biggest cuts in earnings expectations.

The pace of downgrades indicates that Indian equities are likely to report earnings slippage for the sixth year in a row, reflecting the impact of lower consumption, stagnant investments, and softness in global commodity prices on the pace of economic expansion.



Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) has reduced earnings growth estimates to 15 per cent, compared with 24 per cent at the beginning of FY20. According to KIE, deep structural reforms may be the only option to reverse the current economic slowdown and raise GDP growth rates. Similarly, CLSA has reduced estiamtes by 5 per cent and expects growth of 18 per cent for FY20. CLSA’s stock downgrades after the June results exceeds upgrades 3:1."
42,2019-08-22,JSW,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."

We walk you through the key highlights of Friday’s session:


63 Moons rallies
Shares of 63 Moons Technologies hit upper circuit limit after the Bombay High Court on Thursday ruled that the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) was not a financial establishment and, hence, the attachment of assets of its promoter (63 Moons Technologies), under the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act (MPID) Act was not valid. The scrip rallied 10 per cent to Rs 115.50 on BSE. 


YES Bank rebounds 5%
Shares of YES Bank climbed over 5 per cent on reports that the private sector lender was planning to raise additional $1.2 billion. In a clarification to BSE, YES Bank said the bank in its ordinary course of business continues to explore various means of raising capital/ funds through issuance of securities and this has been stated numerous times in recent weeks. The scrip settled the day at Rs 59.25 against the previous close of Rs 56.30.

Future Retail sheds 5%
Shares of Future Retail declined after the company informed the bourses that Amazon would acquire 49 per cent stake in a Future Retail promoter firm, Future Coupons, for an undisclosed amount. The promoter group of Future Group led by Kishore Biyani has entered into a share subscription agreement and a shareholders' agreement with Amazon.Com NV Investment Holdings (Amazon), the statement said.


Infosys hits fresh high
Before closing 0.75 per cent up at Rs 801.90, shares of IT major Infosys scaled fresh record high of Rs 809.95 during the day. Market experts said weakness in the rupee, which breached the 72-mark against dollar for the first time on Friday, aided the IT counters. The BSE IT index closed 0.94 per cent higher at 15,969. TCS, Mindtree and Mastek all rallied up to 3.57 per cent on Friday.

46,2019-08-27,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: The stock of Nestle India hit a record high on the speculation of being included in the Nifty 50 index in its next reshuffle. However, short-term investors may well book profit in the stock if such an inclusion stands confirmed.

This is because two out of every three companies that have made it to the Nifty in the past five years have posted negative returns in the year after inclusion. As many as 19 out of the 21 stocks underperformed after a year of inclusion against their performance a year before, indicating that the Nifty inclusion comes at the time of peak performance. It is also indicative that much of the positive sentiment surrounding the inclusion gets factored in well before the actual inclusion.

For instance, the Britannia stock was included in the Nifty in March this year. The stock is down 18 per cent since, whereas it had gained 20 per cent in the year before the inclusion. Similarly, JSW Steel, which got added in October 2018, is down 44 per cent till now. It had posted 52 per cent gains in the year preceding its inclusion.

Only two – Eicher Motors and Bajaj Finserv – of the 21 stocks that got included in the Nifty in the past five years performed better a year after their inclusion in the benchmark index. Trading at very high valuation of 71 times of its trailing four quarter earnings, the Nestle stock will be the most expensive FMCG stock in the index, if included.

Nestle India reported an exceptional performance in the latest quarter to June, posting 10.5 per cent growth in volume amid overall slowdown in demand.

Its return on net worth stands at 45 per cent and return on capital employed at 43 per cent. The company is relaunching its global malt-based drink Milo in India."

JSW Steel's EBITDA per tonne will decline by around 13% and remain lower than Tata Steel's Indian operations, largely because of elevated raw material prices and the company's relatively limited backward integration, the report said. 

""Nonetheless, the two Indian steel companies will benefit from rising steel production on the back of continued demand growth,"" it added.

Licenses to 59 iron ore mines currently under operation in India will expire by March 2020. While most of these licenses are expected to be renewed, if they are not, a resulting shortage in iron ore supply would lead to an increase in prices, the report said. ""Tata Steel's Indian operations are insulated from such iron ore supply disruptions because of its backward integration into iron ore production. However, JSW's captive sourcing will account for only 20%-25% of its iron ore requirements by December 2019 and therefore the company is more exposed to a rise in iron ore price,"" Moody's said.

India will remain the world's second-largest steel producer behind China after having overtaken Japan in 2018. New capacity additions in India will be limited over the next 12 months but domestic production will increase to meet demand growth. Consolidation in the Indian steel sector that began in 2018 will continue in 2019, with five stressed steel companies accounting for 20% of the country's steel-producing capacity operating under new ownership. 

""This will lead to an improvement in India's capacity utilization to 85% over the next two years from less than 78% in the 12 months to June 2019,"" Moody's pointed out. Slowing but still healthy domestic demand and limited capacity additions will help keep steel prices largely stable over the next 12-18 months, it added."

61,2019-08-30,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Tata Steel, Asia’s oldest maker of the infrastructure alloy, faces the danger of slipping into the red in the September quarter after nine straight quarters of profit, analysts said.

That means three out of India’s four largest steel producers could head into a loss in the quarter, the others being SAIL and Jindal Steel and Power. JSW Steel, too, could see a sharp dip in earnings but will be profitable, given its lower costs and interest outgo.

Total net debt of these top four steel companies alone is Rs 2.4 lakh crore, and losses for them could mean more trouble for lenders.

An unexpected fall in steel prices could dent the heavily leveraged steel players, analysts warn. Tata Steel’s debt exceeds Rs 1 lakh crore, and the move to offload debt in its European business has been shelved after talks with Thyssenkrupp were called off.

Average global steel prices are down €30 since June, which translates into Rs 2,370 per tonne. Tata Steel sold 2.3 million tonnes in Europe in the previous September quarter. Assuming similar volumes for the current September quarter, its operating profit before tax (EBITDA) would fall by Rs 550 crore.



In the Indian business, analysts expect EBITDA to fall by Rs 1,350 crore in the September quarter based on management guidance. This means its EBITDA from the two businesses together could be lower by Rs 1,900 crore. After deducting this number from the June quarter’s EBITDA of Rs 5,515 crore, EBIDTA for the September quarter can be estimated at Rs 3,615 crore. By contrast, its interest and depreciation costs are about Rs 3,900 crore.

JSW Steel sold 3.66 million tonnes last September. Prices are down by Rs 1,500 per tonne from the June quarter’s average prices. This would result in EBITDA fall of Rs 550 crore from the preceding June quarter. In the June quarter, its EBITDA was Rs 3,700 crore. Its interest and depreciation together were Rs 2,100 crore. JSW Steel’s net debt is Rs 47,000 crore.

Similarly, SAIL, which sold 3.5 million tonnes in the previous September quarter, would see a drop in EBITDA of Rs 525 crore. It logged EBITDA of Rs 1,590 crore in the June quarter, and its interest and depreciation for the quarter were Rs 1,660 crore. Other income of Rs 220 crore and no tax due to past losses resulted in a Rs 100-crore profit in the June quarter, but that would not be the case in the current quarter. SAIL has net debt of Rs 47,000 crore.

Jindal Steel and Power posted a loss of Rs 87 crore in June against a net profit of Rs 110 crore last year. Jindal Steel had net debt of Rs 38,000 crore.

Stocks of Tata Steel, SAIL, Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel are down 35 per cent, 44 per cent, 42 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively. The downtrend is likely to continue."

1,2019-09-03,JSW,"Anand Rathi has maintained 'buy' rating on JSW Steel with a price target of Rs 283.

JSW Steel (JSTL) has reported a de growth of 3.4% in its consolidated revenues at Rs 1,98,120 million in Q1-FY20 against Rs 2,05,190 million reported for same quarter last year. The decline was mainly driven by subdued domestic market demand and a weaker sentiment as reflected in slow automotive and consumer durables momentum leading to lower volumes and inventory buildup.

INVESTMENT RATIONALE
The company’s consolidated operating margins during the quarter stood 18.8% at Rs 31,160 million against 24.9% at Rs 51,050 million in Q1-FY19, a contraction of ~600 basis points. The decline in margins was due to lower realisation as well as lower volumes. The company’s standalone Ebitda per tonne for the quarter declined 21% to Rs 9,940 in Q1-FY20 against Rs 12,600 in the same quarter previous year. The company’s consolidated profit after tax (PAT) margins stood 4.8% at Rs million in Q1-FY120 against 10.2% at Rs 20,970 million in Q1 of FY19.

""We have incorporated latest numbers and revised our projections for the company. We continue to remain positive for long term on JSW Steel Limited and maintain a buy rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 283 per share,"" the brokerage said."
2,2019-09-03,JSW,"Mumbai: Ratings agency ICRA has revised its outlook on the long term rating for JSW Steel from Stable to Negative based on the fall in profits on the back of low steel prices as well as weakness in domestic demand, JSW Steel said in a stock exchange filing. 

The revision in outlook comes even as it reaffirms its AA long term rating and AI+ short term rating for the steel company's borrowings including bank debt, non convertible debentures and commercial papers. 

""The revision in the rating outlook takes into account the expected moderation in JSW Steel's profits and coverage indicators in FY2020 following weakness in domestic as well as international steel prices, and a moderation in domestic demand,"" JSW Steel said. 

The homegrown steel maker had suffered a 56% fall in net profit for the first quarter of this fiscal at Rs 1,028 crore on the back of lower sales due to weak demand as well as lower realisations due to subdued steel prices. 

Last month, Moody's revised its outlook on the Asian steel sector to negative. It said that profitability of rated Asian steel producers will decline further by around 15% in the 12 months to June 2020 with input costs soaring and spreads declining as a softening market demand is preventing producers to pass on the high cost to consumers."

4,2019-09-04,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel is planning to raise about $350 million (Rs 2,520 crore) from overseas loans, which should help it reduce borrowing costs as it navigates a profit margin squeeze due to a fall in steel prices and integrates recent acquisitions such as of Monnet Ispat.

The purpose of the proposed fundraising is refinancing its existing high-cost debt, which could bring down its overall borrowing costs, said two people familiar with the matter. A part of the proceeds would also be used for general business purposes.

JSW has proposed to raise five-to-seven-year loans, which may be priced after adding about 350 basis points to the London Interbank Offered Rate (six-month), the people told ET.

The benchmark gauge has dipped 50 basis points since May, with about $16-17 trillion debt securities yielding in negative globally. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.

The company has reached out to about half a dozen investment bankers including Citi, Standard Chartered, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank and MUFG, the people said. The banks could not be reached immediately for comment.

A JSW spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

The company finds it an opportunity to tap cheap global credit as it battles sector woes,” said a senior executive involved in the processes. Bankers are currently seen debating the success of fundraising, citing investor apathy for any steel sector company.

Last week, global ratings company Moody’s revised India’s steel sector outlook to negative, citing input cost pressure on the profitability of Asian steel producers.

“We expect steel producers' profitability, as measured by Ebitda per tonne, will decline by around 15% in the 12 months to June 2020,"" Moody’s said in a note. The prices of iron ore and coking coal, two key steelmaking inputs, have surged by more than 60% and 20%, respectively, in the year to June 2019, with weak demand too weighing on.

Back home, ICRA — the local arm of Moody’s — cut JSW Steel’s rating outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’.

JSW Steel is in the process of increasing its steelmaking and downstream capacities by 6 million tonnes per annum and 3.95 mtpa respectively by the end of FY2021.

Ongoing capital expenditure also includes various cost-saving projects, including setting up of pipe conveyors (already commissioned), a pellet plant, a captive power plant and a coke oven plant, which are likely to improve JSW Steel’s cost efficiencies further, ICRA said in a note.

Two months ago, JSW Steel announced a mega fundraising plan to garner about Rs 17,000 crore in debt securities, including up to $1 billion in fixed-rate bonds in the overseas markets, mainly to retire short-term loans and meet capital expenditure."
5,2019-09-05,JSW,"Promoters have raised their holdings in about 130 companies in August, seizing the opportunity provided by a sharp correction in stock prices to consolidate their stake.

These companies include both large and midcaps, such as United Spirits, JSW Steel, Vodafone Idea, Chola Financial, Deepak Nitrite, Sangam India, Atul, Motilal Oswal and Quess. Their promoters believe that the fundamentals of the companies may be overshadowed by temporary weak market sentiment, according to analysts.

The fall in valuations has encouraged promoters to buy shares, which in another way is giving assurance to investors about the long-term prospects of their companies, they said.

“It’s an important indicator for investors to track the promoters’ buy/sell data of the company during the current situation,” said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research & Advisory. “As an insider, promoters would know the underlying value of their business and hence they see longterm value in its stock price.”

The Sensex has declined more than 8 per cent since the July 5 announcement of the union budget, in which an additional surcharge was imposed on capital gain tax for the super-rich. The BSE midcap index has fallen 11 per cent and the small-cap index plunged nearly 14 per cent during this period.

The BSE mid-cap index has fallen 11 per cent while the small-cap index has plunged nearly 14 per cent during this period. Foreign portfolio investors have sold shares worth Rs 30,300 crore since July 5.



Shares of some of these companies where promoters increased their shares have fallen so badly that they have become attractive. Shares of JSW Steel are currently available 50 per cent cheaper from its 52 week high price while Vodafone Idea stock declined 84 per cent from its yearly high.

The fall in valuations and stock prices has encouraged promoters to buy shares of their own companies, which in some form giving assurance by the promoters to investors about their company long term outlook, analysts said.

Similarly Aditya Birla Holding companies, IGH Holdings and Pilani Investment and Industries has acquired 13.62 crore shares worth Rs 85.64 crroe of Vodafone Idea from the open market.

9,2019-09-05,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved JSW Steel’s Rs. 19,700 crore bid for debt-ridden Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL). “The resolution plan of JSW Steel is accepted. Objections raised by ex-directors-cum-promoters of the corporate debtor and the operational creditors are overruled,” ordered a two-member bench led by Justice MM Kumar. 

The NCLT approval brings JSW Steel a step closer to adding 3.5 million tonnes of BPSL’s steel production capacity to its operations. The bench on Thursday said the criminal proceedings against the erstwhile promoter of BPSL, Sanjay Singhal, would not impact the implementation of JSW Steel’s resolution proposal. 

The Serious Frauds Investigation Office had filed a case against Singhal and a number of bankers for their alleged role in siphoning off of funds from BPSL. Under the JSW Steel resolution plan, financial creditors will be able to recover Rs 19,350 crore, or 41% of their total admitted claims of Rs 47,158 crore. Operational creditors will get Rs 350 crore, or 47.7% of their admitted claims of Rs 734 crore. 

The bench imposed cost of Rs 1 lakh on promoters Sanjay and Aarti Singhal, to be paid personally. The Singhals had opposed the acceptance of the resolution plan on the grounds that it had not been shared with the previous management. 

The bench observed that the ex-management and promoters had made efforts to delay the conclusion of the insolvency proceedings. 

The judgement permitted creditors of BPSL to file applications for recovery of money, if any money that had been siphoned off or been extracted through tainted transactions is recovered in criminal proceedings. 



The bench also stated that all profits generated by BPSL during the corporate insolvency resolution process be distributed on a pro-rata basis to all creditors, in line with the judgement of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the insolvency case of Essar Steel. Tata Steel, which was also in the running to acquire BPSL, had appealed against the approval of JSW Steel’s proposal by the committee of creditors. 

The tribunal also rejected arguments by operational creditors that preferential payments were made to certain creditors, calling the process ""fair and transparent"".

The resolution professional for BPSL, Mahender Khandelwal told ET that the judgement was validation of the RP and appreciation of the process.

""Today the Hon'ble NCLT vide its judgement has found no merit in such claims raised by the operational creditors and has directed them to raise their issues in front of appropriate forums,"" said Khandelwal.

Tata Steel held that the committee had given JSW Steel too much time to revise its bid. The NCLAT, however, held that it was within its rights to negotiate with bidders. This judgement along with the completion of the insolvency proceedings of Essar Steel and Alok Industries will help restore investor confidence in the market, said RK Bansal, the chief executive of Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company that has an exposure of Rs 409 crore to BPSL. 

Big funds had recently become apprehensive when it came to investing, he added."

13,2019-09-07,JSW,"Other than Bajaj Finance, Kunal Bothra, Independent Market Analyst, is bullish on two high beta stocks -- Ujjivan and Adani Enterprises -- as top trading bets for next week. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What do you make of the week that has gone by, especially as we ended it on a high note?
What do you make of the week that has gone by, especially as we ended it on a high note?More than the Nifty recovery -- just a placid 100-150 points odd upmove from its weekly lows -- what was more important was the fact that a lot of the midcap stocks tried to make a good comeback. The market breadth improved remarkably, especially in the second half of this week. I believe that was a very positive sign,

The week had a lot of mixed patterns in terms of sectors as well because the traditional sectors or the defensives which were holding up pretty well like IT and FMCG. They were the ones which saw a bit of a correction in the second half of this week but what was more important and more of a pattern which was visible was that a lot of the high beta spaces saw demand coming back.

So, names or sectors like the auto stocks are managing to make a very strong comeback; the metal index is making a comeback, Bank Nifty overall is also trying to make a very good comeback. When you see such kind of a pattern where the defensives see a correction and then the market gets into more of a risk-on mode, we generally expect that there could be a new trend in the making. 

Overall, I believe we should be moving up higher on the indices, 11200 is where I would place the targets for the Nifty for the next one week.

What do you make of some of these metal names like Tata Steel, Vedanta and maybe Hindalco? Do you like anything in the metals pack?


What do you make of some of these metal names like Tata Steel, Vedanta and maybe Hindalco? Do you like anything in the metals pack?Tata Steel is one of the stocks which I like from the metals pack. Many of these other stocks like Vedanta, Jindal Steel are more of high beta, but Tata Steel is sturdy and strong in terms of the price trends. Look at the way the prices behaved in the last one to two weeks. Earlier, many of these metal stocks were more of whipping boy candidates. Whenever you saw the markets going down, breaking key support levels, metal stocks were amongst the first sectors which saw a sharp selling pressure. 

That is clearly seen by the performances of many of these individual stocks as well. But what has happened in the last one week is that not just these stocks have gone sideways but there have been divergent trends in the indicators as well. 

The RSIs (relative strength index) for a couple of these stocks like Tata Steel, JSW Steel has performed brilliantly. Many of these stocks are now showing signs of bullish RSI divergences. That is generally a precursor that the prices are nearing a short to medium term bottom. When you couple this up with the longer term chart patterns as well, there stands to be a very good case that many of these metal stocks could not just see a short-term rally. But this rally could be slightly multifold in terms of timeframe.

I believe that if risk-on is where the market gets into, then the metal stocks may not just see a staggered rally. They can in fact even see a V-shaped recovery. I believe many of these metal stocks pose a very good opportunity for trade, especially Tata Steel.


Any view on Reliance? It did particularly well over the last three or four weeks when there was this up-gap created post the Aramco announcement. When the stock opens with a 4-5% gap up, that gap generally acts as a strong support level. We have indicated earlier that if the stock rallies up post the gap and then tries to enter that gap zone, it acts as a strong demand zone for the stock price. What are your picks for the next week?

We have seen that happening for Reliance Industries. It has partially filled that gap and the support was closer to Rs 1175-1177 on spot levels. We have managed to partially fill that gap and now Reliance has managed to turn from those levels. It indicates that Rs 1170-odd mark is now a very strong support zone for Reliance and you could see the stock coming back into the thick of the price uptrend. 

In such a scenario, a buy on dips is a very good strategy because then your risk reward is absolutely favourable. At current levels of Rs 1,200-1,220, Reliance could be bought into. You can have an upside of almost Rs 80-90 from the current levels with a stop loss of almost Rs 30-35.


What are your picks for the next week?I am highlighting three stocks; first one is a buy on Bajaj Finance, that stock has confirmed a breakout of an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern. I would suggest a buy on Bajaj Finance for a target of Rs 3,500 and stop loss at Rs 3,300. 

The other two stocks are slightly high beta; the first one is a buy on Ujjivan. I believe that the stock is showing a very strong pattern on the daily charts. It is more of a double bottom pattern. The stock has already broken out above this double bottom pattern and the momentum seems to be continuing week after week. So Ujjivan is also a buy. I would expect another Rs 20 to be added to the stock price, Rs 330 as a target and a stop loss at Rs 298. 

The third one is a buy on Adani Enterprises, the stock has been more sideways but the momentum indicators have confirmed a breakout on the daily charts last week. I believe Adani Enterprises could be a strong buy at current levels with targets of Rs 144. Stop loss to be kept at Rs 133."
14,2019-09-09,JSW,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 23 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.


• ICICI Securities has maintained buy rating on RBL Bank and reduced target price to Rs 536 from Rs 725. Shares of RBL Bank have fallen more than 50 per cent in the last three months, mainly due to lingering concerns of asset quality and growth, said ICICI Securities. Given the bank’s top quality management team, no significant legacy issues, its relatively high risk-adjusted retail yields and relatively low market share of 0.6 per cent offering long-term growth potential, said ICICI Securities. The stock ended up 4.65 per cent at Rs 336.75 on Friday.


• CLSA has a buy rating on Larsen & Toubro with a target price of Rs 1,730. A deep dive into L&T’s lossmaking businesses reveals it wiped out 14 per cent of its FY19 consolidated PAT, said CLSA. While these businesses consume US$1.7 billion in capital, they depress RoE by 194 bps, said CLSA. The brokerage expects losses to decline on a turn in hydrocarbon and toll roads, a divestiture of roads, and a likely turn in nuke forgings. CLSA said L&T is a good proxy for domestic capex revival. The stock ended up 0.6 per cent at Rs 1,328.40 on Friday.


• Kotak Institutional Equities has an add rating on Sun Pharmaceutical Industries with a target price of Rs 460.Sun Pharma announced that SEBI has initiated a forensic audit into its financials for FY16-18, presumably linked to the whistleblower complaint, the brokerage said. The brokerage said it is in no position to speculate on the outcome of the audit, and while key concern on the use of the balance sheet for third-party loans in the past has now been addressed, the development again brings non-business related risks to the fore.The stock ended down 1.6 per cent at Rs 424.90 on Friday.

• Centrum Broking has maintained buy rating on Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, with a target price of Rs 3,000. The key asset of generic Nuvaring has received a major CRL, the average time for which could vary from 9-15 months, said Centrum. The review could get priority, depending on the filing status of other generics, said Centrum. The timeline shifts of the launch of key assets would make these opportunities dearer to competitors as time passes, said Centrum. However, management is confident on US market growth given the new launches and pending product pipeline, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 2.18 per cent at Rs 2,739.95 on Friday.

• Credit Suisse maintained outperform rating on JSW Steel and revised target price to Rs 288 from Rs 300 after the NCLT approved resolution plan by JSW Steel for Bhushan Power and Steel. While Bhushan Power’s profitability was similar to JSW’s before the resolution process, it will be much lower now under IBC, said Credit Suisse. However, the brokerage expects it to improve once JSW starts operating the plant. The stock ended up 0.79 per cent at Rs 217.95 on Friday."

18,2019-09-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: Secondary steel producers, which account for almost 60% of India’s steel industry, and mid and smallscale plants are cutting back on output to cope with a demand slump at home.

In the iron ore-rich district of Ballari in Karnataka, at least eight plants that include secondary steel makers like BMM Ispat, Rayen Steel, PGM Ferro Steel and companies such as Mukand and Kalyani Steels — primary suppliers to the auto sector — have scaled back production.

Subdued construction demand is also a trigger for such cutbacks.

Mukand's Hospet (Karnataka) facility has scaled back production by about 15-20% in the last three months. Inventories have increased substantially over normal levels, Mukand said.

Kalyani Steels has had to cut production by as much as 40% over the same period, said a company official on the condition of anonymity.

Many producers 
ET spoke with said more cuts could be in the offing if demand does not improve.

However, India's oldest steel maker Tata Steel expects demand to pick up in the festive season of the second half of the year and said it will not cut production anytime in the near future. Secondary steel makers that use scrap to produce sponge iron and pellets do not share the same optimism.

“Standalone plants producing sponge iron and pellets and with capacity less than 0.2 million tonnes have been badly affected,” said Deependra Kashiva, executive director at the Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association. “However, other plants like Tata Long Products (former Tata Sponge Iron) and Godawari Power and Ispat that produce more of value-added products can survive the slowdown.”

To be sure, sponge iron plants use the electric arc furnace (EAF) or induction furnace methods that make it easier to modify production, unlike the blast furnace route employed by big steel players like JSW Steel, Tata Steel, SAIL, Essar Steel.

The bigger companies are working on inventory management and newer export destinations to cope with fall in local demand.

“Domestic demand has to improve as export opportunities are also shrinking. The industry will not be able to wait for more than one more quarter before deciding to take production cuts,” said Ranjan Dhar, chief marketing officer at Essar Steel. Construction demand typically slows in the monsoon quarter, and this season has been among the rainiest, with at least nine states seeing repeated instances of flooding. According to an industry source, JCB, that produces earth moving equipment for construction, had sold close to 5,500 machines last year during the period between July and August, while this year it sold only 1,500 machines.

According to Tata Steel, the silver lining is that China is no longer disrupting global markets and is exporting only 5 million tonnes per month. With the scale, raw materials and latest plant and technology that Indian companies possess, they are “structurally in a stronger position”, it said.

“Stock prices reflect that Q2 will remain forever but that is not the case,” said Ritesh Shah, lead analyst for materials at Investec Securities.

“In Q2, there was a problem of contractors not getting working capital for state and central projects, which is why construction activity slowed down.”

Shah also said that as the anti-dumping duties kick in, imports will reduce and locally produced steel will replace the imported quantity."

22,2019-09-10,JSW,"MUMBAI: Naresh Goyal’s son Nivaan Goyal has founded a travel technology company, seeking a fresh path out of family’s troubles as his parents face government probes and their grounded airline Jet Airways awaits an investor.

The Goyal family scion, with his cousin Nikhil Raghavan, also a former executive at Jet, started Digital Blinc Technologies, according to documents filed with the Registrar of Companies under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The company is registered in Maharashtra and was formed in June with an initial share capital of Rs 10 lakh, the documents showed. They listed Goyal and Raghavan as the first directors.

Raghavan announced the formation of the company in a Facebook post in August.

“I’m glad to announce that I have co-founded a tech startup called ‘Blinc Technologies’. Our first product is a really exciting play in the B2C (business-to-customer) travel space and is set to go live in 2020,” he said on the social network.

The company website lists Raghavan, the former head of innovation and technology at Jet, as Blinc’s co-founder and president. It lists services including online ticketing solutions, a cab-ride sharing application, a loyalty platform for earning and burning points and a digital payment system.

Jet, India’s oldest private carrier, stopped operating on April 17 after running out of cash to stay afloat and failing to raise money. In June, India’s bankruptcy court admitted an insolvency plea from its biggest lender, State Bank of India, after the airline repeatedly defaulted on loan repayments. A resolution professional appointed by the court is now trying to find a new investor for the airline.

The Goyals face a probe by the Enforcement Directorate on possible violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act in Jet’s deal to sell more than half of its loyalty rewards programme, Jet Privilege, to Etihad Airways. The ED is probing the possibility of an offence under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act over alleged suspicious transactions in the airline’s books. It is also studying a tax evasion case of more than Rs 650 crore.

The ED is the finance ministry’s economic law enforcement agency. To be sure, Nivaan Goyal isn’t targeted in any of these probes.

Nivaan Goyal had, in the last few months of Jet’s operations, closely aided his father in trying to find a new investor for the company. Before that, he had been part of an internal business transformation team tasked with turning around the troubled airline. His close associates have said that in better days, he had broached the idea of travel technology in company meetings. He had proposed the technology would be owned and used by Jet. Those ideas didn’t come to fruition until now.

Jet’s grounding left about 18,000 employees and several top management executives in the lurch and many of them have found new roles.

Former finance chief Amit Agarwal has joined as CEO of JSW Steel Coated Products Ltd. The airline’s chief people officer Rahul Taneja has moved as group HR head at the Jindal Group.

Raj Sivakumar, former senior vice president for worldwide sales and distribution, has joined global business process management company WNS as senior VP and practice leader for the Americas. Belson Coutinho, senior VP for marketing, innovations and e-commerce at Jet, is now chief marketing officer at visa process outsourcing and technology company VFS Global. VFS also hired Praveen Iyer, Jet’s former senior VP, revenue management, as its chief operating officer, special projects, in Dubai.

Abhijit Dasgupta, VP of planning at Jet, has become head of network planning at IndiGo, the country’s biggest airline. Adam Voss, senior VP for engineering and maintenance at Jet, is CEO of South African Airways Technical."
23,2019-09-11,JSW,"KOLKATA: A sharp increase in steel imports from partner countries under Free Trade Agreements (FTA) last month has sent alarm bells ringing, with local mills approaching New Delhi to exclude the infrastructure alloy from the list of items to be favourably covered by a wider trade pact.

The increase comes at a time when overall steel imports showed a decline of 6.5% in July 2019. India now has FTA with 13 countries, but recent talks under the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) — a 16-country pact that would include China — has raised the likelihood of higher steel imports at zero duty.

Shipments at zero duty from FTA countries have shot up by 67% in April-July 2019, according to the latest available industry data, against a 58% increase in the same period last year (April-July 2018).

Imports climbed from 586,000 tonnes in April to 856,000 tonnes at the end of August. Of this, in August alone, FTA imports climbed 0.8% even as shipments from non-FTA countries attracting 7.5% duty have declined.

“The real threat appears to be imports at zero duty from FTA countries,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint MD, JSW Steel.

Steelmakers are getting increasingly apprehensive about the presence of China in the proposed RCEP. The platform includes 10 Asean member countries --Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos and Vietnam and their six FTA partners--- India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

Commerce minister Piyush Goyal has held sectorspecific meetings in light of the upcoming RCEP negotiations. Steelmakers have been demanding that steel products be kept out of the purview of the RCEP.

In particular, domestic steel players have raised concerns over significant reduction in customs duties under the proposed pact.

The steel sector, already reeling under the threat of imports, is anxious that a trade deal may lead to dumping of goods by China, with whom India had a $53-billion trade deficit in 2018-19.

The steel industry believes it will be further exposed to unfair competition since countries such as Japan and Korea already get the advantage of zero duty when they export to India under the FTA."
31,2019-09-11,JSW,"JSW Steel reported a 13% drop in crude steel production in August 2019 to 12.53 lakh tonnes (lt) down from a volume of 14.48 lt it had produced in August 2018. The production was lower due to a planned shutdown at Vijaynagar works and also due to the impact of monsoon at its Dolvi works, the company said in an official statement. The slide in crude steel production in August follows a 4% drop in July 2019 when it reported 13.17 lt production against a July 2018 output of 13.78 lt. 

The lower production reported by JSW Steel is part of a larger slowdown in the steel sector which us facing low demand and pressure kn prices. A part of the problem can also be attributed to seasonal factors as the monsoon period steel is usually associated with lean demand when construction activity is low.

This year a significant slowdown in auto sales has impacted large steel players and thus demand for flat products has been affected. 

JSW Steel, which is one of the country’s largest steel producers with 18 million tonne per annum capacity also reported a 13% drop in flat rolled products production to 8.51 lt in August 2019 against an output of 9.81 lt in August 2018. At the same time, long products saw a 5% decline in production to 2.91 lt in August 2019 compared to 3.05 lt in August 2018.In July 2019 the company had posted a flat products output if 9.08 lt diwn 8% compared to July 2018."

32,2019-09-12,JSW,"KOLKATA: Successful bidders of the current round of coal block auctions can use extracted coal at any of their plants including those at subsidiaries, provided the end-use plant is similar to the one specified during the auction. Earlier, operators were tied to the plant specified during the auction.

The Centre, however, has rejected prospective bidders’ request of selling coal to Coal India at notified prices for the non-regulated sector, which is almost 20% higher than notified. They asked for a higher price as this round of auction was for the non-regulated sector — for which Coal India charges higher.

Initially, the Centre had said that sale to Coal India will be at a discount of 15% on the notified price for sectors other than power utilities. Subsequently, they clarified that such a sale will be at a discount of 15% over the notified price for the power sector as well, offering Coal India over 20% margin for selling this coal in the open market. A block operator can sell up to 50% of their produce to Coal India in a year.

Utilisation of coal at any other plant by the bidder would, however, be subject to the ministry’s scrutiny and prior approval from the Centre. “The block operator needs to inform the government at least 30 working days before it starts to divert coal to any other plants,” a senior executive from a prospective company said.

Under the current round of auction, the government has offered to auction 27 blocks under three tranches — 8th, 9th and 10th — and successful bidders can sell 25% of the produce in the open market.



Three dozen companies, including Reliance Cement, UltraTech Cement, Balco, Ambuja Cements, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, Birla Corporation, ACC Cement and Vedanta are prospective bidders for the current round.

33,2019-09-12,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel chairman Sajjan Jindal said his company will approach a higher court to seek immunity against claims arising from alleged money-laundering frauds at Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL), a steelmaker in administration that Jindal has offered to buy for Rs 19,700 crore.

“We want a neat and clean company, and we don’t want any confusion,” Jindal told ET.

“We as a resolution applicant had offered this value under certain conditions. The NCLT order has modified the plan in ways that can have an impact on the viability of the plan,” Jindal said. “We will go for judicial intervention to make sure our conditions are approved.”

Jindal said the company will either seek clarifications from the NCLT or challenge the order in the appellate tribunal (NCLAT). The company will file an appeal before the end of next week.

There are two clauses in the NCLT September 5 order that have not gone down well with the steelmaker.

First, the court has refused to grant JSW Steel immunity from claims arising from money-laundering frauds reported by Punjab National Bank and Allahabad Bank in the last few months. A total of more than Rs 5,580 crore worth of loans taken by the company have been declared fraudulent by the two banks collectively.

The Delhi High Court’s April ruling held the money-laundering law above the bankruptcy law. So, JSW Steel is worried that the assets of the acquired company may get attached as “proceeds of crime”, which will affect its health after JSW Steel has taken it over. Second, profits generated by the company during the insolvency process that could have been used as working capital by JSW Steel have been ordered to be distributed among the financial creditors on a pro rata basis.

However, the order does say that criminal investigations going on against the ex-promoters will not come in the way of implementing the Rs 19,700-crore bid for the company. This refers to the case filed by the Serious Fraud Investigations Office (SFIO) against ex-promoter Neeraj Singhal and a number of bankers for their alleged role in siphoning off funds from BPSL. Jindal also remained unperturbed about the timing of the 3.5-million tonne company’s acquisition, even though he said he is disappointed it has taken so long and the time advantage of a good market has been lost.

“The steel business is cyclical in nature. We are not so time-sensitive,” Jindal said."
40,2019-09-13,JSW,"NEW DELHI: JSW Steel on Friday approached the NCLAT to seek protection from the ongoing investigation in money laundering cases against former promoters of Bhushan Power & Steel, for which it has emerged as the highest bidder under the insolvency process.

The Jindal group firm is seeking immunity as the Delhi High Court in a recent ruling said that money laundering laws prevails over the Insolvency and Banruptcy Code (IBC).

It has also challenged the NCLT's direction to redistribute profits earned by Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL) during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) - from July 2017 to August 2019 - among the financial creditors and operational creditors of the debt-ridden firm.

JSW Steel's petition is expected to be listed for hearing on Monday before a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) bench headed by Chairperson Jutsice S J Mukhopadhaya.

Earlier this week, the Delhi-based prinicipal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved Rs 19,700 crore bid of JSW Steel for debt-ridden BPSL.

Although, in its 138-page-long order, the NCLT has given it protection from the criminal cases filed against the promoters but was silent over the money laundering cases.

The Jindal group firm, in a regulatory filing, has also confirmed that it has appealed against the NCLT order passed on September 5 before appellate tribunal.

""We hereby inform you that on detailed examination of the terms and conditions of the NCLT Order approving the Resolution Plan, it has come to our notice that the approval contains certain modifications.

""Further, certain important reliefs sought by the Company have also not been granted. The Company has therefore appealed against the said Order dated September 5, 2019 before the relevant judicial forum,"" said JSW Steel.

According to the resolution plan approved by the NCLT, Rs 19,350 crore will be distributed among financial creditors to settle their Rs 47,158 crore of admitted claims. The remaining Rs 350 crore would be paid to operational creditor to settle less than half of their Rs 733.76 crore admitted claims.

Banks will get 41.03 per cent of their outstanding dues as compared to a liquidation value of between Rs 9,320 crore and Rs 9,707 crore, it said.

JSW Steel will make an infusion of Rs 7,200 crore in the company for improving operations of the company.

BPSL was dragged to insolvency by lenders led by PNB after the company failed to pay loans within the stipulated time-frame.

The NCLT said criminal proceedings against the former founders of Bhushan Power and Steel on the alleged siphoning off of funds would not impact JSW's takeover.

""The criminal proceedings initiated against the erstwhile members of the board of directors and others shall not effect the JSW - H1 (highest) Resolution Plan Applicant or the implementation of the resolution plan,"" it said.

It, however, did not grant JSW certain reliefs sought from statutory authorities under the Income Tax Act and the RBI, among others.

""We leave it open to the members of the Committee of Creditors to file appropriate applications if criminal proceedings result in the recovery of money which has been siphoned off or on account of tainted transactions or fabrication,"" the NCLT said on charges against former promoters.

38,2019-09-13,JSW,"JSW Steel has moved the appellate tribunal to challenge the NCLT's order that approved its Rs 19,700 crore acquisition of Bhushan Power and Steel but did not grant it relief from investigations going on against the company for money laundering, as well as ordered for the profits generated during the insolvency period to be distributed among financial creditors. 

""...we hereby inform you that on detailed examination of the terms and conditions of the NCLT Order approving the Resolution Plan, it has come to our notice that the approval contains certain modifications.

India’s most valuable steel producer is looking outward as the slowest economic expansion in six years cuts demand in the South Asian country and puts pressure on margins.

JSW Steel Ltd. expects to exceed its export target of 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons for the fiscal year “after having seen the slowdown in the domestic demand,” Joint Managing Director Seshagiri Rao said Thursday in an interview. That’s a reversal from April, when the Sajjan Jindal-led mill left its export target unchanged from a year earlier.

There has been a substantial increase in inventories, indicating falling demand in the last two months, Rao said in Mumbai. For the full year, growth will be slower than the earlier estimate of 6.5% to 7%, he said.

Demand for steel in India could grow at the slowest pace in three years as a crisis in the country’s shadow banking sector fueled a cash crunch and economic growth slowed to a six-year low. The S&P BSE Metal Index is the biggest loser among 19 sector indexes on the Bombay Stock Exchange and shares of JSW have slumped nearly 28% this year.

“What we are hearing is that a lot of companies, particularly sponge iron players, pellet players and lot of secondary players are either cutting down or moderating production. Only the big players are still continuing and trying to sell and reduce inventories,” Rao said. “If demand doesn’t recover in the second half, then primary producers” may have to review their production plans.

JSW will be able to meet its production target of 16.95 million tons for the current year despite a 13% slump in August and the company won’t scale back its capital expenditure plans. Additional risks are seen from rising tax-free imports from South Korea and Japan. The countries don’t tax imports of raw materials unlike India, making it difficult for Indian mills to compete, he said.

“Historically, the second half is much better in terms of volumes and profitability,” he said. “There will be an improvement in demand in the second half compared to the first half” on more government spending and the release of pending payments to industries."

JSW Steel Ltd., India’s most valuable steel producer, is predicting declines for iron ore next year as demand from biggest consumer China eases and supplies recover.

Prices may trade between $80 and $85 a ton for the rest of 2019 before sliding to $60 to $65 next year, Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the Mumbai-based mill, said. The key steel-making raw material has benefited from “speculation” and there is no reason why ore should be trading at elevated levels of about $95, he said.

“Gradually we are seeing some moderation” in steel production globally and “once the crude steel production comes down, including in China, then automatically the demand for raw material should come down,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Whatever disruptions we have seen in supplies are slowly, gradually normalizing.”




Iron ore has had a volatile year. It surged in the first half, triggered by supply disruptions in Brazil and Australia, and plunged in August as output recovered and global growth slowed. It is staging a revival this month, pushing back toward $100 a ton, on speculation that Chinese demand is holding up and there may be more mainland stimulus in the works.

Iron ore prices are moving in a completely different direction to other materials such as scrap, coking and thermal coal, and electrodes, which are declining and are more reflective of ebbing demand from the steel industry at present, Rao said.

JSW imported between 6 million and 8 million tons of iron ore in the year ended April, he said. That works out to about as much as two-thirds of India’s total iron ore imports, which jumped 47% to 12.8 million tons last year. Still, the mill may not import any ore this financial year as local supplies jump ahead of the expiry of merchant mining leases by March 31, Rao said.

“A lot of mines are expiring next year, so everybody wants to produce more and supplies are increasing. So, therefore, we are sourcing locally,” he said. “This financial year we have not planned imports of iron ore.”"

However, this was opposed by senior advocate Kapil Sibal representing JSW Steel and said the company was not going away from it but want some assurance from it.

According to him, investigations against BPSL is at ECIR stage (Enforcement Case Information Report) and they may file cases in future and the assets of BPSL could be attached by the ED.

However, the NCLAT asked the creditors to wait till October 14.

The plan, which was approved on September 5, JSW Steel is bound to pay the amount within 30 days.

51,2019-09-19,JSW,"MUMBAI:The inclusion of steel in India’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations that propose to extend free trade agreements to China will excessively harm the local steel industry by opening floodgates to Chinese imports from the largest steel producing nation.

Industry captains and experts have called on the government to “exercise caution” while finalising the multilateral trade agreement.

“Our plea is that even if RCEP negotiations are finalised, Indian steel industry which has suffered in the past even under the current FTA arrangements with 13 countries, should be excluded from its purview,” Seshagiri Rao, joint MD at JSW Steel, told ET.

The government is also reviewing the current India-Asean FTA that came into force in 2010.

“We sincerely hope the proposed review of India-Asean FTA would help in addressing the growing asymmetry in bilateral trade in goods between the two regions, ensure less violation of Rules of Origin (RoO) and enable better utilisation of the FTA by the Indian Industry,” said TV Narendran, MD at Tata Steel, adding that in the last 10 years, imports have grown faster than exports.

Exports in August grew 37% to 9.8 lakh tonnes since last year and have almost doubled since July, helping India to continue becoming a net exporter. It became a net exporter of steel last year for the first time in 14 years, a report said.

However, experts said the growth is on account of slowing domestic demand that grew only 1.7% in August against 6.4% in April this year and imports from other countries have dried up due to lack of demand in domestic user industries like auto as Japanese and Korean auto makers in India prefer to import from their home countries.

RCEP could increase the number of countries where India can export without duties. Some analysts said long term demand from India may be capped at around 150 million tonnes and in that case, regional peers could help with demand creation. Experts said there is little to gain for India as no other country generates as much demand as India.

Another factor is competitiveness. Cost of manufacturing steel in India is higher by at least $80 per tonne owing to high embedded costs like logistics and infrastructure, among others, which makes finished steel goods less competitive compared to Chinese goods.

“Even if the steel industry is included within the RCEP's purview, it should come with certain safeguard mechanisms, a flashpoint that could check which countries are exceeding safe limits that do not threaten the domestic industry,"" said Deependra Kashiva, executive director at Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association.

Analysts are divided on the issue. ""The fear of imports from China is relatively unfounded and, if witnessed, can be better addressed by staying within the RCEP framework vis-a-vis staying out,"" a report by ICICI Securities said.

However, Ritesh Shah, lead analyst for building materials at Investec Securities, said including China will be “inviting trouble.”"
52,2019-09-19,JSW,"NEW DELHI: There is a need to adopt durable and proven corrosion protection methods, like structure galvanisation, with large-scale infrastructure expansion projects happening in the country, said Dharmendra Pradhan, minister of Steel, Petroleum & natural Gas while inaugurating the 3rd International Galvanizing Conference in New Delhi on Thursday. 

The steel minister deliberated on how zinc will play an important role towards building infrastructure for the nation including projects like The Smart Cities Mission. 

Speaking on this occasion, Andrew Green, Executive Director, International Zinc Association (IZA) said that the fundamentals of zinc are good, looking at the deficit of zinc supply. “Infrastructure projects, fertilizer and railways will be key drivers of demand for zinc in India”, he said. 

Zinc is a $40 billion per year market and is the fourth-most used metal worldwide, behind iron, aluminium, and copper. The per capita consumption of zinc in India is far behind at 0.6 kg to the world average of 2 kg, according to Green. 

Annually, India loses around 3-4 per cent of GDP on account of corrosion losses, said Sunil Duggal, CEO, Hindustan Zinc. 

“Western countries, which are far ahead of us in terms of Infrastructure, have mandated the use of galvanized steel structures in bridges, highways, public utility, airports, metro stations, railways stations and are thus able to preserve long-lasting and robust structures. As we ready ourselves for the rapid urbanization and infrastructure boom, it is imperative to galvanize these structures and industries that will not only ensure a long-life but also the safety and security of the public using these structures daily,” he said. 

Galvanized sheet penetration in India is at 8 per cent with respect to total steel production, whereas it is 19 per cent in USA and Europe’s 18 percent. In India, the galvanized steel production is 7 per cent of total steel production (8 million tonne wrt 104 million tonne) whereas this figure for Japan was 11 per cent, USA 19 per cent, European Union 18 per cent and Korea 16 per cent, said IZA data. 

On the first day, the delegates were discussing India’s infrastructure landscape and how galvanised steel can play a major role in accelerating the growth especially in the smart city initiative. 

The second day of the programme will have a dedicated session on importance of galvanizing in automobiles, with speakers from auto companies, auto experts and Indian steel producers supplying to the automobile companies presenting their perspective. 

The conference also saw participation from Hindustan Zinc Ltd, JSW Steel, Essar Steel, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra, Honda, government bodies like Indian Railways, CPWD, DMRC, PGCIL, CRRI & companies like APL Apollo, Surya Roshni, RR Ispat, International Lead-Zinc Development Association and IIT Delhi, Mumbai."
53,2019-09-19,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel has released pledged shares worth Rs 1,150 crore that represent 2.01% of share capital of the company , the company said on Thursday.

In an interview with ET in June, chairman Sajjan Jindal had said that over the next six months, he planned to wind down the share of pledged holding that during the June quarter was almost half of promoters stake of 42% in the company.

JSW Steel is expanding capacities at both its major facilities in Vijayanagar as well as Dolvi. In this fiscal it will be spending Rs 15,000 crore on its expansion drive. It has recently also won the mandate of acquiring stressed Bhushan Power and Steel for which it is offering Rs 19,700 crore.

56,2019-09-20,JSW,"The Centre has agreed to increase an area cap for iron ore mines in the state of Odisha allowing Tata Steel to participate in upcoming auctions. 

In a letter to the state government on Saturday, a copy of which ET has seen, the Mines Ministry, has agreed to a six fold increase in area limit for mining grant allowed to an individual lessee. For iron ore this limit, of 10 sq km, has now been extended to 58 sq km in the state of Odisha, the country's largest iron ore producer.

The decision, pending since a year, will now allow Tata Steel to bid for upcoming deposits of iron ore and associated minerals such as manganese. 

Uncertainty over this issue had halted auctions of iron ore mines in Odisha where Tata Steel now has not one, but two integrated steel plants. The mineral sector is to make a huge transition in March of next year when 31 working mines (mostly in Odisha) come to the end of their lease terms wiping out 29 per cent of iron ore from the domestic market.

The letter dated 20th September points out that Odisha's total iron ore resources is to the tune of 7558 million (as per 2015 data), with the National Steel Policy 2017's target of 300 million tonne production for steel by 2030, there is greater focus on developing larger mining blocks. ""The state of Odisha is the highest iron ore producing state in the country, therefore it requires to boost up production for development of steel and allied industry,"" it says. 

The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act requires the Centre's approval for any grant of mining rights that leads to a lessee controlling more than the area cap - in Odisha's case 10 sq km. Rules for auction of mineral resources introduced by an amendment to the Act in 2015 however is silent on the subject.

Naveen Patnaik's government had first sought an increase to 75 sq km to accommodate Tata Steel which already holds mining rights to 49 sq km area. The latter's participation in past auctions had been challenged by rival steelmaker JSW Steel in the High Court of Delhi eventually forcing the Odisha government to withdraw the iron ore deposits in question.

The Centre which had agreed to increasing the cap in neighbouring Jharkhand to 75 sq km had refused to ntertain Odisha's request. The state government later sent a fresh request to the Centre seeking for area limit to be capped, not at 75 sq km, but 48 sq km instead – the total area of iron ore held by Steel Ministry’s PSU, Steel Authority of India."
61,2019-09-23,JSW,"NEW DELHI: JSW Steel on Monday demanded a 25 per cent safeguard duty on imports of steel to protect domestic players.

JSW Steel Joint Managing Director and Group Chief Financial Officer Seshagiri Rao said this while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an industry event here.

On domestic steel sector being impacted due to the ongoing trade war between the US and China, he said it is a matter of concern. Lot of diversion of steel products is happening into India, affecting domestic industry.

In August, import went up and a major part of it was from FTA countries. Most of the countries have taken protectionist measures and domestic steel industry has also been seeking safeguard duty, he said.

""A 25 per cent duty we are looking at on steel imports. It is very much essential..there are FTAs signed and majority of imports are coming from FTAs. Imposing safeguard duties is very much essential. All other countries have taken measures,"" Rao said.

According to official data, In 2018-19, finished steel exports stood at 6.36 MT, a decline of 33.87 per cent compared to the previous year. Imports stood at 7.83 MT, a growth of 4.7 per cent from last year. Thus, India was a net importer of total finished steel.

In August 2019, share of imports of finished steel from FTA countries such as Korea, Japan and Indonesia aggregated around 70 per cent of total imports to India.

He also said JSW Steel will take part in auctions of mines next year.

A number of mining leases for coal and iron ore is slated to expire in March next year.

Speaking to reporters at the same event, JSPL Chairman Naveen Jindal said his company, which at present buys iron ore from miners, will also participate in auctions in order to reduce dependence on open market for raw material."
57,2019-09-23,JSW,"MUMBAI: JSW Steel plans to launch a $500-million bond offering to global investors this week, according to people aware of the matter. The Sajjan Jindal-promoted steel maker finalised 11international banks over the weekend to manage the proposed issue, though it has yet to make the names of the book runners public, they said.

The proceeds from the proposed sale of bonds will be used to refinance some existing loans and also bolster the company’s reserve of funds for use towards general corporate purposes, said a person, who did not wish to be identified.

The selected banks are likely to include prominent US and European banks as well as some Japanese financiers who have loaned money to the company in the past.

“We do not want to comment on speculation,” a senior JSW Steel executive told ET in response to a query.

This would be the third such offering by the steel maker overseas, after it raised a similar sum of money two years ago and then followed it up with another successful issue in April this year. The two past issues took its tally of funds raised through overseas bond offerings to $1 billion.

JSW Steel, which is competing with Tata Steel to be the country’s top-ranked steel producer, has been adding capacities at its plant in Karnataka and is also scheduled to close its acquisition of Bhushan Power and Steel, for which it recently received an approval from the National Company Law Tribunal.

The company’s recent offering of $500 million bonds to investors was rated Ba2 or one notch below investment grade by ratings agency Moody’s.

The bonds offer a coupon of 5.95% to investors.

“India’s steel demand will remain the strongest in Asia but slow to mid-single-digit growth, as weak auto and manufacturing demand offsets demand growth in the infrastructure and construction industries,” Kaustubh Chaubal, vice president at Moody’s, said in a recent note to investors.

Moody’s revised its outlook on Asian steel producers to negative from stable on August 28 on the grounds that an increase in input costs was scheduled to adversely impact the profitability of the steel producers."

69,2019-09-24,JSW,"Kolkata: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Ba2 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by JSW Steel Limited (Ba2 positive). The rating outlook is positive. The proposed notes rank pari passu with JSW's existing senior unsecured notes and are therefore rated at the same level as these notes, and also at the same level as JSW's Ba2 corporate family rating (CFR).

""The Ba2 ratings reflect JSW's large scale and strong positions in its key operating markets, competitive conversion costs, good product and end-market diversification, and increasing focus on value-added products and retail markets,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's vice president said.

The ratings also incorporate JSW's exposure to the inherently cyclical steel industry, its relatively limited raw material integration, its large capital expenditure needs in India, and its loss-making international operations that will limit free cash flow generation over the next two years.

Moody's said it expects India's steel consumption to grow at 5 per cent over the next two years, supported by government infrastructure projects in the railway, road and metro sectors, even as auto and manufacturing demand stays soft. As a leading player with around 15 per cent market share (by production), JSW will benefit from the supportive business conditions.

""The proposed issuance represents JSW's second USD bond issuance this year and illustrates its proactive approach towards raising long-term finance before incurring capex. JSW also plans to issue INR debentures and raise foreign currency loans to diversify its funding sources,"" Chaubal, who is also Moody's lead analyst for JSW added."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits” for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India. The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list” of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries to smaller names including Manappuram Finance , Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.

“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,” he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.”



India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.

Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9 per cent while small cap names gained 7 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3 per cent in the last three sessions.

The gains show that the “first round impact” of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.

Here are the key insights from the report



Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6 per cent above Tuesday’s close
Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75 per cent of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment
Quality list additions: Britannia Industries, UltraTech Cement, GAIL, Hero MotoCorp, AU Small Finance Bank, Nestle India, Manappuram Finance, Repco Home Finance, Symphony, Power Grid, GlaxoSmithkline Consumer
Deletions from list: Sun Pharma, HDFC , Cipla, JSW Steel, L&T Infotech, Sun TV, TeamLease Services, Can Fin Homes, Eris Lifesciences, Adani Ports, Reliance Industries, Crompton Greaves, InterGlobe Aviation."
73,2019-09-25,JSW,"The mining industry is apprehending a ""mayhem"" when the leases of 31 non-captive iron ore mines will expire on March 31. The fear is that production will not resume immediately, and it would affect the supply of almost 70 million tonnes of the mineral, which is the key input for making steel.

The law gives the existing lessees seven months to remove their plant and machinery after the expiry of the lease. For the new entrant, it takes nearly three years to get the environmental and forest clearances for mining, according to an industry body.

Both these factors can delay the resumption of mining. ""These 31 mines make up 45% of the iron ore requirements of the steel industry and what we expect on March 31 is a mayhem that will affect particularly the steel sector,"" RK Sharma, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, told ET.

To ensure smooth transition of these leases, the government had decided to begin auctioning from the end of August, extending into September. ""Even if they start the auction process, it will be a theoretical exercise as effective transfer can take place only after the expiry of the lease,"" Sharma said.

User industries like steel and sponge iron, on the other hand, had written to the government in June against any further extension of the mining leases that the merchant miners had been batting for.

They argued that when the law was amended in 2015, the miners had got an extension of five years to ""complete the necessary procedures to bring these mines to auction."" Companies like JSW Steel, Kalyani Steels and Tata Long Products (formerly Tata Sponge Iron) stand to win mines under these auctions.

Hindustan Zinc chief executive Sunil Duggal has warned of direct job loss to around 500,000 if these mines fall non-operational for a long time. This will add to the almost 180,000 direct job losses caused by the closure of iron ore mines in Karnataka and Goa between 2011 and 2018.

74,2019-09-26,JSW,"Indian private sector companies, which are rated lower than investment grade, in the international market have made the most of low rates and easier liquidity conditions in the overseas market and are on course to raise a record amount of dollars.

So far this year, firms such as Azure Power, Jubilant Pharma, Greenko, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), GMR Hyderabad, Vedanta Resources and JSW Steel have cumulatively raised $7.4 billion and are just shy of beating the $7.7 billion raised by such companies in 2014. Bankers expect the 2014 record to be broken this year as more such companies like UP-based Lalitpur Power Generation are already meeting investors to find the time to issue these bonds.

“The overseas market has generally been more receptive to highyield issuances this year and Indian companies have taken full advantage of this fact,” said Sameer Gupta, head of debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank India. “This window has opened even as liquidity in the Indian markets was tight especially in the first half of the year, so it has helped companies access funds and also diversify their funding sources all at one go.”

The rush has been such that some companies have hit the overseas market twice this year to raise funds for refinancing and general corporate purposes. Take JSW Steel for example, which raised $400 million through a 5.5-year bond offering to international investors at 5.37 per cent on Tuesday. This was the alloy maker’s second such offering after raising $500 million in April this year. It is rated Ba2 by Moody’s and BB by Fitch.

Two of the GMR group’s airport subsidiaries — DIAL and GMR Hyderabad — raised $350 million and $300 million by selling these bonds to investors abroad. Then there are NBFCs like Indiabulls Housing Finance and Shriram Transport, which used this route to diversify their sources of funding. In February, Shriram Transport raised $400 million by selling three-year bonds to investors outside the US and followed it up with a $500-million issue for US-based investors in April.

“We are expecting more such high yield issuances out of India and we expect this year to be a record year, which will set the benchmark,” said Ashwini Kapila, managing director at Barclays. “The market has been really conducive driven by a clear risk on rally. The sharp fall in the US treasuries have also helped these companies and some of the concerns of last year like trade tensions between US and China have also subsided. All this has played its part.”"

Even if the companies shift, the gains would be negligible to have any meaningful impact on the heavilyleveraged balance sheets of most metal companies.

Most companies in the sector have accumulated losses of the past and have been paying tax at MAT. Besides, companies including Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Vedanta will also add losses from their recent acquisitions.

These companies may want to exhaust the tax exemptions of the existing norms before adopting the new tax rates. JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco, JSPL, SAIL and Vedanta also get tax benefits from the capacity expansions done over the past few years.



""The balancing act between the existing benefits and the future ones from the shift to the new tax rate is likely to delay the adoption by most players,” said Amit Dixit, metals analyst with Edelweiss. “Companies are still analysing the relative benefits of the new scheme, including one-time (non-cash) gain on deferred tax liabilities adjustment and treatment of upcoming capacities/acquisitions.”

In addition, high debt levels and strong capacity addition through organic and inorganic routes in the recent past, will restrict their capabilities to expand further. Most metal companies are heavily leveraged and some companies including Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power and SAIL are expected to slip into losses from the current quarter. For Hindalco, its US-based subsidiary Novelis contributes three-fourth of the total profit before tax and hence, the gains may not meaningful.

“Lower tax is unlikely to re-rate sector multiples. Further, given the stretched balance sheets, we do not expect any further capex in FY20-22 beyond what is already announced,” said Sumangal Nevatia, metals analyst at Kotak Securities.

Among sectoral indices, the Nifty Metal index is the lowest gainer since the announcements with 8 per cent gains, after the Nifty Pharma and Nifty IT indices. The momentum is unlikely to sustain.

Vedanta is an exception with its stock gaining 13.4 per cent. However, the spurt is mainly due to rumours of the government planning to sell its 29.5 per cent stake sale in company’s cash rich subsidiary Hindustan Zinc."

81,2019-09-27,JSW,"BENGALURU: Karnataka’s two-month-old BJP government has decided to go slow on the sale of land to JSW Steel in Sandur taluk of Ballari district, against which chief minister BS Yediyurappa himself had led a big campaign while in the opposition.

The government has put on hold the May 27 Cabinet decision of the previous JD(S)-Congress regime following objections from within the Congress and protests by the BJP. Industries minister Jagadish Shettar told ET, “I have not met anyone from the JSW Group, nor have I studied the file yet.”

Senior Congress leader HK Patil was the first to object, said Shettar, and the BJP also went on a protest. “We have not even had a preliminary discussion on the subject. I will discuss with my Cabinet colleagues and the CM and take a decision,” he said.

The minister said he will also revisit the proceedings of the four-member Cabinet sub-committee of the previous JD(S)-Congress regime. When contacted, Priyank Kharge, a member of this sub-committee, said they just had one meeting in July, and were told the company had complied with the conditions the government had laid down. “We have asked the officials for the relevant papers and also to address the issues raised by people point-wise. Alongside, we had also planned a field visit to see for ourselves if the company had fulfilled all conditions,” he said.

The JSW Group has decided to renew its efforts and make a fresh representation to the government, according to JSW Steel deputy managing director Vinod Nowal. “Industries are facing problems throughout India. The government should understand our problems, and do whatever is legally due to us,” he told ET.

As India’s largest steel producer, the JSW Group has also been exporting steel, and employing a large number of people from two-three neighbouring districts. “It is not just us. The government has given land to many industries as per its policies, and converted it into freehold in due course. We have invested ?65,000 crore, created 20,000 direct jobs and are paying ?6,500 crore in annual taxes,” he said.

The JD(S)-Congress government had decided to execute absolute sale deed in respect of 3,667 acres of land in Sandur taluk of Ballari district on the grounds that the company had fulfilled all commitments laid down under the earlier industrial policy. The Mumbai-headquartered JSW Group operates a 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) steel plant on the sprawling campus it got under a lease-cum-sale agreement.

Since the Cabinet decision, the steel mill, controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal, was at the centre of a political crossfire between the JD(S)- Congress regime and the BJP.

The state government allotted the land to the steel mill in two instalments of 2,000 acres in 2006 and 1,666 acres in 2007 at Toranagallu in Sandur taluk.

Where Are We?
 Rollover from the September series to October has been in the favour of the bulls. The monthly closing for September monthly contracts is likely to be positive; hence the index seems to have formed a medium term bottom at 10637 levels. Currently, the index is trading within a narrow range of 11613-11350 levels and till we don’t see a breakout above 10613 levels, the consolidation is likely to continue.


What is in Store?
 Currently, the Nifty is consolidating in a falling channel and the range of the same is 11350-10613 levels. The Index has taken off its crucial trend line hurdle of 11100; hence the base has shifted from 10637 to 11100 levels. Below 11350 levels, the next support comes at its 200 DMA i.e.11250 levels. There has been an increase in volumes with a breakout from the consolidation; hence it’s a price-volume breakout. Above 11613 levels, the immediate target come at 11750-11800 levels in the short term.


What Could the Investor Do? Based on the above observations, investors should utilise any dip as a buying opportunity as the market currently is in the grip of the bulls. The liquidity in the market has improved which has led to an increase in overall volumes. The momentum as well as wave count indicate that the short- to medium-term trend is positive, so the investors as well as traders will gain from the same. The stocks to focus on the long side in the short term are Reliance Industries, IndusInd Bank, Concor, Kansai Nerolac, Voltas, United Spirits, JSW Steel, Axis Bank and Marico."

The fall was led by private lenders Federal Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and RBL Bank, each of which fell over 3 per cent. Out of 12 Nifty Bank constituents, only two ended the day in green. 


Key Sensex movers
Banks were largely responsible for Sensex’s 430-point fall. Top five banks — HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank and SBI —dragged the 30-share index 330 points. 


IT stocks surge

3,2019-10-06,JSW,"MUMBAI: The post-budget measures announced by the government and the ongoing festive season have renewed the hopes of alloy major JSW Steel of better days ahead, though it still remains cautious on investing in new mines. Since the past few quarters, the steel sector has been hit badly due to the slowdown in real estate, auto and infrastructure sectors. The long and extended monsoon season also played a large role in dampening demand. 

""Demand slump is quite evident from the numbers given by the joint plant committee for the first half of the fiscal and it has been going down month after month. We are seeing demand slump not only from the auto industry but also from other key sectors like realty, infrastructure and general engineering,"" JSW Steel joint managing director and group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao told . 

However, he is hopeful that the series of initiatives announced by the government since the budget that roiled the sentiment for almost every sector, and the ongoing festive season can improve the sentiment, and thus the second half should be better. 

 Rao also blames the extended and heavy rains for the demand slowdown as the construction sector has come to a standstill. 

""Given the recent government initiatives coupled with the Reserve Bank slashing key rates for the fifth time in a row, the second half should be better. However so far we have not seen anything moving on the ground due to the extended monsoons,"" Rao says. 

He, however, notes that though the sentiment may improve, the credit flow into the system will take some more time. 

Welcoming the recent NMDC decision to renew the leases of the Donimalai mines in Karnataka, he says this will augment iron ore supply to the raw material starved steel plants in the state. The company has one of its largest facilities in the state. 

""We see this as a positive move as it will enhance the supply benefitting the iron ore starved sponge iron/ pellet/steel plants in Karnataka,"" he says. 

Asked if the company is changing its strategy towards the upcoming Odisha mine auctions, he said that ""we will continue to be cautious and not aggressive in our bidding."" 

""We have given a guidance of 1.5 per cent growth this year so we haven't anticipated a big growth in our production or sales numbers,"" he says when asked whether they will revisit its production targets and guidance for the fiscal. 

The company has set a target to increase its crude steel production and saleable steel sales to 16.95 million tonne and 16 million tonne, a rise of 1.5 per cent over FY2018-19, respectively."

5,2019-10-07,JSW,"MUMBAI: Domestic equities have weaken after a euphoric rally after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax cut announcement. Even a rate cut by RBI failed to cheer investors on Friday, and it looked like Nifty remains technically vulnerable to profit taking.

Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities, says Nifty’s underlying trend is sharply down. “A reversal pattern as per smaller and larger timeframe charts could open up the market to more weakness next week,” said Shetti.

While the broader market trend remains weak, analysts say the market is throwing up some solid opportunities for stock picking.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver gains over the next few sessions.


Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance SecuritiesAxis Bank | Buy| Target price: Rs 750| Stop loss: Rs 620
This stock has multiple supports in the Rs 640-650 range and witnessed a positive bounceback from the lower range in last two months. Key technical indicators are poised positively above their neutral line, signalling strength on the counter. Formation of higher bottoms on the weekly charts and a strong support near its 200-week moving average will save the stock from falling further.


CESC | Buy| Target price: Rs 810 | Stop loss: Rs 715
This stock has witnessed a vertical fall from its 52-week high at Rs 850 and seen some bounce from its long-term 200-day moving average. A reversal in the RSI from its neutral line and a positive crossover in the Stochastic around the oversold zone are confirming a turnaround in the stock.


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities.

Info Edge | Buy | Target Price: Rs 2,485| Stop loss: Rs 2,115
As per the weekly timeframe chart, this stock has indicated a sharp breakout on the upside. After remaining rangebound in the previous week, the stock rose sharply last week and closed higher. A larger positive sequence of higher tops and bottoms is still intact and the recent swing low of Rs 1,835 hit in the later part of August could now be considered as the latest higher bottom of the sequence. Hence, one may expect further rise this week. Volume has expanded with a rise in stock price. The weekly 14-period RSI also shows a positive indication, which indicates a long trade setup. Buying can be initiated in Info Edge at current market price of Rs 2,270. Add more on dips down to Rs 2,180.


Biocon| Buy | Target price: Rs 253| Stop loss: Rs 215

This stock moved up smartly on Thursday and shifted into a consolidation pattern on Friday. The daily chart pattern indicated the formation of a double bottom around Rs 212-211 levels. The price movement of last few weeks could be considered as an important bottom formation. A sustainable move above Rs 240 could be considered as a sharp upside breakout of this pattern. The daily RSI gives a positive indication, which indicates the possibility of strengthening the upside momentum. One may look to buy Biocon at the current market price of Rs 231, add more on dips down to Rs 220 and wait for an upside target of Rs 253 over next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop loss of Rs 215.


Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking

BHEL| Sell Oct Futures | Target price: Rs 43 | Stop loss: Rs 51
BHEL has been trading in a downtrend for last several years and there is still no change in trend. Though it had made several attempts in the past, but it went in vain as the stock failed to surpass the critical hurdles and resumed the downtrend. Currently, it is trading on the verge of fresh breakdown of the consolidation range. “We thus suggest initiating fresh shorts in the given range,” the analyst said.


JSW Steel | Sell Oct Futures |Target price: Rs 195 | Stop loss: Rs 225

JSW Steel has been trading in a downtrend for last one year and there’s still no sign of trend reversal. After a failed attempt to sustain above the resistance zone at 200 EMA, it is again drifting lower and is likely to make a new 52-week low. Weakness on other metal counters is adding to the negativity. “We thus advise using any bounce to go short in the given range,” the analyst said.


Lupin| Sell Oct futures | Target price: Rs 650 | Stop loss: Rs 712

The pharma counters are mostly trading in a prolonged downtrend and Lupin is no different. After a breakdown of the consolidation pattern, it’s currently trading at a 52-week low and likely to inch further southward. “We advise traders not to miss this chance and create fresh shorts as per the recommended levels,” the analyst said.


Jay Thakkar, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers


Exide Industries | Sell | Target price: Rs 182| Stop loss: Rs 195

Exide has broken down from the symmetrical triangular pattern on the hourly charts and the fall prior to it was a Five Wave declining structure. Hence, another impulse is expected on the wave down.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher


HCL Tech | Buy | Target Price Rs 1,180-1,230 I Stop loss: Rs 1,030
This stock has taken support near the lower trendline support of the channel pattern in the daily chart and indicated a bounceback with improving RSI and a positive bias to imply further strength and potential to rise in the coming days. Volume participation on the counter has been significant.


Apollo Hospitals| Buy | Target price: Rs 1,550| Stop loss: Rs 1,330
This stock has seen a higher bottom formation pattern on the daily chart with the RSI indicating a trend reversal from the oversold zone to give a buy signal. The bias has improved with further strength and the stock shows potential to rise more in the coming days. “With decent volume participation, we recommend a ‘buy’ rating on this stock for an upside target of Rs 1,550, keeping the stop loss at Rs 1,330,” the analyst said."
6,2019-10-07,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Metal shares were trading with losses in Monday's morning session. 

Shares of NMDC (down 2.88 per cent) , Steel Authority of India (SAIL) (down 2.09 per cent) , MOIL (down 1.26 per cent) and Jindal Steel & Power (down 1.07 per cent) were the top losers in the index.

JSW Steel (down 0.96 per cent) , APL Apollo Tubes (down 0.65 per cent) , Tata Steel (down 0.41 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (down 0.24 per cent) too were trading in the red. 

The Nifty Metal index was trading 0.29 per cent down at 2290.50 around 10:37 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 36.65 points at 11,211.40 while the BSE Sensex was up 182.73 points at 37,856.04. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 22 were trading in the green, while 28 were in the red. 

Shares of YES Bank, Vodafone Idea, ZEEL, BPCL, SBI, Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Bank of Baroda and SAIL were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
7,2019-10-09,JSW,"The government is actively considering introducing a short, time-bound, online financial bidding process in corporate insolvency cases to improve transparency and reduce litigation, a senior official said.

Currently, creditors of a company undergoing insolvency proceedings are free to negotiate with potential bidders individually, which has led to offers being revised, bids coming in after the deadline and associated litigation, prolonging the process.

The Centre aims to quicken resolution proceedings by setting a time limit for financial bids.

“Once a resolution applicant submits a plan and the plan meets basic eligibility criteria, you can shortlist eligible ones and then give them a window for, say 48 hours, to do financial bidding on a platform,” corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas said, explaining how the proposed window would work.

In some high-profile resolution cases, revised bids have led to prolonged litigation, which has delayed the insolvency process. In the Bhushan Power & Steel case, Tata Steel had opposed the inclusion of a late bid by Liberty House and a revised offer by JSW Steel. 

However, the NCLAT dismissed Tata Steel’s appeals and the NCLT subsequently approved JSW Steel’s bid.



Ruchi Soya saw multiple bids by Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved and Adani Wilmar before the former snapped it up for Rs 4,350 crore in early September. The resolution process for Ruchi Soya began in January 2018.

The government amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in an attempt to speed up the corporate insolvency resolution process by setting a limit of 330 days, including the time taken for litigation. Many cases far exceeded the previous 270-day deadline because the tribunals did not include the time taken for litigation. Experts said the window for financial bids will bring down litigation.

“It is likely to increase transparency, speed up the process and reduce litigation,” said Bishwajit Dubey, a partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.

Uday Bhansali, president (financial advisory) at Deloitte India, said the move “would help maximise value of assets provided other commercial conditions are not diluted” in cases where there are multiple technically qualified and fully compliant resolution plans. “Anything that helps value maximisation in a transparent manner is obviously positive for financial creditors, operational creditors and all stakeholders.”"
10,2019-10-10,JSW,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, went shopping for select PSU as well as private banks and infrastructure stocks in September when the benchmark BSE Sensex advanced nearly 4 per cent following a major corporate tax cut.

The fund house bought more than 1 crore shares each of the country’s biggest lender by assets, State Bank of India, and India's largest hydropower producer NHPC ahead of the September quarter earnings season that kicks off on October 10.

Shares of these PSUs have declined over 10 per cent since January, 2019.

Big bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala earlier this week said he sees a good opportunity in the PSU stocks. In an interaction with ETNOW, he said, “There is a very good opportunity in PSU stocks across the board. The biggest beneficiary of the tax cut would be the PSU firms.”

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other top buys in September included Axis Bank, Coal India, ITC, Bharat Electronics, BPCL, HPCL, Ashoka Buildcon, Federal Bank, ICICI Bank, L&T, GAIL, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma, Kirloskar Ferrous and eClerx Services, among others.

Bharat Petroleum’s (BPCL) share price has risen nearly 40 per cent since September after the government announced a plan to sell its 53 per cent stake in the company. Edelweiss Securities sees more upside in the stock given its material gap in valuations vis-à-vis top global refineries.

The brokerage recently came out with a ‘buy’ rating on BPCL with a revised price target of Rs 632 per share (earlier: Rs 442).

Reliance Securities is positive on the pharmaceutical sector and has advised investors to stay stock-specific.

Ace Mutual Fund database showed HDFC AMC held 5.44 crore shares of Axis Bank as of September 30 against 4.96 crore a month earlier. Likewise, it also bought over 10 lakh shares each in ICICI Bank and Federal Bank, indicating that the fund house has developed a liking for select private sector lenders.

Sunil Subramaniam, MD & CEO, Sundaram Mutual said NBFCs and public sector banks are going to be fairly less active and private sector banks would be a safe play as they have a healthy mix of retail and corporate books. “Year-on-year, their earnings should still show decent growth,” he said.

HDFC AMC also added shares of hotel firms Chalet Hotels (9 lakh shares) and Indian Hotels (5 lakh shares). Besides, it bought Mishra Dhatu Nigam (9.49 lakh shares), JSW Steel (9.06 lakh shares), ONGC (8.17 lakh shares), Neyveli Lignite (8 lakh shares), REC (7.46 lakh shares), Greenply Industries (7.30 lakh shares) and Aster DM Healthcare (7.18 lakh shares), Garden Reach (6.94 lakh shares) and HDFC (6.82 lakh shares).

The fund house appeared to have found a contra bet in auto stocks, as the sector continued to reel under pressure due to weak demand for more than a year now. The fund house added some shares of Tata Motors (16,892 shares), Hero MotoCorp (27,933), M&M (21,358) and Maruti Suzuki (1,561), but sold 15,302 shares of Bajaj Auto during the month.

Maruti Suzuki cut production by 17.48 per cent in September, making it the eighth straight month of lower output.

From among major blue chip firms, the fund house added 4 lakh shares of the oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries (RIL) and 3.71 lakh shares of HDFC Bank. IT companies Tech Mahindra, Sonata Software, NIIT Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services also drew interest of the AMC.

JM Financial has a ‘buy’ rating on RIL with an immediate target price of Rs 1,346 and thereafter Rs 1,365.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 98 companies and offloaded shares in 53 others from across sectors. With an asset under management of Rs 3.46 lakh crore, it held 308 stocks as of September 30, 2019.

Among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month included over 10 lakh shares each in Infosys, Edelweiss Financial, YES Bank, Ashok Leyland, BHEL, S Chand, Shriram Transport, Rites and Tata Chemicals.

It also sold over 1 lakh shares of select midcap and largecap firms such as Divi’s Lab, Dabur India, Titan, Cipla, Wipro, Adani Ports and Petronet LNG, among others.

Titan shares declined as much as 6 per cent in intraday trade on October 9 after the company reported a 2 per cent decline in jewellery business revenue for September quarter of 2019-20 despite a 7 per cent growth in retail sales.

“Retail sales (secondary sales) grew 7 per cent in Q2 FY20 but revenues declined 2 per cent year-on-year in Q2FY220, due to the adverse impact of hedges matured during the quarter,” the company said in a BSE filing."

9,2019-10-10,JSW,"Steel companies, led by JSW Steel, BMM Ispat and Kalyani Steel, are hoping Donimalai mines in Ballari district will resume iron ore production soon with the Centre amending the regulations in a bid to break the logjam created due to the stand-off between Karnataka and public sector mining giant NMDC.

The Hyderabad-based NMDC has been struggling since November last year when its 20-year lease of Donimalai mines in Ballari district expired. That left the PSU with only Kumaraswamy mines in the district, crippling its production. The two mines have a production capacity of 7 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) each.

Ballari district is dotted with steel, sponge iron and pellet industries, all of which are dependent on local iron ore. Industry experts peg the local demand at about 32 MTPA. The Supreme Court, however, capped the production at 28 MTPA in 2014, with NMDC accounting for half of it. ""With Donimalai mines backing down, one-fourth of the supply was hit forcing steel, sponge iron and pellet industries to operate at half of their capacity and fire workers. They will get a big relief if Donimalai mines start production,"" a senior executive at a steel mill said.

A state could extend the mining lease for 20 years in respect of a public sector enterprise, but Karnataka decided to go slow on NMDC's request. The state government offered to extend the lease if the PSU was ready to pay 80% of the market price as premium. The public sector major, however, refused, leading to a deadlock, sources explained.

The Mineral (Mining by Government Company) Rules, 2015, earlier, gave discretion to a state on extension/renewal of a mining lease for a PSU. However, after NMDC and the Karnataka government locked horns, the Centre removed the discretion two weeks ago, bringing hope to the steel mills, sponge iron and pellet units.

State’s secretary for mines M Maheshwar Rao said they were aware of the amendments. ""We are getting the amendments examined. The government will take a suitable decision soon,"" he said.

Vinod Nowal, deputy MD at JSW Steel, hailed the Centre's decision. The Karnataka government, he said, should take it forward and allow NMDC to resume production at Donimalai mines at the earliest. ""The lease of many mines are going to expire in March next year and the industries can function only if the government ensures continuity in supply,"" he added.

NMDC is India's single-largest iron ore producer at 32.4 MTPA in 2018-19. Its latest annual report said the company reported a drop of 3% in market share due to suspension of mining activities at Donimalai."

22,2019-10-14,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to release assets of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. (BPSL) attached as part of investigations into alleged loan fraud and money laundering by the company and erstwhile promoter Sanjay Singhal. JSW Steel, which is looking to acquire the company in bankruptcy proceedings, had sought protection from the ongoing probes.

The tribunal has put on hold the Rs 19,700-crore payout by JSW Steel for acquiring the debt-ridden firm. 

The NCLAT told ED that its actions would undermine the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), a key pillar of the strategy to repair bank finances.

“You are going to kill the economy of the country... (You are) playing with fire,” the bench headed by NCLAT chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhyaya told the directorate. “No outsider will come and purchase (distressed companies)... IBC cannot be annulled in this manner. Money laundering is by an individual.”

The NCLAT also directed ED not to attach any further assets without its permission. The Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved JSW Steel’s Rs 19,700 crore resolution plan for BPSL on September 5. JSW Steel doesn’t have to pay the money until the next date of hearing, which is October 25, the NCLAT said.

The bench directed the agency and the CBI to file a reply in the next two days.

“We direct the deputy director, and other officers of the directorate of enforcement... to release the property attached in favour of the resolution professional immediately,” it said.

The ED last week attached plants and property of BPSL worth more than Rs 4,025 crore after obtaining an order from a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court. The central probe agency said it has seized land, building, plant and machinery of the firm located in Odisha under PMLA provisions.

The tribunal said the ED doesn’t have the jurisdiction to seize the property of a corporate debtor, particularly when an appeal is pending with regard to attachment, questioning the move by ED. Counsel for the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) also told the NCLAT that the ED has no jurisdiction to attach assets under the insolvency process. The MCA said its stand was in consultation with the Department of Financial Services and banks.

“When the appeal is pending and you (ED) have received a notice, why have you attached?” said the bench. “Why should we not file a contempt?”

The ED’s provisional attachment order of October 10 has been stayed until the issue is decided by the appellate tribunal, it said. Officers and directors are also prohibited from attaching any property of BSPL without permission."

Where are We? After the 2-day strongest move of the decade, the Nifty faced resistance at 11700 level which was its previous reversal area. The index has retraced almost 61.8 per cent retracement level of the earlier rise; whereas, the mid- and small-cap sectors lost their previous gains. It indicates bears are back after a short sting of the bulls. The index is hovering around its 200-day long-term moving average. Momentum indicator RSI reading comes at 53 level which shows neutral force in the market.


What is in Store? The index seems to be on the cusp of the bears till it sustains below 11400 level, which is an immediate hurdle for the bulls. The index is forming probable inverted flag pattern which indicates continuation of negative movement. Implication of the pattern will get invalidated above 11400 level. On the downside, the index can have potential support in the range of 11000 to 10900.


What could Investors Do? The earnings season has just started and it will be the key event to watch out for. Technically, the index had offered good investment opportunity as it is down almost 12-15 per cent from the top. The recent decline can be used to expand the portfolio as many stocks had retraced their important long-term support levels.

13,2019-10-14,JSW,"MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) move to attach the properties of Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL) is a “vindication” of its stand, JSW Steel said on Sunday.

India’s second-largest steelmaker has offered to acquire BPSL, but sought immunity from litigation related to alleged frauds at the bankrupt company. 

“The move vindicates JSW Steel’s stand of seeking immunity from attachment of properties of the corporate debtor,” said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director, JSW Steel, on Sunday. “This may happen even in other cases, where the control is changed under the (Insolvency and) Bankruptcy Code.”


ED Says BPSL Diverted Funds
On Saturday, ED attached immovable BPSL assets worth Rs 4,025 crore under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), in connection with investigation into an alleged bank fraud. These properties include the building, plant and machinery of a 3.5-million tonne steel plant in Odisha.



In September, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) allowed JSW Steel to acquire BPSL. However, JSW did not get relief from the scope of ongoing probes against BPSL, leading it to challenge NCLT in a court of appeals. 

A Delhi High Court ruling in April had held that relevant laws on money laundering take precedence over the bankruptcy law, and JSW Steel was worried that assets of BPSL would get attached as “proceeds of crime.” This would affect the financial health of the company after JSW Steel had taken it over.

“The insolvency code is a commercial law, and anybody acquiring an asset under it has the basic right to demand that the asset be free from encumbrances,” said Alok Dhir, managing partner, Dhir & Dhir Associates. “Laws need to let the acquirer control an asset without (having to deal with) the pre-acquisition period overhang. Also, the legislature’s interpretation of such laws has to be purposive; if it’s not, investors may not show interest in stressed assets in the future.”

JSW Steel has offered Rs 19,700 crore for BPSL, but ownership change is linked to future higher court verdicts. An appeals tribunal is scheduled to hear on Monday the acquiring steelmaker's petition for immunity from ongoing probes into BPSL fraud cases. JSW Steel has also challenged the clause that says profits generated by BPSL during insolvency be distributed among financial creditors.

Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate alleged that BPSL had used various means to divert funds obtained as loans from several banks. “An amount of Rs 695.14 crore was introduced as capital by Sanjay Singal (then chairman and managing director) and his family members in BPSL out of artificially generated long-term capital gains by diversion of bank loan funds of BPSL,” the agency's statement said, according to a PTI report. Long-term capital gains didn’t attract income tax at the time."

30,2019-10-15,JSW,"State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar on Tuesday said the Enforcement Directorate and other central law enforcement agencies should restrict 
to attaching personal assets while investigating a promoter and keep 
off the company which is 
under the insolvency process.

Speaking a day 
after NCLAT asked the ED 
to release the attached properties of Bhushan Power & Steel which is being taken over by JSW Steel, Kumar asserted the lenders' first right of taking charge of an asset of its bank-financed and said no one should dispute the same.

""Any action which ED or any other central authority has 
to take, they can take with the existing 
promoters and attach their personal assets leaving their companies away,"" he said, speaking at a Bloomberg event here.

Kumar said the agencies should follow this rule especially in case of companies which are undergoing bankruptcy process, as new suitors are ""not fools"" 
to risk their money.

""The person acquiring a company cannot be subjected 
to any harassment by any agencies and I am sure that will be guaranteed now,"" Kumar said, adding as per the spirit of the bankruptcy code, an acquirer needs a ""clean asset"".

It can be noted that over the weekend ED had attached assets worth Rs 4,025 crore while probing money laundering linked 
to an alleged bank loan fraud against the BPSL 
promoters. This was challenged by JSW Steel at the NCLAT, which on Monday had slammed the ED, saying the bankruptcy code would fail if the agency functioned like this and ordered the property be released. JSW Steel had won the bid 
to buy company for Rs 19,700 crore.

Kumar said the Supreme Court judgment on Essar Steel should address much of the worries which are leading 
to legal tangles in the nascent bankruptcy laws.

He said there will not be any more consolidations once the number of state-run lenders gets down 
to 12, and private sector lenders should also acquire smaller rivals.

Meanwhile, Kumar also said since public private partnership model has not succeeded, a new model needs 
to emerge and the government cannot continue 
to take the financial burden on projects.

If required, we bankers should be willing 
to take pains in the short-term as a new model emerges, he added.

""I am not saying all was well or is well with the behaviour of 
promoters. There are issues and they are coming out. Take a large power plant for instance. We need a promoter with means 
to put it and run it. How many 
promoters are left with the capability 
to bring in equity and invest today?""

He said large companies and those big mid-size ones have utilised only 31 percent of their working capital limits, while smaller companies have utilised 70 percent.

There has been a 15 percent increase in term loans for the bank on a year-on-year basis, as there is lot of appetite for credit, he said.

On the PMC Bank scam, Kumar said while cooperatives are needed and have offered good services 
to customers over time, governance issues dog them.

He said

42,2019-10-18,JSW,"JSW Steel has raised Rs 2,000 crore via issuance of NCDs from Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) to meet long term working capital requirements, refinancing some high cost debt and to fund an ongoing capital expenditure program, the company announced via a notification on the BSE on Friday.

This is the third fund raise by the 18 million tonne steelmaker this year after it raised a total of $900 million (Rs 6,410 crore) this year, first in April and then more recently in September , through dollar bonds. 

The ten-year papers will bear a face value of Rs 10,00,000 and hold a coupon rate of 8.79 per cent, the company said. 

JSW Steel wants to take its capacity to 40-45 million tonne by 2025 and is in the midst of an elaborate expansion program that includes both increasing capacities at its existing plants in Vijayanagar and Dolvi, as well as acquiring plants primarily through the company’s bankruptcy law and then integrating them into itself. 

It has a target of increasing capacity at its Dolvi plant from 5 million tonne to 10 million tonne by March next year. 

Also , the company has made an offer of Rs 19,700 crore for the 3.5 million tonne Bhushan Power of Steel under the IBC. The sale has for now been stayed by the companies appellate tribunal due to investigations going on by the Enforcement Directorate against its former promoter Sanjay Singhal. 

JSW Steel’s promoters have also been releasing pledged shares in recent days and have repaid loans worth Rs 2,350 crore through release of shares. Net debt at the company is around Rs 45,000 crore."
43,2019-10-19,JSW,"New Delhi: Bhushan Power and Steel misused bank loans to carry out fictitious transactions and route funds to four promoter group entities that had invested in the company, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said. BPSL made advances to “paper entities” through bank transfers and procured fake transportation documents to project that goods worth several crores of rupees had been ferried to the company’s plant in Odisha, the ED said. 

This was done in connivance with owners of steel, iron ore and transport companies to make the fictitious transactions appear lawful, the ED said in its investigation report. The ED had provisionally attached BPSL’s assets last week, a move that was opposed by JSW Steel, which had made a successful bid for BPSL under the insolvency resolution process. 

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal stayed the ED’s order to attach BPSL properties worth Rs 4,025 crore earlier this week, which the agency is considering appealing. The ED, in the report exclusively accessed by ET, said that BPSL chairman Sanjay Singal had devised a “brilliant scheme to dress up the books of accounts” of the company. 

“BPSL had devised a peculiar modus operandi to siphon funds obtained as loans from various banks/financial institutions,” the ED said. “Singals did not use the bank funds for the purpose for which the same were sanctioned, committed forgery and falsified accounts, causing wrongful loss to the lending banks.” 

In July, Punjab National Bank and Allahabad Bank had accused BPSL’s former promoters and directors of fraud in connection with loans given to the company. The ED said that during his questioning on October 3, Singal admitted to routing the amounts transferred by BPSL to various parties on account of purchase of goods, which never took place. 

Singal deposed in his statement that Rs 3,330 crore was routed to the accounts of four companies controlled by him out of the funds diverted from the accounts of BPSL in the shape of advances shown to various parties. It added that Singal conceded that the four companies — Jasmine Steel Trading, Marsh Steel, Diyajyoti Steel and Vision Steel — were promoters of BPSL that were ultimately owned and controlled by him and his family. 

The four companies infused Rs 3,330 crore in BPSL in the period from 2011-12 to 2016-17. BPSL has denied the allegations levelled against it. Singal, the report stated, also admitted that “long term capital gains (LTCG) of over Rs 695 crore were artificially generated by his family members and himself and another amount of nearly Rs 700 crore was invested by his family members and himself in BPSL out of the funds so generated in their accounts as LTCG which were nothing but the funds diverted from the accounts of BPSL.”"

Slowdown curbs India Inc's appetite for M&A

Planned shutdown and a sharp correction in steel prices hurt revenues which fell 21 per cent YoY to Rs 15,520 crore for the quarter. Sales realisation and sales volume too declined.


Here are the key takeaways of JSW Steel's Q2 earnings:

Steel production dropsCrude steel production during the quarter stood at 3.84 million tonnes, down 8 per cent YoY. The current quarter performance was marked by a confluence of multiple headwinds – prolonged and severe monsoon impacting/logistics at Dolvi works, weak demand environment, sustained tight liquidity condition, planned shutdowns and sharp price correction.


Steel sales declineSaleable steel sales dropped 9 per cent from a year before to 3.60 million tones, as weaker activity levels on the back of muted investment spend, credit squeeze, and a slowdown in the automotive sector resulted in overall subdued steel demand.


Guidance cutThe company expects to achieve 97 per cent of its crude steel production and saleable steel sales guidance of FY20, as production and sales volumes dropped in the first half of the year.


Impact on marginsMargins were adversely impacted by lagged pricing impact of certain key raw materials such as coking coal. The benefit of subsequent correction in raw material prices will flow through in the subsequent quarter."

50,2019-10-23,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Amid a stretched slowdown in demand for steel that grew by less than 1 per cent in September, JSW Steel decided to ""recalibrate"" its capital expenditure for this year, bringing it down by Rs 4,700 crore and also reduced its annual production and sales guidance, the company's management announced at its September quarter earnings conference. 

JSW Steel had earlier planned to spend Rs 15,700 crore this year on various organic expansion programs but will now be puting off expenditure on augmenting its downstream capacities and in other special projects to next year and will only be spending Rs 11,000 crore this year. The company also said that the volumes that it has lost in the first half of the year are ""unlikely to be recouped during the second half"" and hence will look forward to achieving only 97 per cent of its guidance for the year. 

The company reported a 21.5 per cent rise in its net profit for the June-September quarter at Rs 2,536 crore as it was able to benefit from reversal of deferred tax provisions worth Rs 1,976 crore. The company had made these provisions earlier but re-visited them after the government announced the new corporate tax regime that JSW Steel plans to enter in future. Net profit before tax benefits stood at Rs 688 crore. 

Net sales decreased by 18.5 per cent at Rs 17,572 crore due to lower sales volume and lower realisations that fell by 16 per cent owing to sharp fall in steel prices. Operating profit stood at Rs 2,731 crore, down by 44 per cent since last year. 

The company's sales declined by 9 per cent during the quarter and it tried to makeup for the shortfall in domestic demand by pushing exports that increased by 68 per cent since last year during the quarter. Jayant Acharya, the company's chief for commercial and marketing said that it was able to reduce inventory by 48,000 tonnes since June. 

Net debt at the end of the quarter stood at Rs 49,640 crore with a net debt to Ebitda ratio of 3.23x. ""Comparing the relative ratios with what we have been guiding there is enough headroom for the company (to borrow more),"" said Seshagiri Rao, joint MD at JSW Steel."

60,2019-10-24,JSW,"We have started seeing a good amount of interest and traction building even in the midcaps and smallcaps, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Last one year has been full of twists and turns and peaks and turfs. Whatever could go wrong, has gone wrong, investor wealth has been massively destroyed. Should one go out and grab bargains this Diwali or is it time to conserve cash?Last couple of years have been quite tough but things finally seem to be falling in place for our markets, Over the next one year and even beyond that, we should be able to see a decent performance from the market and this time, after a spectacular performance from some of the largecap companies, we have started seeing a good amount of interest and traction building even in the midcaps and smallcaps. 

Once the earnings start reflecting in the numbers and overall global markets are supportive, the next 2-3 years should be extremely positive for our markets and we should be super bullish.


What could go wrong? Everybody is telling me buy good time, bargains are there. Why is nobody telling me about the risks which are there. Everybody is focussing on what can go right, rather than what potentially could go wrong?Globally, in a large part of the economies, Eurozone or some of the emerging markets, China are the black boxes where people do not have much of clarity what can come one particular day. Secondly, we have seen in last three years, earnings growth is taking a while to come back. If there is further delay in earnings growth beyond two or three quarters and the demand revival is delayed, then obviously there is going to be a question mark on the sustainability of the rally.


What do you make of yesterday’s extraordinary volatility in RBL?The volatility was caused by the Q2 numbers and the kind of guidance which the management gave about possible credit costs and the concentration of certain non-performing assets across certain entities. In the current environment, where you have already gone through a bit of grind coming from companies like DHFL, Yes Bank and Indiabulls, people have become extra circumspect on the asset quality side. 

There is a sense that the management is probably trying to say that there could be some more negative news over the next few quarters. People would stay away from such companies in the current environment and which is what we have seen. RBL Bank has come down from Rs 600 plus to almost Rs 250. We had a viewpoint on RBL Bank and we have put under the cautious view at this point of time till the clarity emerges on the asset quality front.


JSW numbers are really not encouraging and even in terms of the commentary coming in, it has been a bit of a tough time with regards to the industry and weak margins, expensive valuations, lower prices and lower demand. What is your outlook on JSW going forward?We had a buy call on JSW for a while but post the quarterly numbers, and the outlook from the management, we have decided to book out of JSW Steel. Both on the pricing front as well as on the volume front, things will take a while to be back on track. Overall given the debt and the environment we think that it makes more sense to get out of some of these steel companies. 


The cycle will turn. It is not going to be a permanent cycle. Some would argue that if you are buying metal stocks, you are pretty much buying a Tata Steel, Vedanta or Hindalco which are mostly below book. We have noticed that in the last 15-20 years, if you bought metal stocks when they were approaching half a book, you have always made money.The issue with buying some stocks purely on valuation parameters is that you do not know how long you will have to really wait out. Even if the economy revives, it will take a while for it to reflect in the capex cycle. Typically, only when you see a big revival in the capex cycle, do you see the commodity players doing well. 

At the moment, though the stocks have corrected, I honestly do not know how long it will take to reflect in the numbers. We should be looking at companies where there is earnings visibility over the next three or four quarters. From that perspective, we are staying away from the steel companies."

51,2019-10-24,JSW,"New Delhi: Insolvency courts do not have the jurisdiction to direct release of a company’s assets attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the Enforcement Directorate has told the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

Defending its decision to attach the assets of bankrupt steel mill Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL), the ED said validity of a provisional attachment order passed under PMLA can only be examined by the adjudicating authority under PMLA.

The NCLAT had on October 14 directed the ED to immediately release BPSL’s assets to the resolution professional of the company and file a reply.

“The provisional attachment order dated 10.10.2019 passed under Section 5 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, is not amenable to the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Tribunal and its validity can only be examined by the Adjudicating Authority under Section 8 of the PMLA,” the agency said in an affidavit filed before the NCLAT.

The ED attached plant and property of BPSL worth more than Rs 4,025 crore in Odisha as part of investigations into alleged loan fraud and money laundering by the company and its erstwhile promoter Sanjay Singhal. The ED’s move has stalled JSW Steel’s Rs 19,700 crore resolution plan for BPSL.

The NCLAT had told the ED that its actions were undermining the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and would harm the economy.

It had also asked the agency as to why it had attached the assets when it had joined the plea in a matter where JSW Steel had sought protection from any liabilities arising from earlier criminal conduct.

The ED has submitted the PMLA was a specific law governing money laundering and that no exceptions could be made to it unless provided for by the parliament. It also said the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code does not grant any powers to NCLAT to deal with PMLA cases.

Sources close to development told ET that the agency has not released the attached assets of BPSL.

The ED has also said that the NCLAT should not rely on the view of the ministry of corporate affairs as the view of the government, as the agency is under the administration of the department of revenue.

The ministry of corporate affairs in consultation with the department of financial services had backed creditors of BPSL and resolution applicant JSW Steel in the previous hearing, arguing that while the ED is free to attach the personal assets of erstwhile promoters who have allegedly committed fraud, it does not have jurisdiction to attach the assets of the company."

62,2019-10-25,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has asked the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to arrive at a consensus on the government’s view regarding the attachment of assets belonging to Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) by the ED. The seizure has stalled BPSL’s bankruptcy resolution process under which JSW Steel was set to take it over.

A three-member NCLAT bench said Friday that any claim on the assets of BPSL by the ED would be treated as operational debt under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. “It will be desirable to discuss and settle this matter,” said the bench headed by justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, referring to getting the government’s view on the issue. NCLAT will next hear the case on November 18.

The ED had, earlier this month, attached BPSL’s land, buildings, plant and machinery in Odisha worth more than Rs 4,000 crore in a case related to the alleged diversion of bank funds. The MCA has opposed the seizure, which has led to a delay in payments to creditors of the company under a Rs 19,700-crore insolvency resolution plan proposed by JSW Steel.




Finance and corporate affairs minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that she was in talks with both the revenue secretary and the corporate affairs secretary to resolve the issue.

“We are applying our minds to it … Let us see how we can resolve it,” Sitharaman said. “The government has recognised that there is an issue.”

NCLAT had directed the ED to release the BPSL assets to the resolution professional in charge of the bankruptcy process on October 14.

At that time the tribunal told the agency that such actions undermined the IBC, a cornerstone of the strategy to repair bank finances.

“You are going to kill the economy of the country… (You are) playing with fire,” Mukhopadhyaya had said. “No outsider will come and purchase (distressed companies)… IBC cannot be annulled in this manner. Money laundering is by an individual.” 

However, the ED contended that the NCLAT doesn’t have the jurisdiction to tell the agency what to do as the assets were attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). In its reply filed before the NCLAT, the ED argued that the validity of the attachment of BPSL’s assets could only be reviewed by the adjudicating authority under PMLA. The ED submitted that “there is no power under the IBC to interfere with a provisional attachment order passed.”"
61,2019-10-25,JSW,"New Delhi: Efforts are ongoing to resolve the issue of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attaching assets of companies that are undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday.

Several companies that are undergoing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) are also facing investigations by the ED over alleged money laundering by their promoters.ED, which is an investigative arm of the finance ministry, has claimed that it could attach such assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). It has seized some assets of Bhushan Steel & Power, posing challenges to the ongoing resolution process for the company.

“We are applying our minds to it … Let us see how we can resolve it,” she said.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and the ED have locked horns over the attachment of Bhushan Power & Steel’s properties. The case is currently being heard by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The ED in its affidavit to the tribunal said that insolvency courts did not have the jurisdiction to direct the agency to release assets attached under the PMLA.

The MCA, in consultation with the Department of Financial Services, had backed the creditors of Bhushan Power & Steel and the company that sought to acquire it, JSW Steel, before the tribunal, arguing that while the ED was free to attach the personal assets of the erstwhile promoters who had allegedly committed fraud, it did not have the jurisdiction to seize the assets of the company.

“On this matter, I had some discussions. I am conscious of the fact that the ED does its duty and job, and when it comes to the question of attaching such properties of people who are being pursued under the PMLA, some of the company property are also getting attached,"" the minister told reporters.

INCOME TAX, MTNL-BSNL MERGER

Asked about a possible cut in personal income tax rates, the finance minister said: ""As regards income tax at the stage, there may not be much for me to say … People have spoken about it.""

On the government's decision to merge state-run telecom operators MTNL and BSNL, she said: ""We recognise the role that BSNL and MTNL and the combined institution have to play in the country's telecommunication and connectivity.”"

72,2019-10-30,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel shares gained more than 5 per cent over the three trading sessions since it posted a weak set of earnings numbers for the second quarter last Wednesday. The worst is behind for the company, with input prices easing and demand expected to rise, according to joint managing director Seshagiri Rao. “While steel prices fell substantially in the quarter, raw material prices corrected only with a lag, thus squeezing margins for the September quarter,” he said.

JSW’s standalone Ebitda per tonne fell 38 per cent from the preceding quarter to Rs 6,400, the lowest level in nine quarters. Standalone revenue fell 12 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 15,520 crore, led by a 10 per cent decline in the average selling price.

The performance of the company’s smaller subsidiaries was also weak, resulting in consolidated profit before tax falling 62 per cent QoQ. However, consolidated net profit more than doubled from the first quarter to Rs 2,536 crore due to tax reversals. The situation will reverse in the second half of this financial year, Rao said. Since August, coking coal prices have fallen almost 30 per cent to $140 a tonne. Iron ore prices, too, have declined 30 per cent from their peak in the first half of the financial year. The cheaper coal and iron ore will be consumed from October. At the same time, steel prices are not expected to fall much and demand should pick up.

“We are seeing some movement in retail demand, especially from rural regions, due to a better monsoon. Some of the state projects that were on hold, too, have restarted. While inventory levels with producers have gone up, the inventory with consumers is low. Chinese production and supply are also low,” said Rao.


“We factor in improvement in steel prices and lower coking coal costs, but still see steel Ebidta/tonne in the Rs 8,000-8,500 range in the second half of FY20 and in FY21,” CLSA said in a recent note. The figure is higher than Rs 6,400 in the first half of FY20 and lower than Rs 11,700 in FY19.

Given the uncertainty, the JSW Steel management has pushed some of its capital expenditure to next year, reducing its estimated spending to Rs 11,000 crore from Rs 15,700 crore for this year.

From a 52-week peak of Rs 359.70 on November 5 last year, the JSW Steel stock has declined about 35 per cent to Rs 234.5 at the close on the BSE on Tuesday and is trading at 7.1 times FY21 estimated EV/Ebitda, which appears expensive. However, the stock may find support at the current levels as the outlook improves."

71,2019-10-30,JSW,"Mumbai: Stocks surged for the third straight day and closed at near-four-month highs as better than expected earnings and hopes of tax sops for equity investors lifted sentiment.

Higher retail and car sales during the long Diwali weekend and the festival month of October also added to the buoyant mood with investors expecting more government measures to propel the economy out of its year-long slump.

The Sensex climbed 582 points to end at 39,831.84, its highest close since July 2. The Nifty rose 160 points to close at 11,786.85. All indices ended in the green except telecom, which fell 4 per cent. The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices rose 1.12 per cent and 0.55 per cent, respectively.

The Sensex and the Nifty have risen 10.43 per cent and 8.51 per cent, respectively year-to-date.

Markets were buoyed by reports that the government may consider rationalising the taxes that equity investors pay, including the long-term capital gains tax announced in last year’s budget.

The finance ministry and the prime minister’s office are holding consultations on cutting some rates and doing away completely with the securities transaction tax, some media reports said.

Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth ?877 crore on Tuesday while domestic institutions pumped in ?145 crore in equities.



Good show by heavyweights

Heavyweights like ICICI Bank, SBI and Tata Motors posted better than expected second quarter earnings over the weekend leading many investors to believe that the worst may be over for auto and banking stocks. Tata Motors surged 17 per cent on Tuesday capping 30 per cent rise in just two days. SBI fell on Tuesday but the shares had risen 7 per cent on Friday after posting a three-fold rise in second quarter profits. Reliance Industries surged 2.3 per cent to Rs 1,467, contributing most to the Sensex’s gain, after it announced plans to make its telecom subsidiary net-debt free and the setting up of a new company to house all digital initiatives and apps. Metal stocks were also big gainers. Tata Steel and JSW Steel rallied 7 per cent while SAIL and Jindal Steel gained 5 per cent each.


“A sharp turn in sentiment can lift all the boats and offer good trading opportunities in the beaten down stocks,” Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy & investments at Sharekhan, said referring to the improved mood after the Diwali sales and earnings reports.

Technical analysts said the Nifty has formed a bullish candle on a daily scale as follow-up buying happened at higher levels. “Supports are gradually shifting higher,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Sandeep Nayak, CEO of Centrum Broking, believes that the recently concluded festival season has resulted in a sentiment turnaround for beleaguered auto stocks. Auto sales rose 5-7 per cent in this year’s festival season — spread over Navratri, Dussehra and Dhanteras — over the year-ago period. Two car makers, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, have registered 7 per cent and 10 per cent growth, respectively, ET reported in its Monday edition. Two-wheeler sales haven’t seen as much of a festive surge, though the performance has improved over previous months."

2,2019-11-01,JSW,"Share pledge levels of select Indian companies hit new highs in September quarter even as a few of them removed share pledges completely.

Out of the 839 companies, which have reported promoter share pledges so far, the total value of promoter’s pledged shares stood at Rs 2.35 lakh crore, which was over 1.5 per cent of total market-cap of BSE-listed entities.

As many as 88 companies saw substantial (more than 1 percentage points) increase in the promoter share pledges in September quarter. Prominent among them included JSW Steel, JSW Energy, Bajaj Consumer Care, Adani Green Energy, Amara Raja Batteries, Zee Media, Adani Ports, Future Retail and Torrent Pharma, among others. 

Four firms saw promoters encumbering complete shareholding during the quarter, according to Ace Equity data. They included McDowell Holdings, PBM Polytex, MphasiS and DHFL.

Shares of many of these companies have taken a beating in recent months, as worried investors sold what they got at any price. Falling share prices forced a number of banks and mutual funds to revoke pledged shares, further hurting sentiments. However, not everyone is unhappy with the scenario.

Shankar Sharma of First Global thinks bear market acts as a cleaner. “Bear markets act as disinfectants. All the ills, which were being hidden by rising stock prices, come out when stock prices go down suddenly and you are left with your pledges out in the open. The reason you pledge shares is to put some other business up, as we have seen in some corporate groups. But because of the downturn, those businesses have collapsed. So, it is disinfecting your entire corporate landscape in a brutal way,” he told ETNow.

Normally, share pledging rises in a tight liquidity and rising interest rate environment. It becomes problematic in a volatile market, particularly if stock prices crash. This can then force promoters to increase collaterals to lenders by pledging more shares.

Essel group features prominently on the list of companies that have seen an increase in share pledges. Not surprisingly, the market has punished the stock. Zee Entertainment fell 21 per cent during the quarter and Zee Media 22 per cent.

Abneesh Roy, Executive Vice-President at Edelweiss Securities, expects Zee Entertainment to see conclusive rerating when promoter debt issue and the promoter share pledges get resolved. 



Meanwhile, promoters of 14 firms removed all pledges on their shares in September quarter, data shows. They include Birlasoft, Eros International, Triveni Glass, Triveni Turbine and JK Tyre, among others.

In all, promoters of 70 companies substantially reduced share pledges during the quarter AceEquity data showed. Major names among them were Adani Transmission, Star Paper, Centrum Capital, Infibeam Avenues, Granules India and NCC, among others."
3,2019-11-02,JSW,"Betting on Jindal Steel and Balrampur Chini next week, says Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.
What do you make of this set up when you look at the charts, especially with the Sensex hitting a record high?I believe that the Nifty has managed to make a very good comeback. It is not just the Nifty price performance which is the key, not just this week but the last two months. The reshaping of the market internals is something noteworthy because the entire market texture has changed. Sentiment has changed. Just a couple of months back, everything was extremely pessimistic and now things have started to look more optimistic. Even if a company delivers any negative news, the stock does not get sold off that extensively. 

When you see a complete change of scenario, you expect this new trend which has emerged to continue. Last week, particularly, we saw very good comeback from midcaps and smallcaps. The largecaps took a bit of a breather in the last couple of days of the previous week. I believe that is going to be the market mood for the next one, one-and-a-half odd week. I expect Nifty to consolidate, hover around the 12,000-odd mark. We have to see how it tests the 12,000 mark intra week. It should consolidate at these levels and the midcaps and smallcaps should try and pick pace. The focus for a short-term trader should be more stock specific, rather than be taking a call on the entire sector as such.


What is your view on some of the large auto names? It is time for these stocks to see a bit of profit booking because these stocks were the first ones to try and move up higher. When the index consolidates or looks set to consolidate, these stocks could see some bit of profit booking. Tata Motors has risen higher, Maruti has come back to the psychological resistance of 7700. Same is the case with Bajaj Auto. Hero MotoCorp has not performed as probably would have been expected or anticipated. The stock has best gone sideways in the last few weeks. When you see such signs, it generally indicates that largecap auto stocks can take a bit of a breather. Maruti can correct another 200 to 250 points spread over the next one to two weeks. Bajaj Auto can also drop by another 100 to 120 points and that should be the theme for the auto stocks individually. Tata Motors could probably be rising by another 10% from current levels as well.


What is your view on metal stocks? Metal stocks rallied and the metal index is up 5% for the week. How would largecap metal stocks do from here?So they should do reasonably well. In terms of sector behaviour, sector dynamics metals is the last of the sectors to try and pick a pace when the market overall is getting into a stable uptrend. We have seen a lot of the other sectors trying to move up first and metal has followed, Last week was remarkably very well poised for many of these auto stocks. Tata Steel came back and hit that 400 mark. Jindal Steel, JSW Steel and even the other smallcap or midcap names have made a very good comeback. Metal stocks are traditionally very high beta and they ride on high momentum. It is more speculative in short term because it has been fuelled by a lot of rise in the open interest. 

We have seen that happening for many of these metal stocks on Thursday and Friday as well. I believe on the back of that, metal stocks can sustain a rally and given the high beta nature of the stocks, they could rally 8-10% further from their closing prices last week.


Are you finding any PSUs looking interesting? You track a lot of these PSU names. The likes of Concor, BHEL, anything looking interesting and you can even take some of the PSU banking names if you have?PSU banking overall looks fairly good. Though Canara Bank, Bank of India corrected a bit on Friday, I still believe that the monthly charts are poised for a very strong upside. Similarly, largecap PSU banks like SBI also moved reasonably well, trading above the Rs 300 psychological mark. 

Among other PSUs, we have seen a very big volume push into stocks like BHEL, BEML and even Container Corporation (Concor) has seen a very good amount of open interest and delivery volume being built up in the last one to two weeks. It is more important because generally when you see a sector or the components of the sector seeing a very high amount of delivery volume and consistent buying, when the stocks correct they do not see too much volumes. That is a sign of long buyers who have fresh entered into a stock and want to stay put into the stock trend. I believe many of these stocks would go into a very strong upside which should be visible over the next one to three months.


Any two or three picks that you have for our viewers.Two picks – first one is a buy on Jindal Steel. It is more of a high momentum stock. We have seen good amount of open interest getting built up last week. Buy with a target of Rs 135; keep stop loss in Rs 115 range. 

The second pick is interesting because this is more of a positional buy. It is a buy on Balrampur Chini and the stock is looking absolutely fabulous on the longer term charts as well as across all timeframes – monthly, weekly as well as on the daily timeframe. That would suggest a positional buy with an immediate target of Rs 176 and stop loss to be kept closer to Rs 159."

22,2019-11-08,JSW,"BENGALURU: A global steelmaker is considering investing $4 billion (Rs 28,000 crore) to set up a plant in India and is in preliminary discussions with the Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat governments for the proposed project. The company plans to set up a 4 million tonne per annum steel plant in the near term and progressively take it up to 12 million tonnes, according to officials. Building a 1 million tonne capacity requires an investment of $1 billion.

The company’s India plans are part of its strategy to diversify its steel mills across the world, the officials said, requesting anonymity because the discussions are in a preliminary stage.

Ballari district in Karnataka is the company’s preferred location for the plant because the region has abundant deposits of high-grade iron ore, a key steel-making ingredient, and is home to steel, sponge iron and pellet units. The JSW Group has a steel mill of 12 MTPA capacity in the district.

The Karnataka government will do its best to facilitate investments in the steel sector as it would add thousands of jobs, state industries minister Jagadish Shettar told ET. The government will meet investor needs as per the state’s industrial policy, he said.

Karnataka has banned the export of iron ore and has been encouraging investments in facilities that use iron ore as the main input. The state government, however, will have to meet the company’s needs in terms of land, water and help with iron ore supply.

While the steel giant is said to be keen on its proposed investment, projects of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest producer, and Uttam Galva (Brahmani Steel), have not progressed after land in Ballari district was allotted to them.

The global steelmaker is also evaluating potential areas in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. Steelmakers prefer to set up their plants close to sea ports or iron ore mines. Proximity to ports helps in the import of iron ore and export of finished products.

Industry experts peg local demand for iron ore in Ballari region at about 32 MTPA. The Supreme Court capped production at 28 MTPA in 2014, with NMDC accounting for half of the output. Setting up a new steel mill in the region would be possible only if iron ore production can be increased or the raw material is imported.

A lot may also depend on how Karnataka deals with a request of JSW Steel to register its land in Sandur taluk of the district. The government is yet to take a decision on the land sale deed. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had campaigned against the Sajjan Jindal-controlled steel behemoth during the previous JD(S)-Congress regime."

Anand Mahinda, Chairman of Mahindra Group, tweeted that he salutes the five judges of the Supreme Court for showing ""extraordinary courage"".

""5 men. A decision that 1.3bn people were awaiting. What extraordinary courage it required to be on this bench & what incredible application of mind it must have taken to reach the conclusion. I salute them for doing their duty & upholding the process of justice in our nation,"" he tweeted.

In a unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court's five-judge bench asked the government to allot a five-acre plot in a ""prominent"" location in the holy town of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh for constructing a new mosque.

The disputed 2.77-acre plot will for now remain with a central government receiver, who will hand it over to a government-created trust that must be created within three months. The trust will be tasked with the construction of the temple.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said: ""This is a welcome decision of the Supreme Court which has been taken unanimously by the court. This decision has led to the end of decades old legal issue"".

The minister appealed people to accept the SC order and maintain peace and tranquility. This historic decision of the Supreme Court will further strengthen the culture, tradition and unity.

""I thank the judiciary, all organisation, society and people who were involved in resolving the matter,"" Goyal said.

On the verdict, Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted, ""We should respect Court verdict on Ayodhya maintaining peace and restrain"".
IFFCO Managing Director U S Awasthi in a tweet said, ""Welcoming the 5 bench apex Supreme Court order of giving the disputed land to Hindus for the #RamMandir and giving the alternate land 5acre land to Muslims. A good peaceful resolution to the entire issue. Let's maintain the peace & harmony"".

Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur, while welcoming the historic judgement, in a tweet said that Ram is symbol of maryada (dignity), religion and patience. The Supreme Court verdict has kept interest of everyone in mind and it is rationale and just, he said adding he welcomes the judgement from bottom of his heart.

He further said this is the beginning of a new era and there is a need to portray an image of India that is united. The government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is committed to the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and taking everyone along, Thakur said.

Industry body PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the Supreme Court verdict going forward will harness communal harmony in the world's largest democracy and will lead to the holistic growth and development of the country.

Congratulating each citizen of India, PHD Chamber President D K Aggarwal said ""this is a win-win verdict for all"".

Decades-old dispute has finally found its closure, JSW Steel CMD Sajjan Jindal said.

""The Supreme Court and the bench must be admired for their unanimity in arriving at a measured judgement that ensures that communities move forward respectfully and work towards a more united nation,"" Jindal said."

26,2019-11-14,JSW,"Mumbai: Halfway through the quarterly earnings season, corporate report cards have largely managed to beat Dalal Street’s expectations on the profitability front, with commentaries also turning positive. 

This has led to expectations that better times could be ahead in terms of earnings, and there could be more upgrades compared with downgrades on the earnings front.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) in a report pointed out that among the 92 MOFSL universe and 28 Nifty companies that have announced earnings till November 2, sales for the Nifty companies have degrown at (-) 0.6 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, while Ebitda has expanded 9.1 per cent and net profit 12.4 per cent against MOFSL’s estimates of (-) 0.4 per cent, 1.7 per cent and (-) 1.8 per cent YoY growth, respectively.

Excluding corporate-focused private banks, Nifty sales, Ebitda and profit growth stood at (-) 1.6 per cent, 4 per cent and 11.3 per cent YoY versus MOFSL’s estimates of -1.2 per cent, (-) 0.6 per cent and (-) 0.7 per cent YoY, respectively.

Of the 28 Nifty companies that have announced results, 21 surpassed, three missed and three met MOFSL’s expectations on the profit front. On the Ebitda front, nine companies surpassed, 4 missed and 14 met expectations.


Companies that have surpassed expectations on the profit front included JSW Steel, SBI, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, ICICI Bank and ITC, among others.




Guest contributor and other agencies 
“While aggregate earnings have been in line with estimates, commentaries are turning incrementally positive, especially on the consumption front,” MOFSL said.

“The reduction in corporate tax has largely resulted in better-than-expected profit delivery and restricted the pace of earnings downgrades. This, combined with various government announcements to revive the troubled sectors, has helped revive market sentiment,” it added.

Corporate earnings so far have beat expectations, helping the market stay upbeat and scale record highs amid optimism on the US-China trade deal, analysts said.

 “It’s an exp ectation beat for sure,” said Vinod Karki, Head of Strategy at ICICI Securities. “If you look at the earnings upgrade-downgrade scenario, it would seem there are more upgrades or neutrals compared with downgrades. This means the consensus was more pessimistic about corporate earnings,” Karki said.

For the MOFSL universe, though, the earnings upgrade-downgrade ratio has been balanced so far, with 31 MOFSL universe companies witnessing upgrades of more than 3 per cent and 29 seeing downgrades of more than 3 per cent, indicating a revival in the earnings momentum.

“However, things are not as bad as consensus was expecting. This is reflecting in the market as well. The earnings season has helped support the market,” he said."

30,2019-11-21,JSW,"One-off deferred tax gain supported bottom lines for much of India Inc during the September quarter. But that should not take away credit from those which managed to grow bottom lines on the strength of top line expansion.

September quarter earnings season broadly turned out to be better than expected, which took BSE benchmark Sensex to its record high mark. Sensex scaled a fresh all-time high of 40,676 amid the ongoing earnings season.

This was one of the better earnings seasons anytime in last three or four years, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Adviser.

“A number of companies have beaten Street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because we had the tax cuts in the middle of the quarter. A lot of companies adjusted that in the second quarter,” he said.

For instance, despite a drop in top line, Tata Steel reported a 6 per cent increase in consolidated net for the quarter at Rs 3,302 crore, thanks to the new tax regime.

JSW Steel posted 22 per cent rise in consolidated net profit, mainly due to a writeback of deferred taxes and accrued incentives from previous years. But the company’s revenue from operations actually declined 18.5 per cent to Rs 17,572 crore from Rs 21,552 crore a year ago.

But Mavani also points out that going by pre-tax profit or Ebitda number, a large number of companies also managed to grow on their own, actually showing margin expansions that beat Street expectations.

Data available with Ace Equity on November 6 showed 71 firms listed on BSE as largecap, midcap or smallcap reported over 100 per cent rise in net profit in Q2.

Even some of them like Dr Reddy’s Lab reported over 100 per cent expansion in net profit despite a 25 per cent rise in Q2 revenue. Others like SBI reported manifold rise in bottom line due to a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

SBI posted nearly six-fold rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter, supported by a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

Bottomline of the public sector lender grew 485 per cent to Rs 3,375 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576 crore in the same period last year. Gujarat Gas, GSK Pharma, Indian Bank, Jindal Saw, NIIT, JK Tyre, Deepak Nitrite, Motilal Oswal Finanical Services, Bank of Maharasthtra and Avani Feeds were among other major players that reported over 100 per cent profit growth in Q2.



Besides one-time tax gains, other income, improving asset quality and corporate-related actions supported bottom lines of select companies during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services reported 3,297 per cent profit growth at Rs 142.3 crore in September quarter against a Rs 4.5 crore in the year-ago period, while Indian Bank reported Rs 359 crore profit on increasing income and improving asset quality by controlling loan slippages and other factors, a top bank official said.

A sharp drop in provisions for loan writeoffs in the home finance arm during the quarter supported the bottom line of the Mumbai-based firm. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said a strong momentum was seen in the market is due to healthy Q2 earnings from big corporates. “This positivity is likely to stay in the short to medium term as concerns of the market are fading with tax cut,” he said.

Out of top 71, five players reported over 100 per cent sales growth, 25 others posted 10 to 70 per cent increase sales. Others reported up to 10 per cent rise or fall in net sales during the quarter.

Some 73 firms from across sectors such as consumer food, TV broadcasting, banking, NBFC, plastic products, power generation and engineering, among others, reported 50 to 100 per cent bottom line expansion.

The list included players like Multi Commodity Exchange, Bandhan Bank, SRF, GTPL Hathaway, Kukuyo Camlin, Varun Beverages, EIH, Petronet LNG, PSP Projects, Torrent Power, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, UltraTech Cement and Aarti Drugs.



“Corporate earnings have been subdued or below expectations over the past few years. However, we are starting to see a revival in corporate earnings growth, and expect it to pick up pace from H2FY20. This will help to drive the markets going forward,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

He said the recent corporate tax cut would provide a boost to corporate earnings over time. “We believe a bottom-up research-oriented process, coupled with growth at reasonable price (GARP) approach will help deliver superior returns over the long term,” he said."
31,2019-11-21,JSW,"New Delhi: Presence of more companies in the market will lead to more innovations, quality and R&D activities, said domestic steel players on Thursday while reacting to the entry of global steel giant ArcelorMittal in India. ""We don't see ArcelorMittal as a challenge,"" JSW Steel Chairman Sajjan Jindal told on the sidelines of the ISA Steel Conclave here. 

 More number of players, more the research & development (R&D) activities, innovations, quality in the market, he added reacting to a question how will the ArcelorMittal's entry benefit the consumers. 

 Jindal Steel and Power Chairman Naveen Jindal said, ""We see its (ArcelorMittal's) entry as a positive step."" 

 Tata Steel Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee also said there should be competition in the market. 

 Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) Chairman A K Chaudhary said, ""ArcelorMittal's entry will promote healthy competition in market."" 

 The industry looks forward to work with them in future, he added. 

 Last week, the Supreme Court paved the way for ArcelorMittal's takeover of debt-ridden Essar Steel for Rs 42,000 crore and set aside the July 4 NCLAT order giving equal status to financial creditors and operational creditors. 

 Following the verdict, ArcelorMittal said it expects to complete the acquisition of the debt-ridden company by the end of this year. 

 Essar Steel was auctioned under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to recover Rs 54,547 crore of unpaid dues of financial lenders and operational creditors."
32,2019-11-22,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: Indian boards are seem to be meeting slightly more frequently than they were earlier. The median number of meetings for 91 of the BSE 100 companies was seven in fiscal 2019, compared with six in FY18 as well as five years earlier in FY15, as per data from Bloomberg. Five was the most common number for board meetings held by the companies in the year ended March 31, 2019.

Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have a higher frequency of board meetings. The median number for the 16 PSUs in BSE100 index was 13, compared with 11 in FY15. Coal India topped the list with 21 board meetings in the last fiscal year ended March 31. The company’s board had met seven times in FY15.

Incidentally, the sitting fees for independent directors of PSUs is Rs 40,000 - around one-third of the statutory limit of Rs 1 lakh. ICICI Bank is the only privatesector company on the list of top 10 companies, with 18 board meetings in FY19. The bank’s board had met seven times in FY15. Incidentally, a dozen companies have had a sharp year-on-year surge in the frequency of their board meetings in FY19. This list is dominated by banks, with ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank featuring among these dozen companies. Banks have been under increased scrutiny of the regulators and investors, warranting a higher engagement for their boards. Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Larsen & Toubro, HCL Technologies and REC are the other companies on this list.


Agencies
In the case of nearly half of the 91 companies, a positive correlation was found between the frequency of board meetings and their stock performance. The boards of companies that are performing well typically meet more frequently compared with the opposite group. For instance, pharma companies Cipla, Lupin and Sun Pharma have witnessed a gradual decline in the number of their board meetings over the past five years as industry headwinds pressed along. The board of Indiabulls Housing Finance met nine times five years ago, but only five times in FY19. Likewise, Piramal Enterprises had eight board meetings in FY18, but that dropped to five in FY19. Housing finance business has come under pressure in the recent years.

Ten of the BSE 100 companies have conducted only four meetings in FY19 - the minimum needed to comply with the Companies Act 2013. Most companies on this list, such as Godrej Consumer Products, Page Industries, Lupin, Hero MotoCorp, Bharat Forge and JSW Steel, have been under performing in the past couple of years. To be sure, the median frequency of board meetings in India Inc is akin to that in the US. As per the Spencer Stuart 2018 S&P 500 Board Index, the median number of board meetings was seven for the year ended May 2018. A majority of S&P 500 company boards met on an average of six-nine times annually."
33,2019-11-22,JSW,"KOLKATA: ArcelorMittal's entry into India through its Rs 42,000-crore acquisition of Essar Steel should ‘energise’ the domestic market, benefiting consumers in one of the world’s fastest-expanding economies that is building infrastructure to underpin its growth ambitions.

“With ArcelorMittal entering India, we expect the domestic steel market to become more competitive, and bring in more innovation and stability,” steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Thursday on the sidelines of a conclave in New Delhi. “This will ultimately help consumers.”

ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest producer of the alloy, is entering India at a time when the sector is going through a lean phase, facing a demand slump. Other steelmakers shared Pradhan’s sentiments about ArcelorMittal’s entry into India.

“Competition is good; it will keep us on our toes,” said Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Steel. Jindal said Indian steelmakers appear to have had a headstart in the local markets since they have been operating here for several years, with a good understanding of local needs.

ArcelorMittal’s presence will bring in new technology, and have a longer-term impact on prices and the steel product basket."
34,2019-11-24,JSW,"The government plans to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to provide immunity to companies taking over stressed assets from prosecution for financial crimes committed by erstwhile promoters.

This will help make the insolvency process more attractive for the bidders and instil confidence in them, sources said.

The government may move an amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 during the current Winter Session of Parliament.

The amendment comes after several companies that are vying for assets being auctioned under IBC expressed concern regarding getting into legal trouble over the cases against previous promoters.

In many of the cases under insolvency, the promoters are under investigation by various agencies, the sources said.

""We are working out a mechanism where the resolution applicant, who through this entire court supervised process is acquiring a stressed asset as a going concern, will not be encumbered by the criminal liability relating to the company which has been caused by the previous management,"" an official said.

A clear direction on this will not allow occurrence of cases like Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL).

Last month, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached BPSL's land, buildings, plant and machinery in Odisha worth more than Rs 4,000 crore in a case related to alleged diversion of bank funds, delaying the resolution process under which JSW Steel was set to take over the company.

Following the development, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) asked the ED and the corporate affairs ministry to reach a consensus on the issue of attachment of assets of BPSL.

While the ED is of the opinion that it can attach the property of BPSL under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ministry has been maintaining that the agency cannot do so as proceedings under the IBC are on."

Major trend of the Nifty is positive as declines are being bought into, but Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035, and then a lifetime high of 12103, according to technical analysts. They are bullish on HDFC, RBL Bank, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE, Maruti Suzuki and L&T.


Where are we: Nifty has been consolidating in a range of 250 points in between 11800 and 12038 zones from last 16 trading sessions. It witnessed some profit booking from higher levels in last two sessions but forming Doji candles for third consecutive week, indicating a tug of war between Bulls and Bears. However major trend of the index is positive as declines are being bought into but requires a decisive range breakout with follow up action to commence the next leg of rally.


What is in store: Now Nifty has to continue to hold above 11850 zones to witness an up move towards 12035 then life time high of 12103 while on the downside major support exists at 11800-11780 zones. Bank Nifty is outperforming from last couple of weeks and till the time it sustains above 30800 mark, we maintain our positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31500 then 31783 zones while next support below 30800 is placed at 30500-30300 zones.

What traders can do: Nifty has got stuck in a range where declines are bought but follow up is missing so better to use Bull Call Spread or Call Ladder Spread with the view that positive to range bound bias could continue. Aggressive option traders can do the short strangle or Call writing to get the benefit of time decay. On stocks, we have a positive view on HDFC, Bosch, Eicher Motors, RBL Bank, Exide Industries, JSW Steel, Jindal Steel, Grasim, ZEE while weakness is likely in Infosys, TCS, Petronet and Havells."

51,2019-11-28,JSW,"Kolkata: Domestic steel prices could increase by over Rs 1,000 per tonne in December, the first rise in six months, propped up by a strong revival in international prices and improvement in demand from infrastructure and housing sectors, according to industry executives.

“We are seeing signs of an improvement in demand since November and this has given us scope for price correction. However, we would prefer to calibrate the prices in step with a gradual recovery in demand,” said a top marketing executive of a steel manufacturer based in eastern India.

The sentiment was echoed by more executives working in other steel mills in the country. “Major steel players are looking at a moderate price recovery of Rs 1,000-1,500 per tonne in December on the back of a small price correction last month,” said a senior executive of a Mumbaiheadquartered steelmaker.

The October-March period traditionally represents two strong quarters for the steel industry, as construction activity generally picks up in the post-monsoon period. “This year, in addition to the seasonal impact on steel demand, a major contributing factor is the improvement in global prices by almost $40/ tonne. With a weak exchange rate, this translates into a higher price increase at home. However, domestic prices are yet to improve in tandem, since demand, though improving, is yet to catch up,” one of the executives cited earlier said.


An increase in price will improve the prospects of medium and large steel firms, including Tata Steel, Tata Steel BSL, JSW Steel, Essar Steel, Steel Authority of India and JSPL. Prices have been falling since May due to sluggish demand from infrastructure and construction sectors, and drop in orders from the slowdown-hit auto sector.

Benchmark global prices are based on rates of key flat steel items like hot rolled coils (HRC) which go into making of automobiles, consumer durables and construction materials. From a high of Rs 44,000 per tonne, HRC prices had plunged to, what industry executives termed as “unsustainable”, levels of Rs 34,000 per tonne."

On the weekly chart, the Nifty has formed a small bullish candle and if it crosses and sustains above 12100-12150 levels, then it could witness buying towards 12300-12400 levels, according to technical analysts. They are positive on stocks such as ITC, UltraTech, TCS, Hero Motocorp, Apollo Tyres, Federal Bank and Mindtree.


Where Are We: The Nifty last week witnessed high volatility and closed below the 12100 levels and formed a bearish candlestick on the daily chart. On the weekly charts the index has formed a stiff resistance at 12150 levels with upper shadows which indicate exhaustion in momentum. The index faces immediate resistance at 12100-12150 levels on the upside and needs to close above this for a continuation of the uptrend. The Bank Nifty has shown early signals of decline in momentum as there is a series of divergence on the intraday charts.


What Is In Store: The Nifty on the daily charts indicates some consolidation as the support zone is at 11850-11800 levels and resistance is at the 12100-12150 zone. The prices have declined from its overbought levels and could move in the near term towards 11,850-11,800 levels. The Bank Nifty faces immediate resistance around the 32,100 levels and the price patterns indicate strong support clusters around the 31,700-31,600 levels on the downside which is likely to provide cushion in the case of a decline. The momentum would turn positive only above 32,150. Till then expect some correction towards the 31,600 levels.


What Should Investors Do: The metal sector is bouncing from its oversold levels. Expect Hindalco, Tata Steel and JSW Steel to see an upside of 10 per cent in the short term. The IT sector is likely to continue its underperformance in the near term. PVR and Godrej Consumer Products are likely to see a momentum rally of 10-15 per cent in the short term and and buy-on-dips strategy is recommended."
1,2019-12-02,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 11 points, or 0.09 per cent, lower at 12,090, indicating a tepid start for Dalal Street. Here are a few stocks which may buzz the most in today’s trade:

4,2019-12-02,JSW,"BHUBANESHWAR: The Odisha government has decided to cancel and postpone India’s most anticipated auctions of iron ore mines by about a month - saving it from charges of cartelisation and restrictive practices. 

The decision was taken after Adani group and ArcelorMittal, who participated in the first of two rounds of auctions, complained against JSW’s decision to bid for the largest block through half a dozen subsidiaries. 

Senior officials of Naveen Patnaik’s government spent the weekend holding a series of meetings to save these high-stake auctions of the first lot of working mines in the country which had seen overwhelming response. 

“It’s unfortunate that the company decided to abuse a loophole in the model bid document. We’ve decided to improve the conditions, and taking a cue from the model bid documents for coal auctions we are barring subsidiaries, affiliates and associates from participating in auctions of the same block,” said a senior government official. He described the decision, taken after several meetings through the weekend, as “painful” but the only one that will hopefully avoid lengthy litigation.

Letters of intent earlier expected to be granted to the highest bidder by January will now be signed in February. 

Odisha, home to more than half the country’s iron ore production, is inviting bids for 50-year mining rights to twenty mines in two phases. These are among the more than 300 mines lapsing on 31 March 2020 as India transitions to a strict regime of auctions for mining licenses. 

What the Centre and the state government were hoping to avoid, as India transitions to a regime of auctions for mining licenses, was a disruption in raw material supply to the steel sector. Having received an overwhelming 177 bids for the first set of ten mines, Odisha had already decided to postpone phase two - of another ten working mines. 

Among the first lot was the massive 767.284 ha Nuagaon deposit with reserves of 792.93 million tonne, larger than all other iron ore deposits on offer A net worth criterion of Rs 3872 crore had disqualified the incumbent lessee KJS Ahluwalia. Of the fifteen technical bids received for Nuagaon, six were from companies or subsidiaries of the Sajjan Jindal led JSW Group - JSW Steel, JSW Raigarh, JSW Bengal Steel, JSW Jharkhand Steel, JSW Utkal Steel, and Amba River Coke. 

Elder brother Prithvi Raj Jindal’s Jindal SAW and younger brother Naveen Jindal’s Jindal Steel and Power and its subsidiary, Jindal Power, are also in the run. 

This upset competition, including Arcelor Mittal’s recently incorporated AM Mining and Adani Power Resource, who complained to the state government that this was unethical and unfair said company officials on condition of anonymity, even if the rules did not specifically bar subsidiaries from participating. 

Half of the highest bidders of the technical round make it to the second phase of forward bidding. “This clustering of bids amounts to restrictive practices, which put other bidders at a disadvantage and will reduce the potential revenue of the state,” said an Adani official who asked not to be named. 

An email seeking comments from JSW did not elicit a response. 

Other bidders included Tata Steel’s TS Alloys, Vedanta, Aditya Birla Group’s Essel Mining and Industries and India’s largest private iron ore miner Rungta Mines. 

An awkward precedent for the mines department however is its successful auction of the Saruabil Chrome mine that was bagged by TS Alloys, a Tata Steel subsidiary quoting 88.5 percent (or the value of per tonne ore it would pay the state) to beat, amongst others, Tata Steel. This could be cited by JSW if it chooses to challenge the state’s decision in court. 

“We have not received any complaints yet about that auction. If we cancel that, what is the guarantee the government gets such a high premium again. We will cross that bridge when we come to it,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named. 

In the past JSW had contested Tata Steel’s participation in auctions – on grounds that it already exceeded an area limit capping mineral rights. This led to Odisha to withhold auctions for more than a year until the centre finally agreed to a fivefold increase in their cap - now set at 48 sq kilometres."
12,2019-12-03,JSW,"Kolkata: JSW Steel has set a target of supplying 1.5 lakh tonne of TMT Rebars to metro rail projects across the country in FY2019-20, compared to an annual average of one lakh tonne in the past few years. The company supplied more than 30,000 metric tonnes of JSW Neosteel TMT Rebars for construction of Metro projects in various Indian cities in the last two months. With this, its overall supplies of the Rebars for metro construction projects has crossed 85,000 tonnes in the current financial year, which is more than half of its target for the current fiscal.

JSW Steel, part of the JSW Group, is supplying to metro rail projects in Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Indore, Bhopal, Lucknow & Ahmedabad. The ongoing supplies, as well as those already completed during the current fiscal, will boost JSW Steel’s supplies to Metro rail projects by more than Rs 600 crore following successful completion of these deliveries. The company bagged these metro rail orders through key (engneering procurement construction) EPC partners with ongoing supply arrangements. The various metro rail projects are expected to cumulatively add over 760 kilometre of urban rail transit lines to India’s fast expanding metro network.

Commenting on it, Jayant Acharya, Director – Commercial, Marketing & Corporate Strategy for JSW Steel said: “Over the last few months, we have completed large supplies of high grade JSW Neosteel TMT Rebars to these Metro Rail Projects and continue to stay on track to service the ongoing order pipeline.""

Metro construction activities are being undertaken in a big way in India including expansion of existing metro network with respective state governments having cumulatively earmarked more than US$ 50 billion to construct the current phase of over 760 km of metro lines. These rail-based ‘Mass Rapid Transit Systems’ have been widely accepted as a solution for most of traffic and pollution related problems being faced in major cities across the world."

13,2019-12-04,JSW,"MUMBAI: Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s ArcelorMittal has approached the government seeking immunity from likely future investigations pertaining to Essar Steel and its erstwhile promoters, the Ruia family, four people familiar with the matter told ET.

Mittal wants to avoid a recurrence of any controversy akin to the one involving Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL), when the Enforcement Directorate attached the firm’s assets after it was acquired by JSW Steel from the National Company Law Tribunal.

ArcelorMittal has told government officials and ministers that any future or ongoing probe into past dealings of the Ruia family should not impact the assets of Essar Steel. The steel giant has reached out to the home, finance, law and defence ministries, according to one of the persons. “ArcelorMittal has held talks with several ministers and civil servants, and has received a positive reply,” said a person aware of the developments. 

“It has been a long battle for the Mittals, and this is their way of preventing future troubles after they transfer money to the banks. ArcelorMittal is very clear it doesn’t want any ambiguity around any present or future liabilities,” the person said.

ArcelorMittal declined to comment. Questionnaires sent to the four ministries did not elicit a response till press time Tuesday.



Essar Steel was admitted to the bankruptcy court in June 2017 and several bidders showed interest, including ArcelorMittal, which finally bagged the asset after numerous legal and procedural twists and turns. ArcelorMittal wants legal clarity from the government before it transfers money into the escrow account.

“Banks are yet to receive the money, but they are hopeful it will come in before the end of the month, which will help bump up their December quarter earnings,” another person, requesting anonymity.

Mittal’s worries stem from the BPSL case, where the ED attached assets of the company after it was taken over by JSW Steel. The agency was investigating the Singal family, the former promoters of BPSL, on charges of money laundering.

In October, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) came down heavily on the ED and directed it to release BPSL’s assets. “You are going to kill the economy of the country... (You are) playing with fire,” the NCLAT bench headed by Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya told the agency. “No outsider will come and purchase (distressed companies)... IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) cannot be annulled in this manner. Money laundering is by an individual,” it said.

The Supreme Court last month reinforced the supremacy of the committee of creditors and financial lenders in deciding the payment schedule for creditors in bankruptcy cases, clearing the decks for ArcelorMittal’s purchase of Essar Steel.

Lenders will recover almost 92% of the Rs 54,500-crore owed to them by Essar Steel. Operational creditors will receive Rs 1,196 crore. Banks, which have made provisions of 50-100% for Essar Steel, will not only be able to improve provision coverage ratios but also consider write-backs that will boost profits."

22,2019-12-05,JSW,"ET Intelligence Group: The correction in steel stocks over the past two days is likely an overreaction to a delay in trade deals involving the world’s two biggest economies. Given the favourable valuations and fundamentals, this might be an opportunity to buy.

JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Jindal Steel & Power and state-owned SAIL corrected more than 5 per cent in the past two days after US President Donald Trump’s announcement on a likely delay in trade talks with China. But contrary to this, domestic steel players have taken a 2-3 per cent price increase on Monday. Global steel prices are also up 3.5 per cent. Domestic steel players hiked prices by 2-3 per cent in the beginning of November too and have the headroom for another 2-3 per cent.

In the past five weeks, Indian steel prices are up 5-6 per cent, as compared to this global steel prices are up 9-11 per cent. Imported steel price after including duties are near Rs 37,000 per ton, Indian Steel prices are at Rs 36,000 per ton, thus allowing more headroom for future price hikes.



As compared to this, the prices of raw materials including iron ore and coking coal have corrected sharply. Global iron ore prices have fallen 10 per cent since early October and are down more than 30 per cent from their peak in 2019. While Tata Steel has captive iron ore, other players depend on domestic supply of iron ore mainly from NMDC. But more importantly, international coking coal prices are down nearly 30 per cent from the 2019 peak, which benefits all four players.

The benefit of this will be seen from December quarter onwards due to the lag effect. The global demand supply situation for steel is also improving, especially in China.

On the global supply side, China production declined in October for the first time since the end of 2017 driven by production curbs. China’s demand indicator for steel on the other hand showed a mixed trend with vehicle sales declining but demand from residential floor space and appliances improved.

Shares of JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power and SAIL are trading at FY21 estimated 5.7, 6.1, 5.2 and 6 times EV by EBIDTA. This is attractive, given that the cycle is in an upswing."
21,2019-12-05,JSW,"MUMBAI: The Rs 1 crore-plus club of independent directors rose over fourfold to 89 in FY19 from 21 in FY13, according to market tracking firm Prime Database, as companies sought to attract board members from a dwindling pool of such candidates.

There were 43 independent directors who earned more than Rs 1 crore from a single company even as the government has been looking to cap their remuneration to ensure impartiality. Companies that gave over Rs 1 crore to a single independent director included Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Holdings & Investment, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, HCL Technologies, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Infosys, Reliance Industries, Tata Chemicals, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Elxsi, Tata Steel, Tech Mahindra, United Breweries and Wipro.

While higher compensation is believed to impact the independence of directors, experts said limiting compensation will make it more difficult for companies to attract qualified people when the pool is already shrinking due to increased liabilities they could face.

“Any kind of limit on the independent directors pay will not serve the purpose of attracting talented people,” said JN Gupta, managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services, a proxy advisory firm. “It should be commensurate with the effort, time and commitment.”

The 10 highest-earning independent directors in FY19 included former State Bank of India chairman OP Bhatt (on boards of companies including HUL and TCS), former Blackstone Group chief Punita Sinha (JSW Steel, Infosys), former director general of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research RA Mashelkar (Reliance Industries, Piramal Enterprises), former Securities and Exchange Board of India chief M Damodaran (Larsen & Toubro, InterGlobe Aviation) and former McKinsey partner Ireena Vittal (Housing Development Finance Corp, Tata Global Beverages), according to Prime Database.

The compensation of the 89 directors ranged from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore, according to the data based on 492 of the Nifty 500 companies for which annual reports were available for 2018-19. There were 72 independent directors in this category in FY18.

“Most of the companies paying above a crore to a single director are large ones. Smaller companies are still facing the challenge of attracting good people,” said Pranav Haldea, MD of Prime Database.

In the US, a top independent director would earn between $250,000 (Rs 1.8 crore) and $1 million, experts said.

“If compared with global benchmarks, a crore being given to an independent director in India is not excessive and is unlikely to make him/her feel obligated to the management,” said Arun Duggal, chairman of credit rating company ICRA and an experienced independent director. Also, as long as the director’s renumeration is one-fourth of the CEO’s compensation, it is fair, Duggal added.

The average pay of MDs and CEOs of companies in FY19 was about Rs 6.5 crore, according to an ET analysis of salaries of CEOs, excluding promoters.

The average take-home remuneration of independent directors, including sitting fees and commissions, increased 7% to Rs 19.04 lakh in FY19 from Rs 17.83 lakh in FY18, according to Prime Database.



“The new Companies Act has put more onus and accountability on the independent directors and as a result, their number has shrunk. Companies have no choice but to pay more,” said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern.

According to the law, independent directors can be paid up to Rs 1 lakh as sitting fees per board meeting. Companies have the flexibility to pay more as commission. The total commission paid to independent directors in a company can be as much as 1% of its profit. The data showed that the top 100 directors accounted for as much as 36.47% of the total remuneration paid to independent directors in 2018-19."

32,2019-12-06,JSW,"NEW DELHI: A host of battered stocks have seen sharp rallies from their 52-week lows in recent weeks. Analysts said while some of these stocks have risen on prospects of high risk-reward, others have gained on value buying as investors judged the prevailing concerns as overdone.

Data compiled from corporate database Ace Equity showed 127 of BSE200 stocks have hit their one-year lows this quarter (October-December). Out of them, nearly half have climbed over 20 per cent, 35 have risen over 30 per cent and 16 stocks have rallied 50 per cent within a small timeframe. 

Shares of Vodafone Idea have zoomed 196.55 per cent from their 52-week low of Rs 2.6 hit on November 15. YES Bank has climbed 117 per cent over its 52-week low of Rs 29.10 (hit on October 1). Corporation Bank has rallied 90.44 per cent from its October 15 low. Stocks such as Reliance Power, Coffee Day Enterprises, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Edelweiss Financial Services have gained 87 per cent, 83 per cent, 73 per cent, 68 per cent and 66 per cent, respectively. 

Girish Pai of Nirmal Bang said that the situation has come to a place where it seems Vodafone Idea is going to survive for a few more years. This was against a bankruptcy-like situation earlier, he said. “That is what the stock price indicates,” he told ETNOW. 

Edelweiss Securities says YES Bank looks like a high risk-return potential candidate, as its base case shows the bank is here to stay, braving the known and unknown challenges and a temporary lull in earnings.

In the case of Indiabulls Housing, CLSA has revised its price target to Rs 450 from Rs 350 as the recent clarity in court case pertaining to the company's alleged irregularities in books would provide some relief to the company.

DLF, RBL Bank, UCO Bank, Bharti Infratel are other BSE200 stocks that have rallied 40-65 per cent from their respective 52-week lows. 

In a study, Elara Capital found that only three of the top 10 good performing Nifty stocks of last one month have been consistent performers on a three-month, six-month and year-to-date basis.

The median beta of top 10 performers of 2019 has increased from 1.03 to 1.41, suggesting that the market is shifting toward 'value' and ‘high-beta’ stocks.

Elara Capital says it is a sign of the market broadening from the narrow set of ‘high quality’ performers. It expects the trend to continue among Nifty50 stocks and more broadly across the broader market.

“After hanging on to quality for several months, year-to-date trends have started accommodating turnaround performers. However, the trend over the past month shows that the market is moving toward companies with lower sales growth, higher capital intensity and higher leverage, primarily due to the presence of metals (JSW Steel & Tata Steel) and telecom (Bharti Airtel & Bharti Infratel) among top 10 performers,” it said."
33,2019-12-06,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday asked the Enforcement Directorate to file a final affidavit containing developments related to attachment of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd assets.

A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya also asked the ED to clarify about its role after the attachment of assets of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL).

The appellate tribunal was hearing a batch of petitions, including one filed by JSW Steel, against the attachment of BPSL assets.

""ED would file the final affidavit giving the developments, which have taken place,"" the tribunal said.

The NCLAT has directed to list the matter on December 12 for the next hearing.

It would hear the BPSL case along with other matters, which involves a similar issue.

The ED and Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) are at loggerheads over the attachment of the assets of the debt-ridden firm by the former over the money allegedly siphoned off by the erstwhile promoters of BPSL, which is presently going through insolvency resolution process.

The ED comes under the Finance Ministry. At present, Nirmala Sitharaman is holding both finance and corporate affairs portfolios.

While the ED is of the opinion that it can attach the property of BPSL under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the MCA has been maintaining that the ED cannot do so as proceedings under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code was on.

Earlier, on October 25, the NCLAT had asked both organisations, which are presently headed by Sitharaman, to settle the matter adding that there was no question of amendment of laws.

""It is desirable if the two wings/ departments of the central government sit together and settle the issue,"" it said.

On October 10, the ED had attached assets worth over Rs 4,025 crore of debt-ridden BPSL in connection with its money laundering probe linked to an alleged bank loan fraud by its former promoters of BPSL.

JSW Steel, which has emerged as a successful bidder for BPSL with its bid of Rs 19,700 crore, filed an appeal against ED's move before the NCLAT, which had on October 14 directed them to be immediately released in favour of the resolution professional of the debt-ridden firm.

Earlier, on October 14, the NCLAT had directed the ED to release BPSL properties attached by the agency on the JSW Steel plea, alleging siphoning off of funds by its erstwhile promoters.

On this, the ED filed an affidavit before the NCLAT questioning its jurisdiction.

In the said affidavit, the ED told the appellate tribunal that it has no jurisdiction over the properties attached by the agency under the PMLA and asked it to vacate its earlier order and dismiss the appeal filed by JSW Steel.

The validity of the attachment could be examined by an adjudicating authority only under the PMLA, and hence the NCLAT should vacate its order passed on October 14, directing it to release the assets of BPSL, the ED told the NCLAT.

""It is submitted that the provisional attachment order dated October 10, 2019 passed under Section 5 of PMLA Act is not amenable to the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble tribunal (NCLAT) and its validity can only be examined by the adjudicating authority under Section 8 of the PMLA,"" the ED had said in an affidavit filed before the appellate court.

""There is no power under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to interfere with a provisional attachment order passed,"" it had said."
34,2019-12-06,JSW,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has allowed JSW Steel's appeal against certain clauses pertaining to liabilities and receivables in the National Company Law Tribunal’s order approving its resolution plan for ailing steel company Vardhman Industries Ltd (VIL).

“The company had preferred an appeal before NCLAT challenging certain portions of NCLT orders, and the judgment on the same has been pronounced on December 4, 2019, allowing the said appeal of JSW,” JSW Steel said in a notification to the stock exchanges on Thursday.

While the notification said “the company is yet to receive the copy of the NCLAT order for appropriate action”, some people aware of the matter said the appellate tribunal has upheld JSW Steel’s contention.

If JSW Steel’s contention is upheld, the steelmaker will have moved closer to completing its acquisition of Ludhiana-based VIL, which was referred for insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act last year."

36,2019-12-09,JSW,"MUMBAI: The Centre is set to alter the insolvency code to shield new owners of bankrupt companies from criminal liabilities pertaining to the time when the entities were controlled by the outgoing promoters, three people familiar with the matter told ET.

The Cabinet is likely to approve relevant changes to the three-year-old Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) at the earliest, they said.

“The government is expected to shortly seek Cabinet approval on amending the IBC that will give immunity to assets bought through the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) route,” said one of the three cited above.

“This will bring much-needed confidence to buyers of distressed assets, acquirers who were otherwise wary about the over-reach of the investigative authorities.”



ET reported on December 4 that steel giant ArcelorMittal had approached the government seeking immunity from any future probes into Essar Steel or its erstwhile promoters, the Ruia family. Arcelor-Mittal won the bid for Essar Steel through the IBC resolution process.

Amendments to the IBC, which came into effect in December 2016, will require eventual parliamentary approval. The ongoing winter session of Parliament is scheduled to end on December 13.

Buyers of distressed assets have been a worried lot after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached assets of the Singal family, the erstwhile promoter, on charges of money laundering in the Bhushan Power & Steel case.

The ED had attached the assets of Bhushan Power & Steel around the time JSW Steel was looking to acquire the company.

The case saw the ED and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), the court of appeals in bankruptcies, debate which of the two had priority rights over the assets of an insolvent company.

In October, the NCLAT came down heavily on the ED and directed it to release the assets of Bhushan Power & Steel.

“You are going to kill the economy of the country... (You are) playing with fire,” the bench headed by NCLAT chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhyaya had told the directorate, ET reported on October 15. “No outsider will come and purchase (distressed companies)... IBC cannot be annulled in this manner. Money laundering is by an individual.”

Last month, India’s Supreme Court cleared billionaire Lakshmi Mittal’s ?42,000 crore bid to take over Essar Steel’s manufacturing complex at Hazira in Gujarat and settle outstanding debt. Essar Steel owes as much as ?54,550 crore to its lenders. But ArcelorMittal is awaiting clarity over amendments to the IBC before transferring money into the lenders’ escrow account.

A mail sent to the finance ministry and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) did not elicit any response.

While the details of the amendments are not fully known, experts said blanket immunity may be counter-productive in such cases and should come with a set of riders that ensure assets built through proceeds of crime are not legitimised. Across-the-board immunity could also encourage round-tripping.

“The same rule cannot apply to every situation and hence the government should carefully look at giving immunity in cases dealing with bankrupt companies: Otherwise, it may end up permitting the sale of assets gained through illegal routes,” said one of the people cited above. “The sovereign should have rights over such assets.”

However, another banker aware of the development said this cannot be an argument against providing immunity to the new buyer.

“Investigations similar to Bhushan Power and Steel will keep all potential buyers away. Even without the amendment, IBC had seen promoters attempting to buy their own companies, but that wasn’t allowed and deals could be scrutinised to make sure these transactions are above board,” he said."

43,2019-12-11,JSW,"MUMBAI: The economy may be slowing down, but not the entry into the ‘million dollar CEO club’, which saw a record 22 new members in FY19.

The number of CEOs earning a million-dollar (Rs 7 crore) salary annually surged to 146 from 124 in the previous year — an 18% jump. This is by far the best fiscal for the elite club in the last four years despite the falling rupee. The club with 119 members in FY16 had seen a marginal membership growth till FY18.

According to the annual study of CEO/CXO compensation in BSE 200 companies by EMA Partners, commissioned by TOI, the overall pay of the million dollar CEO club increased 14% to Rs 2,457 crore from last year’s Rs 2,158 crore, with the average CEO package at Rs 16.8 crore. For the study this year, the value of the rupee to the US dollar was taken at Rs 70. In the previous year, the threshold to the club was Rs 6.5 crore (the rupee to the dollar was pegged at Rs 65). So the cut-off in annual compensation — Rs 7 crore — required to figure in the elite million dollar CEO club got tougher this year.




The club features prominent promoter and professional CEOs such as Sun Group chairman Kalanithi Maran, who leads the group with a compensation of about Rs 88 crore, Hero MotoCorp CMD Pawan Munjal (Rs 80 crore), JSW Steel chairman Sajjan Jindal (Rs 69 crore), Larsen & Toubro CEO & MD S N Subrahmanyan (Rs 27 crore), Indiabulls Housing Finance VC & MD Gagan Banga (Rs 16 crore), Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan (Rs 11 crore), Marico MD & CEO Saugata Gupta (Rs 9 crore), among othersAmong the new entrants to the club, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh received the biggest jump of over 300% in compensation to Rs 17 crore in 2018-19, from about Rs 4 crore in the previous fiscal. 

Professional CEOs (85 of them) have clearly outpaced promoter CEOs (61), and this gap has only widened over the years. “Hiring a good CEO in India just got tougher as India Inc sees more exit barriers in place now in the form of short-term and long-term compensation,” said EMA Partners regional managing partner (Asia) K Sudarshan. He added that the numbers have risen in line with the deepening market.

Although the economy is facing a slowdown, Sudarshan said its effects will be more visible in terms of bonuses and commissions payable to CEOs. In any case, these are numbers for FY19, and the real impact of a slowdown will be seen in CEO salaries of FY20. Over the last few years, CEO salaries have come up for criticism in certain sections of society. Some leaders of India Inc have seen their annual compensations remain unchanged this year, such as the Marans, while for others it has come down, like in the case of Onkar Kanwar of Apollo Tyres. However, experts believe with growing demands on CEOs, the salary paid to the occupants of the corner office is justified. 

Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan, who is credited with bringing Maggi out of the crisis it faced a few years ago, said he does not entirely work for the salary that he earns. “It’s not that this (compensation) is going to influence the way in which I contribute. When you reach the level of a CEO, there are other reasons that inspire you to work. To me, pay has to reflect the skills to manage the complexity, the challenges, the accountability and the responsibility that a person carries,” he said. Narayanan said in the Indian context, the governance responsibilities in a publicly-listed company are quite high and thus if a CEO is being remunerated in consonance with the expectations of an organisation, then it is fair to give him/her whatever is deemed to be fair by that organisation. “Ultimately, you want CEOs to add value as well. One of the measures is the share price that they deliver for investors. Those who have delivered strongly on that at least have added value to somebody rather than just taking a salary. If the principles of accountability, responsibility, skill, talent and value addition are counted in and then people are paid, it’s fine,” said Narayanan.

Concurring with Narayanan,Marico MD & CEO Saugata Gupta said it’s not the money that attracts people to the post. “I want to leave a legacy behind. What drives me is the sheer adrenaline and the new learnings one gathers in this journey as CEO,” he said. Experts said if one were to look at broad benchmarking in the global context, the expectation from an emerging market player is high growth, and that clearly justifies the compensation CEOs get in India.

Sudarshan said the numbers no longer raise eyebrows and any attempt to stifle or muzzle compensation is not in the best interests of the organisation and its shareholders. What is a matter of concern for India Inc is the number of women at the top. Women CEOs form only 2% of the million dollar CEO list this year. “This continues to be a grave challenge and we are seeing that many companies are proactively taking steps to ensure diversity at all levels and we will hopefully see a big difference over a period of time. There’s no magic bullet for this issue,” said Sudarshan."
44,2019-12-11,JSW,"NEW DELHI: The cabinet approved amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to protect successful resolution applicants from criminal proceedings against offences committed by previous managements or promoters.

It also lowered the rating threshold for public sector banks to purchase high-rated pooled assets to BBB+ from “financially sound” nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) under the partial credit guarantee (PCG) scheme. Lowering the limit from AA will make more NBFCs and HFCs eligible for funds from banks.


MONETISING ROAD PROJECTS
It also approved the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plan to set up an Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) and monetise road projects. This will help speed up monetisation of working assets and attract more funds to the sector.


IBC AMENDMENTS
Ring-fencing successful bidders from offences committed by previous managements will speed up the resolution process by giving comfort to buyers of stressed assets.

ET had reported last week that Lakshmi Mittal’s ArcelorMittal, which has successfully bid for Essar Steel through the insolvency process, had sought immunity from any future investigations pertaining to the company and its erstwhile promoters, the Ruia family.

The changes will help the Rs 42,000-crore resolution offered by ArcelorMittal to go through. Worries on this count had risen after the Enforcement Directorate had attached assets worth Rs 4,000 crore in Odisha of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, a company undergoing insolvency resolution, in a case related to the alleged diversion of bank funds. This has delayed a Rs 19,700 crore insolvency resolution plan proposed by JSW Steel. Proposed changes will ensure investigations do not stall insolvency resolution.

Other amendments include measures to ensure that corporate debtors undergoing resolution continue as going concerns. Licences, permits, concessions, clearances etc. cannot be terminated, suspended or not renewed during the moratorium period.

They also propose a threshold for financial creditors to prevent frivolous triggering of corporate insolvency, ensuring that bankruptcy isn’t invoked for small amounts.

Amendments are expected to be introduced in the ongoing session of Parliament.

Changes are being made to streamline the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) and protection of lastmile funding, in a move that will help sectors such as real estate and infrastructure.

Experts say these amendments were badly needed. They will remove hurdles in the way of speedy resolution and also attract bidders. “Preservation of licences, permits, quotas etc, which are core to the business of insolvent companies, and ensuring that no criminal action can be taken for past violations of resolved companies, will make resolution easier and will also increase the realisation for all stakeholders,” said Manoj Kumar, partner and head, M&A and transactions, Corporate Professionals.


RELIEF FOR NBFCS, HFCS
Lowering of rating threshold will provide significant relief to liquidity-starved NBFCs and HFCs and follows representations from them and banks. Not much disbursement has happened under the PCG mechanism because of the high threshold.

The move will help otherwise solvent NBFCs or HFCs avoid the distress sale of assets.

“The proposed government guarantee support and resultant pool buyouts will help address NBFCs/HFCs resolve temporary liquidity or cash flow mismatch issues, and enable them to continue contributing to credit creation and providing last-mile lending to borrowers, spurring economic growth,” the government said in a release.

The move will also protect the financial system from any “adverse contagion effect” that may arise due to the failure of such entities, the government added. The scheme will remain open until June 30, 2020, or till assets worth Rs 1 lakh crore are bought. The finance minister has been empowered to extend the scheme by three months.


NHAI INVIT
Setting up an InvIT will allow the NHAI to monetise completed national highways. This will help keep the road-building effort going in view of the funds crunch and lack of private investment.

Highway projects will be bundled to form special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to be offered to investors. The SPV will then be traded on stock exchanges and returns will be linked to the InvIT’s performance in capital market.

InvIT as an instrument provides flexibility and is expected to create specialised O&M concessionaires and attract patient capital of around 30 years, the official statement said. “Retail domestic savings and corpus of special institutions to be invested in infrastructure sector through InvIT,” the statement added.


IIFCL EQUITY SUPPORT
The cabinet also approved a proposal to increase equity support to India Infrastructure Finance Co Ltd (IIFCL) of Rs 5,300 crore in the current financial year and Rs 10,000 crore in FY21, a move that will allow the company to finance big-ticket infrastructure projects. The cabinet has also approved increasing the authorised capital of IIFCL from Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore."
45,2019-12-12,JSW,"Tobacco-to-consumer goods conglomerate ITC is languishing near its lowest levels of 2019 amid concerns the upcoming Goods and Services Tax Council, which is meeting on December 18, could increase taxes on cigarettes. Notwithstanding the worries about a possible tax hike on cigarettes, most analysts have ‘buy’ recommendations on the stock as ITC is among the cheapest consumer stocks, trading at a discount of around 30 per cent to its 10-year average valuation.

The stock ended up 1 per cent at Rs 238 on Wednesday, near its 52-week low of Rs 234.10 which was hit on September 18. With GST collections of states falling short, there are rising expectations of a tax hike on cigarettes which has led to ITC shares falling over 20 per cent from their recent peak in April this year and 8 per cent in the last one month.

“States are not happy with the cess they are getting from the central government so the fear is that cigarette taxes may go up as it is one of the key components of the cess. It has been around 18-19 months since there have been no tax hike on cigarettes, so at some stage the taxes have to go up,” said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-presidentinstitutional equities at Edelweiss.

“Valuations are cheap and profits are growing at 9-10 per cent but if the tax hike is over 10 per cent, it will be seen negatively as it will then impact volumes. A 5-8 per cent hike will be absorbed,” said Roy. The group derived 46 per cent of its total revenues from cigarettes. Consumer businesses contribute 25 per cent to its revenue. Hotels and agri-businesses contributed 4 per cent and 12 per cent to its total revenues, respectively.

ITC, which sells brands such as Sunfeast biscuits and Gold Flake cigarettes, is trading at 19.1 times estimated price-to-earnings ratio, according to Bloomberg data. Of the 38 analysts tracking the stock, 34 have a ‘buy’ rating and four analysts have a ‘hold’ rating.

The company posted a standalone profit growth of 36.2 per cent in the three-months ended September at Rs 4,023 crore – its highest ever quarterly profit-due to fall in tax expenses and tax credit. Its cigarette business posted 6 per cent growth in gross revenue at Rs 5,326.8 crore.

Rising competition from peers in the tobacco sector has also weighed on the stock recently, said some analysts. ITC has underperformed the BSE FMCG index which is down about 5 per cent in the last one month.

“The company is facing competition from VST Industries and GPI – both of them have 10 per cent market share each now and they are going pan-India. The company has not been able to take price hikes because of the economic slowdown and competition from other players,” said Vishal Gutka, VP-consumer and retail at Phillip Capital. “Volume growth has been in low-single digits in the last few quarters and we don’t see any meaningful upside. If the cess on cigarettes is hiked, volume may even decline,” said Gutka. Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock despite these concerns as it is one of the cheapest consumer stocks.

Others believe that any impact on volumes in the event of a cigarette tax hike will be temporary.

An analysis of historical trends confirms that when consumers are faced with a tax increase on cigarettes after a period of relatively benign pricing, the impact on volumes is short lived, said Morgan Stanley, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on ITC with a target price of Rs 370.

IIFL believes that a cigarette tax hike is possible but it is not a near uncertainty which the market seems to be pricing in. “A nil-tomoderate tax hike will remove the event risk on the stock. The case for a high-tax hike is weak, given the lack of revenue-generating potential and a resultant surge in demand for illegal cigarettes,” said Percy Panthanki of IIFL in a note on Wednesday."

47,2019-12-12,JSW,"Amid a painful slowdown in the domestic economy, 22 companies ended a loss-making spree of three quarters to report profits for the July-September period.

Most of them are from sectors that have still been going through a slowdown amid myriad problems, which are what had left these businesses deep in the red in the first place. Many of them also faced acute liquidity crisis amid the debt market crisis triggered by infrastructure lender IL&FS’ payment defaults.

Seven of these 22 turnaround stories come from metals-related industries, which have been reeling under demand contraction. They included Jai Balaji Industries, MSP Steel and Power, Kridhan Infra, Anchal Ispat and Mideast Integrated Steel, among others.

Among others on the list are Dish TV, Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), Sintex Industries, BL Kashyap & Sons, HT Media, Inox Wind and Hind Aluminium – all smallcaps.

“The rally in the broader market has not yet moved to the smallcap segment, but over the past two to three months, market participation has been going up in midcaps,” said Amit Premchandani, Senior Vice-President & Fund Manager for Equity at UTI Mutual Fund.

With most of the largecaps trading at steep valuations, midcaps and smallcaps have become attractive. Most analysts expect the broader market to gain traction going forward.

S Krishna Kumar, CIO - Equity & Executive Vice President, Sundaram AMC believes the gains will percolate to midcaps and smallcaps as the rally broadens.

“The reality is, the largecap index is up about 50-60 per cent in last three years, whereas the midcap and smallcap indices are probably up or down just about 10-15 per cent.

53,2019-12-14,JSW,"Hindalco, Ashok Leyland and EID Parry are the three stocks Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in, is choosing as his trading picks for next week. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What do you make of the momentum towards the end of the week?Intra week, there has been a very strong comeback for the Nifty. From those 11,800 marks, it has been a very ferocious comeback. For two or three days consecutively, the market stayed pretty well. What was more heartening was a variety of factors. First of all, the index came back above that 12,000 mark which I believe is a very strong psychological breakout for the indices. 

The second and the most important part was the market breadth improving and not just in terms of the advance decline ratio, but stocks which moved up higher, last week. Earlier, the rally started from the low beta or defensive stocks like the pharma, IT stocks and then in the second half of the week, we saw the metals and the PSU banking pack pick up quite a bit of a pace.

When you have such a strong sectoral mix and markets internals, you generally expect the momentum to carry forward. The only one catch over here for the index which I saw looking at the data on Friday post closing was that PCR or the put-call ratio is now at 1.4-1.42 levels. So, over Monday-Tuesday next week, if we see successive price up moves, then there is a high possibility that the put-call ratio may come into an overbought territory. That could call for a bit of short term correction.


What do you make of the metals pack this week? One of the star gainers was metals and was probably led by what is happening in the US?Absolutely. The metal stocks did fabulously well and many of these stocks were waiting for a breakout anyway. A case in point is Hindalco which closed at a multi-week high at those 205 plus levels, SAIL also has shown a lot of promise. Even SAIL is coming out of a bullish flag pennant kind of a combination and breakout on the weekly charts. 

There are some strong indicators on the monthly timeframe as well and many are metal stocks. Tata Steel also did pretty well. JSW Steel had a bit of an iffy run on Friday, but net-net, even this stock is looking quite strong and sturdy. Almost all the stocks from the metal pack did fabulously well for themselves last week and when you have risk-on mode coming back into the markets, these kind of sectors are trader favourites. Many of these metal stocks should see a continued up move, case in point Hindalco and SAIL particularly."
54,2019-12-15,JSW,"By Arvind Panagariya & Rajeev Mantri

Two features of the regulatory regime have been central to the current malaise in India’s financial sector. First, until 2015, contrary to international best practice, RBI rules permitted banks to classify restructured loans as standard assets rather than downgrade them to non-performing status.

Second, until the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) came along in 2016, the process of exit for defaulting firms and recovery of loans from them was cumbersome, costly and protracted.


In good books 
Fearful that recovery of loans in default would be partial and take a long time, bank managers preferred to restructure loans before they went into default. Under the rules, restructured loans retained their status as standard assets. The incentive to follow this practice was especially high in public sector banks (PSBs), since any write-downs on loans in the event of default and partial recovery carried the risk of attracting the attention of vigilance agencies. As a result, restructured loans with little prospect of full recovery piled up, especially on the books of PSBs.

Many unscrupulous promoters saw in this weakness of the system, an opportunity to accumulate personal wealth. They effectively transformed a part of the bank debt into personal equity. This act undermined their ability to service the debt further, but they knew that banks would have no option but to restructure the loan on more generous terms. Repeated iterations of this process gave rise to what came to be known as ever greening of loans.

Eventually, in 2015, RBI did catch up with this game and changed the regulation to force banks to reclassify restructured loans as non-performing assets (NPAs). That led to a quick deterioration of balance sheets of banks, especially of PSBs, which had accounted for disproportionately large volume of restructured loans. GoI was left with no option but to commit a gigantic Rs 2.1 trillion in 2017 for recapitalisation of PSBs. Fundamentally, this sum gave relief to corporations and banks despite their missteps. It amounted to more than one-fifth of all public welfare direct benefit transfers since 2013-14.

An even more damaging effect of the arduous pre-IBC regime was that it subverted the process of creative destruction by throwing sand in the wheels of market renewal. Difficulty of exit discouraged entry of new vibrant firms. Firms make new investments on the basis of certain market expectations. In case those expectations are not realised, they need to be able to exit. The more difficult such an exit, the more reluctant the investor. This blunting of competition from efficient potential entrants had the effect of propping up inefficient and uncompetitive incumbent firms.

Furthermore, the large inefficient corporations often recognised that GoI would view their protracted exit, during which the value of their assets would see deterioration, and paucity of new entrants as socially costly. Therefore, during a downturn, they could credibly argue that unless GoI rescued them, their entire sector and the wider economy would suffer. The threat of accompanying job losses sharpened this argument.

Luckily, IBC has now considerably speeded up the exit process. Backed by a 2017 amendment to the Banking Regulation Act, it has also empowered creditors to pursue defaulting promoters. The results, to date, have been extremely encouraging.


Jet lag For example, in 2017-18, Jet Airways was among India’s largest players by passenger share in both the international and domestic civil aviation markets. But when it defaulted on its loans in 2019, creditors could speedily eject its powerful promoters. Moreover, despite its size, its exit created minimal market disruption. Other airlines stepped in to fill the supply gap and are also picking up its employees. Loan recovery by creditors is well under way.

Likewise, IBC has resulted in the entrenched promoters losing Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) and Essar Steel. JSW Steel and Arcelor-Mittal have respectively acquired these firms. BPSL and Essar creditors have recovered 41% and 92% of their loans, respectively.

According to ratings agency Crisil, during 2018-19, financial creditors recovered 42.8% of the Rs 2.53 trillion amount claimed under IBC. This represents a marked improvement over the dwindling pre-IBC recovery rates of 31%, 24%, 22% and 18% in 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 respectively. Critically, Crisil reported that the average time taken for resolution has declined from 3.5-4 years to 326 days for the 94 cases resolved under IBC as of March 31, 2019.

Given the new context, it is essential for GoI not to subvert competition by intervening on behalf of ailing corporations. When bankruptcy is swift, it does not result in the destruction of assets. Instead, it allows a more efficient buyer to acquire them at prices at which they can be deployed profitably.

What GoI needs to do is make IBC even speedier, more transparent and hazard-free. As an example, it is reported that after JSW Steel acquired BPSL, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached the firm’s assets against its claims on BPSL. Such overreach by government agencies has a chilling effect on all potential bankruptcy resolutions. It is reassuring that the Cabinet has recently approved an amendment to IBC protecting buyers of assets against such liabilities. Parliament must swiftly pass the amendment.

55,2019-12-16,JSW,"State Bank of India is set to get about Rs 12,161 crore as the largest acquisition through the three-year-old Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is completed on Monday. Essar Steel’s sale to the Arcelor Mittal-Nippon Steel consortium will also allow two of the world’s top three steel makers to gain a foothold in the growing Indian market, giving tough competition to incumbents Tata Steel and JSW Steel. 


SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar has been closely involved in supervising the deal and has seen the various twists and turns as the matter went right up to the apex court, forcing changes in the bankruptcy law. In an interview with ET, Kumar expressed relief at the completion of the transaction and explains the impact it will have on SBI’s balance sheet. 
Excerpts:


Can we finally say that the Essar deal is done?
Yes, we can now say that it is done. The full money has come into an SBI escrow account on Friday. It will now be distributed among the creditors on Monday. We can now look ahead. It has been a longdelayed transaction.


Boost to SBI Balance Sheet
But what can we say? All is well that ends well. I can only say that it is a big relief for me and for my bank that this transaction has finally been completed.


How will you use the money?
We are getting a write-back of more than Rs 12,000 crore and it will directly go to our profit and loss account, in the pre-provision operating profit to be exact. We plan to use this money to shore up our capital and provisions. We have been making provisions all along but RBI norms on provisions are strict, so we will shore up provisions.


How will this recovery impact your balance sheet and profitability?
We do not have any targets for profitability. But yes, this recovery will strengthen the balance sheet of the bank. As I said, we can use the extra money to make more provisions according to RBI norms. We still have to measure the full impact of this recovery but this and other recoveries should help us in reducing our gross NPAs (nonperforming assets) by 1.5 to 2 percentage points at the end of the fiscal. I think by the end of March our gross NPA should come down somewhere around 6% (SBI's gross NPAs were at 7.19% at the end of September 2019).


Essar is done now but what is the outlook for recoveries going ahead?
This transaction will expedite recoveries and have a far-reaching impact on other resolutions as a lot of clarifications have been made because of this. We are expecting a steady pipeline of recoveries till the end of this fiscal. Taking Essar into account, we could gain Rs 18,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore by the end of the fiscal. Like Bhushan Power & Steel, where resolution is expected to be soon and where we stand to gain Rs 4,000 crore. We also received money from Prayagraj Power last week. Then there is Alok Industries where we expect Rs 1,800 crore and Ruchi Soya where Rs 800 crore will come to our P&L. The impact on our balance sheet will be different depending on how much provisions we have made.


Will higher recoveries mean that SBI will now be able to concentrate on lending more?
We never moved away from focussing on lending and that will continue. Yes high-profile recoveries like Essar take some toll, so to that extent we can focus better. Lending will continue and asset quality will also improve. But this is a business and some big slippages like DHFL (Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd) have an impact on the whole system."

Analysts’ view
“Nifty formed a dark cloud cover candle pattern on the daily chart, which is a bearish reversal pattern. Now the index has good support near 12,000 and if it manages to hold above this zone, then we may see some recovery, otherwise sharp profit booking can be seen. Immediate resistance is coming near 12,100-12,150 zone” -- Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities“Inflationary pressure and static manufacturing activity impacted sentiment while trade deal optimism buoyed global markets. Global factors are likely to be more supportive in the near term and market anticipates a better economic growth in the coming years, which is giving support in every consolidation. Investors are also keenly waiting for the upcoming GST council meet to get any cues on overcoming revenue shortfall” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Global marketsAsian peers mostly closed lower as investors’ initial enthusiasm over a phase one US-China trade deal gave way to concerns about the lack of concrete details on the agreement. Japanese shares ended lower as survey showed the manufacturing sector in Japan continued to contract in December, and at a slightly faster rate. Though, Chinese shares ended higher after the United States and China reached a historic agreement on a phase one trade deal and key Chinese data beats forecasts. China industrial production and retail sales expanded at the fastest pace in five months in November as steps taken by the government helped to boost domestic demand.

60,2019-12-17,JSW,"New Delhi: State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar expects profit in the third quarter to get a boost from the resolution of the Essar Steel insolvency case, which will give the country’s largest lender a fillip of Rs 12,161 crore.

The sale of Essar Steel to the ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel consortium for Rs 42,000 crore, the largest transaction through the three-year-old Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), was completed last week.

Kumar said the resolution of Alok Industries and Bhushan Power and Steel – where SBI is expected to recover Rs 1,700 crore and Rs 4,000 crore, respectively – was close to completion.

“Bhushan Power and Steel and Alok Industries I consider very close to resolution,” he said on the side-lines of an IBC event in New Delhi. The bank is also expected to get Rs 800 crore from the resolution of Ruchi Soya.

While JSW Steel is looking to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel, Reliance Industries is said to be in talks with banks for funding the buyout of debt-ridden textile manufacturer Alok Industries.

The top boss of SBI said that while liquidation under IBC should be avoided, small and medium enterprises required different treatment. IBC should be used for larger companies, where loans are high.

“SMEs have to be treated differently… IBC should be used for where the amounts are bigger and multiplicity of lenders is there,” Kumar said. However, he added that a change in legislation was not required.

The government introduced a bill to amend the IBC in the winter session of Parliament. The bill proposes to bar government agencies from attaching the assets of a corporate debtor undergoing bankruptcy resolution for prior offences, making such stressed assets more attractive to potential buyers.

Further, no attachment, seizure, retention or confiscation of property of the corporate debtor can take place in relation to an offence committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process where the property is covered under a resolution plan approved."

81,2019-12-24,JSW,"Mumbai: JSW Steel, which is in the process of acquiring Bhushan Power and Steel, is raising Rs 3,000 crore in the form of bridge loans to make good the shortfall in the Rs 19,700-crore deal.

Credit Suisse, Deutsche and Standard Chartered are the three lenders likely extending the money that JSW Steel would repay in three years, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told ET.

The company is said to have already arranged three-fourths of the total sum. The short-term loan is needed to plug the residual funding gap.

“We are in the advanced stages of negotiations with both the company and the lenders examining the final terms and conditions,” said a Hong Kong-based senior executive, whose bank is one of the lenders.

JSW Steel, Deutsche Bank, and Standard Chartered Bank declined to comment. Credit Suisse did not respond to ET’s mailed query.

The loan could be priced in the range of 8-12 per cent, sources said.

State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National bank, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank of India are among the lenders to Bhushan Power and Steel.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which is considering an appeal from winning bidder JSW Steel, will hear the case on January 13.

Lenders had written to JSW Steel after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approval for closing the transaction. However, JSW Steel wanted resolution of some issues related to indemnities and liabilities under the erstwhile promoter.

The resolution was stuck due to reports of alleged fraud by its former promoters. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL) assets, and JSW Steel said it wants to be excluded from the scope of the probe and attachment of BPSL’s assets before it committed the funds.

New Delhi has since ring-fenced asset buyers by tweaking the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). It has sought to shield new buyers from prosecution for offences by previous promoters of distressed assets.

JSW had outbid Tata Steel and Liberty House Group for the distressed asset. Bhushan Power & Steel is expected to add 3.5 million tons a year of capacity to the Sajjan Jindalled company’s output."

84,2019-12-25,JSW,"It wasn’t a one-way street for Indian finance. Dewan Housing went into bankruptcy and NBFCs in general struggled. State -run banks, burdened by bad loans, are not out of the woods yet. But the likes of Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank thrived. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also appear to have put their woes behind. Bank Nifty at a record high shows that it’s not all gloom.THE GOOD: NPA CYCLE TURNS
The bad loan recognition cycle at Indian banks finally turned the corner with both the systemwide gross bad loan ratio and the stressed asset ratio monitored by the Reserve Bank of India showing a declining trend.

Gross non-performing loan ratio was down at 9.1% at the end of FY19 against 11.2% a year ago. For listed entities, this ratio declined nearly 7.5% in the first half of this fiscal year, with absolute numbers at Rs 8.94 lakh crore at the end of September versus Rs 10.18 lakh crore during the same period last year.

“Three years since the asset quality review, the level of bad loans is beginning to ease; however, it has not yet relieved the banking system from the pressure over the recovery,” said Sanjay Agarwal, senior director, CARE Ratings. “The decline in the overall slippages is a sign of improvement in the banking system. In light of the June 7 circular of the RBI, banks would have to factor in the effect of the newly prescribed timelines for the restructuring and provisioning of their stressed assets.”

Indian banks have recognised around Rs 17 lakh crore of stressed loans as NPAs since FY16, led by accelerated NPA recognition following the central bank’s stringent norms and asset quality reviews.

Infrastructure-focused banks like ICICI and Axis changed their strategy towards a more granular lending while IndusInd Bank made efforts to kill the IL&FS ghost. For many state-run banks, the announcement of mergers was a bit of a drag, but data showed that their overall share in bad loans declined primarily due to recoveries and huge write-offs.


After the Supreme Court struck down the banking regulator’s February 12 circular on early recognition and resolution of stressed assets, a new framework was brought in which involved signing of intercreditor agreements (ICAs) to arrive upon a resolution. But, with ICAs worth Rs 3 lakh crore signed and resolutions few and far between, the last quarter of this fiscal year will be crucial.

Analysts forecast higher recoveries and slowdown in fresh bad loans may reduce banks’ non-performing loans to nearly 8% by March 2020.

“Asset quality of banks should witness a decisive turnaround this fiscal (FY20) with gross NPAs reducing by 350 basis points (bps) over two years to around 8% by March 2020. This will be driven by a combination of reduction in fresh accretions to NPAs as well as stepped up recoveries from existing NPA accounts,” Crisil said in a note.


THE BAD: IBC BACKLOG
When the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) became law, it promised a new loan recovery mechanism for banks in a defined time frame of 270 days from when a case had been admitted.

However, three years since the law has been in force, it has been marred by delays due to litigation, poor court infrastructure and, in some cases, companies taking their own time to pay up money.

Data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India at the end of September shows that the 156 resolution plans completed took an average of 374 days, which is even higher than the revised 330 days granted by the Supreme Court in July 2019.



In November, while ruling on the muchawaited Essar Steel case, the Supreme Court struck down its own timeline of 330 days noting that the deadline can be extended in exceptional circumstances so as to get the best value to creditors.

“After the Supreme Court order, there is no timeline even for 330 days and we have already seen cases lingering for two years or more,” said RK Bansal, CEO of Edelweiss ARC, India’s largest bad debt aggregator.

The Essar case itself is a prime example of the delay plaguing the IBC, as it took close to 900 days for completion.

Even as banks rejoice over their ₹42,000-cr recovery in the Essar case, eight out of the 12 large cases forced to the IBC by RBI in 2017 are yet to find closure. Like Bhushan Power & Steel, which has been awarded to JSW Steel but is yet to be closed due to litigations amid allegations of irregularities in the company. Or take the case of Alok Industries, which was awarded to a Reliance Industries-JM Financial ARC joint venture in March 2019, is yet to close because banks are awaiting payment.

Delays are not only in resolution but also in admission of cases.

“The law provides for cases to be admitted within 15 days but, in reality, there are cases which are pending admission for months. Additional benches have been created but they are not fully functional. There is not enough infrastructure and not enough people to manage it. Now with personal guarantees also a part of the law, we expect delays to worsen as multiple guarantees will be linked to one corporate debtor. It will make things worse,” said KP Sreejith, managing partner, IndiaLaw LLP.

Fed up with the delays, bankers are now looking at alternatives outside the IBC, like in power projects where the issues are structural in nature, because once a company admitted is not resolved in the IBC, it has to be liquidated.

Bankers hope that this new law, which has so far given mixed results, does not go the way similar previous laws like debt recovery or SARFAESI went.


AND THE UGLY: NBFC CRISIS
The year gone by witnessed the full aftermath of the collapse of IL&FS, which froze the credit markets and the contagion spread. Non-banking finance companies were shut out of the market throwing investors into a tizzy and speculation over which would be the next domino to fall. The next to fall was mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Co with nearly a Rs 1 lakh crore balance sheet. The slide didn’t stop there with small-sized nonbank lender Altico Capital defaulting.

“Overall risk aversion remained high among the lenders as they perceived that liquidity issues can threaten solvency of leveraged corporates in stressed sectors and of many mid and small-sized non-bank lenders and housing finance companies that could potentially face an asset-side problem,” said Rajiv Mehta, lead analyst, Yes Securities. “Amid such cacophony, the investors have taken shelter in wellgoverned banks, NBFCs and HFCs having robust balance sheet.”


Since IL&FS collapse in September last year, without announcing any bailout or liquidity window for the struggling nonbank lenders, the government and the Reserve Bank of India announced several measures to arrest the collapse in the nonbank lending space that contributes over 20% of the total credit.

The regulator announced measures to increase liquidity in the system aiding banks to lend to NBFCs, and relaxed securitisation and priority sector norms. The government, on its part, announced a partial credit guarantee scheme which remains a non-starter till date. But these moves did not bring relief across the board, but selectively.

Then the government allowed an orderly wind-up or resolution of a failed institution. Since then, DHFL has been referred to bankruptcy.

“The trifecta of constrained funding access with rising borrowing costs, recalibration and de-risking of loan book and a slowing economy is set to beat down growth in assets under management of non-banks — comprising non-banking finance companies and housing finance companies — to a decadal low of 6-8% this fiscal, compared with ~15% last fiscal,” Crisil Ratings said.

A recent Motilal Oswal report has pointed out that only the top 25-50 NBFCs are able to manage the liability side pressure, while the remaining still struggle to raise funds. While banks have been disbursing loans to the sector, the mutual fund industry has shut their tap and the sector would likely take another year to be out of the woods."

91,2019-12-27,JSW,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Reliance Securities has retained hold rating on 
Maruti Suzuki India with a target price of Rs 7,250. The company's BS-VI products would be at most competitive pricing with better technology, said Reliance Securities. Industry demand situation may improve steadily in FY21, while it would bounce back in H2 FY21, said Reliance Securities. BS-VI products would help company to gain further market share in FY21, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 1.2 per cent at Rs 7,240.75 on Thursday.

• Antique Stock Broking has maintained hold rating on 
JSW Steel with a target price of Rs 277. JSW Steel is likely to witness flat steel spreads sequentially in third quarter of FY20 as the decline in steel prices in October 2019 and reset of half yearly automotive contracts at lower levels would impact the quarter, said Antique. Recovery in domestic steel demand in Q4 would enable further price hikes with current domestic steel prices at a discount to landed import parity Chinese prices, said Antique. The stock ended up 1 per cent at Rs 269.30 on Thursday.


• Ambit Capital has initiated coverage on 
Thermax with a buy rating and target price of Rs 1,211. Thermax is no longer a play on domestic private capex cycle with international business now contributing 45 per cent to overall consolidated revenue, said Ambit. Profitability of international subsidiaries is expected to improve as restructuring is nearing completion, the brokerage said. Moderating competitive intensity in big ticket orders and shift in mix towards specialty chemicals would aid margin expansion, said Ambit. The stock ended up 0.35 per cent at Rs 1,054.60 on Thursday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained reduce rating on 
Bharti Infratel with a fair value of Rs 275. Long stop date pertaining to Bharti Infratel-Indus merger got extended further to February 24, 2020 on account of pending regulatory approvals. Bharti Infratel's near-term growth prognosis remains weak, it said. Higher working capital driven by increasing receivables is an additional pressure point on cash flows, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.2 per cent at Rs 255.80 on Thursday.

• Reliance Securities has maintained buy rating on 
JK Lakshmi Cement with a target price of Rs 465. The company is likely to witness healthy traction ahead mainly on account of new commissioned grinding unit in Odisha, cost synergies and steady pricing environment in Northern markets, it said. With no meaningful capex hereon, the brokerage expects JK Lakshmi cement to generate free cash flow worth Rs 1,000 crore in FY20-FY21. The stock ended flat at Rs 273.60 on Thursday."

102,2019-12-31,JSW,"NEW DELHI: Driven by 'Make in India' initiative, slashing imports, keeping a tab on domestic prices and exploring alternate overseas sources for coking coal are set to top the government's agenda for the steel sector in 2020 while players expect a ""break out year"" for the industry.

After 2019 saw the domestic market grapple with surge in imports, increased dependence on imported coking coal from select countries, the steel ministry will be focusing on managing availability of iron ore as leases of a clutch of mines are scheduled to expire in March next year.

A few rating agencies and merchant miners have expressed concern that the country may face a short-term disruption in supply of iron ore used in making steel due to the transition phase.

""Managing iron ore availability will be among our targets. We will monitor this (situation) as iron ore is a requirement of our industry. It will be a major task for us. We will keep a watch that prices do not go up and iron ore is made available at a competitive rate to the industry,"" Steel Secretary Binoy Kumar told PTI.

India would see a clutch of mining leases for coal and iron ore expiring by March 2020 and under the amended Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. These leases will not be renewed, which means fresh auctions will be done.

In efforts to reduce dependence on select countries for coking coal, Kumar said the government is already in talks with Russia and Mongolia. Currently, it is dependent on few nations like Australia, the US and Canada.

Around 85 per cent of the country's coking coal demand is met through imports.

""We will also continue to look for alternative sources to make coking coal available which will reduce dependence on select countries, and exploit the coking reserves in the country,"" he said.

Kumar said the priority will also be to reduce imports and increase exports of steel. Around 7-8 million tonnes of steel is imported annually.

Indian Steel Association (ISA) Assistant Secretary General Arnab Hazra said the new year will be the year of hope for the Indian steel industry - ""the breakout year"" for the sector - and stressed that resilience of the industry will stand out.

The industry is hoping 2020 will see increased demand for steel, better prices and development of new products.

Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) Managing Director V R Sharma said iron ore prices are expected to go up again in January 2020 by Rs 1,000 to 1,500 per tonne.

Terming the country's steel market as ""one of the most promising steel markets in the world"", ArcelorMittal said it would to contribute to India's expansion in infrastructure and urbanisation in the coming decades.

Steel magnate L N Mittal's ArcelorMittal, which recently completed the takeover of Essar Steel, will work on its plans of expanding business in India.

Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, Corporate Sector Ratings, Icra, said the current fiscal has seen margin pressures being faced by the domestic steel players, given weak demand conditions and a sharp fall in realisations.

""For the next fiscal FY2021, demand revival will largely depend upon infrastructure investment by the union and state governments. Moreover, there could be cost pressures because of iron ore, if auction of iron ore mines in Odisha and subsequent operations of those mines are delayed significantly, negatively impacting availability,"" he noted.

A Tata Steel official said the industry hopes 2020 to be better, particularly the second half as compared to the second half of 2019 when the industry faced a slowdown in the auto sector which impacted the steel sector as well.

""The first half of 2020 will be better with the new Budget and start of new projects and the second half, we anticipate, will be very good,"" the official said.

Noting that slowdown in growth was quite visible in the latter part of 2019, Seshagiri Rao -- Joint MD and CFO of JSW Steel and Group said the main reasons behind it were the lack of credit from the banking system as well as cut in government expenditure.

""There have been some green shoots of recovery in October and November 2019. We expect the first quarter of 2020 to be better than the December quarter as we are seeing demand coming back on the retail side and in government projects.

""The demand for steel from the auto sector has improved. India's spending on infrastructure is expected to drive the steel industry's growth in 2020. Activity is restarting in areas like pipelines, bridges, construction, and metros,"" Rao noted.

Pankaj Malhan, CEO of Electrosteel Steels Pvt Ltd said the company is extremely bullish on the new year where India is poised to grow strongly banking on the structural reforms and the rebounding economy, thereby leading to higher capacity utilisation.

""The reforms in the coal mining sector along with linkages in the iron ores will further strengthen the sector and will help raise its contribution to GDP from 2 per cent in the near future, creating thousands of jobs. The sector will also look forward to new product development, to create a differentiation for the commodity, make it more retail oriented and make India a hub for low cost, high grade steel,"" he said."
