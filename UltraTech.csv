4,2018-01-08,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The Jaypee Group has restructured its outstanding foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) after renegotiating with investors, including marque Wall Street names like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.

The deal allows the cash-strapped infrastructure conglomerate to delay its debt obligation by about four years, giving it more room to meet immediate liabilities arising out of ongoing legal battles, said people in the know. Jaiprakash Associates, the holding company, had sold $150 million of FCCBs in 2012 with a five-year maturity. These bonds were convertible at Rs 77.50 per share. But, the company could not pay interest since March 2016.

International investors including Bluebay, Clearwater and CIC France had also invested in the securities.

While Goldman and Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the matter, others could not be contacted immediately. Jaypee did not comment on individual investors.

“Investors continue to repose our faith on our company, backed by quality assets and seeing the intent of the promoters who are leaving no stone unturned to discharge all their obligations towards all stakeholders,” JP Group managing director Suren Jain told ET.

“The restructuring of FCCB in Jaiprakash Associates is evident of such investor confidence on us. This has helped us extend our debt obligation by another three-four years.”

The company has been exchanging old FCCBs with two new series of similar bonds. The FCCBs had $110 million of principal outstanding and unpaid interest of $12.3 million. Jaypee paid 25% of the principal outstanding ($27 million) upfront. For the remaining, it issued two separate series of bonds maturing in September 2020 and 2021.

Investors can earn interest income on those two sets of papers at 4.76% and 5.75%, respectively, payable quarterly. These bonds are listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. “It has never been the intention of the group to short-change any investor, whether secured or unsecured,” said Jain.

The series maturing in 2020 amounting to $81.7 million has no conversion option and will be repaid in quarterly instalments starting March this year. The series maturing in 2021, totalling $38.64 million, has a conversion option at Rs 27 per share.

However, if not converted, this series will be repaid in quarterly instalments starting December 2020.

The payment of the principal is usually in the currency in which the money is raised.

“The retail fixed deposit holders (unsecured creditors) have been paid off fully in July 2017 using the sales proceeds of cement units to UltraTech Cement,” Jain said.

A convertible bond is a mix between a debt and equity instrument. Jaiprakash Associates reported total debt of Rs 5,586 crore in the end of September 2017, compared with Rs 27,729 crore at the end of March 2017. Cash from asset monetisation in the past, including Rs 16,000 crore from the cement asset sale, helped, allowing the company to bring its debt to equity to 0.5 from almost 4 just six months ago. Its subsidiary, Jaiprakash Infratech that owns road projects including the Yamuna Expressway and real estate assets, has debt of Rs 8,487 crore and is struggling to meet its obligation."

12,2018-01-16,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Billionaires Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and D-Mart promoter Radhakishan Damani teamed up to bid for Binani Cement, two senior executives in the know of the matter said, intensifying the race for the company which is facing bankruptcy proceedings from its lenders.

Established cement makers such as UltraTech, Heidelberg, the JSW Group, Dalmia Bharat and Ramco Cements also made proposals on their own or in partnerships to acquire the assets of the debt-ridden company on the last day to submit bids, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Dalmia Bharat partnered billionaire Ajay Piramal to bid for Binani Cement, while the JSW Group submitted its proposal jointly with a private equity firm and Ramco Cement tied up with PE fund True North.


Competition good news for lenders
“The partnership between Jhunjhunwala and Damani is a big surprise,” said one of the people. “If you look at the list of bidders, it appears that competition will only intensify and lenders may not have to take any haircut.”

Lenders had made a claim of Rs 3,884 crore on the company. This includes loans acquired by Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company from banks and dues to State Bank of India, Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda. This apart, the company also faces claims of Rs 2,429 crore from IDBI Bank and SBI in the form of corporate guarantees.




Bank of Baroda had referred Binani Cement to the National Company Law Tribunal in July, after the unlisted subsidiary of Binani Industries failed to repay a Rs 97-crore loan to the lender. Bank of Baroda then appointed Vijaykumar V Iyer as the resolution professional.

Originally, the resolution professional set December 22 as the last day for submitting a binding bid for the company, but this was extended to January 15 following requests from companies that had shown interested in the assets. In November, as many as 15 companies, including some international players like France’s Lafarge and Dublin-based CRH, had submitted expressions of interest for Binani.

The lenders had appointed consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal to evaluate the bids.

Binani Cement has a manufacturing capacity of 11.25 million tonnes a year with integrated plants in India and China, and grinding units in Dubai. Bidders are required to provide a plans on either acquiring the company fully or its assets.

The resolution professional has received a total claim of around Rs 7,500 crore from financial and operational creditors. The claim of Rs 2,429 crore over corporate guarantees is in dispute between the resolution professional and the lenders.

Driven by the resolution of stressed assets, the cement industry is going through a consolidation phase.

A fortnight ago, Dalmia Bharat announced a deal to acquire Murli Cement, one of the companies facing bankruptcy proceedings.

Earlier, UltraTech Cement had bought the cement plants of Jaiprakash Associates for Rs 16,189 crore, increasing its capacity to 93 million tonnes."

The period under review saw an increase in variable costs attributable to hardening of prices in pet coke and coal. The ban on pet coke usage in some states also adversely impacted the performance.

However, consolidated net sales of the company went up 33.23 per cent year-on-year to Rs 7,897 crore in Q3 2017-18, from Rs 5,927 crore in the same period last year.

Consolidated PBIDT jumped 16.72 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1,494 crore during the quarter under review.

19,2018-01-18,UltraTech,"Another day, another record! The domestic equity market ended at yet another peak on Thursday amid all round optimism over the economy. Firm global cues and key developments such as a reduction in additional borrowing and likely 100 per cent FDI in private banks gave a major impetus to the bulls.

The S&P BSE Sensex jumped 178 points on Thursday to close at 35,260 while the broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) closed above 10,800 for the first time at 10,817, up 28 points.

Here’s a look at the top stocks/sectors that hogged the limelight in today's session:


Metals crack in a rising market
Metal stocks came under heavy selling pressure after reports surfaced that the US has imposed anti-dumping duty on stainless steel flanges from India. Such imports of stainless steel flanges from India are valued at $32.1 million. The Nifty Metal index fell 2.89 per cent to 3,998 with 14 out of 15 constituents ending in the red. The index was the second biggest loser on the NSE after realty pack. 


UltraTech falls after Q3 earnings
UltraTech Cement announced an annual 23.36 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 456 crore for the quarter through December. This compares with a net profit of Rs 595 crore reported for the same quarter last year. The period under review saw an increase in variable costs attributable to hardening of prices in pet coke and coal. The ban on pet coke usage in some states also adversely impacted the performance. The scrip ended at Rs 4408.55 apiece on BSE, down 3 per cent. 


Spurt in open interest
Mindtree witnessed the biggest spike in open interest contracts at 45.04 per cent, followed by Adani Ports (17.83 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (16.40 per cent). 


Bank stocks rally
Banking stocks made hay on reports that the government was considering 100 per cent FDI in private lenders and 49 per cent in PSU banks. As per domestic brokerage firm ICICI Direct, the government may go for FDI push in the banking sector, which will pave the way for higher foreign flows in banks. The Nifty Bank index hit a fresh record high of 26,888 and settled 248 points or 1 per cent higher at 26,537.40. 


Pharma stocks slip
Pharma stocks slipped in the trade amid reports the government was poised to raise public health spending by 11 per cent, which is much lower than an earlier proposal in Budget allocation to ramp up disease control, Reuters reported quoting government sources and documents. Health Minister JP Nadda had sought a ‘bare minimum’ budget of nearly $10 billion for 2018-19 - 33 per cent higher than last year - in a letter to the Finance Minister on November 26, which Reuters had reviewed. The Nifty Pharma index plunged 118 points or 1 per cent to settle at 9,626.45 with 9 out of 10 constituents ending in the red.


Adag stocks crack up to 10%
Shares of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications (RIL) cracked 9 per cent to close at Rs 29.45 apiece on BSE amid profit booking at higher level. Other group stocks too slipped in the trade. Reliance Power and Reliance Naval shed 6.78 per cent and 7.57 per cent, respectively.


Mindtree logs big gains
Shares of mid-tier IT services firm Mindtree jumped 10 per cent after the company reported 13.8 per cent rise in net profit to $22 million and 3.9 per cent growth on revenues to $214.3 million for October-December quarter on strong execution. The Bengaluru-headquartered company's net profit stood at $ 19.3 million on revenues of $ 206.2 million during the July-September quarter. The stock shut shop at Rs 685.65 apiece on BSE."
20,2018-01-18,UltraTech,"The domestic equity market had an extremely volatile session on Thursday, as the benchmark Nifty50 gave up nearly 100-odd points from the high point of the day to end with modest gains of 28.45 points, or 0.56 per cent. Though the market saw a gapup opening and scaled yet another life-time peak, the Nifty also tested its 24-month-long trend line of a rising channel on the weekly charts from which it reverted.

You can expect a tepid start to the day on Friday. Though there are signs of some tiredness in the market, we do not see any significant decline. The 10,900 level will act as fierce resistance on Friday.

The 10,865 and 10,900 levels will be key resistance in any upmove of the Nifty50, while supports will come in at 10,790 and 10,775 levels.




The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 73.5869 and it marked a fresh 14-period high, which is a bullish signal. The RSI traded in a mildly overbought territory. The daily MACD continued to remain bullish, even as it traded above its signal line. A black candle emerged on the daily chart. However, in the present context, this formation holds no significance.

Pattern analysis showed the market is taking a breather after breaking out of the 10,490-mark. However, with Thursday’s intraday high levels, the Nifty tested a 24-month-long trend line of a rising channel and faced resistance there.

On Friday and in the coming days, no major downsides are likely, but volatility will remain ingrained in the markets as it is pushed into some more rangebound consolidation. We expect the Nifty50 to face some resistance at the 10,900 level on Friday and in the 10,900-10,975 zone in the coming week. As of now, there are no signs of exhaustion of the trend, but we expect volatility to remain ingrained in the market. We recommend staying away from creating any major short positions and select purchases with each volatile correction.

43,2018-01-25,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity market settled in negative territory on Thursday, snapping a winning streak of six sessions, pulled down by IT and PSU bank stocks on the last day of January series futures and options contracts.

 The Nifty50 index shed 16 points to settle at 11,070, while the BSE Sensex retreated 111 points to close at 36,050.

 Out of 50 stocks of the Nifty50 index, 26 fell and 24 advanced.

 “Markets fell on sharp rise in crude oil prices amid higher volatility, as traders rolled over their derivative positions to February futures and options contracts. Certain segments of the market also took cues from the ongoing corporate earnings season. The weakening of the dollar against most emerging market currencies also dampened sentiment. While private banking and metals stocks posted sharp gains, selling was seen in PSU banks, healthcare and auto stocks,” said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, Senior Fund Manager – Equities, BNP Paribas MF.

 PSU bank stocks remained the biggest losers of the day. Shares of public sector lenders cracked even as the government pushed ahead with its Rs 88,139 crore recapitalisation package. Market watchers are of view that the recap plan would lead to steep book value dilution risks that may leave little scope for any rerating on small PSU banking counters. Nifty PSU Bank index cracked over 5 per cent, with Punjab National Bank, Syndicate Bank and Indian Bank plunging up to 7 per cent.

 Pharma stocks too ran up losses, with Dr Reddy's Labs among the top losers after lacklustre earnings.

 IT stocks such as TCS, Infosys and HCL Technologies fell, dragging Nifty IT index down by 1 per cent.

 Indiabulls Housing Finance rose nearly 3 per cent to emerge as the top gainer in the Nifty space after a 55.4 per cent jump in December quarter profit. ICICI Bank, Ultratech Cement and Vedanta were the other significant gainers.

 UPL tanked as much as 7 per cent.

 State Bank of India plunged over 5 per cent as the government's recapitalisation plan showed that it was to receive less-than-expected funds for its kitty.

 Coming to sectors, barring metal, financial services and private banks, all closed in the red.

 Private bank index was the big hitter on the NSE, riding on the gains in ICICI Bank, which rose over 2 per cent.

 As many as 48 stocks hit fresh 52-week highs, whereas 20 hit fresh 52-week lows.

 Globally, China stocks tumbled from two-year highs while South Korea's KOSPI index hit a record closing high of 2,562.23, Reuters reported. European stocks were also a little lower ahead of the ECB meeting."
38,2018-01-25,UltraTech,"Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), India’s largest domestic institutional investor, was busy shopping on Dalal Street all through December quarter and handpicked shares from across the sectors such as banking and financial services, FMCG, upstream and downstream oil and gas, ports as well as IT. 

Among the largecaps, LIC increased its holding in IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to 4.17 per cent as of December 31, 2017 from 4.03 per cent as of September 30, 2017. 

TCS posted 1.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase in net profit at Rs 6,531 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, largely meeting Street estimates. 

LIC also increased holdings in Sun Pharma (from 4.36 per cent to 5.53 per cent) and Punjab National Bank (from 12.20 per cent to 13.94 per cent). 

In the FMCG space, it bought into Britannia and Hindustan Unilever (HUL), raising its holdings in the two firms from 3.53 per cent and 2.08 per cent to 3.79 per cent and 2.55 per cent, respectively.

HUL reported a 27.74 per cent jump in December quarter profit at Rs 1,326 crore on volume growth and margin improvement across categories. The company had posted Rs 1,038 crore profit for the October-December quarter a year ago.

Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, says HUL’s volume growth number was better than Street estimate as there was a pick-up of close to 6 per cent in realisations. The brand extension of Ayush as well as Indulekha can yield results in terms of new brands being created, and the market rewarding it.

“If you look at competition vis-a-vis Patanjali, the intensity is reducing. On the detergents side, one can see margin improvement. So, there has been some kind of price improvement. We would recommend an ‘add’ rating on HUL with a target of close to Rs 1,450,” Sofat said.

Overall, LIC hiked its stake in 40 companies in Q3. From the listed universe, it has investments in more than 200 companies from those listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), data available with corporate database Capitaline showed.




Among the upstream and downstream oil companies, LIC took its stake in BPCL to 3.46 per cent at the end of Q3 from 2.43 per cent in Q2FY18. It also increased holdings in ONGC and Oil India to 9.23 per cent and 11.27 per cent, respectively, from 9.20 per cent and 11.07 per cent in the year-ago period.

On January 20, ONGC announced the acquisition of government’s entire 51.11 per cent stake in refiner HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, paying a premium of over 10 per cent. Shares ONGC surged more than 3 per cent on the bourses on January 22.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes this acquisition will bring synergies in terms of larger balance sheet to take on overseas assets, better funding for HPCL’s projects, lesser volatility in ONGC’s earnings and most to fend off possible competition from private players in marketing of auto fuels if there is any threat to margins. 

“The lower-than-expected premium also does not put any overdue pressure on ONGC’s balance sheet. We continue to recommend ‘Buy’ rating on HPCL with a target of Rs 576. There is no significant change in valuation of ONGC eigher. We reiterate ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 234,” Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Rating agencies ICRA, CARE and Crisil too remained LIC’s favourites. Its stake in ICRA jumped to 7.45 per cent at the end of October-December 2017 from 6.75 per cent in the July-September period. It hiked stake in CARE Ratings and Crisil to 9.85 per cent and 5.45 per cent from 9.78 per cent and 4.68 per cent earlier.

Adani Ports, Asian Ports, Bajaj Finserv, Bharat Forge, Castrol India, Rajesh Exports, Marico, Lupin, Zydus Wellness, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank and UltraTech Cement were other companies that managed to attract LIC investment in Q3 FY18.

On the other hand, LIC dumped shares of Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Balrampur Chini, Cipla, ICICI Bank, MMTC, NBCC, Mastek, Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Copper, Volta, Vijaya Bank, Welspun Enterprises and Videocon Industries."

46,2018-01-31,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: UltraTech Cement has got the go- ahead for its limestone mining project in Bhavnagar district, Gujarat that would entail an investment of about Rs 60 crore, as per official documents.

The proposal is to mine limestone in a lease area of 632 hectare with production capacity of 2.07 million tonne per annum (TPA). Total mineral reserves are 63.58 million tonne and life of the mine is 32 years.

In a letter issued to the company, the Environment Ministry said it has given the green light to UltraTech Cement's proposed limestone mining project with certain conditions.

Among conditions, the company has been asked to rehabilitate 147 families and provide a house for each family with a total expenditure of Rs 12.25 crore or as per the norms of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, whichever is higher, it said.

The company has also been asked to help the project affected farmers for purchase of alternate agriculture land at a lower cost in and around nearby villages for livelihood.

The project cost is estimated to be about Rs 60 crore.

In the proposal, UltraTech Cement has informed that it will carry the mining operations by non-conventional opencast mechanised method without any drilling and blasting.

Surface miner will be used for mining and limestone will be transported to the proposed cement plant located at Bhavnagar district and existing cement plants located in Amereli district via existing roads, it added.

UltraTech Cement, the Aditya Birla Group firm, is the largest cement producer in India with the production capacity of 68 million tonne per annum. Its business is spread over five countries."
0,2018-02-01,UltraTech,"Cement companies are expected to see superior volume growth given the government's focus on housing for all, smart cities (99 already identified) and building toilets under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

 It is expected cement companies may clock 7-8% of volume growth by the third quarter of the next fiscal from close to 6% volume growth at present. Cement companies which have expanded--whether organically or inorganically, this Budget should serve as turn of demand cycle. It must be noted that 60-65% of cement demand comes from housing segment and hence the aforementioned initiatives are expected to create cement demand of over 5.5 million metric tonnes.

This should boost revenues of cement companies which have pan-India presence and balance sheet strength. These companies are Ultratech Cement, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat, The Ramco Cements."
2,2018-02-05,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The shadow of long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax and concerns over a wider fiscal deficit are likely to loom over market sentiment for some more time. Globally, rising bond yields in the US could also spoil the mood on Dalal Street, according to an ETpoll of 25 money managers and heads of research at brokerage houses.

Stocks plunged on Friday in their steepest one-day drop in more than a year after the February 1 Budget imposed LTCG tax on equities. The same day saw the Dow Jones dropping 666 points in its biggest fall since June 2016 over fears that strong US jobs data will prompt the Federal Reserve to speed up rate hikes amid inflation worries and bond yields rising.

ET’s poll showed that 50% expect the Indian market to fall another 5% in the next month. As many as 13% feel the fall could be steeper at 10%.


Midcaps may Face More Heat
Hindustan Unilever, Larsen & Toubro, GIC Housing, ICICI Bank, Marico, UltraTech Cement and Bajaj Finance are among the top picks. Inflation and steep valuations are among the other reasons dragging the market down.

“While LTCG is grandfathered till January 31, 2018, there is apprehension that as investors recalibrate their return expectations factoring the 10% tax, one may see some slowdown in incremental flows into equities,” said Mahesh Patil, co-chief investment officer, equities, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund. “Since midcaps have rallied maximum in the past three years, they would see larger impact in any correction. Globally, rising US treasury yields are also a cause of concern. Reversal in global market rally and rising bond yields are the biggest risk at the moment.”

The poll had 41% participants rating the Budget at seven out of 10 while 23% gave it eight and 36% gave it six.

The LTCG tax, widening fiscal deficit and rising bond yields in the US saw benchmark indices posting their biggest one-day fall in more than a year on Friday. The Nifty and Sensex each plunged 2.3% to 10,760.60 and 35,066.75, respectively. For the year, the Nifty is up 2.2% and the Sensex is up 3%. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices witnessed a bigger selloff, falling 4% and 4.6%, respectively.

Though LTCG fears may weigh on the market in the near term, the reintroduction of the tax is not likely to unsettle India's position in the emerging market basket, according to 57% of poll respondents. Nevertheless, the market isn’t likely to see a runaway rally soon. The poll result showed that 38% see the Nifty at 11,200 by the end of June, which would mean a potential 4% rise from current levels. About 19% see the index at 11,000 by June, while 25% see the index at 10,500 levels.

Going forward, firming interest rates globally and the absence of earnings growth are the main concerns, the poll showed. On the domestic front, macroeconomic worries and upcoming state elections are likely to be on the radar of market participants.

Globally, central banks are focusing hard on normalising policy, raising interest rates, withdrawing liquidity and hence global bond yields are rising in accordance, said Rahul Arora, CEO, institutional equities, Nirmal Bang Securities.

“In India, bond yields are pricing in the rise in global and local commodity prices, which will have a bearing on inflation in addition to the inflationary Budget and relaxation on fiscal prudence,” said Arora. “While the bond markets are giving a very different indication of what the market P/E (priceearnings) should be, the market seems to have outpriced risk and assumed lofty earnings growth as it has for nearly a decade now.”

Arora said the bond market will have a significant bearing on how the equity market behaves this year.

Given the Budget’s rural India focus, agri-input and fast-moving consumer goods companies were high on the preference list of poll respondents. They also favoured banks and indicated a preference for defensive bets—information technology and pharmaceutical companies—which had been out of favour in the recent times due to regulatory and sector-related woes."

5,2018-02-07,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: For retail investors seeking to navigate the choppy waters, largesized companies appear to be better bets now as appetite for risk assets diminishes in India.

Besides having relatively cheaper valuations compared to smaller peers, large-sized companies continue to record double-digit growth in earnings and revenues in the December 2017 quarter, given established business models and greater resilience against business cycles.

The BSE 100’s past three-year average price to earnings multiple is 22.2 and its current price to earnings multiple is 23.7, which is at a premium of 6.8 per cent. On the other hand, BSE Midcap’s past three-year average price to earnings multiple is 29.5 while its current price to earnings multiple is 38.7, a premium of 31 per cent.

Investors could look at large-sized companies that represent a combination of rural, defensive and infrastructure themes, which are less likely to see sharp corrections in their share prices because of greater visibility on earnings.

ETIG lists prominent names that represent the aforementioned themes: Dabur, Hero Motocorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, TCS, NTPC, Bharti Infratel, TCS, NTPC, Pidilite, Colgate Palmolive, ITC, and UltraTech Cement."
7,2018-02-16,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: UltraTech Cement, India’s largest manufacturer of the primary building material, believes that acquiring debt-laden Binani Cement in the ongoing spell of industry consolidation would not breach the monopoly watchdog’s threshold norms on market dominance.

“There is no concern of coming under the scanner of the Competition Commission of India,” Atul Daga, chief financial officer of UltraTech Cement, told ET. Daga said that in Rajasthan, where Binani’s India operations are based, Shree Cement is the largest player with a capacity of 19 MT. Ultra-Tech's installed capacity in the state is 8 MT. In this scenario, even after the possible acquisition of Binani's 6 MT plant in Rajasthan, UltraTech's combined capacity of 14 MT will still be lower than that of the market leader.

India is the world’s second-largest cement market after China, and is also the second-biggest producer of the commodity that is the world’s least priced manufactured item. High freight costs and concentrated limestone mining locations have made cement a highly regionalised business in India, with market dominance determined and assessed on the basis of regional boundaries.

India’s capital-intensive cement industry, where growth is typically correlated with the broader rate of economic expansion by a factor of about 1.2, is in its second major spell of consolidation in the past decade and a half. At the vanguard of the list of buyers in this round of consolidation are Nuvoco, UltraTech, and the Dalmia Bharat group.

The bid deadline for Binani Cement ended on February 12. Along with UltraTech, others who have bid are JSW Cement, a consortium of Dalmia Bharat and Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakishan Damani, Heidelberg and True North-Ramco. Ultra-Tech’s Daga also added that with a total of 17 cement players operating in Rajasthan and Gujarat, there is enough competition in the two markets, preventing monopolies.

In its previous decisions, CCI has looked at a minimum of two states and a maximum of six states that are associated with the plant state in terms of inflow and outflow of cement to decide the relevant market for the acquirer."

8,2018-02-19,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: A Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund consortium leads bids for debt-laden cement maker Binani Cement, exceeding Aditya Birla-led UltraTech Cement’s offer by a few hundred crore rupees, said several people aware of the matter.

The consortium has offered to pay more than Rs 6,300 crore for Binani, while UltraTech Cement came a close second with its bid of Rs 6,100 crore, they said. The Dalmia-Bain Piramal offer is a combination of cash and equity with the latter forming a small portion of the total value. However, UltraTech Cement would score higher in the technical and management qualification, experts said.

On the other hand, lenders’ concerns regarding the Competition Commission of India (CCI) potentially red-flagging concentration of UltraTech’s market share in the Gujarat market could play a role in deciding the winning bid, they said.

To be sure, UltraTech CFO Atul Daga told ET last week its bid for Binani doesn’t face any competition scrutiny risk as its market share in the Rajasthan market is well within limits with Shree Cement being the bigger player there. Still, with the company having more than 30% of the Gujarat market, getting CCI clearance could take between 70 days and five months, a delay that won’t suit lenders. They want the resolution to take place before March 31, said one of the persons. UltraTech declined to comment.




The other entities didn’t respond to ET queries. Six entities were vying for the asset, including an alliance of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakishan Damani; Heidelberg; JSW Cement and True North-Ramco. That made for an aggressive contest for one of the companies referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) last year for insolvency resolution. The fact that the offer values are more than the debt value ensuring the banks have to take minimum haircut implies bidders are highly keen on the asset. 

The 6.25 million tonne Binani Cement has a presence in Rajasthan, a location that will give Dalmia entry into the northern and western markets. It currently has a strong presence in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in the south. Another aspect that makes the cement company attractive is its limestone reserves of 378 million tonnes, a key raw material in cement manufacturing. Dalmia Bharat has a capacity of 9 MTPA.

This was also one of the assets that underwent a second round of bidding after lenders’ estimate of its liabilities changed. In the first round, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Cement had emerged as the highest bidder with an offer of Rs 5,900 crore. The bid deadline for the asset ended on February 12 and a decision by the committee of creditors (CoC) is likely to be made in a few weeks.

Binani owes about Rs 3,884 crore to lenders, which includes loans acquired by Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. from banks and dues to State Bank of India, 
Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda."
9,2018-02-19,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The Aditya Birla Group appointed Santrupt Misra to oversee its chemicals business, adding to his responsibilities of leading group human resources and the Carbon Black operations at the Kumar Mangalam Birla-led conglomerate.

Misra will assume his third position starting April 1. He is taking over from KK Maheshwari, the former managing director of Aditya Birla Chemicals who moved to lead the group’s UltraTech Cement business two years back. 

Misra said there will be no trouble managing three portfolios at the group, which shuffles, expands and sharpens responsibilities of senior management frequently. “I have very stable and competent teams at HR and Carbon Black. They know the deliverables, quality standards, professionalism expected. Once the expectations are set, life becomes easier,” Misra told ET.

“It (giving him another responsibility) has nothing to do with paucity of senior talent.” The $43 billion conglomerate also hired Kalyan Madabhushi from Shell as the business head of the chemicals sector. Madabhushi, formerly the global general manager for chemicals at Royal Dutch Shell, will report to Misra, who was one of Kumar Mangalam Birla's earliest hires and has been with the group for 22 years now.

“We had not decided who would be looking after for a longer term. We took some time to decide it. Birla asked me to oversee the chemical sector, so I accepted it,” Misra said. Aditya Birla Chemicals makes bulk and speciality chemicals and viscose filament yarn. The business is spread across 16 manufacturing locations in four countries: India, Thailand, Germany and China. Its India business was merged with Grasim in 2015."

16,2018-02-22,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group : Although cement demand has historically been better in the March quarter, large cement manufacturers with more than 15 million tonnes of capacity may not report any material rise in operating profit margins.

This is due to their inability to increase product prices in the first two months of the quarter. In the nine months to December 2017 quarter, their margins were 15-30 per cent depending upon the reach and pricing power.

The demand strength from the real estate, individual home builders (IHB) and infrastructure segments plays crucial role in price trend. This time around, demand from the real estate and IHB segments has been weak thereby curtailing major increase in cement prices.

While demand from the infrastructure segment has been stable, it accounts for just over one-fifth of the total cement demand.

It may not significantly offset the slowdown in real estate, which forms nearly two-thirds of the total cement consumption. Within housing, rural housing accounts for 30-35 per cent of the demand, and the rest is owing to urban housing.

Besides weak demand, cement companies are facing higher input costs. In the second half of 2017, prices of petcoke, imported coal and diesel rose sharply. In January 2018, Coal India increased price of linkage coal, which would add to the cost of cement production.

Despite higher raw material costs, companies have been unable to raise prices on sequential basis, unlike in the past when there was a price increase during the March quarter.

Except in the eastern region, cement prices have been range-bound in rest of India. Low-cost housing is driving demand in the eastern region. The average all-India cement price has not moved up from the December quarter levels of Rs 285 per 50 kg bag. In the eastern region, cement price is 3-10 per cent above the all-India average.

Investors will be better off by enhancing their exposure to large pan-India companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and The Ramco Cement. These companies will be able to raise sales volumes once the demand picks up given their size and geographical reach."
20,2018-02-27,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: A consortium of Dalmia Bharat and Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund emerged the top bidder for Binani Cement trumping Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement, with a Rs 6,700 crore offer that will see banks getting all their money back, challenging the assertion that bankers will face losses in every bankruptcy resolution case.

After a four-hour meeting in Mumbai, lenders led by Bank of Baroda voted for the Dalmia-Bain plan that also involves some equity infusion, said two senior bankers aware of the development.

This is likely to be the first debt resolution at the bankruptcy court in which lenders will not have to take any haircut on loans outstanding.

Bank of Baroda referred Binani Cement to the bankruptcy court after it failed to repay Rs 410 crore. Haircut refers to the amount lenders have to sacrifice to settle a loan.



“The total offer made by the Dalmia consortium is Rs 6,700 crore, which includes Rs 6,313 crore in dues to lenders and another Rs 400 crore of capital infusion for running the company,” said a banker who did not want to be identified.

Further, unsecured lenders will be given an option to accept cash or equity in lieu of dues.

Although UltraTech’s offer nearly matched that of Dalmia-Bain, the creditors did not favour it due to possible competition issues.

“Birla’s UltraTech offer was almost at par, but as per the evaluation criteria, they suffered on account of past penalties that were levied by the Competition Commission of India (CCI),” said another source. The lenders had appointed consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal to evaluate the bids.

UltraTech Cement had approached CCI over its Binani Cement bid. Incidentally, UltraTech has acquired two cement plants between 2014 and 2017 from JP Associate which has been approved by CCI.

Further, the promoter of Binani Industries had approached the Kolkata bench of the bankruptcy court seeking permission to participate in the resolution process on the grounds that the deal was being undervalued by resolution professional, Vijaykumar V Iyer, backed by Deloitte.

If the deal goes through, it will be the third such acquisition for Dalmia Bharat, following that of bankrupt Murli Cement and Kalyanpur Cement.

Others in the fray included billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in partnership with D-Mart promoter Radhakishan Damani, Heidelberg, the JSW Group and Ramco Cements.

Edelweiss ARC has the largest exposure with Rs 2,673 crore followed by Bank of Baroda with Rs 410 crore, State Bank of India (Rs 323 crore) and Canara Bank (Rs 320 crore). Among unsecured lenders, IDBI Bank has an exposure of Rs 1,567 crore followed by Exim Bank (Rs 617 crore) and Bank of Baroda’s London branch (Rs 175 crore)."

The Nifty50 index opened in the positive, but failed to hold above its immediate hurdle at the 10,430 level and witnessed a sharp drop towards the 10,215 mark.

It saw a correction of more than 200 points from its opening level and formed a bearish candle on the daily chart. The index also failed to complete its gap zone between 10,447 and 10,428 levels and formed a negative price pattern.

Now, holding below the 10,300-10,333 zone could extend its weakness towards 10,200 and then 10,100-10,074 zone, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,333 and then 10,430 levels.

On the option front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,000, followed by 10,400, while maximum Call open interest was at 10,700, followed by 10,500. 

Significant Call writing was seen at strike price 10,300 followed by 10,500, 10,600 and 10,400, which restricted its upside, while Put unwinding was seen at immediate strike prices, which created scope for a further drop.

The option band signified a shift in lower trading range between 10,100 and 10,450 levels for the coming sessions.

India VIX moved up 5.52 per cent to 16.24. VIX has spiked about 15 per cent in last two sessions, which gave the bears an upper hand. The upside seems to be capped as the Put-Call ratio has fallen in last four sessions.

Bank Nifty opened in the positive, but failed to hold above the 25,000 mark and witnessed a sharp drop towards the 24,350 mark. It broke the day’s low (Gujarat election results low) of 24,617 hit in December 2017 and triggered fresh selling pressure.

The index also broke its 200-DEMA and made lower tops and lower bottoms on the weekly scale. The index witnessed sustained selling after breaking the important support level and fell sharply in the last hour of trade.

Now, as long as the index holds below the 24750-24800 zones, weakness could continue and take it towards 23,900 and then 23,600 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at the psychologically important 25,000 mark.

Nifty futures closed with a 1.34 per cent loss at 10,226.

7,2018-03-08,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Lenders to bankrupt Binani Cement decided that the bid of a Dalmia Bharat-led consortium for the company, judged the highest offer, would be allowed, overruling the objections of Ultra-Tech Cement, said people with knowledge of the matter.

The Dalmia-led bid fulfilled all conditions and hence there was no reason to block it, they said. The consortium had also obtained clearance from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for the purchase, they added. “We are going with the Dalmia bid,” one of them said. “There is no need for us to re-look at the process.”

A consortium of Dalmia Bharat and the Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund emerged as the top bidder for Binani Cement, beating out Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement, with a Rs 6,700-crore offer, ET was the first to report on February 28. UltraTech then challenged the Dalmia-led bid at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday seeking more transparency on the evaluation of bids. Both bids were close to each other in value, said the people cited above.

At a closed-door meeting held Wednesday in Mumbai, the lenders involved decided to seek the approval of their respective boards on the Dalmia-Bain bid, said the people cited above. During the meeting, lenders were also informed that Dalmia had received CCI approval for the plan.

The core committee of lenders had declared the consortium led by Dalmia Bharat as the highest bidder. UltraTech, the lenders said, lost points on past penalties levied by CCI.



The Aditya Birla group, of which UltraTech is a part, has contested the penalties issue and argued that other factors should also be taken into consideration while selecting the winner.

This is likely to be the first debt resolution at the bankruptcy court in which lenders will not have to take any haircut on loans outstanding.

Bank of Baroda referred Binani Cement to the bankruptcy court after it failed to repay Rs 410 crore. Haircut refers to the amount lenders have to sacrifice to settle a loan.

The Rs 6,700-crore offer includes Rs 6,313 crore in dues to lenders and another Rs 400 crore of capital infusion for running the company.

Others in the fray included billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in partnership with D-Mart promoter Radhakishan Damani; Heidelberg; the JSW Group; and Ramco Cements.

Edelweiss ARC has the largest exposure with Rs 2,673 crore followed by Bank of Baroda with Rs 410 crore, State Bank of India (Rs 323 crore) and Canara Bank (Rs 320 crore). Among unsecured lenders, IDBI Bank has an exposure of Rs 1,567 crore followed by Exim Bank (Rs 617 crore) and Bank of Baroda’s London branch (Rs 175 crore). Bank of Baroda referred Binani Cement to the bankruptcy court after it failed to repay its loan.

If the deal goes through, it will be the third such acquisition for Dalmia Bharat, following that of bankrupt Murli Cement and Kalyanpur Cement."
8,2018-03-08,UltraTech,"The coal ministry has cancelled mining license for Mandla South coal block won by Jaypee cement following sale of attached plants to Ultratech Cement. 

Jaypee Cement sold three of the four projects attached to the Mandla South block in Madhya Pradesh, without the right to cola block, to Ultratech Cement on January 29 last year.

""The office of Nominated Authority got to know about the sale of end use plant only on when successful bidder was asked about the matter vide letter dated 7th/12th December 2017 . Hence, despite of various notices and letters from the office of Nominated Authority to adhere to the terms and conditions of the CMDPA, the successful bidder had sold the end use plants, which is major lapse on the part of successful bidder and also shows the clear intention of successful bidder of being not serious about the development of the coal mine,"" the ministry wrote in a letter to Jaypee Cement Corp.

The coal ministry has, however, sought explanation from the company within 15 days. Jaypee had won the Mandla South block with a bid of Rs 1,852 a tonne. The ready-to-produce block has extractable reserves 13.35 million tonne and is reserved for the non-power sector."
9,2018-03-09,UltraTech,"Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group-owned UltraTech Cement will increase its bid for Binani Cement by Rs 700 crore to Rs 7,200 crore, even as the bankrupt company’s committee of creditors on Wednesday approved the offer by a consortium of Dalmia-Piramal and Bain. 

“I would have bid for this value earlier only had we been invited by the resolution professional on our requests, since the margin between the highest and second-highest bidders was very less,” UltraTech chief financial officer Atul Daga told ET.

The company has emailed the resolution professional (RP) about the decision to increase the bid, but has yet to receive a response, he said.

UltraTech, India’s largest cement maker by capacity, is putting in the fresh bid after its requests to consider for the final round of bidding along with Dalmia Bharat went unheeded by lenders and the RP, the official appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal to manage the debt resolution process.

The company had moved the NCLT Kolkata on Tuesday seeking a more transparent way to evaluate bids. On hearing the petition, the judge told UltraTech that the company was “trying to stall the process” by pleading to the bankruptcy court for a “more transparent way of evaluating bids”.

“This higher bid shows that we are a serious bidder and we are not trying to stall the process,” said Daga.

“I would have bid for this increased value had we been invited by the RP earlier when we had requested him to do so.”

The company said it should be invited as the lenders are obliged under law to maximise the value of the transaction. The fresh bid has offered to repay the debt of the unsecured creditors of Binani Cement with an additional Rs 500 crore to various vendors and equipment suppliers.




ET was the first to report on Thursday that lenders to the debt-ridden cement maker have allowed Dalmia Bharat to acquire Binani, overruling the objections raised by Ultra-Tech. Lenders said the fresh bid would be considered by the committee of creditors but unlikely that the process would be repeated again.

“Since the offer has come to the RP in the afternoon, the matter will be taken up with the committee of creditors for their opinion,” said one of the people aware of the development.

“It is unlikely that the process will be considered since lenders have already announced Dalmia Bharat as highest bidder.”

Dalmia has already received the Competition Commission of India approval and can pay the lenders the day after NCLT endorses the deal.

But with the boards of the banks still to approve of Dalmia’s offer, UltraTech also stands to get a chance. Dalmia Bharat declined to comment.

Binani Cement, which owes close to Rs 4,000 crore to lenders, saw a close contest between a Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund consortium and UltraTech for the assets."

11,2018-03-09,UltraTech,"In an unprecedented act of co-operation among lenders, State Bank of India and a dozen other lenders agreed to be “sale ready” for bankrupt companies on which lenders have agreed on the resolution plan to ensure that civil litigation does not delay the revival, said two people familiar with the matter. 

This agreement between banks is essential since there are a lot of formalities like board approval and clearances from various committees of lenders before the committee of creditors could cast a final vote on the proposal cleared by the resolution professional, said those people who did not want to be identified. 

All lenders in a consortium would complete the formalities including board approvals for resolution plans even if a loser challenges the Resolution Professional’s plan in a civil court. 

The fact that the process has to be completed in 270 days, according to the bankruptcy code, makes bankers believe that courts would rule before the deadline even if decisions are challenged. 

“SBI has said that banks should take board approval for the bidder which could be subject to changes based on the court ruling,” said a person present at the meeting. “This is to mitigate risk in situations where there is a litigation by one of the bidders and if the court passes an order just a few days ahead of 270 days bankers should be ready so that they don’t miss out on the deadline.” 

Instances such as Larsen & Toubro seeking court intervention against Bhushan Steel resolution plan after lenders approved, UltraTech Cement questioning the evaluation process, and Liberty Group challenging the decision on Bhushan Power and Steel, have shaken banks who were expecting the new bankruptcy process to quicken their recovery process. 

Indian banks are suffering their highest bad loans with it being at nearly 10.8% for the entire system, and 13% for state-run banks"
12,2018-03-12,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Old habits die hard – and Indian promoters and companies are proving just that when it comes to bankrupt firms and those bidding for them. They are pursuing legal options that may end up delaying or even disrupting the insolvency resolution process.

While bankrupt companies such as Videocon Industries and BILT Graphic Paper are using the civil justice system to oppose resolution proceedings, companies including UltraTech Cement, Renaissance Steel, Larsen & Toubro and Liberty House are knocking on the doors of the National Company Law Tribunal with their gripes about the process followed under Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code.

Legal hurdles could stall the insolvency resolution process, Uday Kotak, vice chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said last week.

“I do not rule out litigation and courts with respect to the bankruptcy law. It will be tested in courts at some point. This 270-day limit for a resolution will be challenged at some point and either the law will be changed or the courts will allow liquidation,” Kotak said at an investors’ conference on Feb 26. Videocon, which owes over.`20,000 crore to lenders, approached the Bombay High Court against State Bank of India and the Reserve Bank of India, seeking a stay on SBI’s move to send it to the NCLT. The high court will hear its appeal on April 17.



BILT Graphic Paper, which owes Rs 7,000 crore to banks, moved the Delhi High Court against IDBI Bank and RBI after the bank initiated insolvency proceedings for defaulting on loan repayments. The Delhi High Court then ordered IDBI Bank not to initiate insolvency proceedings against the company.

“Judicial forums are used by some promoters directly or through related or interested parties by filing multiple applications at the resolution approval stage, thereby delaying the resolution or liquidation of the corporate debtor,” said Jyoti Singh, insolvency and disputes partner at Phoenix Legal. “What is more surprising is that none of these parties challenge the process during the CIRP (corporate insolvency resolution process) period.

While some of these parties may have genuine concerns and thus can’t be stopped from approaching NCLT or NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal), the delay in disposal of these applications is impacting the tempo with which IBC was proceeding a few months ago.” Companies bidding for bankrupt firms aren’t far behind either in seeking a legal remedy. UltraTech, India’s largest cement maker by capacity, moved NCLT Kolkata last week for a more transparent way to evaluate bids for bankrupt Binani Cement.

Lenders have approved the offer by a consortium of Dalmia Cement-Piramal and Bain."
13,2018-03-13,UltraTech,"A multi-cap scheme would be a good choice for investors who are not singularly focused on having a concentrated portfolio. A key advantage of investing in a multi-cap scheme is that the fund takes into account most growth stories that play out across sectors and companies of all sizes. After an encouraging third quarter numbers of FY18, it would be interesting to see how growth stories emerge in companies across market capitalisation. Therefore, by investing in multi-cap schemes, investors can improve the chances of getting the best of companies of all sizes. Among multi-cap schemes, SBI Magnum Multicap Fund has distinguished itself by performing consistently during most market cycles. The scheme invests 50-90% in large-cap stocks, 10-40% in mid-cap stocks and up to 10% in small-cap stocks. This diversification has worked well for the scheme. In the past three-year and five-year periods, it has delivered 12% and 20% returns, while its benchmark, S&P BSE500, has given 7% and 14% returns during the same period.

26,2018-03-16,UltraTech,"""Flabbergasted"" by the lenders' decision to pick its rival, Dalmia Bharat as the winning bidder in the Binani Cement case, UltraTech Cement CFO, Atul Daga is gearing up to raise the matter in the courts now.

""I am flabbergasted with the approach adopted by the lenders. IBC talks about maximising value for stakeholders, but they reducing value by Rs 700 crs. We will raise the issue with the courts,"" UltraTech Cement CFO Atul Daga told ETCFO late Thursday evening.

UltraTech’s contention is that its revised bid of Rs 7,266 crore with payment of 100 per cent of unsecured creditors (up by over Rs 700 crore) should be included in the final shortlist.

Daga is currently drawing solace from the parallel and nearly identical issues that are in being raised in the insolvency proceedings of Bhushan Power and Steel where the question is whether Liberty House bid should be be entertained.

The court, in that case has disallowed the creditors to decide on a final solution until a verdict is reached on the plea filed by the buyers over allegedly lack of transparency in the entire bidding process under the insolvency law.

""Bhushan case is identical to ours. I am sure, the judicial system does not do differential treatment on similar matters,"" Daga added.

UltraTech Cement had submitted the revised bids with the National Company Law Tribunal after the Committee of Creditors, in its last meeting chosen the Dalmia Bharat-led consortium's offer of Rs. 6,750 crore.

This was higher than the UltraTech's first bid of Rs 6,221 crore that claims to paid 71% dues to unsecured lenders. The revised bid was a Rs 700-crore increase to the initial bid, and one where 100% of all unsecured lenders were being satisfied. 

While the Binani Cements case is headed for a fierce court battle now, it raises a larger question for the policy makers in terms of whether the revised bids should be allowed or not under the insolvency law. And if they are to be allowed then at what stage and how?

When asked if revised bids would set a bad precedent for the future cases leading to undervaluation of stressed assets with suboptimal bidding in the earlier rounds, Daga says the resolution professional in the case should not have disclosed this in the earlier stages after the first round that ""there will be renegotiations of the final bids.""

Though Daga believes that UltraTech claims are unimpeachable according to the underlying principle of ""maximising value for the stakeholders"" under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, he concedes that the law should explicitly be clearer on this front. ""Yes, there is too much subjectivity in the bidding and evaluation process and lack of transparency,"" he says."

Accordingly, Ultratech has in-principle agreed to purchase 98.47 per cent of the shareholding of Binani Cement, subject to termination of IBC proceedings, entering into definitive agreement, and other customary and regulatory approvals, said the filing.

Binani Industries that is seeking the termination of insolvency proceedings against its cement company has also requested Ultratech to issue it a letter of comfort that will support their application seeking termination of the IBC proceedings. 

""The board of directors at its meeting held today, after considering the request made by Binani Industries has agreed to issue a letter of comfort confirming that the company will provide funds amounting to Rs 7,266 crore being the amount it had offered the Committee of Creditors in terms of the resolution plan submitted by it to acquire Binani Cement,"" Ultratech said in the release.

Besides, the group has also submitted a performance bank guarantee (PBG) of 10 per cent of upfront payment of its offer to the financial creditors of BCL, Dalmia Bharat Ltd said in an update filed to the exchanges.

The development comes a day after Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech Cement announced that it would acquire BCL by providing Rs 7,266 crore to its parent company Binani Industries Ltd (BIL).

Rajputana Properties Pvt Ltd (RPPL), a part of Damlia Bharat group, has made a Rs 6,350 crore bid along with 20 per cent equity in BCL.

In its filing today, Dalmia Bharat said a letter of intent was issued to RPPL by the RP of BCL and the same has been accepted by RPPL and delivered to the RP.

36,2018-03-20,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Noted banker Uday Kotak today warned that there is more pain lurking with the lenders from small businesses and called upon his peers to look more closely at this underbelly of the credit market.

Private sector banks are accounting for ""nearly entire"" loan growth following the nearly Rs 13,000-crore scam at the state-run PNB, he said and projected that over the next four years, they will corner half of the credit market, up from 30 per cent now.

Stating that worries with the likelihood of loans to small and medium enterprises are ""probably understated"", Kotak said the February 12 RBI circular on non-performing asset recognition will lead to an aggravation of the pain.

""The belief is that a lot of the challenges in the banking system are essentially on large businesses. I think we've also a pretty sensitive underbelly in the SME business which has not fully revealed its hands yet,"" he told reporters at an event of the bank.

Kotak said he hopes the PNB fraud, allegedly perpetrated by jewellers Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi of Gitanjali Gems, is an exception and all stakeholders, including the lenders, the regulator and government will have to work together to regain the lost trust.

He said the country has risen to being the number three in terms of dud loans after the troubled European economies of Greece and Italy, which calls for immediate remedial steps.

Kotak also mentioned the politically-sensitive issue of bank nationalisation, saying 50 years and so many frauds later, we need to ask a question as to what have been the advantages of this decision for the nation.

Describing the sudden twists and turns in the case of Binani Cements, which has got a Rs 7,266-crore out-of-court buyout offer from Ultratech Cement, as a one-off one, he said this should be seen as a teething trouble for the nascent IBC/NCLT framework.

""This is an extraordinary case. Technically, if equity value is positive, if full debt is paid back, the question is do we need to go through the NCLT process at all? These are teething problems which will inevitably come,"" Kotak said. He said even though the macro-situation has taken a beating in the last three years, the micro-situation has improved.

He blamed the massive NPA pains to poor diligence and underwriting of loans, especially to the infrastructure sector after the financial crisis of 2008 and an ever-greening of loans for the last eight years.

Due to the exuberant lending before the 2008 global credit crisis, Kotak said we should be happy if 40 per cent of the principal amount comes back with regard to loans that have gone awry recently.

Introduction of technological tools, which are currently being used extensively in retail lending, will help reduce NPAs in future, he said, adding such tools will be used extensively in the corporate sector as well.

On the recent headlines over regulations and RBI statement that it does not have parity on regulation when it comes state-run banks, Kotak said he feels the private sector banks are ""tightly regulated"".

Banking has been glamourised too much and there is a need for a cultural change which makes banking more boring. Kotak Mahindra Bank, the fourth largest by assets, will continue to invest in branches but will not need as much branches as its rivals, he said.

Meanwhile, he said Kotak Bank will be adopting a new operational charter called 'ABCD of finance' that stands for artificial intelligence enriching the apps, biometric-enabled branches, context-enhanced customer experience and data- empowered design."
35,2018-03-20,UltraTech,"KOLKATA: Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech Cement is likely to get support from Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement in the ongoing fight for control after the Birla company issued comfort letter worth Rs 7,266 crore to Binani group for 98.43 per cent stake.

UltraTech had said that Binani Industries Ltd (BIL) - the promoter firm of BCL - had approached it for arranging funds to pay off the lenders.

""As a creditor, we support the UltraTech offer as it offers a better deal for us,"" an official from a lead creditor told PTI.

This is despite the CoC's approval of the Dalmia Bharat's bid.

""Since, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code IBC proceedings initiated about 7-8 months back on Binani, a moratorium on interest had been imposed. The UltraTech offer allows the loan to a regular one and there will be no haircut even in the interest loss in the interim period,"" the official explained.

A revised bid after the CoC approval is perhaps a first instance and legal opinions remain divided on its sanity.

But, if the NCLT proceeding is challenged in the Supreme Court, CoC will support the move.

The bid by Dalmia Bharat Cement jointly with Bain Capital's Resurgent India Fund of Rs 6,350 crore has been to buy Binani Cement offering 20 per cent equity in Binani to the lenders.

The total secured and unsecured debt of financial creditors is around Rs 6,265 crore, of which the largest exposure is from Edelweiss ARC with an outstanding of about Rs 2,775 crore.

The Dalmia offer covered the financial creditors but several small operational creditors (read MSMEs) have claimed their debt has not been taken care of properly and haircut of even 80 per cent was sought, Rajesh Tibrewal, representing these operational creditors, said.

""We have also moved an intervention petition against the resolution professional (RP) for neglecting our interest and the same was listed for hearing on March 22, he said.

The MSME operational creditors' dues are about Rs 700 crore in Binani Cement, he added.

Tibrewal said that the insolvency law does not treat operational creditors at par with financial creditors which is lacunae in the law."
34,2018-03-20,UltraTech,"by Andy Mukherjee

Kumar Mangalam Birla just treated India's new bankruptcy law with utter disdain. But before you dismiss this as yet another instance of a billionaire behaving badly, think of the huge favor he's doing the legal system.

Normally, Birla's $1.1 billion offer to Binani Industries Ltd. for its 98.4 percent stake in Binani Cement would be unremarkable. Birla's UltraTech Cement Ltd., already the country's largest cement producer, gets to ramp up in anticipation of a much-awaited recovery in housing construction. Binani also has capacity in China and Dubai.

But this isn't a normal deal. Binani Cement is insolvent, and therefore belongs to creditors and not Binani Industries. What's more, the lenders — mostly state-run banks — have already accepted a Bain Capital-backed bid by Dalmia Bharat Ltd. UltraTech's petulant refusal to concede defeat came before the National Company Law Tribunal could give the deal its blessing.

It's one thing for Birla to complain that the sale to Dalmia-Bain wasn't transparent. But to make a counteroffer to the original owners, whose rights to make decisions for the cement unit ended the day the tribunal admitted the business into bankruptcy, smacks of disregard for the law.




That's actually a good thing. India’s bankruptcy code is new, and it’s a well-worn tradition of common law for new legislation to be made roadworthy by litigation, both real and frivolous. It’s the courts’ job to interpret the original intent of lawmakers and fill in the gaps. Many of life’s important questions -- like whether the tomato is a vegetable or fruit -- are decided by legal disputes.

So here are some questions for India's courts, which will obviously have to get involved now.

Will they see the UltraTech bid as a violation of creditors' rights to dispose of an insolvent asset? Or will they take the view that the ends justify the means, and that since the aim of the bankruptcy code is to maximize recovery rates for lenders, Birla's offer -- regardless of to whom it was made -- is valid?

The lenders may indeed be tempted to say yes to UltraTech. Not only does its proposal impose no haircuts on them, but bankers may also be hesitant to annoy Birla, who's a much bigger fish than Dalmia. However, if the creditors' committee is allowed to change its mind, shouldn't Dalmia-Bain be entitled to a breakup fee at least?

Finally, there's the question of fairness. Recovery rates of 100 percent shouldn't be a matter of unalloyed joy for lenders. For one thing, such an outcome suggests Binani Cement was merely illiquid, not insolvent. It's a matter of concern that controlling shareholder Binani Industries couldn't be persuaded by lenders to bring in more equity to service their loans. Now, should the Birla offer get approved, the same shareholder will make money after settling bankers' dues.

State-run Indian banks impose real costs on taxpayers when they make loan-loss provisions on nonperforming assets like Binani Cement. Every year, a cash-strapped government has to bring in new capital. At $32 billion, the latest India bank recapitalization plan is a large one. Lenders can write back extra provisions; taxpayers' gains are limited to having to provide less money to banks in future.

That's inadequate. To make deals more honest, successful bidders for insolvent assets should perhaps be prohibited from compensating original shareholders. Any winner who pays more than 100 percent of creditors' claims should write the check for the extra portion to the government instead.

A simple but uncharitable interpretation may be that Birla is a sore loser. Still, when it's used to test common law, greed may still be a force for good.

32,2018-03-20,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech stumped rival bidder Dalmia and lenders to the bankrupt Binani Cement by proposing to buy the promoters’ stake in Binani through a bilateral deal outside the formal bankruptcy process.

UltraTech, India’s biggest cement firm, told stock exchanges on Monday that it will issue a comfort letter to provide Rs 7,266 crore to Binani Industries to end insolvency proceedings against Binani Cement. The move appeared to catch Binani Cement’s lenders and Dalmia off guard especially after the vote last week by lenders in favour of Dalmia over UltraTech as part of the formal bankruptcy process. The AV Birla firm had bitterly opposed the selection of Dalmia by the lenders and is contesting the decision in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Kolkata. 

“Since Binani Industries is a listed company, it is its obligation to get better realisation of value and give it to the shareholders,” said KK Maheshwari, managing director, UltraTech.

“As a director, Binani is duty-bound to take care of all stakeholders that are getting affected by the bid.”

He said his company will ensure full repayment of debt to unsecured creditors also.

The move is likely to trigger a bitter battle as Dalmia may fight for control of the company which it believes it won in a fair contest at the NCLT.




The tribunal asked the resolution professional to submit the Dalmia plan with it on Monday and would consider it on March 22.

A banker involved in the process told ET that they have not received any formal offer from Binani Cement or UltraTech. “We as lenders have not received any offer from either Binani Cement or UltraTech Cement. However, for us to accept this offer, the bankruptcy proceeding against the company will have to be terminated and only Supreme Court can exercise that power,” he added. Lenders said that the plan has been endorsed by 99.5% of creditors and that they will endorse it again in all probability.

A person close to the development said that Dalmia Bharat has also given its letter of intent and bank guarantees worth Rs 600 crore to lenders and will have to be compensated by the creditors if Binani’s plea is accepted.

Indian bankruptcy laws provide for a process under which aprospective bidder can acquire the assets of a bankrupt firm. They don't provide for a settlement like the one agreed upon by UltraTech and Binani Industries, the promoter of Binani Cement.

Binani Industries said the decision to sell stake to UltraTech was to maximise the value of the asset.

“Section 60, clause 5 of the IBC gives power to NCLT to get a stressed asset out of the resolution process… they could also consider the provisions in the Companies Act,” said Sameer Kaji, senior adviser for corporate strategy, Binani Industries. “However, it is still to be seen how they exercise their power.” Legal experts were divided over whether UltraTech’s move was valid under law.

“The commercial agreement between Binani Industries and UltraTech is invalid as the powers of the directors of the company is suspended during the period when the company is under the bankruptcy proceedings,” says Shavez Mukri, a senior lawyer at Indialaw LLP, a legal firm. “UltraTech should have a resolution plan with the lenders and not directly with Binani.”

Alok Dhir, managing partner at Dhir & Dhir Associates and an insolvency expert, voiced a different opinion. “There is a right to redemption under the Contract Act for the borrower,” he said. “If they pay the entire amount due to the creditors, they can approach the Supreme Court under article 142 of the Constitution of India and seek complete justice and set aside the resolution process under the IBC.”

UltraTech petitioned the NCLT court in Kolkata for a more transparent evaluation process and cancellation of the Committee of Creditors meeting on March 14 which voted in favour of Dalmia. It also submitted its highest bid of Rs 7,266 crore to the court which heard the case on Monday. Binani Industries also told the court of its intention of selling stake to UltraTech. “We feel we have been aggrieved… we were not happy with the level of transparency that we sought from the RP,” Kaji of Binani said.

Binani owes close to Rs 3,800 crore to financial creditors and Rs 500 crore to operational creditors. Other liabilities include Rs 400 crore of statutory dues, Rs 620 crore of corporate guarantees of EXIM Bank which got invoked prior to the beginning of the resolution process, and another set of guarantees for foreign assets worth Rs 240 crore."

43,2018-03-21,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement today said that it has not violated the IBC in offering a Rs 7,266 crore bid to acquire debt ridden Binani Cement (BCL), which was already set to be sold to the Dalmia Bharat group by its creditors.

UltraTech has announced to acquire BCL by providing Rs 7,266 crore to its parent company Binani Industries Ltd (BIL) against bid of Rs 6,350 crore along with 20 per cent equity in BCL by Rajputana Properties, a part of Dalmia Bharat group, approved by the resolution professional (RP).

""We are fully compliant with IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code). We have submitted our bid. We are allowed to revise our bids. IBC says maximise value and if the banker is getting higher amount of money before they have taken a decision, then they should take a decision with their eyes open,"" UltraTech Cement CFO Atul Daga told PTI.

He further added that the company is ""committed to honour"" the amount which it has offered.

""We have filed it with NCLT, well before the Committee of Creditors (CoC) recommendation was put out, well before CoC filed their resolution plan bid with NCLT. Where we have gone wrong?,"" Daga added.

He said UltraTech agreed to issue 'comfort letter' to provide Rs 7,266 crore in return for 98.43 per cent stake in Binani Cement after an approach from the owners of BCL.

""If they can take the company out of insolvency proceedings, we are happy to pay the same amount of money to buy the company and it has to be used to repay the debt. For that purpose they wanted a letter of comfort and we have given them a letter of comfort. I do not think that we have gone against IBC anyway,"" Daga added.

According to him, some of the creditors who were not happy with Dalmia Group bids have approached NCLT backing Ultratech's bid.

""All the creditors, who are against the bid from the present resolution plan have gone to NCLT. They are trade creditors, suppliers who have filed the claim at NCLT,"" said Daga.

He further said, ""SBI Hongkong, Exim bank had filed a case for maximisation of the value because clearly they were feeling let down by the proposal accepted by the majority of the creditor"".

Meanwhile, in a separate development, BIL denied reports of resolution professional alleging fraud by BIL promoters.

""The question of any fraud committed by the company or by members of the board of directors of the company does not and cannot arise as all the accounts of the company and the holding companies are fully audited and all transactions, including related party transaction have been disclosed,"" BIL said in a regulatory filing.

Dalmia Bharat had yesterday informed stock exchanges that its Rs 6,350-crore bid has been submitted by RP before NCLT for approval and it has also submitted a performance bank guarantee (PBG) of 10 per cent of upfront payment of its offer to the financial creditors of BCL."
44,2018-03-22,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The promoters of Binani Cement are trying to “thwart the IBC process” by getting out of the resolution process and stalling the attempt of the government to find a solution for the Rs 4 lakh crore worth of stressed assets, a senior executive at Dalmia Bharat said on Wednesday.

“Binani Cement wants to thwart the IBC,” Mahendra Singhi, group CEO — Cement at Dalmia Bharat told ET. “It’s not a matter of Binani-Dalmia deal. It is a matter of all the 4 lakh crore of assets under the hammer,” Singhi said.

Dalmia, which has partnered with Piramal Bain Resurgence Fund for this asset, also said that with such uncertainties, India may not be able to attract the right kind of funds — FIIs (Foreign institutional invetsors) and PE Funds as such funds are “totally averse to such uncertain conditions”.

A day after the alleged fraudulent transactions undertaken by Binani Cement came to light, Dalmia Bharat that has emerged as the preferred bidder for the asset also said that the company may have initiated its side deal with UltraTech to conceal the forensic investigation underway against them.

“It is likely that Binani Industries may have opted for a sidedeal with UltraTech Cement to come out of the IBC process so that the forensic investigation is stopped,” Singhi said.

Speaking to ET, Singhi admitted that the company was aware of some related party transactions that it found “suspicious” at the time it was conducting its due diligence.

Accordingly, Dalmia did not consider it as a receivable and hence its offer does not stand to get affected in any way. To be sure, Singhi did not allege UltraTech to be in the know of it but added that with the Aditya Birla group’s high level of corporate governance standards, the company may want to rethink giving Binani its letter of comfort. However, UltraTech is not taking a decision just yet."
45,2018-03-22,UltraTech,"The recent sell-off in domestic equity markets has dragged the NSE Nifty below its 200-Day Moving Average (DMA), signalling that the index is losing momentum. So far this year, the 50-share benchmark has already slipped over 2 per cent to 10,155 till March 21.

More than 30 stocks on the Nifty50 are trading below their 200-DMAs. The list included Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Hindalco, HPCL, Lupin, ONGC and SBI.

Even on the Nifty500, as many as 294 stocks that constitute nearly 60 per cent of the pack, are trading under their 200-DMAs. This shows that the market is facing selling pressure across sectors.

Stocks trading below this crucial support line include names like Aban Offshore, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Asian Paints, Aurobindo Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bank of Baroda, Cipla, Colgate-Palmolive, Corporation Bank, Cox & Kings, DCB Bank, Dewan Hosing Finance Corporation, Dish TV, ICRA and NMDC, among others.

Moving averages are a tool for analysing the trend of a stock or even an index. They provide useful information on the support and resistance points.







Usually, any trader or investor uses three major DMAs - Daily Moving Averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 DMA. When a stock is trading above all of its DMAs, it is usually said to be in a continuing uptrend.

During corrective moves, stocks are often seen coming off their highs and are slipping below moving averages. Shallow corrections see stocks testing their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause the stock not only to test 200-DMA but also slip below it.

Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, said, “If any stock trades below its 200-DMA, that means it is undergoing a serious corrective action. However, just because a stock trades below its 200-DMA does not mean that it is in a major bear trend. It just implies it is undergoing a major corrective move.”

Vaishnav told ETMarkets.com: “Bear trend in a stock sets in only if shorter term averages start trading below the longer term averages. As long as 50-DMA trades above 100-DMA and 100-DMA trades above 200-DMA, the stock just remains in a major corrective activity without any bear trend being initiated.” 

The 200-day average, also known as long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for the index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter. A 20-day average measures a month and 10-day average two weeks.

S H Kelkar, Shree Renuka Sugars, Siemens, SJVN, SML Isuzu, Snowman Logistics, Tata Coffee, Tata Power, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, Va Tech Wabag and Vardhman Textiles are among other stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 49 points up at 10,204 in early trade on Thursday. 

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking, said, “We reiterate that traders should remain light within this consolidation and should rather focus on individual stocks with a proper exit strategy. Directionally, the market is still not done with the corrective phase and hence, booking timely profits in existing longs with a short-term view makes a good play for the momentum traders.”"
47,2018-03-22,UltraTech,"KOLKATA: Hopes seem to have brightened for the Dalmia Bharat Group in its quest to acquire Binani Cement, after the Committee of Creditors (CoC) today downplayed the alleged fraud by Binani's promoters, saying it was not related to the sale process.

""All the details are in the data room. The fraud is nothing to do with the sale. If the offer is proper, the tribunal can consider it,"" a counsel on behalf of the CoC said before the NCLT, according to a source close to one of the bidders.

Resolution Professional (RP) Vijaykumar V Iyer had moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), alleging suspect and fraudulent transactions in Binani carried out by an independent forensic auditor.

The source said an unsecured creditor, Exim Bank, having exposure of about Rs 620 crore, has filed an application for maximising value in the sale.

The ramification of Exim Bank's application could not be immediately ascertained.

Ultratech Cement, another prospective bidder for Binani Cement, has offered a higher valuation of about Rs 7,200 crore against Rs 6,500-6,600 crore bid by Dalmia Bharat.

The Kolkata bench of NCLT today heard a few applications with regard to the alleged fraud.

Lawyers associated with Binani Cement and UltraTech interpreted the tribunal's order as implying that the RP will have to respond by March 26.

Binani Group counsel said the company has also moved an application for termination of insolvency proceedings, but the same did not come up for hearing.

The next hearing has been fixed for March 27. ,"
46,2018-03-22,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has adjourned the Binani Cement case to March 27, said lawyers who were present at the court during a hearing Thursday.

As many as 14 applications were made at Kolkata’s bankruptcy courts involving the resolution plan for Binani Cement, which is facing insolvency proceedings.

The Binani case involves objections raised by UltraTech Cement that its offer was not being considered even as India’s biggest cement maker sought to pay Rs 700 crore more than a Dalmia Bharat-led consortium that was declared the winner by lenders to the defaulting manufacturer. Binani Industries, the promoter of Binani Cement, has joined UltraTech in the plea stating that it was not allowed to participate in the meetings held by the committee of creditors while drawing up the resolution plan.

A day after lenders declared Dalmia Bharat as the highest bidder, UltraTech moved the tribunal and offered to pay more. The committee of creditors, which has the power to decide the fate of Binani Cement, voted in favour of the Dalmia consortium because the offer from UltraTech was deemed invalid since its revised bid came a few days after the binding bids were submitted, said senior officials aware of the development.

During the court hearing, resolution professional Vijaykumar Iyer said that he followed all the processes diligently. He told the court that Binani Industries was not allowed to attend the meeting since a forensic audit by Haribhakti and Co LLP showed diversion of funds amounting to about Rs 2,400 crore.

Furthermore, Binani Industries has approached the court with a plea that it wants to terminate the NCLT proceedings against its subsidiary Binani Cement after signing an agreement with UltraTech, which would buy 98% of the existing promoter’s stake in the debt-laden cement maker.

However, lenders say that it would require the Supreme Court’s special intervention. Several operational creditors, too, have joined UltraTech Cement in accusing the resolution professional of being unfair to their claims."

50,2018-03-28,UltraTech,"KOLKATA: The bankruptcy court on Tuesday suggested an out-of-court settlement between Binani Cement and its lenders, almost paving the way for Aditya Birla firm UltraTech Cement’s takeover of the troubled company outside the insolvency proceedings.

The Kolkata bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has asked the committee of creditors (CoC) to take up a proposal by Binani Industries, the parent of Binani Cement, to pay off all lenders’ dues for ‘appropriate consideration’.

Binani Industries had approached NCLT, seeking termination of insolvency proceedings after getting a letter of comfort from UltraTech Cement, which proposed to infuse Rs 7,266 crore by picking up a 98.43 per cent stake in Binani Cement ‘subject to termination’ of insolvency proceedings. The company also offered to pay off all its dues to the financial and operational creditors within two weeks. Earlier, CoC had selected a Dalmia Bharat-led consortium as the winning bidder under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings after rejecting UltraTech’s bid.

The latter then alleged lack of transparency in the proceedings while pointing out that its bid was higher, and followed it up with a deal with Binani Industries outside the ongoing resolution process.

“We are not giving any directions, we are only asking the CoC to take this up for appropriate consideration at their liberty,” Justice Jinan KR of NCLT bench clarified while making the suggestion to consider Binani’s offer to lenders. “A harmonious settlement which has come up for consideration can always be looked into,” he said.

The CoC counsel argued that out-of-court settlements are admissible under the Supreme Court and not NCLT.

Justice Jinan wondered why the stakeholders are not open to an amenable out- of-court settlement, pointing out that there are numerous instances of out-of- court settlements.

Ankur Singhi, senior partner at S K Singhi & Co LLP, the counsel for operational creditors, said NCLT may use its inherent powers as per Section 60(5) of the IBC Code read along with rule 11 of the NCLT rules to suggest out-of-court settlement.

“As per the submissions made before the Hon’ble Tribunal, Binani Industries is willing to pay off all its creditors — financial as well as operational. It seems to be fair,” he said.

The matter will be heard again on April 2.

Singhi said NCLT has directed Binani Industries to serve its application upon CoC and all other applicants. After receiving the application, CoC will deliberate and give their concurrence or dissent. “An offer has been made by Binani Industries and will be placed in front of the CoC for consideration. I can’t say it is an out of court settlement,” he said."
51,2018-03-29,UltraTech,"For now, it’s advantage Ultratech in the battle for Binani Cement. By getting the ousted promoters and unsecured lenders on its side and putting more money on the table, the Aditya Birla group company has convinced the Kolkata bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to give it a second chance. The NCLT on Tuesday asked the parties – promoters of Binani Cement, Ultratech Cement, the creditors, and Dalmia Bharat, to explore an out-of-court settlement. Next week, the parties are likely to get back to the tribunal with their decisions.


The target
Binani Cement, a subsidiary of listed Binani Industries, has become a coveted asset due to two reasons. First, it has 165 million tonnes of limestone reserves (expected to last for 35 years). Second, it is a significant player in the Rajasthan-Haryana belt. It is also said that the company’s inherent value was higher than the non-performing assets (NPAs) of around Rs 4,000 crore on the lenders’ books ‑‑ suggesting “it was just illiquid, not insolvent"".

 Also, a new investor has the potential to expand the present capacity of about 6.25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to up to 11.5 mtpa, say Binani sources. While the acquisition would help Binani Cement consolidate its position in the northern markets, it would also keep emerging competitors such as the Dalmias at bay. 

 Dalmia Bharat has recently snapped up two distressed companies in the insolvency process – Murli Industries and Kalyanpur. The two deals, relatively smaller at about Rs 400 crore each, gave Dalmia, which has a strong presence in the south, better access in west and east, respectively. Binani’s 6.25 mtpa Sirohi facility would have cemented the company’s national presence, say analysts. 





The Ultratech offer
Ultratech, which was conservative in initial bidding rounds, considerably sweetened the deal in the second week of March. In an e-mail sent to the committee of creditors, Ultratech had offered 100% upfront cash payment of dues to secured and unsecured financial creditors. While it would pay Rs 4,048 crore to secured financial creditors, it offered Rs 2,427 crore to unsecured financial creditors. About Rs 350 crore would go to capex and working capital. The insolvency process would cost Rs 114.1 crore. Operational creditors (Rs 307 crore) and employees (Rs 18 crore) would get the rest.

 Analysts, however, feel the price is steep. 

 Binod Kumar Modi, senior analyst, Reliance Securities, said, “We still believe that the price being paid for the assets looks higher and is earning decretive for initial years. However, with the ramp-up in utilisation and cost efficiencies, it may turn cash positive in the due course.” He said Ultratech’s global presence would help shore up Binani’s ailing Chinese and Dubai subsidiaries.

 The additional money offered by Ultratech covered the interests of unsecured financial creditors such as SBI Hong Kong and Exim Bank. These had also impleaded themselves before the NCLT, making the case stronger for the Birla company.

 Mahesh Agarwal, among the battery of lawyers representing Ultratech, said, “Ultratech has a strong case. It has given a revised bid on March 14. If the committee of creditors (CoC) had the higher bid, it had to consider. The job of CoC is to look after interests of all creditors, not just the secured financial creditors.”


Role of RP
The tribunal’s decision puts a question mark on the way the resolution professional (RP) conducted the corporate insolvency process. The RP’s report alleging fraud by promoters of Binani Cement after the announcement of H1 bidder (the highest bidder) has led to counter-charges that this was an afterthought as no such report was made available in the data room during the bidding process. Resolution professional Vijay Kumar Iyer of Deloitte declined to comment saying, “We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters.” However, in an e-mail in response to Ultratech’s offers and contentions, Iyer had contended that his actions were bound by the insolvency code and rules under it and said, “… due opportunity was given to each of the resolution applicants to present their resolution plan to the CoC, pursuant to which you had presented your resolution plan on February 23, 2018”.


Who is the top bidder? 

For Dalmia Bharat, which had been originally declared the H1 bidder with an offer of Rs 6,350 crore when the bidding process closed last month, it is a proverbial slip. It will have to cough up more to match Ultratech’s revised offer of Rs 7,266 crore or concede. The significant amount of time and resources that it had invested in the process might go waste unless compensated as part of the out-of-court settlement. 

 After Ultratech claimed in an exchange filing on Wednesday that a clearance by Competition Commission of India (CCI) for its bid fortified its claim as the H1 bidder, Dalmia Bharat broke its silence and issued a strong statement rebutting the claims.

 Defending the resolution professional's assessment, Mahendra Singhi, group CEO, Dalmia Bharat said, ""The reasons cited by the unsuccessful bidder for its failed bid, in stock exchange filings and press interviews, are misleading. Dalmia Bharat made the highest financial bid and had also obtained the highest score in the evaluation”.

 We state emphatically that the likelihood of obtaining the CCI approval by a bidder was 
not at all a criterion in bid evaluation. In fact, CCI approval was contemplated to be a post-NCLT approval step and hence had been made a carved-out condition precedent to the resolution plans of all the resolution applicants,"" Singhi added. 


Uncharted territory
Lawyers close to Ultratech have referred to the preamble of the insolvency law, which stipulates that it is a legislation to provide “resolution of corporate persons…in a timebound manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons…balance the interests of all the stakeholders”. The insolvency code’s emphasis is on maximisation of value of assets and balancing the interests of all stakeholders. It is not just a recovery mechanism by banks.

 But out-of-court settlement is a tricky issue in insolvency code, experts point out. In the past, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that such a move would go against the spirit of the insolvency law. In June last year, NCLT had initiated insolvency proceedings against Lokhandwala Kataria Construction on a case filed by Nisus Finance and Investment Managers LLP.

 Later, the parties decided to settle the matter. However, in July, the NCLAT put a spanner in the works, saying bilateral deals should not be allowed since insolvency proceedings involve multiple stakeholders such as secured and unsecured financial creditors, operational creditors, and employees. 

 The Supreme Court later allowed the settlement under Article 142 of the Constitution but made clear that the NCLAT’s position was correct on law.

 “By the impugned order dated 13.07.2017, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal was of the view that the inherent power could not be so utilised. According to us, prima facie this appears to be the correct position in law. However, since all the parties are before us today, we utilise our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to put a quietus to the matter before us,” the apex court had said. A few days later, it took a similar position in the matter of Mother’s Pride Dairy vs. Potrait Advertising and Marketing. 

 Given the high stakes involved and complexity brought in by multiple stakeholders, it looks like the battle for Binani will travel to Delhi, first to the appellate body and eventually to the highest court."
1,2018-04-03,UltraTech,"The lenders' committee of Binani Cement Ltd is slated to meet tomorrow to explore the possibility of an out-of-court settlement, in line with the observations made by the NCLT Kolkata bench.

A meeting of the Committee of Creditors has been called on April 4 to consider the NCLT order, CoC sources said.

A panel of two-member judges had extended the deadline for the CoC of bankrupt Binani Cement till April 9, to consider a proposal mooted by the Binani promoters for an out-of-court settlement and end NCLT proceedings.

""We cannot say anything now. We are reviewing all the aspects,"" a senior Binani official said.

Binani's offer is worth Rs 7,266 crore and promises to cover all secured and unsecured creditors without any haircut in the settlement.

Binani Industries had moved the NCLT for termination of insolvency proceedings, after it received a comfort letter from UltraTech Cement of about Rs 7,200 crore.

The CoC had earlier issued a letter of intent to Dalmia Bharat Cement-led consortium, which emerged as the H1 bidder and applied to NCLT for the final nod.

Dalmia Bharat Cement CEO Mahendra Singhi is of the view that once resolution plan is submitted to the NCLT, there is a binding contract with CoC and the party, and thus an out-of-court settlement was not possible."
0,2018-04-03,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) today allowed the parties in dispute over selling of debt-ridden Binani Cement to amicably settle the dispute. 

A two-member bench of the appellate tribunal headed by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya gave liberty to the parties entangled in vexatious litigations, to settle the case amicably. 

""We give liberty to parties to reach settlement and approach appropriate forum for approval of the settlement,"" the NCLAT said. 

The appellate tribunal was hearing a petition filed by Binani Industries, which holds over 90 per cent share in Binani Cement. 

""Learned counsel for the appellant submit that appellant has offered a better amount that is 100 per cent approximately of the dues to the committee of creditors (CoC),"" the court said. 

As per the IBC code, after a resolution plan is approved by the the CoC, it is forwarded to NCLT for approval. 

Earlier, on March 27, the Kolkata bench of NCLT had also suggested that the parties go for settlement. 

While Dalmia Bharat has offered an amount of Rs 6,500 crore for Binani Cement, UltraTech of the Aditya Birla Group, which had entered into a bilateral pact with the promoters of Binani, agreed to pay Rs 700 crore more at Rs 7,200 crore. 

Binani Cement owes around Rs 7,000 crore to its creditors. 

The dispute relates to UltraTech Cement's allegations that the process for choosing the top bidder was not transparent and that the resolution professional (RP) had not followed established best practices. Dalmia Bharat was declared the top bidder. 

UltraTech then moved NCLT and also wrote to Binani Cement's RP, offering to increase its bid price. But when it was not accepted, UltraTech struck a deal with Binani Industries to buy its 98.43% stake in the cement unit, provided the insolvency case was terminated. 

Binani Industries then approached NCLT asking that the case be terminated."
5,2018-04-04,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Lenders to Binani Cement have asked its promoter company Binani Industries to get the Supreme Court’s stamp of approval for its out-of-court deal with Ultratech Cement, banking sources close to the development told ET on Wednesday.

In the meeting that had taken place on the suggestion of the NCLT, Kolkata, for lenders to “explore the possibility of an out-of-court settlement”, bankers also decided that they will be asking UltraTech to pay a deposit of Rs 750 crore as a proof of its commitment toward the deal. They would also seek a bank guarantee for the amount that remains after deducting the deposit from Rs 7,266 crore, which UltraTech has offered to buy out the Binani Industries stake in the debt-laden Binani Cement.

“We have asked Binani Industries to go to the appropriate authority for the stamp of approval for the settlement,” banking sources said. “We have also asked UltraTech to furnish a deposit of Rs 750 crore and give a bank guarantee for the amount that remains,” the source added.

UltraTech has already got a letter of comfort from HDFC Bank for its payment to Binani. 

The deal, which involves UltraTech paying Rs 7,266 crore to the promoter company in return for its 98.4% stake in Binani Cement, has hurt Dalmia Bharat’s prospects of being awarded the stressed asset.

The promoter will be using the amount to pay back lenders all their dues and thus withdrawing the 6 MT company from the resolution process. UltraTech has already given the promoters a letter of comfort regarding its intent to pay. 

Binani Industries does not want to take a decision just yet. A source close to the company said that it will wait for the April 9 NCLT hearing to take place and then take call.

The decision to let parties approach the Supreme Court has emerged from the reluctance of the lenders to be the deciding body for a matter that lacks a precedent as of now. On Tuesday, the IBC panel had recommended a change in the IBC which would let the CoC decide on withdrawal of a company from the IBC process if 90% of the creditors agree. However, this is yet to become a law. 

""The question is who will bell the cat,"" said a source close to the developments who did not wish to be identified. 

On the other hand, according to experts, in the current legal framework, borrowers do stand a chance of approaching the Supreme Court for termination of insolvency proceedings under such circumstances. 

“There is a right to redemption under the Contract Act for the borrower,” said Alok Dhir, managing partner at Dhir & Dhir Associates and an insolvency expert. “If they pay the entire amount due to the creditors, they can approach the Supreme Court under article 142 of the Constitution of India and seek complete justice and set aside the resolution process under the IBC.”

However, Dalmia Bharat is resolute that if the CoC takes a call that is against the prescribed letter of the IBC, the company will not shy from taking the legal recourse . 

""We are a law compliant company and we will defend the law,"" Mahendra Singhi, group CEO- Cement at Dalmia Bharat said. 

Singhi also said that Dalmia has sent letters to all banks that they are liable for a breach of trust if they act out of the contract signed with the company by which the company has paid Rs 600 crore as bank guarantees. 

Binani Cement owes about Rs 7,000 crore to both financial and operational creditors. Even though Dalmia Bharat, with its offer of Rs 6,500 crore, had been voted as the highest bidder by lenders, things took a different turn when Binani Industries approached UltraTech to buy out its stake in Binani Cement for Rs 7,266 crore that was UltraTech’s increased offer for the asset and involved a 100% payout to both secured and unsecured lenders."
4,2018-04-04,UltraTech,"KOLKATA: The prospect of UltraTech Cement taking over the bankrupt Binani Cement became brighter after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) advised on Tuesday all related parties to settle the dispute amicably. This is in line with what the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had advised in an order earlier.

The committee of creditors will meet on Wednesday to discuss the proposal by Binani Cement's parent Binani Industries regarding the Rs 7,266-crore UltraTech offer. A top source close to the development told TOI that the lenders to Binani Cement are likely to take a closer look at Binani Industries' plea.

On Tuesday, a two-member bench of the appellate tribunal headed by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya said that it gave the related parties the liberty to reach a settlement and approach the appropriate forum for an approval. The appellate tribunal was hearing a petition filed by Binani Industries, which holds over 90% in Binani Cement.

Binani Industries had moved the NCLAT against the resolution professional of Binani Cement, alleging that its order was not followed while declaring a successful plan for the struggling cement maker. There was an allegation relating to disclosure too. Binani Industries also asked the NCLAT to declare the meeting of the committee of creditors held on March 14 as ""null and void"".

Earlier, the NCLT had suggested in an order that - in the larger interest of all stakeholders - the possibility of having a harmonious settlement be considered. ""Talk of settlement, if any, is at the liberty of the committee of creditors,"" the order said. The creditors' panel has to get back to NCLT on April 9 with its opinion on the offer. However, a source in Dalmia Bharat Cement (DBC) said it still believes that an outof-court settlement is not under the purview of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. DBC has already written to the creditors against an attempt for having an out-of-court settlement. It said that such a development would violate the binding agreement between the creditors' panel and DBC.

TOI had earlier reported that the final offer of DBC, which was voted on and approved by the committee of creditors, is over Rs 6,900 crore - substantially higher than what was conceived as its offer of around Rs 6,400 crore. The offer was subsequently filed by DBC's resolution professional to the NCLT. The revised offer of Ultra-Tech was for Rs 7,266 crore."
3,2018-04-04,UltraTech,"KOLKATA: The prospect of UltraTech Cement taking over the bankrupt Binani Cement became brighter after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) advised on Tuesday all related parties to settle the dispute amicably. This is in line with what the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had advised in an order earlier.

The committee of creditors will meet on Wednesday to discuss the proposal by Binani Cement's parent Binani Industries regarding the Rs 7,266-crore UltraTech offer. A top source close to the development told TOI that the lenders to Binani Cement are likely to take a closer look at Binani Industries' plea.

On Tuesday, a two-member bench of the appellate tribunal headed by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya said that it gave the related parties the liberty to reach a settlement and approach the appropriate forum for an approval. The appellate tribunal was hearing a petition filed by Binani Industries, which holds over 90% in Binani Cement.

Binani Industries had moved the NCLAT against the resolution professional of Binani Cement, alleging that its order was not followed while declaring a successful plan for the struggling cement maker. There was an allegation relating to disclosure too. Binani Industries also asked the NCLAT to declare the meeting of the committee of creditors held on March 14 as ""null and void"".

US Escalates China Trade Showdown 
The Trump administration on Tuesday raised the stakes in a growing trade showdown with China, announcing 25% tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing’s intellectual property practices. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office unveiled a list of mainly non-consumer products representing about $50 billion of estimated 2018 imports that would hit supply chains for many U.S. manufacturers.

MCLR: Helping or Hurting Borrowers?
Reserve Bank of India has ordered banks to harmonise base rate with the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) beginning April 2018 to ensure that customers benefit from the interest rate movements. Base rate is the benchmark that banks use to charge consumers who took home loans before April 2016, and MCLR is the latest benchmark based on cost of funds, which the RBI has mandated banks to use for charging customers. Unfortunately, banks would be passing on higher rates in the next few years as the two-year lower interest rate cycle turns after depriving borrowers of lower rates for years when base rate was independent of cost of funds. 


Cognizant Tax Case
The Madras High Court on Tuesday asked the Income-Tax Department to release bank deposits of over Rs 2,500 crore of software exporter Cognizant, which it had frozen following a dispute over unpaid taxes on dividend paid to its overseas parent.

A lien, a form of a security interest, is to be created over the rest of the disputed amount till the case is resolved.

Last week, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement had decided to stick with the offer from Dalmia Bharat Cement for the debt-ridden firm's sale under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

Moreover, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had also asked the adjudicating authority, which is National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), to proceed with the resolution process of Binani Cement as per the IBC.

""As far as we are concerned, we have a clear cut direction from NCLAT to do the process as per the law and in a timebound manner. That's why we are confident that NCLT will be approving our resolution plan on April 9 and that should pave the way for resolving this asset,"" Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd Group CEO Mahendra Singhi said.

On April 5, while posting the matter for further hearing on April 19, the NCLAT had stated that ""pendency of the appeal will not come in the way of the Adjudicating Authority to proceed with the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process in accordance with the provisions of I&B Code, 2016"".

NCLAT Chairperson Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya had further observed that the NCLT ""may pass order uninfluenced by the impugned order"" of March 27 it had passed and NCLAT's order of April 3, 2018.

""It is great development as the whole process of resolution will not get delayed,"" Singhi said, adding the case would also show the world that India can bring resolution of stressed assets in a time-bound manner.

Last Tuesday, the NCLAT had given Binani Industries and CoC the 'liberty' to reach settlement after the company had submitted before it stating that it had ""offered better amount which is approximately 100 per cent of the dues to the Committee of Creditors"".

On March 27, the Kolkata bench of NCLT had stated that ""in the larger interest of all stakeholders, possibility of having a harmonious settlement is to be considered, parties are free to consider it out of Tribunal"".

The next hearing of the matter will take place at the Kolkata bench of the NCLT on April 9.

Last month, Dalmia Cement had said its Rs 6,350-crore bid to buy Binani Cements Ltd (BCL) through its subsidiary Rajputana Properties was accepted by the lenders. It had also offered 20 per cent equity in Binani to the lenders.

However, later, UltraTech Cement entered into an agreement with BIL to buy 98.43 per cent stake in BCL. It had also agreed to issue a comfort letter to provide Rs 7,266 crore to Binani Industries Ltd for ending insolvency proceedings against Binani Cement.

Singhi said such a development would have been a breach of contract.

""The offer process has ended and we have already given bank guarantee of around Rs 630 crore. The whole purpose was to have a transparent process,"" he said.

Amid the developments, last week Binani Industries Ltd stated that it had filed application for termination of insolvency resolution process of its debt-ridden subsidiary Binani Cement Ltd (BCL)."
11,2018-04-09,UltraTech,"UltraTech’s chances of winning the battle for bankrupt Binani Cement strengthened as lenders backed the Aditya Birla Group company's bid, although the banks have left the matter to be decided by the Supreme Court, said sources in the banking and cement industry.

The banks have extended conditional support to UltraTech’s bid, seeking indemnity from Binani Industries, parent of Binani Cement, against any potential litigation by a consortium led by Dalmia Bharat that had been declared the winner with a Rs 6,700-crore offer. UltraTech subsequently announced that it had signed an agreement with Binani Industries to buy out the latter’s 98.47% stake in Binani Cement for Rs 7,266 crore.

“At a marathon meeting on Saturday, lenders decided to give their consent to settle their debt with Binani Industries provided it is approved by the Supreme Court,” said a senior official aware of the development.

“Banks have asked Binani industries to indemnify the financial creditors for all legal liabilities that may arise if Dalmia Bharat moves court against the lenders for an agreement that may happen outside the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.”




With the backing of lenders, Binani Industries will move the Supreme Court on Monday seeking an out-of-court settlement with banks for its subsidiary Binani Cement, which is facing bankruptcy proceedings for dues of more than Rs 7,000 crore to financial and operational creditors, said the people cited above.

Binani Industries has deposited Rs 750 crore with HDFC Bank to show its commitment to the deal with UltraTech along with a bank guarantee for the remaining Rs 6,516 crore. It has said the money will be credited to the account within three days of the deal being approved by the Supreme Court.

The Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal consortium is also expected to move the apex court on the grounds that the move by the lenders is illegal as they had won the bid. It may be recalled that UltraTech Cement had moved the court asking lenders to reconsider its offer although 99.5% of them had voted in favour of Dalmia Bharat.

Dalmia Bharat has sent letters to all the banks that any settlement initiated by them would be a breach of trust as they have entered into a contract with Dalmia with the latter having paid Rs 600 crore as bank guarantee, said the people cited above.

While Binani Industries is expected to move the Supreme Court on Monday, the bankruptcy court is scheduled to hear the resolution plan submitted by the resolution professional favouring Dalmia Bharat on the same day."
10,2018-04-09,UltraTech,"Binani Industries has decided to move the Supreme Court with an appeal to redeem the pledge of its assets in debt ridden subsidiary Binani Cements Ltd from its lenders and will also submit 10 per cent of the offer to prove its commitment, a company official today said.

""We are moving the Supreme Court for sure. We have assurance of support from most of the lenders for this move,"" a Binani group spokesman told PTI.

Redeeming the pledge will mean seeking an end to the bankruptcy proceedings against it from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

The Committee of Creditors (CoC), despite supporting the Rs 7,618 crore offer, declined to accept it due to lack of clarity in legal interpretation in several rounds of meeting held both yesterday and today.

The Binani group had sought lenders' support on whether it should move the apex court or not.

Lenders, part of the Committee of Creditors (CoC), desired that there was no problem in the offer unless a higher adjudicating authority permits it.

Binani, backed by Aditya Birla group's UltraTech Cement, has already received comfort letter for financial support.

Binani has agreed to pay the interest till date since the insolvency proceedings started.

From the day insolvency proceedings were initiated by NCLT, the interest on dues are not charged.

UltraTech Cement entered into an agreement with Binani Industries to buy 98.43 per cent stake in Binani Cements. Operational creditors are supporting UltraTech backed Binani offer as it covers entire claim.

Dalmia Bharat group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Rajputana Properties, had emerged as the highest bidder with an offer to pay Rs 6,350 crore for Binani Cements.

The fate of the takeover is hanging in the balance and is set to reach the Supreme Court.

Binani group is hoping to get a favorable outcome from the apex court that will empower the CoC to consent to an out-of-court settlement even after Dalmia Bharat's final voted offer had been submitted before the NCLT, Binani and lenders sources said.

Bharat Dalmia officials has said any out-of-court settlement, while a company undergoes bankruptcy proceedings, will set a bad precedent."
12,2018-04-10,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Dalmia Bharat has sought the Central Vigilance Commission’s (CVC) intervention in the Binani Cement bankruptcy proceedings, arguing that the lenders’ reported move to allow the promoters to seek an out-ofcourt settlement for the debt-laden business violates CVC guidelines and circumvents the dedicated insolvency process.

In a letter to the CVC, the New Delhi-based cement maker wanted the commission to examine the matter and pass suitable guidelines in public interest as reports have started trickling that the lenders are having a change of heart, and could back the deal with UltraTech. The deal with UltraTech assures lenders a higher amount for the asset and 100% payout to both unsecured and secured creditors.

Listing the events since February 27, when Rajputana Properties (subsidiary of Dalmia Bharat Cement) was adjudged the highest bidder by lenders, Dalmia has gone on to outline instances that it believes go against the CVC guidelines.

“The unsuccessful bidder, UltraTech Cement, sent mails to CoC (committee of creditors) members revising its offer upwards on March 8, 2018 and requested CoC to consider its revised offer despite being well aware that the bidding process did not allow submission of revised bids. Shockingly, two PSU banks (EXIM Bank and SBI Hong Kong) who are part of the CoC petitioned the NCLT seeking directions to CoC that negotiations also be done with the H2 bidder. These actions are in clear violation of CVC guidelines for closed bids,” the letter said, mentioning two CVC circulars dating back to 2007 and 2010.

“The CVC will be taking its own action. Let the IBC be saved,” Mahendra Singhi, group CEOCement at Dalmia Bharat said.

The letter also said that apart from violating CVC guidelines and shaking public confidence in the bankruptcy code, the settlement between Binani and the lenders will also “send a wrong message to the international investing community, whose participation in resolving mounting NPAs of the banking sector is vitally important and in public interest.”

Dalmia was referring to the participation of Bain Capital Credit in the consortium that also includes Ajay Piramal's Piramal Enterprises.

The lenders in a meeting on Saturday have decided to conditionally back the deal between promoter Binani Industries and UltraTech should it get Supreme Court approval. Binani Industries has deposited a sum of Rs 750 crore to show its commitment, along with a bank guarantee for the remaining amount of the total offer of Rs 7,266 crore. UltraTech will pay Binani Industries Rs 7,266 crore for the purchase of its 98.47% stake in Binani Cement.

Binani Cement owes about Rs 7,000 crore to lenders. Dalmia Bharat had offered Rs 6,700 crore for the asset."
13,2018-04-16,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement, which lost out to a Dalmia Bharat led consortium in bidding for Binani Cement, has made yet another improved offer that’s worth Rs 7,990 crore, up Rs 700 crore from the last one, said two senior officials who did not want to be named. With this, the difference between the offer by Dalmia group and UltraTech has widened to Rs 1,290 crore.

The company made the offer to the resolution professional on Saturday evening, said the persons cited above. UltraTech contended it will cover the interest lenders had to forgo from the day Binani Cement was admitted to bankruptcy court, they said. “It’s a very attractive offer. But the biggest block is that the UltraTech offer is made after bidding was closed,” said a bank official, seeking anonymity. UltraTech declined to comment. Dalmia Bharat could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Earlier, UltraTech had made an offer of Rs 7,266 crore to top the winning Rs 6,700 crore bid by Dalmia-led group. Consequently, Binani Cement’s parent Binani Industries sought the SC’s intervention to scrap the resolution process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

It said the UltraTech offer would allow the promoters to repay all dues and settle with lenders outside of the bankruptcy court process. But the Supreme Court on Friday forced it to withdraw the petition and said the matter would be heard by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).




The top court will, however, hear on April 19 another plea by a group of operational creditors that’s backing the higher offer.

The lenders had agreed to support the UltraTech offer provided it was endorsed by the Supreme Court. In early March, lenders had declared the consortium of Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal Resurgent Fund as the highest bidder for Binani Cement with an offer of Rs 6,700 crore.

UltraTech’s offer was Rs 200 crore lower. A week later, UltraTech made its Rs 7,266 crore offer, which included paying off the debts of unsecured and operational creditors.

UltraTech also moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which hears the bankruptcy cases, seeking more transparency on the way bids were evaluated. Operational creditors also moved the bankruptcy court against banks’ decision to award the company to Dalmia.

RBI may Loosen NPA Norms
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may relax some of the stringent norms for treatment of bad loans that it announced in February without diluting their spirit. The finance ministry has made a case for providing some relief, especially for small and medium enterprises, given that the tighter rules could force defaulters into rapid bankruptcy, which could dent jobs generation, they said. The one-day, non-performing asset (NPA) classification norm may be extended to 30 days and the requirement that a resolution plan has to be approved by all lenders could be lowered to 75%.


UltraTech Sweetens Offer for Binani Cement
UltraTech Cement, which lost out to a Dalmia Bharat-led consortium in bidding for Binani Cement, has made yet another improved offer that’s worth ?7,990 crore, up ?700 crore from the last one, said two senior officials who did not want to be named. With this, the difference between the offer by Dalmia group and UltraTech has widened to ?1,290 crore.

Auditor BDO Flags Rule Violations in Educomp Deals 
Auditor BDO has flagged certain “preferential” dealings between Educomp Solutions and its counter parties, during an audit of the company that is currently facing bankruptcy proceedings. Last month, Educomp lenders had unanimously cleared a proposal for its sale to Nasdaq-listed Ebix Inc at close to a 90% discount to the value of loans due to them.

Cairn faces a tax demand of Rs 29,000 crore, which it has contested, saying it cannot be taxed on a decade-old government-approved deal. The Income Tax Department has seized Rs 440 crore of dividend income due to Cairn Energy Plc to recover a part of the Rs 10,247 crore tax demand it had raised on the British firm using a retrospective tax legislation.

The Nifty remained in a broader range and witnessed recovery from 10,520 zones to close on a flattish note. The index formed a Doji candle with long lower shadow, which indicates that decline was being bought into, as it got stuck in range ahead of the expiry week.

The index has been making higher highs higher lows on a weekly chart, which suggests continuation of uptrend till any immediate support is not broken decisively. Now, till it remains above 10,500-10,480 zones, it has potential to move towards 10,630, and then 10,700 levels.

On the option front, maximum Put open interest is at 10,500, followed by 10,400 strike, while maximum Call open interest is at 10,700, followed by 10,600 strike. We have seen minor Put writing at 10,350 and 10,500 strike, while Call unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike prices which is providing room for further up move.

22,2018-04-21,UltraTech,"KOLKATA|MUMBAI: Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday passed an interim order asking the resolution professional (RP) of Binani Cement to continue taking care of the management of the company.

The 270-day moratorium period for Binani Cement ends on Saturday.

As per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), a resolution plan has to be approved by the NCLT within this period, otherwise the company could go in for liquidation. However, the tribunal has discretionary powers to extend the timeframe or not consider time taken for litigation within the stipulated period.

“The RP’s counsel brought to our notice that the 270-day period ends on April 21. Since the hearing could not be completed, the RP will continue management of the corporate debtor until further order,” Justice Jinan KR said.

The next hearing is on Monday. UltraTech Cement, the unsuccessful bidder for Binani Cement, had on Thursday urged NCLT to reject the offer by Dalmia Bharat-controlled Rajputana Properties and accept its revised bid for the stressed asset. It had also suggested that the tribunal consider passing an interim order asking the lender's committee to reconsider the offers made by both Dalmia and UltraTech.

UltraTech had also questioned the evaluation criteria for selection of the highest bidder. It emphasized on the point that its revised bid, which was higher by more than Rs 1,000 crore compared to that of Rajputana, should be considered since maximisation of the value of asset was one of the key criteria for resolution under IBC. Ultratech cited the example of the hearing that took place in case of Essar Steel on Thursday where the judge said the RP and committee of creditors had not ensured well that all proceedings were carried out in an efficient manner and where the committee would now have to negotiate with the two original bidders: ArcelorMittal and Numetal.

In response to UltraTech’s submission, Dalmia Bharat’s counsel on Friday argued that maximisation of value should happen in a “timebound manner” and since Ultra-Tech submitted its revised bid on March 8, almost a week after Rajputana was declared highest bidder, its offer should not be considered.

The counsel reiterated that RPPL (the Dalmia subsidiary that has bid for Binani’s asset) has complied by all rules and no illegality has been pointed out in its fully compliant resolution plan which was approved by lenders’ committee.

Moreover, the committee’s decision about selection of the highest bidder was based on guidelines laid down in the process document which was ‘sacrosanct and binding’, the counsel argued. As per the latest offer, UltraTech has offered to pay Rs 7,960 crore for Binani Cement; while Dalmia's resolution plan, which was approved by the committee of creditors on March 14, is worth Rs 6,589 crore."
23,2018-04-22,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India’s hawkish stance, boiling crude prices and weakening rupee restricted strides of the bulls on Dalal Street, as the market’s gains remained capped in the week gone by.

 On a weekly basis, the 30-share Sensex gained 0.65 per cent, while the broader Nifty50 index added 0.79 per cent. The market logged fourth straight weekly gain.

 Q4 earnings and political developments will have a major say in influencing investors and traders ahead.

 Teena Virmani, Vice President – Research at Kotak Securities, said: ""Market will continue to focus on the upcoming election schedule coupled with earnings, yields’ movements and crude prices in the coming weeks.""

 Hardening of yields, both globally and back home, may have a negative impact on markets. Yields moved up recently after the RBI released minutes of April monetary policy meeting, stating upside risks to inflation, which may come from MSP increases, crude price rise and resulting fiscal slippage.

 Rising oil prices also pose a threat to the fiscal and current account deficit (CAD). Oil price direction will also be determined by Opec output cuts and the US decision to reintroduce sanctions on Iran by May 12, Virmani added.


Let's have a look at the key developments that will steer market in the coming week -

Next batch of earnings
A host of big-ticket names are lined up to release their March quarter results in the coming week. Bharti Infratel, LIC Housing Finance and Reliance Infrastructure will declare their results on Monday, while telecom major Bharti Airtel, ICICI Prudential Life and IDFC Bank will release their numbers on Tuesday. Ultratech Cement and Wipro will announce theirs on Wednesday, while Axis Bank, Biocon and YES Bank will unveil their report cards on Thursday. Bandhan Bank, Maruti Suzuki and Reliance Industries are scheduled to announce their numbers on Friday.


Rupee in pain
The rupee on Friday sank 32 paise to hit a 13-month low of 66.12 against the dollar on rising crude prices and fiscal deficit worries. It was the lowest closing level of the domestic currency since March 10, 2017, when it had settled at 66.60 against the greenback.

""Indian rupee fell for a fifth session as RBI minutes revealed that RBI's tone is more hawkish than what markets had previously gauged. FII selling and firm oil adds to pressure on rupee, while US dollar is also not expected to yield much ahead of May's FOMC meet,"" Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.


Simmering crude prices
Last week, both, Brent and WTI (West Texas Intermediate), hit their highest levels since November 2014, at $74.75 and $69.56, respectively, buoyed by geopolitical risk and a tightening market.

For the week, both the benchmarks gained over 1 per cent. However, the prices took a slide when the US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticise rising oil prices. “Looks like OPEC is at it again,” he tweeted. “With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”


Political developments
A host of political developments in the country will have a key role in influencing market direction in the coming week. In a big blow to the ruling BJP party, veteran member and former finance and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha on Saturday quit the party saying country's democracy is in danger. This apart, opposition parties' move to impeach the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra is likely to affect investor sentiment.

 In addition to these, investors will take cue from the upcoming state elections in Karnataka. Any change in political equations will affect market mood. 


What tech charts say
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed an indecisive 'Doji' candle on the daily charts. A Doji candle indicates that the decline is being bought into, as the Nifty50 got stuck in a range ahead of the expiry week.

""The index appears to have formed an Inside Bar kind of formation in three sessions, as price action of last two sessions was confined to the range of bearish candle formed on Wednesday. Unless the Nifty50 emerges out of this 10,594-10,509 range with a breakout on either side, trading shall remain listless,"" said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist for Technical Research & Trading Advisory at Chartviewindia.in.

 Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, says, ""While Nifty is still facing resistance at the pattern resistance area on the daily charts, it remains overstretched and it would be no surprise if there are bouts of corrections at higher levels.""


F&O expiry
Trading could be volatile next week, as traders will roll over positions in the F&O segment from the near month April series to May series. The April F&O contracts will expire on Thursday.

F&O stands for Futures and Options. Futures and Options represent derivatives of the stock market. These derivatives are the financial instruments deriving their values from underlying assets such as currency, gold, or the stocks of a company. 


Kim shuns dirty bomb
North Korea on Saturday announced it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace, ahead of planned summits with South Korea and the US.

 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is scheduled to hold talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next week and with US President Donald Trump in late May or early June, Reuters reported. The move, hailed by countries across the globe, is likely to boost markets when trading resumes on Monday.


ECB, BoJ policy meets
European Central Bank (ECB) is scheduled to announce its monetary policy on Thursday. Since the ECB’s March meeting, economic data has disappointed, inflation estimates have been revised lower and a global trade spat may loom. Economists anticipate that ECB steps towards winding down QE will come only in June or later. But ECB chief Mario Draghi will be pressed on what he thinks about the economic wobbles, trade wars and the euro, said a Reuters report.

Bank of Japan will announce its policy stance on Friday. While no policy change is expected, the BOJ’s forecasts on inflation will be crucial."
24,2018-04-23,UltraTech,"Analysts are getting bullish on Grasim Industries, expecting strong standalone earnings growth and large free cash flows in the next 2-3 years. 

Grasim is a global viscose staple fibre (VSF) major and, along with its group companies, has a global VSM market share of 17%. In recent years, the global rise in demand for VSF has been much higher compared to competing products such as cotton, polyester, etc. 

This explains why Grasim is operating its VSF facility at close to full capacity levels, despite having recently raised its capacity by 50%. Global VSF capacity additions are happening slowly due to stricter environmental norms. To capitalise on the opportunity, Grasim is planning to increase its VSF capacity by another 50% in the coming years. 


Buy: 10

Sell: 1

Hold: 3

The company commands higher margins due to its product mix and also has clear advantage over its rivals due to its high backward integration. While inputs like caustic soda and power already come from its own plants, it is planning on sourcing more pulp from its own supply chain by converting the paper-grade capacity of its joint venture in Canada to pulp grade. Since the outlook of the caustic soda business is bright in the medium term, Grasim is increasing its capacity further. 

The company aims to become the seventh-largest global caustic soda player in the next five years. The capacity addition is going on smoothly and its capacity is expected to go up by 30% in 2018-19. Global caustic soda prices are also on an upswing due to shutdown of facilities in China because of environmental concerns. India is a net importer of caustic soda and eastern India accounts for around 80% of this import. Grasim, which is a pan-India player, will benefit from its ongoing expansion in the eastern market. In addition to its core businesses—VSF and caustic soda— Grasim also has investments in cement, 60.3% stake in Ultratech Cements; financial services, 56% stake in Aditya Birla Capital; and telecom, 28% stake in Idea Cellular. 

Though telecom is under pressure, other big subsidiaries are doing well now. Grasim is now trading at a discount of 50% compared to its holdings and analysts hope that this holding company discount may narrow in coming years. Brighter prospects in standalone business and receding capital allocation concern can be the triggers for this counter.

25,2018-04-23,UltraTech,"India’s biggest domestic institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) was on a major shopping spree on Dalal Street this March quarter, even as the broader market weakened thanks to a series on domestic as well as global headwinds.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 20 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 35 companies from the BSE500 index. The insurer had exposure to nearly 200 companies on the index.

The insurance behemoth booked a record equity profit of Rs 25,000 crore last financial year, compared with Rs 19,000 crore it had earned in financial year 2016-17.

The domestic equity market witnessed a lot of volatility in the second half of March quarter owing to a Budget proposal to tax long-term equity gains, fears of a trade war following some protectionist measures by the Trump administration, geopolitical crises and signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates more rapidly than expected. This also triggered strong FII outflows from the domestic market.

But the domestic institutional investor increased stake in a couple of companies from across sectors, including rating agencies, IT, pharma, downstream oil and gas players, housing finance, select private banks, FMCG and power companies.

Among the large caps, Coal India saw LIC stake go up to 10.30 per cent at the end of March from 9.66 per cent as of December 31, 2017. LIC also raised its holding in oil marketing company HPCL (from 2.08 per cent to 2.17 per cent), L&T (17.94 per cent to 17.96 per cent), Tech Mahindra (3.60 per cent to 3.77 per cent), UltraTech Cement (2.33 per cent to 2.41 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (3.84 per cent to 4.89 per cent).

Oil marketing companies have since come under pressure amid soaring of crude oil prices, which are currently hovering around their three-year high levels.

Infrastructure major L&T has been seeing a lot of interest from institutional investors in recent times.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recently named it as one of its preferred picks.


The public sector insurer also showed confidence in rating agencies during the quarter gone by, hiking stake in ICRA to 8.98 per cent from 7.45 per cent in December quarter. It held 5.88 per cent in Crisil as of March 31, 2018 against 5.45 per cent at the end of December quarter. ICRA shares are down 8 per cent in last one year, having slipped to Rs 3,812.50 as of April 20, 2018 from Rs 4,152 on the same day last year. Crisil is down around 0.77 per cent at Rs 1940.85 from Rs 1,955.90 that it had quoted a year ago.

LIC also showed confidence and raised stake in Castrol India, Adani Transmission, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Hindalco, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, Swan Energy, Power Grid, Oracle Financial Services, ONGC, NHPC, Mindtree, ICICI Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indraprastha Gas, Granules India and YES Bank.

Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance are up 38 per cent in last one year. The company on Friday posted a 22.6 per cent rise in net profit for March quarter to Rs 1,030 crore from Rs 841 crore reported for the same period of last year.

Hindalco has been among top buy recommendations of analysts on Dalal Street following a major spike in aluminium prices. The stock is up 40 per cent in last one year.

Brokerage Edelweiss says Alcoa’s Q1CY18 numbers and guidance reinforce the belief that LME aluminium price will stay robust in the near term as unprecedented constraints in the global supply chain post sanctions on Rusal and cut in Alunorte’s production, smelter restarts/new capacity are expected to be slower or lower in China and ensure steady growth in global aluminium demand at 4.25-5.25 per cent. Alcoa is world’s sixth largest aluminium producer.

Taking cognizance of the improved outlook, Alcoa has revised its CY18 Ebitda guidance higher by 30 per cent. 

All domestic aluminium companies — Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco — will benefit in the near term, Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

Meanwhile, LIC holdings came down in companies such as Dena Bank, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank, UCO Bank, Tata Steel, Indian Hotels and Cipla."
26,2018-04-25,UltraTech,"MUMBAI | KOLKATA: Tata Steel, which was so far leading the race in acquiring Bhushan Power & Steel, is contemplating challenging an order passed by the bankruptcy court that directs the resolution professional to consider Liberty’s application, despite it being filed after the deadline. 

Two senior officials, who did not want to be named, said Tata Steel will approach National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on the grounds that it would amount to penalising those who are law observers and reward violators. 

Liberty House had submitted a resolution plan for Bhushan Power & Steel on February 20, although the last day of submitting bids was February 8. When the resolution professional declined to open the bid on grounds that it was submitted after the deadline, Liberty approached the bankruptcy court to question the RP’s decision. 

While Tata Steel is likely to be disappointed with the court’s directive, it has not spoken out against it. When contacted, a Tata Steel spokesperson said he was aware of the matter. Asked whether Tata Steel is planning to appeal against the NCLT order, the official said the company may take a couple of days to firm up its response. 

For Tata Steel, it could be a frustrating experience since the company had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Power with a Rs 24,500-crore offer, outbidding JSW Steel which put in a Rs 13,000- crore bid. Officials agreed the Tata Steel-BPSL scenario is turning out to be somewhat similar to the Binani Cement case, where UltraTech Cement came into the fray after Dalmia Bharat emerged as the highest bidder. 

Incidentally, Tata Steel has already accepted the Letter of Intent (LoI) for Bhushan Steel and, together with BPSL, it was hoping to add almost 8 million tonne capacity that would take it to the top league of the domestic steelmakers, including Steel Authority of India and JSW Steel. 

At the bankruptcy court, the Tata’s had appealed that the applicant (Liberty House) is nothing but a spoiler and a proxy for the debtor whose only objective is to delay and scuttle the resolution process. In their argument, the lenders had alleged that Liberty has deliberately delayed their applications. The resolution professional argued that Liberty’s application is a complete abuse of the process. 

Senior Counsel for RP, Arun Kathpalia also pointed out that Liberty House failed to submit documents required for qualification and there was noncompliance of Section 29 A, and it failed to provide Rs 10 lakh deposit as per the mandate. The Tatas had also stated that allowing Liberty would set a bad precedent in IBC and entertaining such application would penalise the law-abiding participants and reward violators. 

The counsel for creditors argued that allowing the present application would open floodgates for other applications. Liberty had appealed on the ground that the RP had accepted two applications — ArcelorMittal’s and their application — for expression of interest much after the deadline of October 6, which means that deadline was neither sacrosanct nor considered binding. Bhushan Power is among the 12 companies wherein the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed the bank to refer to the bankruptcy court. It faces .`49,264 crore claims from financial creditors. Lenders had received binding offer from JSW Steel and Tata Steel before the deadline on February 8."

32,2018-04-26,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: The fourth-quarter financial performance of UltraTech Cement, India’s largest manufacturer, is a pointer to the business environment awaiting cement companies over the next few months in the world’s second-largest concrete market.

Uneven growth in cement demand would likely restrict their ability to enhance realisation, and cement players will have to rely primarily on volumes to boost sales. In the March quarter, UltraTech recorded superior volume growth of 32 per cent against analysts’ estimates of 20-25 per cent. The company sold 17.6 MT of cement in the quarter under review in comparison with 13.3 MT in the same quarter last year.

Higher volumes boosted UltraTech’s revenues that beat Street estimates in the March quarter. Against estimates of Rs 8,000 crore, revenue grew 34 per cent to Rs 9,298 crore in the quarter under review. Operating EBIDTA on selling per tonne of cement rose just 2 per cent onyear to Rs 922.

Net profit, after taking into account one-time costs (stamp duty costs on acquired assets and their impairment), remained flat at Rs 724 crore, with expenses related to raw material such as pet coke and freight increasing in the range of 22-24 per cent. In the coming quarters, analysts point out that demand from infrastructure and low-cost housing would be steady. But an increase in demand would be visible only if construction in the broader housing segment shows material improvement. Of the total cement demand, housing accounts for about 60-65 per cent, while 15-20 per cent sales arise in the infrastructure sector. Considering these dynamics and the next quarter coinciding with the monsoons, analysts point out that it would take at least two quarters to gauge demand trajectory for the long term. Construction activity in India thins out during the rains.

In absence of low contribution of demand from the housing segment, analysts point out that cement companies may not be able to raise prices despite rising raw material costs.

UltraTech has been able to hold down expenses as costs of the acquired assets — chiefly Jaiprakash Associates’ plants — have reached the levels incurred on its own assets. Utilisation of acquired JP plants has improved to 75 per cent from 50-55 per cent when they were brought into the UltraTech fold, and this has helped drive down fixed costs per unit. Hence, the scope for any further improvement by way of lower fixed costs would be limited.

On valuations, according to Bloomberg data, the stock is trading at the one-year forward EV/ EBIDTA of 13.7, which is reasonable when compared with the fiveyear average of 13.9."

India is the second largest cement producer of globally. The industry has added 110 million tonnes of capacity in last five years.

However, financial year 2017-18 has been a relatively tough one for the industry due to a ban on sand mining, use of pet coke and diminished market concentration of industry leaders.

Slower progress in infrastructure projects and low offtake from housing and industrial users also slowed down growth.

However, with general elections nearing, it is expected that there would be a greater thrust by all agencies to marquee projects such as Bharatmala, the Smart Cities Project and the Housing for All by 2022 scheme.

Cement demand is expected to grow by 6-7 per cent to reach 307 million tonnes during FY2018-19. Higher government spending on infrastructure, pent-up demand, particularly in rural housing and low-cost housing, and rising per capita income are expected to spur this growth.

Infrastructure projects, especially in the areas of power, telecom, irrigation, roads, metros and railways, besides dedicated freight and industrial corridors are together expected to generate strong demand for cement.

As per the recent Budget announcement, the government is planning to develop two defence industrial production corridors and has already increased budgetary allocation for infrastructure to Rs 5.97 lakh crore. Early estimate of relatively better and widespread monsoon this year and increased spending on affordable and low-cost housing are expected to have favourable impact on cement demand.

With the infrastructure sector enjoying priority status under the NDA government, the cement industry is poised to witness robust demand in the coming years, and it will take India’s economy forward.

Revocation of the sand mining ban and acceptance of manufactured sand, popularly known as M-sand in various regions, is expected to aid construction activities. It is expected that in order to meet rising demand, cement companies will add 56 million tonnes capacity over the next three years.

Recently, UltraTech Cement acquired Jaypee Cement while Orient Cement took over two entities, Bhilai Jaypee Cement and Nigrie Cement Grinding Unit.An improvement in utilisation rates of the newly acquired capacities and fresh capacity additions by these players would also lead to higher volumes.

A number of foreign players are also eyeing India’s cement sector, owing to high profit margins and steady demand.

The expected increase in cement consumption is not yet factored into the stock prices. Stocks like as Ultratech Cement, Ambuja, ACC can be a good play on this theme for long-term growth."
0,2018-05-02,UltraTech,"Mumbai: India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market Index is likely to fall 20 basis points as a result of inclusion of China A-shares, which would entail total outflows of around $540 million by passive funds, said Morgan Stanley in a report.

The MSCI will announce the results of its semi-annual index review on the morning of May 15 and the changes will be effective from June 1.

“Qualified A-share stocks will be included in the MSCI EM index starting in May with an inclusion factor of 2.5% applied to their free-float market cap. By August 2018, the inclusion factor will be increased to 5%... Subsequently, ceteris paribus, India’s weight in EM would likely fall by approximately 20bp (basis points) by August, implying total outflows of around US$540mn (million) by passive funds,” said Morgan Stanley’s Sheela Rathi and Ridham Desai in a report.

In June 2017, MSCI had announced that beginning June 2018, China A-shares will be included in MSCI EM and MSCI ACWI index. India’s weightage in MSCI EM index is 8.5% currently.

In specific stock inclusions, the firm said Pidilite Industries and Power Grid Corporation of India are high-conviction stocks that can be included in the MSCI India index. UltraTech Cement and Container Corporation of India could see an increase in their weightage in the index, which could lead to potential inflows of $49 million and $40 million respectively.

Avenue Supermarts, Future Retail, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are also potential candidates for inclusion in the index but the conviction for addition of these stocks is less due to lower free float market capitalisation, said Morgan Stanley.

Tata Motors Differential Voting Rights and Vakrangee could be excluded from the index, said Morgan Stanley.

Sectoral classification changes are also likely. MSCI had announced in November 2017 that the telecommunication services sector will be broadened and renamed as communication services to include companies that facilitate communication and offer related content and information through various media.

Apart from the classification of telecoms sector stocks Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel into the communications sector, media stocks like Zee Entertainment would be reclassified into the MSCI India Communications sector from the consumer discretionary sector currently, the report stated."
1,2018-05-03,UltraTech,"The operational creditors (OCs) of debt-ridden Binani Cement today lauded the NCLT order which directed the lenders to consider the revised bid of UltraTech Cement and reiterated its demand for forensic audit of the insolvency resolution process. 

Providing a fresh lease of life for more than 3,000 OCs of Binani Cement, the Kolkata bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed the committee of creditors (CoC) to consider the revised UltraTech bid, while allowing Dalmia Bharat to match the offer made by UltraTech. 

Ultra Tech Cement's offer is Rs 1,021.70 crore more than that of the Dalmia Bharat Group's, the NCLT said. 

Dalmia Bharat's resolution plan proposed to settle the accumulated dues of OCs of Rs 503.37 crore for Rs 151 crore. However, they claimed the company owes them over Rs 700 crore. 

""The (NCLT) order has brought new dimension to the case wherein serious violation of IBC on part of RP got validated in the judgment. In total 12 applications highlighting serious violation of process mandated under IBC to RP got concluded in the hearing. We once again demand for forensic audit,"" Binani Operations Creditors Forum (BOCF) spokesperson Rajesh Tibrewal told here. 

The revised bid from UltraTech has to be submitted by Friday to the resolution professional (RP), which will be placed before the CoC. 

Tibrewal said the cost of litigation filed by all stakeholders towards appealing in NCLT, NCLAT and Supreme Court has been around Rs 100 crore till date. 

""Had the RP acted prudently as per provisions of IBC law taking into consideration interest of all stakeholders, it would have saved both cost (including interest cost) and time for all creditors,"" he added.

2,2018-05-06,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: UltraTech Cement made a revised bid of Rs 7,840 crore for Binani Cement following an order by bankrupcy court that lenders should consider their offer, even as they lost out to Dalmia Bharat team, people aware of the development said.

The company said on Sunday it submitted a fresh offer for debt-laden Binani Cement to meet the tribunal’s May 5 deadline. UltraTech declined to comment on the bid amount.

The lenders are expected to meet on Monday to discuss UltraTech’s new bid. If lenders accept UltraTech offer, it would be first such deal where not only all secured, unsecured, operational creditors will be fully paid, but even equity holders, the Braj Binani family, will have an upside.

Dalmia Bharat, which had originally been declared the highest bidder, has been allowed to revise its offer for the stressed cement maker in response to UltraTech’s fresh bid. However, it is unlikely to do so, calling the latest exercise “an illegal process,” people close to the company said.

Dalmia Bharat has filed a plea in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal seeking a stay on the NCLT order directing Binani Cement’s lenders to consider a revised bid from UltraTech. While the NCLAT rejected the plea for a stay, it admitted the petition. The next hearing is scheduled on May 22, after which Dalmia Bharat will decide its course of action.

UltraTech, an Aditya Birla Group company, and Dalmia Bharat had both bid for Binani Cement in February. Although UltraTech’s first offered Rs 6500 crore, little lower than Dalmia Bharat’s Rs 6,700 crore, it later increased it by Rs 700 crore. By then, the lenders had already declared Dalmia Bharat as the top bidder.

UltraTech then went outside the insolvency resolution process and made an offer to buy the company, a proposal that was rejected by the Supreme Court.

Dalmia Bharat has not yet been approached by the resolution professional after UltraTech submitted the revised bid.

Dalmia Bharat was “surprised” by the order passed by the NCLT and “will take all steps required,” the company said in a statement after the tribunal ruled in favour of UltraTech. The company has the option of approaching the Supreme Court, conditional on the ruling passed by the appellate tribunal.

The ability of Dalmia Bharat to match UltraTech’s bid depends on two aspects – its private equity partner and taking on additional debt to support funding.

Dalmia Bharat bid for Binani Cement in a consortium with Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund, which will help with its expertise of buying and turning around distressed assets. Private equity funds work on a model where they can create value from a distressed asset and exit in a fixed span, which is usually about five years.

According to a cement analyst who did not wish to be identified, in an attempt to match the aggressive bid, the PE fund will have to take a hit of between 20-25% on its internal rate of return on the asset or will have to extend its involvement with the asset by a few years, something that is unlikely since the commercial gains from the asset remain the same.

The analyst also seemed sceptical of Dalmia taking on incremental debt to fund the increased offer. Dalmia Bharat currently has net debt of about Rs 4,000 crore. For its 50% stake in the consortium, it will be required to take on incremental debt of Rs 4,000 crore to match UltraTech’s offer of almost Rs 8,000 crore.

With a current operating profit of Rs 2,500 per tonne and adding about Rs 300 that Binani will bring in, the company’s net debt to operating profit ratio will be in the range of 2.8x.

“It is not that they cannot stretch their balance sheet by this amount. It is just that after bringing their ratio down from 4 in the recent past, they will be wary of doing so,” the analyst said."

Videocon: Lenders led by State Bank of India have filed insolvency petitions at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against more than a dozen Videocon group companies that cumulatively owe about Rs 13,000 crore, a move that’s aimed at seeking a comprehensive resolution plan. The debts have been grouped into four clusters to help streamline the process, three people with the direct knowledge of the matter told ET.


Fortis Healthcare: Manipal Health Enterprises, backed by US private equity firm TPG, has revised its offer for Fortis Healthcare, now proposing a merger of both entities in a three-step deal that values the latter at Rs 8,358 crore.

Vakrangee: Auditing major Price Waterhouse has quit audit mandate of technology firm Vakrangee, flagging concerns to the corporate affairs ministry about the books of accounts, mainly related to its bullion and jewellery business, even as the company denied any irregularities. According to a report by PTI, the company is also being probed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which had earlier probed some other entities having traded in Vakrangee shares, about alleged disclosure and corporate governance lapses, regulatory and government officials said. 

PC Jeweller: PC Jeweller (PCJ), which has been in the news for its steep share price correction since April 20, is witnessing trading volumes far in excess of that on marquee counters like HDFC Bank, TCS and SBI put together. This hints of huge speculative activity. The extent of trading interest on PCJ was seen by its deliverable quantity to traded quantity being below 10 per cent on the NSE on Friday. The traded value of PCJ shares was a whopping Rs 2,738.5 crore, almost equal to its free float market cap of Rs 2,755 crore.

4,2018-05-07,UltraTech,"Companies referred to bankruptcy courts may not be allowed to leave the process once bids have been invited or a resolution plan has been accepted.

The government is considering setting a time limit for withdrawing cases admitted for insolvency resolution, ending ambiguity on a key aspect of the procedure. A 14-member law committee on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code had recommended allowing retraction of applications if 90% of the creditors voted in favour of withdrawal. However, the panel had not specified a time limit for withdrawal of such cases. The government now wants to set a clear cut-off time, after which a reference under the code cannot be withdrawn.

“After a resolution plan has been accepted, no such withdrawal should be allowed... even after you have received all bids, such a move should not be permitted,” a senior government official told ET. This means that a settlement outside the insolvency resolution process may not be allowed once bids have been invited.

The issue of withdrawal of applications came to the fore when Binani Industries Ltd. sought to pull its debt-ridden subsidiary Binani Cement from the insolvency resolution process after UltraTech Cement Ltd. offered to acquire the company and pay off creditors. The Supreme Court rejected the plan and the National Company Law Tribunal ordered the lenders last week to consider a revised bid by UltraTech for Binani Cement and allowed Dalmia Bharat, which had been declared the highest bidder, to match its offer.



The IBC committee chaired by corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas had noted that there were instances of cases being withdrawn following a settlement reached between the debtor and applicant creditor. While the idea is that such settlements should be allowed, they should be within a framework that does not undermine the resolution process where bids have been called.

The changes proposed by the IBC committee are likely to be made effective soon after some fine-tuning, the senior official added. Besides recommending a voting threshold for withdrawal of cases, the panel revised the level of majority voting to 66% for important decisions such as approval of resolution plans and allowing liquidation and to 51% for approval of routine matters.

The committee took note of judgements by the NCLT and the appellate tribunals to recommend that rules may be amended to provide for withdrawal of cases with the approval of 90% of the committee of creditors votes.

The panel’s other suggestions include easing insolvency rules for small enterprises and providing relief for home buyers by treating them as financial creditors.

It also said those entering into any backdoor arrangement with corporate debtors formally or informally, directly or indirectly, should be barred from bidding for the insolvent company by bringing them within the scope of the definition of connected people. The government is likely to issue an ordinance to give effect to the changes."
5,2018-05-08,UltraTech,"The Resolution Professional of the Binani Committee of Creditors (CoC) has allowed representation of the operational creditors of Binani Cement, despite no provision of the same under existing norms.

Operational creditors are allowed if their exposure is at least 10 per cent of the debt, which is not the case for Binani Cement.

""Giving regard to the spirit of the May 2 direction of the Kolkata bench of the NCLT, the operational creditors who have filed applications before the NCLT are invited to appoint a representative who will attend the 16th CoC meeting,"" the RP's notice for the meeting said.

The meeting of the CoC has now been rescheduled to May 10 from May 9, in order to accommodate all parties.

The operational creditors had claimed that dues are over Rs 700 crore.

The RP had erroneously verified dues as Rs 460 crore, of which Dalmia Bharat had offered to pay only Rs 151 crore in their resolution plan, one of the operational creditors said.

Agenda matters for discussion in the meeting include the list of creditors prepared by the RP, note of the directions of the NCLT order and the revised offer, along with the resolution plan of Ultratech Cement.

UltraTech has already submitted its revised offer with the RP, but the exact bid value was still not known.

The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had on May 2 directed the CoC of Binani Cement to consider the revised bid of UltraTech Cement, which is about Rs 1,021 crore more than that of the Dalmia consortium.

One of UltraTech's counsel, during a hearing, had said the company will increase the bid by Rs 500 crore if Dalmia Bharat matches the offer.

The CoC had earlier accepted the resolution of Dalmia Bharat by a clear majority.

Meanwhile, Dalmia Bharat has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against NCLT and the The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the tribunal's directive, legal sources said.

Hearing on the matter is likely to take place on Thursday.

Queries sent to the company in this regard did not elicit response at the time of writing the report.

Dalmia Bharat's arm Rajputana Properties had approached the appellate body of the NCLT on May 4 to obtain a stay on the NCLT order.

The NCLAT, however, did not stay the tribunal's order and allowed the CoC to proceed with its meetings.

The next NCLAT hearing on Dalmia Bharat's plea is on May 22."

21,2018-05-10,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The apex court Thursday rejected a Dalmia Bharat plea that had sought a stay on an order allowing Binani Cement’s lenders to consider UltraTech’s revised bid, even as the resolution professional weighed the option of filing an appeal to seek the removal of ‘negative remarks’ contained in the May 2 directive.

The Supreme Court told Dalmia Bharat that it does not want to intervene at this juncture since an appeal with the NCLAT is also pending to be heard on May 22. However, Dalmia Bharat is free to come back to it after the NCLAT has given its order.

Separately, the resolution professional of Binani Cement may on Friday file an appeal with the appellate tribunal asking it to direct the NCLT to remove ‘negative remarks’ in the May 2 order, sources aware of the development told ET.

Besides directing lenders and the RP to consider UltraTech's revised bid along with Dalmia Bharat's offer, the order passed by the Kolkata bench of NCLT on May 2 had also contended that the RP had, on many events during the resolution of the company, violated the objective of the bankruptcy code.



The NCLT judges had arrived at this conclusion after going through the various applications filed by Binani Cement, UltraTech Cement, and operational creditors of the debt-laden company. Vijaykumar V Iyer of Deloitte, the resolution professional, is likely to approach the appellate tribunal to seek the removal of such remarks.

“The entire decision of the RP and CoC in respect of identifying one resolution plan from among six plans and denying opportunity to have negotiation to so as to raise the bid amount by the willing bidders other than the H1 bidder is found vitiated that they have acted against the objective of the code and acted against the interest of various stakeholders of the corporate debtor and also acted unfairly, arbitrarily and against the interest of the competing bidder including UltraTech,” the order read."

28,2018-05-14,UltraTech,"By Swansy Afonso and Upmanyu Trivedi
India’s new bankruptcy law is being bogged down by bitter court room disputes that include the likes of ArcelorMittal and the Tata Group -- jeopardizing the law’s promise of time-bound resolution in a country famous for its sluggish legal system.

None of the 12 large debtor companies that the central bank forced into bankruptcy court in June have been sold yet. The National Company Law Tribunal or NCLT, in charge of the process, has extended a 270-day deadline enshrined in the law for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. and Essar Steel India Ltd. by excluding the days under litigation. Others may follow as the courts are inundated with appeals from founders, administrators, lenders and bidders.

The successful resolution of about $210 billion in stressed loans is crucial to Prime Minister Narendra Modi efforts to clean-up the balance sheets of state-run banks, which hold nearly 90 percent of impaired assets. The first 12 large cases are being closely watched to gauge whether India can hasten the pace of bad-loan recovery, which the World Bank puts at 4.3 years, ranking the nation at 103 for resolving insolvency.

“Discretionary extensions run the risk of setting a dangerous precedent, driving a hole through the very integrity of the code,” said Ran Chakrabarti, a New Delhi-based finance lawyer and partner at IndusLaw. Should the courts water down the 270-day period, “we’re back to square one, and any hope of a swift liquidation process and an efficient recycling of capital -- the very point of any insolvency law -- will go out of the window.”

In what was seen as an initial success for the law, Electrosteel Steels Ltd. was awarded to billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. The hurrah was short-lived as the process has now been stalled by a court order following an appeal by a rival bidder.

The company tribunal has repeatedly postponed a verdict on a bid for Monnet Ispat & Power Ltd. by JSW Steel Ltd. and Apollo Global Management LLC-backed Aion Capital Partners. Tata Steel Ltd. is waiting on final approval for its purchase of Bhushan Steel Ltd., even as it appeals an order allowing a late bid by Liberty House Group for Bhushan Power. ArcelorMittal and a VTB Capital-backed consortium are in court over Essar Steel.

Beyond the 12, the fight for Binani Cement Ltd. is also emerging as a test case, with a consortium backed by Bain Capital Credit slugging it out with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd. While the former had the winning bid under the bankruptcy process, Birla’s company made a late counteroffer and then signed an agreement with Binani’s founders to buy the asset. The matter has been taken to an appellate tribunal and the nation’s supreme court before being referred back to the lenders’ committee.

“If in nine months you can’t get a resolution done then you’ve failed the law,” said Shardul S. Shroff, executive chairman of law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., which represents one of the Binani suitors. “The battle for victory is not the end game for resolution plan, reviving the company is. Therefore, tribunal should avoid getting caught up by challenges and attempts by losing bidders to somehow or the other get back into the game.”"

The NCLT has already asked bankers to look into the revised bid of the Aditya Birla Group's cement firm, including the operational creditors and unsecured lenders, while giving Dalmia Bharat an opportunity to improve its offer. 

The NCLAT has listed the matter for next hearing on July 10. 

 Ultratech's bid for Binani Cement is around Rs 1,100 crore more than that of Dalmia Bharat Group's Rajputana Properties."

UltraTech Cement Ltd., incorporated in 2000, is a large-cap cement company with a market cap of Rs 105771.70 crore.Investment rationale by MacquarieWe believe UTCEM will rebrand cement from CENT’s plants to UTCEM brands post acquisition. UTCEM’s category A brand vs. B/C for CENT could add Rs150-200/t to margins. Also, the plants are running at 70-75% utilisation and with some capex can be ramped up to +90% utilisation. These low hanging fruits can drive the margins of CENT’s assets closer to UTCEM’s margins post acquisition. While trailing earnings suggest 4-5% EPS dilution for UTCEM, an increase in efficiency and brand premium should make the deal EPS accretive. Action and recommendation Maintain Outperform."

72,2018-05-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: It's a sweet and sour feeling the way March quarter earnings have panned out so far.

The short point is there were only a few positive surprises as the season enters its last lap. And the numbers at best are in line with market expectations. 

A few consumption-driven sectors continued with their recent volume-driven growth. But red flags are going up. Rising raw material costs could play a spoilsport for some of them, going ahead. PSU banks with record losses disappointed the most. 

Combined sales of 1,040-odd companies -- apart from PSU and private banks -- climbed 14.9 per cent while their net profit surged 37 per cent on a low base last year. The March quarter of 2017 turned out to be painful for India Inc because of the cash ban announced in November 2016.

Top line rose to Rs 11,55,547 crore compared with Rs 10,05,488 crore in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line for the universe swelled to Rs 1,06,437 crore from Rs 77,801 a year earlier. 

On a sequential basis, sales for these companies went up 7.62 per cent. Profit advanced 4.14 per cent, Capitaline data showed, as compiled by ETMarkets.com.

Banks, especially PSU ones, made jaw-dropping NPA provisions during the March quarter. The result: as many as 14 banks reeled under losses amounting to Rs 46,593 crore. This includes PNB's record loss of Rs 13,416.90 crore. SBI (Rs 7,542 crore), Canara Bank (Rs 4,860 crore) and Allahabad bank (Rs 3,510 crore) suffered huge losses too. 

To give you a perspective, these 14 PSU lenders had reported Rs 4,338 crore loss in the year-ago quarter. If private and public lenders are taken into account, the 1,070 firms reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 71,072 crore for January-March.

""So far, the earnings season has been on expected lines. The upgrades and downgrades are by and large equal to each other following which the earnings estimate for the next year has only been marginally cut by about a per cent,"" said Neelotpal Sahai of HSBC Asset Management India.

From the Nifty bloc, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints, SBI, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, HCL Tech, Wipro, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel fell short of profit estimates. Others such as Bajaj Auto, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Lupin, Zee Entertainment, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Yes Bank came out on top.

""Consumer-oriented sectors from paints to consumer staples delivered not only good results, but very strong commentary on revenue and margin expansion. In some ways, that bullish guidance actually surprised me because I felt that commodity price spike would make them a little more circumspect about margins. Both consumer discretionary and staples are doing fine. Energy companies too performed well,"" Manishi Raychaudhuri of BNP Paribas told ET Now.

For the FMCG sector, what worked is the revival in rural growth, which has beaten the figure for urban areas for three quarters now. 

Metal companies have been putting up a strong earnings show, buoyed by a pick-up in metal prices. This partly hurt outlook for automakers though, which points to further impact of raw material inflation in H1 FY19. They may partially try to offset it by passing on the cost to consumers, said Motilal Oswal Securities. 

The squeeze was on the telecom sector, which saw ARPU downtrading due to renewed competition. That means Ebitda margin for the telcos may remain under pressure, going forward.

""Earning have been mixed bag so for, with IT , Cement , FMCG, Metal, Select private sector banks performing better on revenue, margin and net profit parameters. Some of the high frequency economic data-points such cement production, air traffic growth, petrol/diesel consumption, automobile sales among others, suggest a strong recovery in the economy. Revival in urban demand along with good monsoon led recovery in rural demand would augur well for the economy and corporate earnings,"" said Hemang Jani of Sharekhan. 

For the IT sector, FY19 should see an improvement on a low FY18 base, but the outlook is not exactly euphoric, the brokerage noted. According to Raychaudhuri, the currency depreciation has been a tailwind for software firms.

""In oil and gas space, refining margins have been good. Marketing margins have also been good after a tepid Q3 FY18. Outlook remains uncertain in light of high oil prices, a depreciating rupee, unwillingness of the government to cut excise duties on auto fuels, and the upcoming elections,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Results of cement companies came in above expectations, led by lower-than-expected price decline and a better cost curve. The impact of higher petcoke and diesel prices was mitigated by better operating leverage and other cost efficiency measures, the brokerage added.

Jani said that the outlook for cement sector remains neutral as players across regions except eastern markets will continue to experience pricing pressure.""Moreover high Fuel expenses & logistics cost will keep margins under pressure,"" he said. 

So, where does that leave us with? The market will continue to be more truncated in favour of companies that can grow with earnings visibility, said Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global Financial Services.

""A rise in crude prices which can put pressure on margins due to higher Input costs. It could havesome growth and revenue repurcusion for FMCG, Cement , automobile sector. A rise in metal prices can be dampaner for construction & automotive industry & electrical component industry. Most of the Managements have shown concern regarding higher commodity prices . However, they said they will take price hike if required to pass on the higher RM cost. But we believe price hike might be challenging,"" Jani said."
71,2018-05-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: India’s top 20 billionaires have together witnessed a $17.85 billion loss in net worth so far in 2018, with the top five alone losing $15 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaire index suggested.

Among the top losers has been Gautam Adani, whose net worth has dropped $3.68 billion to $6.75 billion. When the Modi government came to power in 2014, Adani was one man projected to benefit the most.

Shares of four Adani Group companies have lost anywhere between 7 per cent and 45 per cent this calendar. The four group companies – Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, Adani Transmission and Adani Ports & SEZ – have together reported 13.76 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 3,546 crore for FY18 on a modest 3.85 per cent rise in sales to Rs 73,260 crore.

Adani is 242th richest on the Bloomberg index.

Another big loser is Azim Premji, who has controlling stake in Wipro, India’s third largest IT firm. The company has been struggling to log consistent growth due to ramping down of its accounts, challenges in industry pockets and continuing slippage in its traditional business, said brokerage Sharekhan. The stock is down 16 per cent year to date.


Wipro has been at the bottom of the pyramid when it comes to performance among the Big Four (IT players), an industry watcher recently told ETMarkets.

Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi, who controls Sun Pharmaceuticals, has also seen a sharp erosion in his fortunes. His net worth has declined by $3.48 billion to $9.34 billion this calendar, thanks to a 21 per cent drop in the shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals, as analysts are not convinced about its growth trajectory.

Given the ongoing pressures in the company's US generics business, particularly in its core area of topicals (Taro), declining revenue base for Absorica, as well as catchup by peers in the complex injectables (e.g. liposomals) business, specialty rollup is critical to revive growth momentum, says Kotak Securities, which expects hurdles ahead for the company’s specialty initiatives, given the intensifying competitive landscape.

At 18 times FY2020 EPS, the stock has priced in full recovery from Halol, as well as $200 million sales from specialty products, the brokerage said. 

Shanghvi is 153rd richest person in the world, as per the Bloomberg index. 

Oil-to-telecom major Mukesh Ambani has seen a notional loss of $2.83 billion in his net worth this year to $37.4 billion.

Ambani, ranked 21st richest person on the planet, promotes Reliance Industries, India’s second-most valued firm after TCS.

Shares of RIL are down 1 per cent this calendar, while those of Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, another Ambani-promoted company, are down 25 per cent. Ambani also has stakes in two listed media firms, whose shares are down too.

Fifth on the list is Kumar Birla. Eight of Birla's listed firms have seen a 19.72 per cent erosion in their combined market value to Rs 2,19,904 crore from Rs 2,73,932 crore at the end of 2017. Shares of his companies including Hindalco, Idea Cellular, UltraTech Cement and AB Capital have dropped between 7 per cent and 50 per cent this calendar. His net worth has declined $2.24 billion to $6.83 billion. 

The sixth person on the list is the country ‘s richest real estate tycoon KP Singh. Shares of his company, DLF, where he has majority shareholding, have dropped 25 per cent this calendar. Singh's net worth has dropped by $1.65 billion to $4.79 billion. 

FY18 has been a difficult year with muted sales in H1FY18 owing to RERA. ""In addition, demand for DLF’s luxury portfolio in Phase-V was lukewarm. With a Rs 14,300 crore inventory still in hand, DLF will continue to focus on selling the same,” HDFC Institutional Research said in a note. 

The company has guided for an annual pre-sales run rate of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore. The NCR market is now showing signs of revival. Existing inventory seems to have much better margin profile.

74,2018-05-28,UltraTech,"Lenders of Binani Cement will meet on Monday to decide its fate amid a legal battle between the two bidders —Dalmia Bharat, who was originally awarded the cement company for being highest bidder, and Birla owned UltraTech Cement who improvised their offer by over Rs 1,400 crore from original offer after they lost out to Dalmia consortium.

The battle has now reached the Supreme Court with Dalmia Bharat charging UltraTech with not complying with Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which bars defaulters from participating as resolution applicants. Dalmia has made this claim on the basis that UltraTech partnered with Binani Industries, the defaulting promoter of Binani Cement.

Lenders said the meeting is significant in the backdrop of Dalmia Bharat’s decision not to revise its original offer of Rs6,350 crore while UltraTech Cement revised its offer to Rs 7,600 crore.

“The resolution professional has asked all lenders to be present for the meeting to decide between the two offers. If all lenders are present and if the decision by the Supreme Court does not withhold banks from deciding on highest bidder, the RP may suggest voting,” said a bank senior official.

“However, if the Supreme Court agrees to hear Dalmia’s case and gives direction to the lenders to relook at the eligibility of UltraTech under Section 29A of the code, the decision may be delayed,” he added.

The tribunal extended the deadline for resolution of Binani Cement, which originally expired in April, to June 24. While extending the time, the tribunal also directed lenders to consider UltraTech’s offers and said that Dalmia should be given a chance to match the offer.

Dalmia, who bid in partnership with Bain Capital and Piramals, has not revised its offer and has taken a view that UltraTech is not eligible to bid as it is acting in concert with Binani Industries. These allegations stem from an agreement Binani Industries signed to sell 98.4% of its stake in Binani Cement for Rs 7,266 crore to UltraTech Cement.

The agreement between the two parties was signed after UltraTech lost out on Binani Cement. However, the tribunal’s decision to maximise recovery through a resolution has gone in favour of UltraTech. Binani Cement is the only bankrupt company where all lenders and most operational creditors are expected receive full dues. Lenders have made a claim of Rs 6,313 crore.

Edelweiss ARC has the largest exposure with Rs 2,673 crore followed by Bank of Baroda with Rs 410 crore, State Bank of India (Rs 323 crore) and Canara Bank (Rs 320 crore)."

This is Prachi Sharma, your market jockey, with the morning market briefing to get you up and running for a busy day on Dalal Street.

First the good news: crude oil prices have started sliding. While petrol prices in the country have hit a new high, global oil price trend looks promising.

Meanwhile, markets worldwide seem to be happy with the news that the US-North Korea summit is back on track. And Nifty charts are looking good, as we enter the expiry week.

That's where we start trade, ladies and gentlemen.

This morning, Nifty futures in Singapore traded in the positive and that’s a healthy sign for Dalal Street.

Asian stocks drifted in early trade. Equity benchmarks nudged higher in Tokyo and dipped in Australia. South Korean stocks rose as did US stocks futures. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm that his June summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is back on. 

On Friday last, US stocks had closed lower, spooked by geopolitical issues.

Oil prices slid on Monday, extending a steep decline. The market eyed an increase in output from the world’s three top crude producers -- Russia, US and Saudi Arabia. Brent crude futures were just above at $75 per barrel. 

Things seem to be falling in place for the rupee too. On Friday, the currency made a terrific comeback, clocking the best single-day rise since March 14, 2017, to end at 67.78, up 56 paise.

Vedanta: The Tamil Nadu government on Monday ordered the permanent closure of a copper smelter controlled by London-listed Vedanta Resources after 13 people protesting to demand its shutdown on environmental concerns were killed last week. Residents and environmental activists have long demanded a shutdown of the copper smelter, India’s second-biggest with an annual production of more than 400,000 tonnes, citing air and water pollution, Reuters reported.

L&T: Infra major Larsen & Toubro on Monday reported a 4.69 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 3,167 crore for March quarter, beating Rs 3,098 crore estimated by analysts in an ET Now poll. It has written off orders worth Rs 16,000 crore because of stalled projects, laid off staff and cut costs as it missed its revenue guidance in a challenging environment but is optimistic about 2018-19, expecting good business mainly from the government and state firms.


Fortis Healthcare: Fortis Healthcare said on Monday it had not decided whether to re-open bidding for itself, after an offer of funding that its board had accepted got a tepid response from investors, prolonging a fierce takeover battle. The Hero Enterprise Investment Office and Burman Family Office’s offer this month to invest Rs 1,800 crore ($267 million) in the company did not go down well with Fortis shareholders, who voted out a director last week. Three directors resigned ahead of the vote.


UltraTech Cement: UltraTech appears to have won the race for Binani Cement after lenders, in a marathon, seven-hour meeting on Monday decided to sell the bankrupt cement maker to the country’s biggest cement producer. Aditya Birla heavyweight UltraTech has, however, stipulated a condition. Its offer of Rs 7,600 crore is conditional upon its proposal receiving approval from the courts and is significant given that rival Dalmia Bharat consortium’s appeal against eligibility of UltraTech is pending before the Supreme Court and is likely to be heard next week.


Oil India: Energy exploration and production major Oil India on Monday reported an exponential increase of nearly Rs 848 crore rise in its net profit for the fourth quarter of 2017-18.

Kamdhenu: TMT bar and paints maker Kamdhenu almost tripled its net profit for the March quarter rising on the back of significant increase in royalties as well as consistent demand for TMT coming from the infrastructure sector. The company reported a 204 per cent increase in profit at Rs 5.6 crore while revenue from operations increased by 55% at Rs 376 crore.


Bank of India: Higher provisions for bad loans and lower earnings from the banking business led to Bank of India reporting an almost four-fold expansion in its fiscal fourth quarter net loss at Rs 3,969-crore. In the March quarter last fiscal year, the bank had reported a loss of Rs 1,048 crore.


Bank of Baroda: CLSA has retained ‘buy’ rating on Bank of Baroda and cut target price to Rs 170 from Rs 190. The brokerage firm has trimmed earnings estimates on the back of the lender’s results and lower treasury income, it expects the bank to return to profit from FY19 onwards. A recovery from the NCLT cases could provide upside and would be key to management’s ROE target of 10 per cent, CLSA added. Shares of Bank of Baroda ended up 3 per cent at Rs 145.40 on Monday.

OMCs: Shares of state-run oil marketing companies--BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corporation--will be watched after petrol and diesel prices were hiked for the sixteenth day in a row.

77,2018-05-30,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: The lenders of Binani Cement have issued letter of intent to UltraTech after approving its bid to acquire the company under the bankruptcy code, Aditya Birla group firm said today.

The Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement on May 28 approved the resolution Plan submitted by UltraTech Cement, it said in a regulatory filing.

The company said that the CoC ""has today issued a letter of intent to the Company for acquisition of Binani Cement"".

According to sources, the CoC of Binani Cement had voted in favour of UltraTech Cement's Rs 7,960-crore offer.

The race to acquire Binani was bitterly contested between two resolution applicants - UltraTech and Dalmia Bharat group.

The CoC had earlier approved the bid of Dalmia Bharat Group.

However, the Kolkata Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had turned it down asking to consider UltraTech offer, which was higher.

According to UltraTech, the ""acquisition provides the company access to large reserves of high quality limestone.""

It said: ""The acquisition increases the Company's presence in the highly competitive and fast growing Northern and Western markets in the country.""

Binai Cement has a capacity of 6.25 million tonne per annum (MTPA) in Rajasthan comprising an integrated cement unit with capacity of 4.85 MTPA and a split grinding unit with capacity of 1.4 MTPA.

In addition, BCL subsidiaries operate 2 MTPA grinding unit in UAE, 3 MTPA clinker unit and 0.5 MTPA grinding unit in China, UltraTech said.

""As the Company has already received the CCI approval, the resolution plan is now subject to the approval by NCLT,"" UltraTech further informed.

Binani's acquisition would also provide UltraTech access to large reserves of high quality limestone.

""The Company is confident of turning around the operations of Binani Cement, which will benefit all the stakeholders of BCL and result in synergies from optimisation of costs and improved realizations,"" it said.

It would also ""infuse the required financial stability and resources"" in Binani Cements.

On May 20, UltraTech announced to merge the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles and Industries through a share swap deal.

""Upon consummation of this transaction, the Company's cement capacity will stand augmented to 116.15 MTPA including the recently announced acquisition of cement units of Century Textiles & Industries Ltd,"" said UltraTech."
78,2018-05-31,UltraTech,"Here’s a lowdown on top macro triggers that may move market on Thursday. This report was compiled from agency feeds.

Moody's Cuts Growth Forecast
International rating company Moody’s Investors Service has cut India’s growth forecast to 7.3 per cent for 2018 from 7.5 per cent projected earlier on the back of higher oil prices. However, it expects the country to benefit from acceleration in rural consumption due to a normal monsoon and higher support prices. A re-escalation of trade tensions between the US and China is another risk factor to global growth, according to the company. Meanwhile, a Reuters poll showed that January-March 2018 would have the fastest expansion since before demonetaisation in November 2016 and implementation of GST in July 2017 stalled growth. GDP data is expected today.


ICICI Orders Probe Against Chanda Kochhar
The board of ICICI Bank has ordered an independent enquiry, including forensic audit, into new whistleblower allegations that CEO Chanda Kochhar violated the bank’s code of conduct, rules on conflict of interest and was part of quid pro quo dealings with certain bank borrowers.The bank’s board is planning to complete the probe while she is on her annual vacation, people familiar with the matter said. The enquiry will be overseen by the bank’s audit committee and will be headed by an “independent, credible person”.


MSCI May Cap India Weightage
The NSE-SGX fight seems to have taken its toll. MSCI Inc., one of the world’s biggest index compilers, is placing emerging markets including India and Brazil on notice for limiting investor access, reports Bloomberg. The two countries, along with Turkey and South Korea, are “potential future examples” of markets whose weights could be capped on MSCI indexes. All four countries restrict the use of their local data in derivatives created by offshore exchanges, putting them afoul of MSCI’s anti-competition clause. India also has a “lengthy and burdensome mandatory registration process” for foreign investors, MSCI said. 

AirAsia Dismisses CBI AllegationsAirAsia India, being investigated by the CBI, has said it would be ""incongruous"" to allege that the control of the airline is not in accordance with foreign exchange investment laws. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has received information that AirAsia group CEO Tony Fernandes and his deputy Bo Lingam handpicked “lobbyists” who claimed to have access to public officials, according to the CBI first information report (FIR) and people with knowledge of the matter. According to CBI, the key role was allegedly played by R Venkataramanan of Tata Sons, who “lobbied” hard to procure all “government approvals” necessary for AirAsia to operate in India. Tata is a stakeholder in AirAsia India. In a filing to the Malaysian stock exchange, AirAsia Berhad denied accusations and contentions, saying that it believes that ""these trumped up accusations are baseless and motivated by considerations that as yet remain unknown"". 


Monsoon UpdateThe monsoon will remain strong in India in July and dip only slightly below normal in August, the weather office said in its second-stage forecast, calming concerns of a mid-season downturn forecast by foreign meteorologists. Northern, western and central regions, the key areas of the summer-sown kharif crop can expect good rainfall but southern and north-eastern India may face a deficit although the country’s overall rainfall is forecast to be normal. 


Bank Strike Hits Money Market Ops
Banking operations in the country were hit on Wednesday as 10 lakh employees, primarily from PSU banks, went on 2-day strike to protest against a ""meagre"" 2 per cent salary hike. The strike, also supported by employees of some old generation private sector banks and foreign banks, will continue today. Operations at the new-generation private banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank were, however, almost normal, barring few activities including cheque clearance. Operations like deposits, FD renewals, government treasury operations, money market operations have been hit by the strike.

RCom Exits Insolvency
Reliance Communications has agreed to pay Rs 550 crore to Ericsson to settle an eight-month legal dispute over dues, paving the way for the Anil Ambani-controlled telecom company to exit bankruptcy proceedings and sell assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm and Brookfield to repay lenders.

5,2018-06-05,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Dalmia Bharat, one of the bidder who lost out to UltraTech Cement in the second round of bidding, to stay the resolution process of Binani Cement.

The court, however, said it will hear Dalmia Bharat’s plea on July 2.

Dalmia Bharat, who emerged the highest bidder in the first round, questioned the lenders’ decision to vote in favour of UltraTech Cement when the bankruptcy court was yet to announce its final decision on UltraTech Cement’s eligibility to bid.

The Supreme Court ruling effectively means that the resolution professional can present the resolution plan before the bankruptcy court. The National Company Law Tribunal – the dedicated bench to the hear bankruptcy cases- will hear the resolution plan approved by the lenders on June 18. In a parallel development, the higher bench of bankruptcy court will hear Dalmia Bharat’s appeal on the eligibility of the Ultratech on July 10. Dalmia Bharat’s grounds to object to UltraTech stem from an agreement under which Binani Industries signed to sell 98.4% of its stake in Binani Cement for Rs 7,266 crore to UltraTech.

“The decision to go ahead with resolution plan is very positive for lenders as it gives hope that the timeslines are being respected,” said one bank official who did not want to be identified. Binani Cement is facing bankruptcy proceeding and is the only company so far where the lenders are expected to receive full dues.

A week ago, all lenders unanimously voted in favour of awarding Binani Cement to UltraTech Cement for Rs 7,600 crore. Dalmia Bharat, declared winner is the first round, declined to raise its offer of Rs 6,582 crore in the second round.

The second round of bidding was conducted after the bankruptcy court directed lenders to consider UltraTech’s bid – which was higher than Dalmia but made after lenders decided to award Binani Cement to Dalmia Bharat.

Interestingly, UltraTech has offered to pay lenders their dues only 5 days after the receipt of the order in their favour. Lenders had made a claim of Rs 6,313 crore against which they would receive Rs 6,851crore since this is the only case where interest during the moratorium period (when company is referred to IBC) is being paid."

16,2018-06-20,UltraTech,"Mumbai: Ratings agency India Ratings has affirmed UltraTech Cement and its borrowings 'IND AAA' with a stable outlook on the basis of a strong market position and lineup of acquisitions along with a good cash flow generation and liquidity. 

However, if net leverage (net debt to EBITDA ratio) hovers above 1.5x due to an unexpected debt-funded expansion or acquisition, a reduction in buffer cash and securities without a commensurate reduction in gross debt or delays in the integration of acquired assets, it could result in a rating downgrade, Ind-Ra said. 

With a 92.5 MT per annum capacity, the Aditya Birla-led UltraTech Cement is the largest cement maker in the country, poised to become the world's third largest company excluding China after its acquisition of the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries which will take the cement maker to 105.9 MT. 

It has also placed a bid for the distressed Binani Cement that is awaiting final nod from the the insolvency tribunal NCLT. 

It has been consistently reporting positive cash flows from operations and free cash flow for over a decade. Ind-Ra expects the the trend to continue based on a stable working capital cycle as well as profitability. It's cash and current investment stand at Rs 4,168 crore estimatedly for the year 2017-18. 

However, the company's per tonne EBITDA could remain under pressure due to rising fuel and prices. 

In terms of net debt, the company will be taking over an additional Rs 3,000 crore of debt for its acquisition of Century Textiles and Industries which would increase its net leverage in the near term. Over the medium term, however, Ind-Ra expects this to improve over the medium term as the company achieves operational synergies and expands reach in newer markets. 

It's debt for 2017-18 stood at Rs 19,480 crore with a revenue of Rs 31,411 crore and operating EBITDA of Rs 6,145 crore. Interest expenses for the year stood at Rs 1,233 crore."

It formed a bearish Harami pattern followed by a bullish Harami pattern, which indicates that the bulls and the bears are not ready to loosen their grip and follow-up buying is missing on both sides.

The index formed a Doji candle or a pin bar last week, but failed to hold above the same and again got stuck in a range. Now it requires a decisive range breakout above 10,835 or below 10,700 to commence the next leg of rally.

33,2018-06-25,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: UltraTech Cement is planning to raise Rs 9,000 crore via an issue of redeemable, non-convertible debentures on a private placement basis, the company said on Friday, while notifying the exchange of its annual general meeting to be held on July 18. It plans to seek shareholders’ nod for the issuance on the AGM.

UltraTech last month announced the acquisition of the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries and it was to be financed through a share swap, besides taking on Century’s debt of Rs 3,000 crore.

UltraTech has also aggressively bid for Binani Cement under the bankruptcy code that seeks resolution of distressed assets in the country.

The cement maker also recently commissioned its greenfield clinker plant of 3.5 MT in Manawar in Madhya Pradesh with a grinding facility and waste heat recovery system at the site still to be constructed before September 2018.

UltraTech ’s net debt at the end of March, 2018 stood at Rs 12,007 crore and net debt to EBITDA ratio at 1.85x. It increased to Rs 17,000 crore after it announced the Century acquisition, pulling up its leverage to 2.35x. KK Maheshwari, UltraTech’s MD, said that with the company generating cash every year, the leverage was within comfort levels.

However, if it is successful in acquiring Binani for which it has bid close to Rs 8,000 crore, its leverage is bound to cross 3x. “This is okay in the short term, but if cement prices do not improve pulling up the EBITDA, the leverage will become a cause of worry,” said Prateek Kumar, cement analyst at Antique Stock Broking.

In a recent move, India Ratings had affirmed the AAA rating to the cement maker with a ‘Stable’ outlook based on its strong market position and line-up of acquisitions along with a good cash flow generation and liquidity.

Ind-Ra said the company has been reporting positive cash flows from operations and free cash flow for over a decade and it expects the the trend to continue based on a stable working capital cycle as well as profitability.

38,2018-06-26,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: As the bears overpowered the bulls on Monday, dragging the Nifty pack down by some 60 points, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 98 counters on NSE, signalling the possibility of a downward trend reversal.

Among the stocks that saw bearish crossovers were Idea Cellular, Allahabad Bank, HPCL, BHEL, Motherson Sumi, Power Finance Corporation, SREI Infrastructure, PTC India, Wipro, Sintex Industries, Gujarat Pipavav Port and Aditya Birla Capital.

Some of these counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw similar bearish crossovers included UCO Bank, Arcotech, Hero MotoCorp, Majesco L, Amara Raja Batteries, Zee Media Corp, Maruti Suzuki India, Welspun India, Tejas Networks, IL&FS Transportation and Nava Bharat Ventures.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa.



The MACD alone may not be sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also signalled bullish crossovers for 29 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘buy’ signals. They included Tata Power, PNB Housing Finance, HDFC Bank, KEC International, UltraTech Cement, MAS Financial Services, Filatex India, Shalby and TRF.



The Nifty50 index on Monday formed a bearish candle similar to the ‘Bearish Harami’ pattern on the daily chart. A ‘Bearish Harami’ followed by a ‘Bullish Harami’ pattern indicates that the bulls and the bears are not ready to loosen their grips and followup action was missing on both sides, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

On the way up, the gap area between 10,834 and 10,850 levels will be a crucial resistance zone for Nifty in the near term, whereas on its way down, the 10,701 level will be a crucial support, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

In the near term, the index can drift lower towards the 10,550 –10,417 zone once it breaks the low of 10,701. Overall, the short-term chart structure of the index remains bearish.

“We maintain our bearish outlook on the index for the short term with a reversal placed at 10,930,” said Ratnaparkhi.

Understanding MACD



A close look at the chart of Maruti Suzuki India shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

39,2018-06-26,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Jaiprakash Associates is in advanced talks with LafargeHolcim-controlled ACC Limited to sell its residual cement business with an installed capacity of about 5.5 million tonnes per annum for Rs 5,200 crore.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the fiscal, said two people familiar with the development.

“The company is divesting its entire residual cement asset to become a debt free company and also to infuse fund in its cash-crunched subsidiary Jaypee Infratech Limited, the listed real estate arm of the company,” said a person involved in the transaction.

Jaypee has entered into an exclusivity agreement with ACC till July 31. A spokesperson of ACC declined comment on what he called “market speculation”.

Jaiprakash Associates also declined a comment.

Jaiprakash Associates, which houses the group’s cement business, is raising Rs 2,200 crore from Deutsche Bank as bridge loan against the sale of cement assets. About Rs 1,000 crore of the proceeds from the bridge loan will be used for Jaypee Infratech after getting lenders and court approval. The balance will be used to repay its own term loan, sources said.

“Jaiprakash Associates is the holding company of Jaypee Infratech and is complying with the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” a company spokesperson said. “As a law abiding corporate of the country, JAL is working on various options to meet its commitments to various stakeholders, including homeowners.”

According to a senior official of a public sector bank, Jaiprakash Associates has submitted a detail proposal in the meeting of joint lender forum (JLF) last week.

“Under the proposed plan, the company will divest its entire cement business for about Rs 5,200 crore,” the person said. “The divestment is aimed at making the company debt free.”

Once the deal will be consummated, the proceeds will be used first to repay the Deutsche Bank’s bridge loan facility and the rest will be used to repay term loan of the company, said the lender.

The proposed divestment of the cement business include units in central India with clinker capacity of 4.4 million tonnes and grinding capacity of about 3.3 million tonnes, the firm’s 74 per cent stake in Bhilai Jaypee Cement, a joint venture with Steel Authority of India, and Nigrie Cement Grinding Unit.



Jaiprakash Associates had earlier entered into a binding agreement with Orient Cement, a CK Birla Group firm, to sell its Bhilai Cement and Nigrie Cement Grinding Unit for Rs 1,946 crore in May 2017. However, the transaction was terminated last month due to delay of more than 12 months in finalising the deal.

After the sale of cement business, Jaiprakash Associates will be primarily an EPC contractor in road and hydro power. It has already started refocusing on the EPC projects and has got contracts worth about Rs14,000-crore. The company will also have some hotel properties and about 50 million sq ft of undeveloped land along the Yamuna Expressway.

The Jaypee Group has sold assets worth over Rs 36,000 crore to repay loans of banks. These included Rs 20,000-crore sale of cement business to UltraTech Cement, an AV Birla group company, sale of hydro power projects to JSW Energy for Rs 9,700 crore, and sale of 74 per cent stake in Bokaro Cement to Dalmia Cement for Rs 1,150 crore."

As the bears keep a tight grip on the domestic equity market, testing the limits of investors’ patience, market pundits are seeking to look at the situation as a glass half-filled, pointing out opportunities to accumulate shares of good businesses.

They say the way SIP investors of mutual funds are going whole hog to lap up the dips in the market, direct equity investors too can use the systematic equity planning route to hoard fundamentally-strong stocks, one lot at a time.

While mutual funds are always there for such a systematic approach, if you don’t want to go for the entire mutual fund portfolio and instead focus on a few high conviction ideas, systematic equity planning (SEP) or SIPs in direct equities can help.

In a tumultuous market, which itself looks unsure of its direction in the near term, such a systematic approach can help accumulate stocks at lower prices by averaging out costs.

Direct equity SIP can help eliminate the risk of timing the market and average out benefits. Investors can put in a pre-decided amount or pick a specified quantity of stocks at regular intervals over long period. If the investment is constant, one buys more units when the price is low and fewer units when the price is high. Similarly, when one buys a specific quantity at regular intervals, it may lower the cost by averaging it out.

The only flaw, if any, is that direct SIP does not allow automatic diversification the way a mutual fund SIP does, unless the investor himself/herself picks a set of diverse stocks to buy in the first place.

Direct SIP in equities can help accumulate stocks of your choice in your portfolio on a regular basis. It benefits you by cost averaging, says Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.

“It gives the power of compounding to your investment. A well-diversified stock portfolio generally smoothens out the impact of the market’s highs and lows,” he said.

Prakarsh Gagdani, CEO, 5Paisa.com said the process works just like mutual fund SIPs, but a long-term approach is needed to see significant gains.

Stock selection is important for SIP in direct equity. If one company’s performance deteriorates in the long run, the benefits may not be as good as in the case of a mutual fund SIP, he said. 

Similar to mutual fund SIP, direct equity SIPs also allow investors to put in money on a monthly or quarterly basis. 


Time frame and cost
Market experts say investors opting for this route must have a clear view about the company and its stock price for 2-3 years or even more. One should go through the company’s balance sheet, study cash flow statements, return ratios and consider the impact of any micro and macro changes.

Direct equity SIP allows you to save on expenses that you incur in a mutual fund SIP. In mutual fund SIP, the fund manager may have an edge and better ability to switch funds to better stocks, book profits when required or shift fund to the safety of debt when the situation goes out of hand. In direct equity SIP, one has to do it all by himself, brokerage Bonanza Portfolio said in a note.

Goldi Jain, AVP for Advisory, Sharekhan said the cost is low in direct equity SIP compared with a mutual fund SIP, where the expense ratio ranges from 1.2 to 2.5 per cent.


Current market scenario
Investors have been cautious on the domestic equity market this calendar amid rising crude oil prices, unabated outflow of foreign institutional investors’ money, worries over global trade war and weakness in the rupee. 

The domestic equity benchmarks are trading at around 8 per cent premium to its 10-year average P/E ratio. However, a faster pace of economic growth and commodity prices can be favourable tailwinds for corporate earnings growth. In FY19, corporate earnings are projected to grow at 20 per cent after many years of single-digit growth. However, the equity market has already factored in the earnings recovery in prices. That may mean downward pressure on the market in the near term, said Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL.


Investment options
Considering the scenario, if you are looking for systematic investment in direct equity with a 2-3 year investment horizon, Bonanza Portfolio recommends a basket of 8-10 stocks, which include Bajaj finance, Godrej Consumer, HUL, Titan, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank. 

5Paisa.com recommends direct equity SIP in Tata Motors, HDFC, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma and Lupin.

Jain of Sharekhan prefers HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Marico, Ultratech Cement, Britannia for direct SIP. 

Investors need to do due diligence while choosing stocks. Also, one would need to review the portfolio from time to time."
49,2018-06-28,UltraTech,"“As important as the issues discussed was the fact that @PMO India spent more time at the session than budgeted & also 45 minutes of unhurried conversation over tea with all participants. A powerful & timely signal of confidence in the business community,” Anand Mahindra, chairman and managing director Mahindra & Mahindra, tweeted after Prime Minister's meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday with 41 business leaders.

However, the conversation wasn't all ""unhurried"". The event saw friction between Kumar Mangalam Birla and Ajay Piramal come out in the open, according to a Business Standard report. Birla and Piramal — locked in a bidding war over Binani Cement at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)—voiced their differences on bankruptcy proceedings. 

Piramal informed the PM that the NCLT process was being vitiated by some players who had lost the race at the bidding stage but were trying to get back into the process through other means, the report said citing a source who attended the meeting.

Reacting to Piramal, Birla said the NCLT process was clear that the company would be awarded to the highest bidder and not arbitrarily, the report said. Birla also said the NCLT process should be such that it demanded the least sacrifice from all stakeholders.

According to the report, Piramal had spoken out after the PM sought comments from business leaders on increasing economic growth. 

""There was tension in the room as it was a corporate battle played out in front of the PM. Some of us were quite uncomfortable with the war of words,"" said a CEO who attended the meeting, according to the report. The PM just listened to Piramal and Birla without making any comments. 

Other industrialists present at the meeting included Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh and Piramal group chairman Ajay Piramal. Top bankers including State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar and Kotak Mahindra Bank chairman Uday Kotak also attended the meeting. 

Early this month, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Dalmia Bharat, one of the bidder backed by Piramal Enterprises who lost out to Birla's UltraTech Cement in the second round of bidding, to stay the resolution process of Binani Cement. The court, however, said it will hear Dalmia Bharat’s plea on July 2. 

Dalmia Bharat, who emerged the highest bidder in the first round, questioned the lenders’ decision to vote in favour of UltraTech Cement when the bankruptcy court was yet to announce its final decision on UltraTech Cement’s eligibility to bid.

The second round of bidding was conducted after the bankruptcy court directed lenders to consider UltraTech’s bid – which was higher than Dalmia but made after lenders decided to award Binani Cement to Dalmia Bharat."
50,2018-06-30,UltraTech,"MUMABAI: Bank of Baroda has sold its Rs 410 crore loans in Binani Cement to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company in a reflection of the lenders’ frustration in resolving a bankruptcy that’s mired in litigation, said two people familiar with the matter.

The sale of the loan involves a structured transaction where the lender would receive a portion of the profits if the ARC is able to recover more than what it was originally valued at, said those people who did not want to be identified.

“It is a structured deal wherein Edelweiss ARC gave the highest offer,” said an official. “As per the structure, Edelweiss ARC would share the upside with Bank of Baroda once the Binani Cement resolution plan finally goes through.”

Aditya Birla Group-owned Ultra-Tech and Dalmia Cement are quarrelling over the control of Binani Cement with each bettering the offer of the other and questioning the validity of each others’ offers.

Lenders had approved a resolution plan of UltraTech Cement which is being opposed by Dalmia Bharat on grounds that they had offered more than UltraTech.

Dalmia Bharat emerged the highest bidder with Rs 6,582 crore offer which was approved by 99.5 per cent of lenders, but this was challenged by UltraTech at bankruptcy court on grounds that the bidding process was not transparent and went on to raise the bid to Rs 7,600 crore."

6,2018-07-05,UltraTech,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Cement makers in the world’s second-biggest market for the commodity have recently raised prices in select local pockets, but the increases largely apply to bulk sales to builders and infrastructure providers — or the nontrade segment of the industry.

Analysts who met dealers stocking cement bags that are ultimately used by individual home builders (IHBs) said that prices have risen in select regions by 3-5 per cent in June, when compared both with the year-ago and month-ago periods.

On a month-on-month basis, except the west, prices rose in the range of Rs 315-330 per 50 kg bag in June. Against last year, except in the south and west, cement prices in the ‘rest-of-India’ region climbed 3 per cent-5.5 per cent.

Still, competition and the industry’s increasing dependence on nontrade business, which has both bargaining power and suffers from cyclicality, should limit the ability to raise prices further.

Yet, raw material and freight costs continue to rise, foretelling significant margin pressure for manufacturers in an industry where dominance is defined by on-the-ground presence and the proximity of output sources to consuming markets.

Deepak Sharma, director of strategy at Kanvic Consulting, a management consulting firm, said: “Between 2018 and 2021, there will be an incremental supply of 80 MT.

This capacity is happening across the board by large and mid-sized players as well as new entrants. As a result, by 2021, there is a forecast of excess supply of over 170 MT, which will keep industry-wide capacity utilisation below 70 per cent.”

Sharma added: “As a result of this, there will be pressure on earnings. In our assessment, the industry’s volume growth will be in the range of 5-7 per cent between FY18 and FY21.”

Kanvic Consulting expects that in the next three years, after incremental capacity addition, the industry will remain fragmented and market share of top 10 players will remain flat.




Analysts say that central, eastern and northern regions should generate stable demand: west and south may be volatile. Kanvic Consulting believes that those with robust supply chains, distribution managements and logistics are likely to do well. Among these players are UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement."

Going forward, June quarter earnings, macro data and geopolitical developments will continue to influence investor sentiment.


Here's a lowdown on the key factors that are likely to steer market in the coming week -


June quarter earnings
An action-packed week awaits on the earnings front, as several big names are scheduled to announce their Q1 numbers. FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is slated to release its results on Monday, July 16, while Zee, Crisil and Ashok Leyland will announce theirs on Tuesday, July 17. Bandhan Bank, JK Tyre, Mindtree, RCom and Ultratech Cement are expected to declare earnings on Wednesday, July 18. Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank will announce their numbers on Thursday, July 19. Wipro, Bajaj Auto, MCX and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company will release theirs on Friday, July 20.


WPI numbers
On the macro front, the government will announce wholesale price inflation (WPI) for June 2018 on Monday, July 16. Wholesale inflation accelerated to a 14-month high in May, driven by a broad-based increase in prices that had spilled over to the retail level as well. WPI rose by 4.43 per cent YoY in May 2018, compared with 3.18 per cent in April and 2.26 per cent a year earlier.


Stock-specific actions
PC Jewellers will remain in focus when trading resumes on Monday after the company on Friday withdrew a May 10 proposal wherein it had announced a plan to buy back shares worth Rs 424 crore from shareholders. Aurobindo Pharma on Saturday said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Apotex's businesses in Czech Republic, Poland, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands for 74 million euro.

This apart, Dr Reddy's Laboratories would be in focus after the New Jersey District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the domestic drugmaker on sale of a generic version of Indivior's prescription medicine Suboxone in the US market.


Trump-Putin meet
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on Monday, July 16. Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine, while Trump has said he would press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 US election to the war in Syria, Reuters reported.


Global cues
China's GDP data for second quarter will be unveiled on Monday, July 16. The Chinese economy expanded 6.8 per cent year-on-year in the quarter ended March 2018, the same pace as in the previous two quarters. Markets will closely monitor the data as the first salvos have been exchanged in a trade war with the United States. It is expected to show growth easing very marginally to 6.7 per cent, says Reuters report. 


Rupee, crude prices
Investors will keep an eye on the movement of the rupee against the US dollar and swings in crude prices.

The rupee on Friday surged to a three-week high of 68.31 before closing marginally up by four paise at 68.53 against the US currency mirroring late losses in stock markets and capital outflows. Oil prices rose on Friday but declined for the week as supply concerns eased. Earlier on Wednesday, crude prices plunged 5 per cent for its worst daily performance in over a year amid trade war tensions and reports the US could consider waivers on sanctions against Iran.


Powell's testimony on July 17
According to a report by Reuters, US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on July 17. ""Powell’s testimony will be closely watched as the Fed tries to navigate towards higher interest rates at a pace that keeps inflation under control but without going so far or fast that it slows the economy,"" the report said.


Tech chart
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a small bearish candle on the daily chart, signalling the possibility of a near-term pause in the ongoing momentum. However, a bullish candle was clearly visible on the weekly chart with a full-fledged breakout above the eight-week consolidation zone, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. Weekly momentum oscillators such as 14-day RSI and ADX are all signalling a sharp upside momentum in the market, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. He sees strong resistance for Nifty50 in the 11,170-200 zone in the coming week."
28,2018-07-16,UltraTech,"Selective buying in heavyweight stocks took the benchmark BSE Sensex to an all-time high level last week.

However, most of the stocks in the 30-share index are still giving negative returns on a year-to-date basis. The selling pressure has been severe in midcap and smallcap stocks. 

Headwinds in the form of weak emerging markets, rising rates, higher crude oil prices, election year worries and relative rich valuations have mainly impacted sentiments on Dalal Street this year. 

Global brokerage Morgan Stanley, which estimates Sensex to hit 36,000 by June next year in base case, believes the largecap index has support from an improving growth cycle, strong macro stability and local appetite for equities.

“We expect Sensex earnings growth of 5 per cent YoY in F2018, 23 per cent in F2019 and 24 per cent in FY2020,” the brokerage said in a report.

In a bull case scenario, it sees Sensex at 44,000 and in bear case at 26,500. 


Factors favouring the market
The global brokerage highlighted the factors that are looking favourable for the market. They include macroeconomic stability evident in positive BoP and backed by RBI’s commitment to keeping real rates positive. 

A bullish steepening of yield curve, which is at a post-2010 high, correlates positively with stocks and low and falling beta, which augur well in a weak global equity market environment.

In addition to this, India’s growth is likely accelerating relative to emerging markets. “Our work shows corporate confidence is at a multi-year high and profits are likely to mean-revert from below trend. Strong domestic flows, currently averaging around $2-2.5 billion a month, are in a structural uptrend,” Morgan Stanley said.

The brokerage prefers largecaps to midcaps and like sectors, including banks (private corporate and retail), discretionary consumption, industrials and domestic materials, while avoiding healthcare, staples, utilities, global materials and energy.

The brokerage further says crude oil prices remain a key risk to equities given its ability to cause pain to fiscal deficit and, therefore, growth. It sees strong growth in 2018 and 2019 driven by consumption, exports, government spending and a nascent recovery in private capex.


Valuations
Morgan Stanley said equities do not look compelling compared with long bonds. India’s recent outperformance has lifted relative valuations above average. “Our composite valuation indicator suggests low double-digit index returns in the coming 12 months,” it added in a report.


Stocks in focus
Bajaj Auto, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, Titan, ITC, ITC, RIL, Bharat Financial, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M Financial, Shriram Transport, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Adani Ports, Havells India, Asian Paints, Ultratech Cement, UPL and Infosys are among the stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focus list. 


Factors against domestic equities
The global brokerage said a likely rise in crude oil prices can put pressure on growth, while upward pressure on inflation from food price hikes indicate that more rate hikes are coming. The election cycle, which brings its own set of uncertainties, relatively rich midcap valuations (even after the recent drawdown) and high equity valuations relative to bonds, which indicates that the market is pricing in some part of the coming growth recovery, are some of the factors looking against Indian equities."
29,2018-07-18,UltraTech,"US Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments of US growth and jobs have buoyed US and Asian markets, while a further drop in crude oil prices promises to give the domestic market a strong start on Wednesday. Let's check out what all might matter to Dalal Street during the day:


Singapore trading sets stage for gap-up startNifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 41 points, or 0.37 per cent, higher at 10,943, indicating a firm start for the Nifty50.


OthersSource: sgxnifty.org

Tech view: Nifty50 forms small bullish candleNifty supports shifted higher and the trade setup remains in favour of the bulls, but the index needs further strength to get past multiple hurdles and make its way towards the 11,080 level. It appears the last three sessions of the corrective consolidation phase is a mere pause of the ongoing strong uptrend as the advance-decline ratio tilted in favour of the bulls during the course of the day, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. 


Strong job growth, low inflation ahead: Fed Chair 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday he sees the United States on track for years more of steady growth, but was challenged in a congressional hearing by senators worried the Trump administration’s trade policies were already damaging businesses in their districts.


US stocks end higher
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index added 55.53 points, or 0.22 per cent, to close at 25,119.89. The S&P500 index advanced 11.12 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 2,809.55. The Nasdaq Composite gained 49.40 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 7,855.12.


Asian shares climb on US cues

38,2018-07-18,UltraTech,"Industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla today warned of near-term headwinds for the economy saying the rising oil prices, spiralling inflation, firming bond yields and a widening current account deficit are areas of concern. 

The present positive outlook gets a bit dimmed when one views the increasing trade protectionism, rising crude prices, geo-political risks and the uncertainty about tightening monetary policies in the advanced economies, Birla told the shareholders at the annual general meeting of the group flagship Ultratech Cement here this evening. 

Noting that the economy has shown considerable resilience to the transitory effects on demonetization and GST rollout, he said infrastructure projects like Bharatmala, new airports and metros, along with affordable housing and smart cities will stoke growth in the medium-term. 

""However, there are near-term challenges. Rising oil prices and inflation, firming bond yields and a widening current account deficit are areas of concern. The ongoing global trade wards, more so between the US and China, are worrisome and will have a spillover negative effects on our economy,"" Birla warned. 


Noting that the domestic cement industry has seen demand pick-up of late, he said after seven years the industry is likely to report good growth this year. Government thrust on infrastructure development remains the key growth driver. Revival of rural housing demand and push to low-cost housing have supported strong volume offtake, Birla said. 

In FY18, the industry was hit due to ban on sand mining and pet-coke in major states impacted construction activities. The massive duty hike on imported pet-coke from 2.5 per cent to 10 and the increase in diesel prices pushed freight cost upwards. This resulted in higher operating costs and impacted the margins, he said. 

However, the cement industry is expected to post 8 per cent growth in FY19 due to slew of infrastructure projects, Birla said. 

Meanwhile, Ultrarech today reported a 30 per cent plunge in consolidated net at Rs 631 crore in the June quarter from Rs 898 crore a year ago, despite a robust jump in net sales to Rs 8,841 crore from Rs 6,938 crore. 

Acquisition of 21.2 million tonne cement assets of Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement, and the successful commissioning of a 2.5-mt greenfield clinker capacity at Dhar in MP, have helped the UltraTech to become the third largest cement company globally, ex-China, and the largest domestic player, Birla said. 

The demerger of group company Century's cement business into UltraTech is expected to be completed within the ensuing two-three quarters, he said. 

Century's cement business comprises three integrated units in MP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra with a total capacity of 12.6 mt. 

""This transaction will provide an opportunity for strengthening our presence in the highly fragmented, competitive and fast growing Eastern and Central markets. It also extends its footprint in the Western and Southern markets,"" he added. 

Birla also informed that the company has submitted a resolution plan for acquiring Binani Cement and if goes through it will help the compay meets its the long-term strategy of expanding, growing and consolidating its bsuiness in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

39,2018-07-19,UltraTech,"Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) appears to have revamped its investment strategy on Dalal Street if its June quarter portfolio tweaks are any indication.

The insurance behemoth invested in some lesser-known companies through the quarter even as it exited well-known names, in what looked like a game-changing strategy by the country’s largest institutional investor.

The public sector insurer has seen its portfolio underperform the benchmark BSE Sensex index over the past year, mainly because of investments it had made over the years in some weak public sector companies every time the government went for share sale.

LIC was busy shopping all through the April-June period, as the broader market witnessed a lot of weakness and stocks across sectors slipped to attractive valuations.

The insurer bought shares from across sectors, including banks, rating agencies, logistics, metals and mining, cement, oil marketing companies, power as well as chemicals.

What really surprised analysts and markets watchers was sudden appearance of its name among shareholders of lesser-known companies such as Paisalo Digital and Williamson Magor.

The insurer’s name did not figure among the major shareholders of these companies at the end of the previous quarter.

Paisalo Digital, formerly SE Investments, is a non-deposit taking non-banking financial company. Williamson Magor is also an NBFC and its business activities include investments, lending and providing rent, maintenance and management consultancy services.

LIC also held over 2 per cent stake in Federal-Mogul Goetze (India) and GSK Consumer Health at the end of June. It was not among the key shareholders at the end of previous quarter.

On the other hand, the insurer reduced its holding in more than 30 firms during the quarter, including some key names such as Nalco, Tata Power, Uco Bank, Allahabad Bank and even IDBI Bank, the PSU lender it now plans to buy out.

The Indian Hotels, Bata India and Ambuja Cement also witnessed a significant drop in LIC’s shareholding at the end of June.

The insurance behemoth increased its holding in State Bank of India, the country’s biggest lender by assets, to 10.23 per cent at the end of June from 10 per cent at the end of March quarter.

According to a report by Business Standard, the insurance behemoth has bailed out several public sector companies but these investments have resulted in the underperformance of the insurer’s equity portfolio. The value of LIC’s equity portfolio (adjusted for incremental investment in the intervening period) jumped 65 per cent since March 2012 against doubling of the Sensex during the period.

It also lapped up shares in two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp, raising its stake to 6.36 per cent from 3.5 per cent. Hero MotoCorp has increased its lead over rival Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) in the first quarter of this financial year.

Data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) showed Hero MotoCorp sold 20,60,342 bikes and scooters during the April-June period compared with 16,90,423 units sold by HMSI.

In the April-June quarter of last financial year, Hero had sold 18,11,343 units compared with 14,78,478 units for HMSI. Hero MotoCorp is also among top picks of HDFC Securities in auto OEM space.

LIC also bought shares in HCL Technologies, Hindustan Unilever, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Ultratech Cement.





HUL last week posted a 19.17 per cent rise in June quarter net profit at Rs 1,529 crore on strong volume growth and sustained margin improvement. The company had posted Rs 1,283 crore profit for the April-June period a year-ago.

Some brokerages have raised target prices for the FMCG stock following June quarter earnings, while others have downgraded it, citing expensive valuations.

Top brokerages such as CLSA, Edelweiss, HSBC, ICICIdirect and Motilal Oswal have increased target price on the stock by 4-18 per cent. However, Antique Stock Broking, Nomura and Jefferies have downgraded it.

UltraTech Cement on Wednesday beat Street estimates and reported Rs 598 crore profit for June quarter.

HCL Technologies on July 18 said it has completed a $330 million acquisition of US-based Actian Corporation in partnership with Sumeru Equity Partners (SEP).

In a filing, it said through this deal HCL Tech will “own high margin, recurring revenue IP business in data analytics, integration and management products.”

Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley have ‘outperform’ rating on the stock, with price targets of Rs 1,175 and Rs 1,060, respectively.

In all, LIC hiked stakes in over 25 companies in Q1, data available with Ace Equity till July 17 showed. The insurance behemoth has stakes in more than 250 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The insurance firm hogged limelight this month after it announced plans to enter the banking space by buying a controlling stake in the debt-stressed IDBI Bank. It currently holds 7.98 per cent in the bank compared with 10.82 per cent as on March 31, 2018."

After trading stable for most part of the day, the Nifty saw some paring of gains in between. However, it recovered from the low point and ended the day with a net gain of 49.55 points or 0.45 per cent.

While maintaining a positive bias for Wednesday’s trade, we see the market approaching its previous lifetime high level of 11,170, where it is likely to witness some consolidation once again.

The structure of the market remains very much intact and we will see it attempting to mark fresh highs in coming days. However, some resistance at the previous high may not be ruled out.

Wednesday is likely to the levels of 11,170 and 11,235 acting as immediate resistance area for the Nifty. Supports may come in at 11,075 and 11,010 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 67.9207. RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is a bullish sign. The daily MACD stays bullish, as it continues to trade above its signal line. Apart from a small white body, no significant formations were observed on the candles.



Pattern analysis of the Nifty reveals that after pausing its upmove and remaining in a brief congestion for couple of days, the index has clearly moved out of it. It is set to approach its previous high level of 11,170 wherein it is expected to encounter minor resistance and see some consolidation happening as well.

Overall, the intent and bias of the market remainis intact.

The positive part of the story is that along with the broader markets that have stabilised, the sectors such as Infra and metals, among others, which grossly underperformed the market, have also started to participate.

Any consolidation that occurs at current or higher levels should be continued to make fresh purchases.

45,2018-07-24,UltraTech,"Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Equity Advisory, Motilal Oswal Securities, says he is expecting around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. He was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:

Do you believe UPL’s acquisition of Arysta Lifescience is going to be value accretive and the synergy realisation can provide a significant upside even after yesterday’s upmove in the stock?
UPL has a fantastic track record of acquiring overseas companies in last 20-25 years. They made 20-odd acquisitions in so many years. With Arysta, it will be increasing $3 billion worth of debt on UPL’s special purpose vehicle and that would be a dilution. Net debt to equity will go higher. How they will be able to service the debt, the interest cost on the debt is something needs to be watched.

There will be a bit of postponement. It will be there for the earnings over FY20-FY21. It is very much priced in and it is not going to be value accretive at this point in time for next one-one and a half years.


Talking about the big earnings which the market is going to be reacting to and besides ACC’s good numbers, one wonders what went wrong with United Spirits? How to explain that kind of muted volume growth?
There was high expectation that post highway ban, there would again be a significant jump in the quarter, but the premiumisation is not working well. The Prestige and other brands have shown a very tepid growth and the cost has also gone up significantly.

EBITDA has improved but margin is not improving and the EBITDA margin and the profit margin both are very much flattish. Topline is growing but bottom line is growing a little less -- 10% to 15%. Plus, the earnings volatility is such that it is unpredictable whether one quarter will be a good enough to show traction for profitability in FY19 or FY20 or any other financial year. It is just a flipflop kind of an earning trajectory. They are still struggling with trying to rationalise operations again the regulatory actions.


What could we expect from Asian Paints today given that it is the leader in the paints segment? It is the go-to story when it comes to paint stocks and the fact that the market is betting big on the segment especially after the GST rates are being cut?
Asian Paints has 60% odd market share in the paint industry. It is a dominant player. This quarter, Asian Paints could see a 10-15% kind of a growth. Crude volatility, which is a raw material margin, needs to be watched out for. Crude has now retraced back from 80 to odd 72-73 odd. That gives some kind of a breather for rest of the financial year. We expect around 44-45 times PE multiple for next year. That means it can show further growth also.


In the metal story, do you think Hindalco, Tata Steel, Vedanta are buys even at the current levels?
Currency headwinds are almost there for the metal sector but trade war between the two elephants is showing a worrisome sign for these companies. Prices are declining day by day. Realisation will get hit for at least next one to two quarters and that is visible from here. Plus, we believe that the metal companies have done their capacity expansion to the fullest. Now there is not much of a scope there but if demand declines, then bad days will start for them. 

It is not a linear growth for metal stocks at any point in time throughout the year. With 100% capacity expansion, if demand slows down and price realisation is down, then they will have to suffer. However, with Hindalco, there is a different story. They have acquired Aleris and that is a different ball game. One can enter the stocks at around 8% to 10% correction. Even JSW Steel or Hindalco or Vedanta will provide a good opportunity in the longer term.


What is your perspective on mid-tier cement names? Cement is more of a regional play and if names like ACC are doing well, one can only extrapolate that some of the smaller companies will also see traction in their earnings. Would you agree?
I would say even UltraTech Cement has delivered in line with expectation. ACC is beyond comparison because traditionally, it is a very old plant and has had limited capacity expansion. Now the premium segment is picking up in ACC and so it is not comparable with others.

Irrespective of ACC cost per tonne has been reduced, the other cost has gone down and EBITDA has improved slightly, that does not mean that other midcap company which we are talking about is going to be performing better. It is a different ballgame for ACC at this point in time. We believe volume growth will be tepid enough. There will be 6% to 7% average volume growth for all the companies.

In midcaps, Birla Corp is something which needs to be watched out for in terms of results and ongoing for next one-one and a half year, the stock has corrected significantly and Reliance Cement which was the recent acquisition of one-one and a half year back, is running at 80% capacity. There are high chances that the stock can react to the positivity for next one-one and a half year. But it would be an investment perspective and not for trading. So for midcaps, almost 5% to 7% volume growth will be there in this quarterly numbers.


Beside earnings, this week is very critical in terms of a Nifty earnings composition. L&T, ITC, Hero MotoCorp and Reliance Industries will report their numbers. Which ones are you looking out for and what is your expectation thereof?
This week, the result to watch out for would be ITC. We have to see where are its growth numbers and how the food and the non-cigarette business is shaping up. It can surprise positively rather than negative. 

In Hero MotoCorp, again a price war is taking place at the domestic level with Bajaj. The entry level segment will again be dampening the sentiment. It is not something which would be exciting.

Reliance needs to be watched to see how the margin will come up for this quarter and whether it has taken anything out of the crude advantage. On EBITDA front plus, Jio is doing very well and the retail needs to be watched. Maruti is our favourite."

On further movement in domestic equity markets, Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan said, “We feel that from here on earnings will play a major role in determining further upside. Factors such as global trade wars and upcoming general elections in India will keep investors cautious in the short term. However, the longer term picture for Indian equities looks positive and we continue to prefer sectors such as private banking, consumer discretionary, information technology and pharma. With the rupee hovering close to 69 mark we feel certain IT and pharma companies will benefit from these tailwinds.”

Elsewhere in Asia, Hang Seng and Nikkei gained up to 0.90 per cent, while Shanghai Composite, Kospi Composite and Taiwan Weighted dipped up to 0.32 per cent.

ACC led the surge in the sector with a 13% gain to Rs 1,473.25 — its biggest one day rise since March 2001. India Cements, Sagar Cements. UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement jumped 3-9%.

“These stocks were beaten down on fall in volume and pricing pressure. In the June quarter some of the cement companies have surprised on volume and margins front. I believe the sector will outperform this year and ACC could touch ₹1,850,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets and Corporate Affairs at IIFL.

ET Bureau
Edelweiss expects the ongoing financial year to be a landmark year for the cement Industry on the back of robust volume with incremental demand emanating from the confluence of revival in affordable housing projects, rural demand and increased infrastructure spending by the government.

A good start to the earnings season in June’2018 quarter further substantiates this thesis, said Edelweiss. “Despite multiple micro challenges like spike in pet coke, diesel prices, shortage of linkage coal, coupled with subdued average realization, the industry has delivered reasonably decent operating performance,” it said.

Even after the surge in Tuesday’s session, cement stocks are down for the year. ACC itself is down 15% so far in 2018. Mangalam Cement, India Cements, Sagar Cements, UltraTech Cement and Andhra Cement are down 3-38%.

Prateek Kumar, analyst at Antique Stock Broking said the surge in cement stocks was primarily a rub off effect of ACC earnings.

“ACC has given strong performance in the quarterly results which had a rub off effect on the other companies in the sector. However sustenance would depend on how the results for other companies are in the space,” said Kumar."

India, too, has been at the receiving end. The country has seen outflow of portfolio money worth Rs 6,430 crore in the first six months of the year.

Despite this, the equity indices have hit new highs, as money continued to chase the largecaps. Thus, a look at what the biggest FPIs are doing is noteworthy.

Ace Equity data suggests EuroPacific Growth Fund cut its holding from 2.37 per cent to 2.20 per cent in Eicher Motors and from 2.41 per cent to 1.61 per cent in Grasim Industries, sequentially, in June quarter.

During the quarter, the fund maintained its holding at 3.38 per cent in Reliance Industries, 1.25 per cent in ACC, 2.65 per cent in Ambuja Cements, 2.66 per cent in Axis Bank, 1.89 per cent in HDFC, 4.94 per cent in Kotak Mahindra Bank, 1.34 per cent in Mahindra & Mahindra and 1.59 per cent Motherson Sumi.

63,2018-07-28,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Lenders have decided to call fresh bids for bankrupt Bhushan Power & Steel after one of the bidders JSW Steel revised its offer up by 60% this week to Rs 18,000 crore, two senior officials who did not want to be named said.

JSW’s offer is higher than that of Tata Steel which had emerged as a preferred bidder over second-placed rival Liberty House. The Tata group made an offer worth Rs 17,000 crore while JSW Steel offered Rs 11,000 crore on February 12, the last day for submission of bids. Liberty House which made its bid 12 days after the deadline offered Rs 18,500 crore.

“The resolution professional (RP) has received revised offer from JSW Steel. There was heated discussion on this at a three hour meeting among lenders today. Finally it decided to invite revised financial bid from all applicants by Tuesday,” one of the officials quoted above said. “Lenders decided to go for a second round of bidding on the grounds that they have not yet voted for the higher bidder, so there is a scope to call for fresh bids,” he added. JSW Steel told ET that it did not want to comment on the matter.

Last month, committee of creditors disqualified Liberty House after it failed to provide critical information on funding arrangement despite repeated reminders. The Tata group thus emerged as preferred bidder while JSW’s bid was not considered since it was too low. The new, revised JSW offer comes when Tata Steel had moved the courts questioning Liberty’s late offer. The bankruptcy court ruled in Liberty’s favour saying that that lenders should consider the bid despite the late submission.

A recent spat between the consortium led by Dalmia Bharat and UltraTech Cement for Binani Cements shows that lenders have considered revised offers after the deadline in the past. After losing out to Dalmia Bharat, UltraTech Cement improved its offer substantially and moved the bankruptcy court when lenders declined to accept it. The court decided in UltraTech’s favour and its bid was later approved by all lenders when rival Dalmia declined to up its price.

Bhushan Power & Steel is among the 12 large defaulters that RBI had directed banks to refer to the bankruptcy court. It faces claims of Rs 49,264 crore from financial creditors."

Century Textiles and Industries (CTIL) in May this year announced plans to demerge its cement business into Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement.

The company last year also entered into a deal with Grasim Industries to manage and operate its viscose filament yarn (VFY) business for a period of 15 years. The agreement would provide Grasim the right to use the relevant assets of CTIL, however, the ownership of assets to remain with CTIL.

Grasim would be paying Rs 600 crore royalty and a refundable security deposit of Rs 200 crore, to be done through internal accruals.

""This will help the company in reducing its debt,"" CTIL vice chairman Kumar Managalam Birla told shareholders at the annual general meeting today.

The company's debt is estimated at around Rs 4,100 crore at present.

Currently, CTIL has exposure to the cement, textiles, pulp and paper and real estate businesses.

Its VFY plant is located at Shahad, Thane, having a capacity of 25,000 tonne, which includes 19,000 tonne of VFY and 6,000 tonne in rayon tyre yarn.

""CTIL has also decided to demerge 13.4 million tonne cement capacity to UltraTech Cement which will enable transfer of debt of around Rs 3,000 crore,"" Birla said, adding UltraTech is in a growth phase and the acquisition will give the company ready capacities in growing markets.

Shareholders of CTIL will receive one share of UltraTech for every eight shares held.

""This transaction will help the firm in deleveraging balance sheet and creating an opportunity for its growth in the remaining businesses especially in unlocking the value in the real estate portfolio,"" he said.

Currently the company has around 30 acre in Worli area in the city, besides around 100 acres in Kalyan.

It also has land parcel in Pune, which will be developed at a later stage, the company said.

2,2018-08-04,UltraTech,"There is a generational transformation underway at many of India’s marquee industrial houses. Founded in the late 1960s and 1970s, they grew with India, and are now readying the ground for the next generation of the family to take the reins.

At the $13 billion core sector conglomerate JSW Group, led by Sajjan Jindal, this script is now playing out. In the hot seat is 28-year-old Parth Jindal, an alumnus of Brown University and Harvard Business School.

Sajjan Jindal is the son of Jindal group patriarch OP Jindal.

The burden of expectations is inevitable. His father Sajjan Jindal took the reins of a small steel plant on the outskirts of Mumbai in 1984, with revenues of Rs 9 crore, and grew it in three decades into an operation that overtook the century-old Indian steel business of Tata Steel, in volumes.




But steel is not where the younger Jindal is expected to play. He is expected to build his own turf, in areas with little presence of the group — cement, paint and sports.

When we arrive at the group headquarters in Mumbai, Parth Jindal has just returned by chopper from the company’s steel plant in Dolvi in Raigad district. He meets us looking fresh from a quick shower in office, wearing an air of nonchalance.


Sports Track
Jindal says he is determined to build India’s first publicly traded sports company. He wants a listing on the bourses by 2025. JSW Sports includes team franchises in cricket, football and kabaddi. The expectation is that in another seven years, the perception about the worth of a sports franchise among investors will change for the better.


For instance, the Dallas Cowboys, an NFL franchise in the United States, is valued at over $4 billion. European soccer franchises such as Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona, are also multi-billion dollar businesses. “My dream is to create India’s first IPO for a sports company. India currently is behind the curve. But sports as a business is fast gaining traction,” he says.

In March, JSW Sports acquired a 50% equity stake in the Delhi Daredevils franchise of the Indian Premier League. Jindal is bullish about its prospects. Firstly, it is very hard to break into the IPL owners’ league because new teams are unlikely and existing owners are wealthy individuals who have no reason to sell.

So when the opportunity to buy a stake in the Delhi franchise came along, it wasn’t a difficult decision to make.

With the new television broadcast deal and the earnings that accrued to each IPL team, Jindal says all the eight IPL teams are now profitable. His Delhi Daredevils finished eighth in the IPL this year out of eight teams, but will still be profitable, he claimed. Each team is poised to make an excess of Rs 150 crore in profits, he says.

Other sports such as kabaddi and football need more time to grow. The company owns the Pro Kabbadi League franchise Haryana Steelers and the ILeague football club Bengaluru FC.

The break-even point in kabbadi, Jindal says, would come in the next three years. Football is a longer-term play and could take anywhere from five to seven years to break even, he says.

“The money in sports is only going to grow. You can see where the new deals are happening. Cable TV is only going to survive for two things — live news and live sports. Everything else is moving to platforms like Netflix, Jio TV and Amazon Prime. There’s going to be nobody watching cable TV for any other reason,” he reasons. 

While sports is a glamorous business to be in, he’s also been tasked with building two dust-and-grime businesses from scratch — cement and decorative paints. The target date for a roll-out of its paints business is set for the year-end.

JSW Group has built a fortune serving or selling to other businesses in steel, energy and ports. Cement and paints, however, are consumer-facing businesses, with an altogether different set of challenges.

From a standing start in 2009, JSW Cement has ramped up to become a 12.5 million tonne business. And in two years, it will see a further expansion to 20 MT. The company makes three varieties of cement from slag, a byproduct of the steel-making process.

Jindal says in two years the cement business will achieve sufficient scale (20 MT) for an IPO. He wants it to have a capacity of 50 million tonnes eventually. A lot of the growth would have to come from acquisitions. The group has been eyeing assets to buy.

“We looked at several acquisition opportunities. At one point we were considering Lafarge Cement very seriously,” Jindal said.



On Your Own Dime
Being part of a $13 billion conglomerate must make financing a new business easy, right? Wrong.

While the group under Sajjan Jindal has decided on diversification into allied sectors, the group’s stated policy is that diversification into newer businesses will pay for itself to further grow the business. Thus the steel business, which brings in some 90% of the group’s revenues, will not divert funds from its revenue streams to fund other businesses.

“We don’t discuss allocation of capital at the group level, we allow each business to organically or inorganically grow on their own strength,” Jindal says.

But when Lafarge was on the selling block, the proposition to scale up the cement business fast was a rare opportunity and the group was prepared to make an exception. But it proved unnecessary, as the deal didn’t happen.

One cement sector analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said recent steps have indicated the group is serious about the cement business. “Two things that the company has done — buying Shiva Cement for its limestone and setting up a clinker facility in Fujairah in UAE — bode well for the company’s IPO plans. Had it not been for these two steps, I would have written them off,” he added.


War Paint
JSW’s diversification into paint has raised eyebrows. India’s paints market is dominated by four large, entrenched players. “For a company like JSW Paints to penetrate the paints market, it will have to overcome the entry barrier put up at the distribution level,” says an analyst tracking the paints industry. He said that at the distribution level, shop shelves don’t have room for a new brand to come in. “In the past, companies like the Japanese brand Nippon Paints and American brand Sherwin-Williams tried to enter the market but without any success,” says the analyst.

Jindal is unfazed.

“There is so much opportunity in this country that it amazes me. I had the same thoughts that you harbour — how will I take on an Asian Paints or Berger for instance,” Jindal says.

He mentions his father’s predicament when he started out building an integrated steel plant. “I’m sure my father thought too when he started on his entrepreneurial journey whether he can take on Tata Steel… When a market is growing so fast, there’s always space for a new entrant to come in. That’s my fundamental belief.”





His reasoning is simple. The paint industry is growing at an attractive pace. As incumbents get bigger and bigger, there are opportunities for a new player to enter, he reasons. Because he believes, the bigger players may find it difficult to react to market challenges because they’re too big now.

There’s also a trump card. Unlike, Asian Paints or a Berger Paints, he says JSW Group can offer its dealer a steel franchise, and another branch of the same dealer a cement franchise or a paints dealership.

Mahesh Singhi, founder and managing director at Singhi Advisors, a transaction advisory firm, sees merit in the JSW gameplan to be a “complete building solutions provider”.

“The market for paints is expanding. There is room for new players to grow,” Singhi said. The idea is that a customer buying steel rods to build a house is also a potential buyer for cement and paints.

Jindal’s unique selling proposition is going to be water-based paints, which are environmentally friendlier than solvent-based paint products.

“Also the (dealer) channel of established paint companies fear, the guy hundred metres away is also competing against him by offering the same paint product. JSW Paints can offer an alternative,” he reasons.


Family Bond
Those who are watching the grooming of the Jindal scion say Parth Jindal’s confidence to take on big players such as Asian Paints or Birla Group’s Ultratech Cement stems partly from the close guidance he is receiving from his father and the JSW top brass.

With the schedules that come with globe-spanning businesses, how does the family find time to spend together?

Whenever they are at home, they work out together and meet for breakfast after. As a kid, he used to see his father work out. He recalls when he was homesick at school in the UK, his father’s advice was to go outdoors and take part in sports. You’ll make friends, his father said. It worked.

“As a family, we are quite passionate about sports and working out. It’s a good way of being mentally agile and staying sharp,” he says.

These days, he beats his father in a game of squash."

31,2018-08-18,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: When a clutch of foreign investors recently voted against the reappointment of Deepak Parekh, one of the senior-most persons in the corporate and financial world, for “over-boarding” — or, presence in boards of more than 6 companies — many, probably including Parekh and his team, were stunned, even outraged. First, corporate India has no law against “over-boarding”; second, does it really make a difference?

But there aren’t many who are on the same boat with Parekh. Among the non-executive chairmen in the list of BSE100 companies — the universe of Indian listed entities that primarily interest the foreign portfolio investors — only Kumar Mangalam Birla and Harsh Mariwala have presence in boards of more than 5 companies.

Do they have to grapple with a similar predicament as Parekh?

Harsh Mariwala (similar to Parekh) is non-executive chairman of Marico and Kaya (both group companies), and is on the boards of L&T Finance Holdings, Zensar Technologies, Aster DM Healthcare, JSW Steel and Thermax. In contrast, Birla is director only on the boards of his group companies.

While Birla declined to respond to queries from ET, Mariwala spelt out his views that possibly echoes the belief among corporates.

“I endorse the view that multiple directorships beyond a reasonable limit may pose challenges to a director in allocating sufficient time to the companies, thus hindering his ability to play an effective role. In light of which the Kotak Committee on corporate governance recommended a limit of seven listed companies for a director to hold positions in and the same has been enforced by Sebi through its recent amendments to the listing regulations. While global views on this differ as they treat a director having more than 5 public directorships as overboarded versus 7 public directorships which is the limit in India, investors need to give due regard to some of the factors like the capability of the individual serving the board, his contribution to the company, the needs of the board on which he serves and the depth and quality of executive leadership, when they (the investors) are insinuated with such views from the proxy firms,” said Mariwala, founder and chairman of Marico.



According to him, the law in India has already put many checks and balances in place to ensure that each director fulfils his fiduciary responsibility.

Birla and Mariwala each serve on boards of nine and seven publicly-listed companies, respectively. FPI holding in companies such as Idea Cellular, Grasim Industries, Ultratech Cement, Hindalco and Marico is more than 20%.

ISS, the global proxy advisory firm, had voted against Parekh’s re-appointment on ‘over-boarding’ concern since he served on boards of more than six listed firms. Explaining the reason for voting against the re-appointment of Parekh, ISS has mentioned in its voting recommendation report: ‘investors may be concerned whether directors are able to fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities when they are serving on a large number of boards, as in this case. While the demands of each board will vary, and the capacity of each person will vary, holding the equivalent of more than six directorships with publicly-listed companies may make it challenging for a director to devote adequate time to the affairs of each company’. None of the chairmen of companies from the S&P 100 and FTSE 100 indices serve on more than four and six listed companies, respectively.

These checks, said Mariwala, take various forms — public disclosure of attendance of directors, limit on his membership in board committees, board evaluation, recommendation of re-appointment based on the outcome of evaluation, succession planning, provisions on disqualification of directors, etc.

“Merely, a number on directorships may not necessarily hinder the capability of a director in fulfilling his duties but one has to evaluate the ends and means of a board before deciding if a person can be boarded or not to be boarded, else, it may go on to deprive a company from retaining a good leadership/independent directorship,” he said.

However, he agrees that corporates should take a cue from this to strengthen their disclosures as regards to matters like appointment or re-appointment of directors for investors as well as proxy advisory firms to take pragmatic views on such matters.

While the global norms consider more than six companies to be over-boarding, the Sebi regulations notified in May this year have a slightly higher threshold for individuals having board memberships in listed firms.

The newly notified Sebi (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 limits the number of directorship of a person to eight listed entities with effect from April 1, 2019 and not more than seven listed entities with effect from April 1, 2020."

33,2018-08-21,UltraTech,"The setup is pretty strong for equities globally and specifically for emerging markets, Sandip Sabharwal, asksandipsabharwal.com, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 
  
  
  


What really is going to dictate the market mood from here now that earnings are done with?
Directionally, the market should do just fine. The setup is pretty strong for equities globally and specifically for emerging markets. The Indian markets held on but most of the other emerging markets have corrected a lot in terms of sentiment indicators and redemptions from emerging market funds. They have reached a peak last seen in 2003 when there was taper tantrums kind of outflows. 

On those parameters also, the emerging market basket as a whole has got oversold. The way I see things now, we will see a flow back into emerging markets. India will also get the flows which will help sustain the markets. But the broader markets now will do much better than the headline indices.

The headline indices over the next few weeks might move up in low single digits, but we could see specific stocks move up significantly. There could be 20% to 40% returns in a vast majority of midcap companies which are doing well, but have got beaten down in the entire meltdown in mid and small cap segment.


The buzz on the Street on Kajaria Ceramics, seems to be that the management has guided in closed quarters for a very sharp recovery in the second and the third quarter. What according to you could be leading to this? Since it is an election year, there will perhaps be some more focus on affordable housing and perhaps some freebies as well.
12% to 15% growth is the plausible option for this company. They would have grown at that rate in any case just because the GST rate got reduced from 28% to 18% and then some issues related to the e-way bills made the unorganised sector continue to do better.

All those things have got settled now. Kajaria from a peak of around Rs 750-760 fell to just Rs 400 levels. It is a great company and it is available cheap today. Over the next couple of years, it will go back if not earlier to what the highs it saw in early 2018 or late 2017. It was around Rs 750 at that time. So, 50-60% return over a two-year timeframe is an excellent return. Value buying should have got set in now and we have also been accumulating this stock.


How are you looking at the cement pack because it keeps coming on the radar and then going off. Are you still buying into cement?
In cement we have had a holding in UltraTech Cement for some time and recently we have added India Cement as a value pick because I think that stock is cheap relative to replacement value. The stock fell from Rs 190 right down to Rs 103-104 level and results were not great.

That gave another opportunity to buy because the company itself is giving a strong outlook for the second half and the overall industry outlook is also positive as the next two-three years’ capacity addition in cement will just average 3-4% per year and demand growth should be between 8-10%. 

So, capacity utilisations will go up. There is a very high operating leverage in cement companies and as such, the pricing should also move up. 

Next two, three years will be very good for cement. Some stocks would have already run up significantly. In terms of pure valuations, they might look expensive but then we can always find value picks. 

Something like India Cement because it has got a significant amount of debt, incremental improvement in its profits is much greater when the cycle turns. That is one stock which could do well.


Global giants like Kellogg's and Reckitt are bidding for GSK Consumers’ Horlicks now. What does this mean in terms of how market would shape up? Listed companies in India like Britannia, Nestle, even ITC is largely into that space. How would the landscape for FMCG space turn when these kind of giants would make their strides in our market?
Many of these companies are already present in a big way. Reckitt used to be listed earlier and it has got a wide array of products which is there. Everyone knows Kellogg’s for the cornflakes but it is somewhat related to breakfast. Horlicks also is a drink which could be had for breakfast. 

It is a good fit for these companies and it is a good fit for many other companies also. The way the aggressive push is there for Horlicks, I do not see it changing the entire paradigm of FMCG by any significant degree. But it just shows that so many companies are interested in getting into the growth which the Indian markets are showing. And I think that is a positive sign."
34,2018-08-21,UltraTech,"Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech today said it has received an approval from the fair trade regulator Competition Commission for the acquisition of the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries. The company said the CCI has given its approval for the share swap deal between the companies, Ultratech said in a regulatory filing. 

 On May 20, UltraTech said it would acquire the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles and Industries through a share swap deal, a move which would further consolidate its position as market leader in the segment. 

 ""...the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has by its letter dated August 21, 2018 informed the company that it has approved the proposed combination under sub-section (1) of section 31 of the Competition Act, 2012,"" Ultratech said. 

 However, the copy of the CCI order is awaited, it added. 

 The board of directors of UltraTech Cement on May 20, 2018 approved a scheme of arrangement amongst Century Textiles and Industries and its respective shareholders and creditors, the Aditya Birla Group firm said in a statement. 

 The transaction would provide UltraTech an opportunity to further strengthen its presence in the east and central markets, extending its footprint in the Western and Southern markets in the country. 

 Century Textiles has three integrated cement units situated in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra with a total capacity of 11.4 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) and a grinding unit in West Bengal of 2.0 mtpa."

  Corporate Affairs, India Infoline, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

One stock that you have been very bullish on is ITC and in the last two months, it has contributed maximum in terms of upside to this market. Do you maintain that bullishness stance or do you feel that ITC has run its course?
ITC is going to be a pedigree stock and right from Rs 260, this has been one of the best performers in the Nifty. The Rs 317-318 may be a temporary hurdle but I have a Rs 350 target for year-end. If I gave you a one-year target, I can stick my neck out and say ITC will be Rs 450. ITC is much more than a brand show, it is all about paper, hotels, FMCG, ITC Haryali, the other businesses are doing extremely well. 

Valuations are extremely attractive right now in the consumption basket. ITC was one of my top picks. The other was UltraTech Cement when nobody wanted to talk about cement. I do not rule out UltraTech touching Rs 5000 coming by March 2019. 

The third stock is Sun Pharma. Again, for most, it is a very pessimistic call. But see how this sector has performed! I can stick my neck out that pharma will be the dark horse of 2019 rather than IT. If you want to play on any weakness on the rupee, look for a basket of pharma stocks.


How much more upside do you expect in the market this year, over and above the 10% we have already seen thus far?
We have run up quite a bit and we have been almost bang on. The markets have climbed all the walls of worry. You will see some correction may be in the next fortnight where you can see it touch 10,800 to 11,000. But we would not rule out 12,000 around the Diwali time.

As I have been saying, from September onward, midcaps will be the flavour of rest of the year. In largecaps, we think the markets are fully priced. There is hardly any room on the upside and that 100 point which can come may be because of slight bit of froth but that is where you have to be wary. Look for midcaps where you are certain and where earnings have been very positive. Those will be outperformers in the next three months.


You are also highlighting an intermittent dip of 600 points before we make a dash for 12,000. What would lead to that and is it just the peak valuations that the index has been running on?
You will see some proverbial profit booking by mutual funds. You will see some sort of climax globally where markets have again feathering the bend towards equities but a 5% correction from here is definitely much warranted and it is going to take the froth off the market. 

I would be comfortable with 11,000 or 10,800 in next two weeks. There can be a lot of reasons for that -- profit booking, global cues etc. I am not getting alarmed. All I am saying is that at these levels, if you have been advocating what we have been saying, then it is time to take money home also.


 Sometime back, my colleague broke the story about M&M and Ford forming a JV to capture the market share. Ford has a market share of less than 3% or around 3%, M&M has a market share of less than 8%. Do you think two weak players would combine and form a formidable force?
That is the story of India’s consumption and it is the end consumer who is laughing all the way. We have seen that in two-wheelers and now we are going to see that in the SUV market. Their amalgamation will be a very strong point because survival is the key. Both have a good model but again there is too much competition and in the end, people are realising that they have to consolidate and foes may have to become friends. 

It will be a saner mover because both of them will cut their extraneous expenses and it will have good repercussions rather than just battling it out on an individual basis. SUVs have been weaklings for Mahindra. For Mahindras, it has all been about tractors. It is not about the SUV market which is fully saturated and margins are going to be under pressure.


You mentioned about power and pharma being the dark horse sectors for 2019. You also gave a host of midcap names to our question that which stocks would do well. You mentioned about the market correcting a bit. Which stocks or which sector according to you would show that correction?
It is evident both the HDFC twins, the largecap retail banks these are looking extremely stretched. Some of the metals are also looking stretched and that is a corollary to a stronger dollar.

So, it is the overall basket, it is not stock specific. I am talking of the index as a whole. If it corrects to 11,000, it will take some froth off the market and that will be healthy for the market. 

It is said you cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. You had to be bullish when there is a lot of uncertainty. These days, people are turning a little cautious. 

I am not bearish on Indian market. All I am saying is that there is a round of profit booking which I can foresee and I would be comfortable if we got back to 11,000 and consolidate it rather than just keep going without any pause."

Profit-booking at record levels amid prevailing weakness in the rupee against the US dollar kept the risk appetite of investors subdued. 

The talk between the US and China, that gave hope to investors all over the world, concluded without any major breakthrough. Both major economies slapped fresh tariffs on one another on Thursday, intensifying the trade tussle. 

The equity barometer Sensex fell by 84.96 points, or 0.22 per cent, ending the day at 38,251.80. The NSE counterpart Nifty50 finished day's trade at 11,557.10, with a loss of 25.65 points or 0.22 per cent.

We walk you through the key highlights of the day’s session: 

Bank, auto among top drag on SensexICICI Bank, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki were the top drags on the Sensex. However, metal and mining counters, such as Vedanta, Tata Steel and Coal India helped Sensex pare losses. Vedanta, ONGC, Axis Bank, Wipro and Mahindra & Mahindra emerged as the top five gainers. YES Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports and IndusInd Bank stood as biggest Sensex losers.

Colgate-Palmolive falls on group arm's India entry Shares of Colgate-Palmolive (India) came under pressure on Friday as global asset management firm CLSA said the entry of Colgate-Palmolive Asia Pacific into the Indian market will not augur well for the Indian subsidiary. CLSA expressed concerns that Colgate-Palmolive Asia Pacific’s foray into the Indian market by acquiring a stake in Bombay Shaving Company will hit prospects of the shareholders in future. 


Global stocks cautious ahead of Powell's speechMost major markets reflected cautious sentiment today ahead of the speech by the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later today at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that may hint on the direction of monetary policy. The dollar index slipped slightly and stocks remained subdued.

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “On the earnings front Q1FY19 numbers have been above expectations and we remain confident that rural demand will pick up in the coming quarters. With government focusing on cleaning up the banking sector there may some short-term pressure on banking names, but the worst is behind.”

Jani prefers stocks in the private banking space and feel that they will outperform their PSU peers. Stocks such as HDFC Bank and RBL Bank remain among preferred picks. He also believes that market will continue to be volatile in the short term on the back of global fund inflows and general elections in 2019. “Any correction should be used by investors to add quality companies,” Jani said.

Capital Goods, Teck, Consumer durables, Metal, Auto and Realty index also rallied up to 8 per cent during the past 40 trading sessions.

40,2018-08-29,UltraTech,"Smart money chases smart stocks.

Take this: Those who had shown faith on country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki in the early days must be sitting on healthy profit today. The stock, which got listed on the bourses in July 2003, has rallied over 5,400 per cent in last 15 years. One major milestone for the stock was its entry into the elite Nifty50 club in 2004.

There are 12 other stocks which all got listed after Maruti and have seen similar fortunes after entering Club Nifty. They include TCS (listed in August 2004), UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), YES Bank (July 2005), Tech Mahindra (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infratel (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013). 

Data suggested that one of every four debutants of last 15 years, which made it to Club Nifty, gave handsome returns to investors.

Barring Coal India (down 17 per cent), all other stocks from Club Nifty have delivered positive return to investors since their listing. YES Bank has rallied nearly 3,200 per cent since listing, UltraTech Cement 1,551 per cent and TCS 1,528 per cent.

The Nifty topped the 11,700-mark for the first time ever this week coming from sub-1,500 level 15 years ago, logging a 750 per cent rise.

Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, Power Grid, NTPC, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Bharti Infratel have climbed 396 per cent, 96.30 per cent, 86 per cent, 110 per cent, 357 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto have soared 1,300 per cent and 805 per cent, respectively, since their listing in 2008.

JSW Steel, which on Tuesday qualified to enter the Club Elite, advanced over 3 per cent in early trade on Wednesday. NSE Indices said it will replace Lupin in the Nifty 50 index from September 28, 2018. 

“Change is the only constant and index structure is no exception. Over the years, the representation in Nifty50 has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy: new sectors have evolved, while some have lost relative importance in the New India,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market experts are looking bullish on most of the above-mentioned stocks. Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) with a target price of Rs 10,805. The automaker expects double-digit growth in FY19, driven by continued strength in rural markets. The company remains fully committed to launching fully electric vehicles in India in 2020, supported by access to technology from Toyota. In the interim, it will launch a strong hybrid vehicle. Shares of Maruti Suzuki traded at Rs 9,413 on Wednesday.

Country’s biggest IT major Tata Consultancy Services is among the preferred picks of brokerage Sharekhan. TCS recently reported higher-than-expected margin performance in Q1FY19, while Infosys and HCL Tech delivered on expected lines, according to Sharekhan.

BofAML recently upgraded Tech Mahindra to ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ and raised the target price to Rs 800 from Rs 600 earlier. “We expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 per cent over FY18-21. Such growth to provide more qualitative stock rally,” the brokerage said.

Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 475. “The strong cargo growth story remains intact, driven by inclusion of new ports (Ennore in FY19, Vizhinjam in FY20) and growth in logistics business. We also expect strong cash flows in FY19 and beyond, with capex peaking out and operations stabilising across assets. We view the current price as an excellent opportunity to own a superior cash-generating asset portfolio,” it said.

Motilal Oswal also has ‘buy’ ratings on Bajaj Auto, Coal India, NTPC and Power Grid."

Here are five factors that pulled domestic equity market lower on Monday:

Falling rupeeA persistent fall in the rupee dampened market sentiment. The local currency weakened further to hit a fresh low of 72.61 against the US currency, dropping nearly 90 paise in the afternoon trade on Monday.


Weakening macrosIndia's current account deficit (CAD) widened to $15.8 billion in April-June in value terms this year as against $15 billion in the same quarter of 2017-18, mainly due to a higher trade deficit, according to RBI data released on Friday.

Sentiment also got affected with a report saying that the total liabilities of the government increased to Rs 79.8 lakh crore at end-June 2018 from Rs 77.98 lakh crore at end-March 2018. Public debt accounted for 89.3 per cent of total outstanding liabilities at end-June 2018 with internal debt accounting for 83 per cent share. Nearly 24.9 per cent of the outstanding dated securities had a residual maturity of less than five years.

Boiling crudeHigh oil prices were a spoiler for both the rupee and bonds. India imports more than two-third of its crude requirement and any rise in global prices impacts not only pushes up dollar demand by importers, but also raises inflation concerns back home.

Crude oil prices climbed further, as the US drilling for new production stalled and the market eyed tighter conditions once Washington's sanctions against Iran's crude exports kick in from November.

Brent crude was hovering above $77 per barrel in the international markets on Monday.


Spike in bond yieldsThe benchmark 10-year bond yield is hovering around 8.11 per cent, highest since November 2014. When macroeconomic indicators turn weak, bond yields push higher, resulting in a drop in prices. Investors then tend to seek more returns on bonds to compensate for the risks involved.


Bearish global cuesAsian peers were mostly trading lower after the US President Donald Trump declared he was considering tariffs on an additional $267 billion Chinese goods, ratcheting up tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The development overshadowed a strong US jobs report that kept the US Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates. Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite were down over 1 per cent in the late trade."

25,2018-09-14,UltraTech,"Leaders from local and state governments, business, and civil society have come together in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit organised by California Governor Jerry Brown to send a “clear signal” to national governments to step their efforts to tackle climate change.

“We are trying to recreate the kind of impulse, the kind of energy the kind of enthusiasm that gave governments the confidence to take the Paris Agreement over the line but this time in the context of what we have to do by 2020,” said Nick Nuttall, director communications, Global Climate Action Summit.

The genesis of this summit can be traced to the 2015 Paris climate talks. In the months preceding the UN-sponsored climate talks in Paris, there had been significant mobilisation by businesses, cities, and regional and provincial governments that signalled clear support to the national governments to move ahead and finalise the 2015 climate treaty. Conceived as an effort to preserve and promote that momentum, the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States and his subsequent decision, fulfilling a campaign promise, to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, gave the summit yet another purpose. “The summit, with its focus on sub-national and non-state climate actors, is critical to maintain the momentum when the US federal government is shirking its responsibility and commitment to the world,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the New Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment, and Water. 

Nuttall, however, argues that this more than just about US businesses and local and state governments stepping in and reiterating their commitment to achieving the Paris Agreement goals and climate plans and targets pledged by the Obama administration under the climate deal. Nuttall, who served as the spokesperson of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change said that he doesn’t think that anyone ever thought that the achieving the Paris Agreement would be “some kind of calm sailing”.

“If the overall movement of the world is up and determined to address the Paris Agreement, then those governments that are less enthusiastic are likely to find themselves on the wrong side of history, and likely to find themselves on the wrong side of what the planet and the people living on it actually need-- which is a low carbon/de-carbonised world with all kinds of new job opportunities and all kind of new sectors.”

The summit is an opportunity to showcase climate action but also a moment to spur more action or as the GCAS theme puts it to Take Ambition to the Next Level. 

“The summit aims to reinstall momentum in climate action as well as bring together leaders from government as well as private institutions and companies to take up more climate commitments,” said Ajay Mathur, director-general of the New Delhi based think tank and research outfit, TERI.

“This is the first wave of stepping up, moving up, taking ambition to a higher level coming from the business, the economy, and sub national governments trying to send a clear signal to national governments to move up with their ambition sooner rather than later because 2020 is the year that scientific risk assessments say we should be peaking global greenhouse gas emissions,” say Nuttall.

Just ahead of the GCAS, Indian companies including UltraTech Cement, Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, Mahindra Heavy Engines Ltd, and Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies announced climate actions they would undertake. Anand Mahindra, executive chairman of the Mahindra Group, who serves as co-chair of the summit was instrumental in getting corporations across the world to adopt science based targets with this challenge at Davos.

Ghosh said that India must use this opportunity provided by the California summit to “demonstrate its climate actions, by virtue of its power of resistance to inequities in climate politics, its power of example set through domestic policies and actions, and its power of leadership at the international level, such as the International Solar Alliance.""

The three-day global summit will culminate with a Call to Global Climate Action to all sectors of the economy but with a focus on national governments. Nuttall said that the call to action will be taken by Patricia Espinosa to the UN General Assembly and brought into that One Planet Summit that French President Emmanuel Macron is doing during Climate Week by travellers in an electric car that will leave San Francisco on the 14th of September and pass through states like Nevada, Kansas and New Jersey meeting the public, auto workers and those acting on climate change.

But that is not the end of the road for the Global Climate Action Summit, the idea is to keep up the momentum. “The idea is to ensure that all challenges issued before the GCAS to investors, businesses and cities don't just end in 2018 but build over the next two years and beyond.” He said the idea is to ensure “a bigger wave from these sectors as we approach the UNSG’s Leaders’ Summit so that governments will feel a strong wind of support to raise their national climate action plans."

Rahul Sharma, Senior Technical Research Analyst, Equity99 said, ""For this week, Nifty has strong support levels at 11,430-11,380 levels and resistance at 11,605-11,640 level.""

As many as 43 stocks in the Nifty index were trading in the red with Indiabulls Housing Finance falling over 2 per cent, followed by UltraTech Cement (down 2.07 per cent), Titan (down 1.89 per cent), Tata Motors (down 1.63 per cent) and Bajaj Finance (down 1.53 per cent).

On the other hand, Wipro, HCL Tech, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Infosys gained up to 1.50 per cent.

Sugar stocks extended their gains on the government’s announcement of hike in ethanol price for blending in petrol by 25 per cent. Rana Sugars, Magadh Sugar and Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar rallied up to 20 per cent in early trade.

Meanwhile, the rupee plunged over 75 paise to 72.61 against dollar despite the government on Friday announced an array of steps, including removal of withholding tax on Masala bonds, relaxation for FPIs, and curbs on non-essential imports, to contain the widening CAD and check the currency fall."
27,2018-09-17,UltraTech,"Keep your eyes and ears open. Chances are, you might just spot some big winners on Dalal Street. And take this, they may be even from the lot that has trailed benchmark indices so far! 

Look at Morgan Stanley, which recently added three underperformers from different sectors to its portfolio. The global brokerage has suddenly taken a fancy to India's biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI), which just about doubled investor money in the past 10 years even as the benchmark Sensex rallied over 180 per cent during the same period. 

Leading super-specialty hospital Apollo Hospitals and real estate developer Prestige Estates are the two other favourites of Morgan Stanley after the latest correction.

For the short-list, the third-largest wealth management firm in the world in terms of total client assets focussed on stocks that have underperformed the market over the past 12 months whose business fundamentals have been weak with slow earnings growth and RoEs below the standard deviation from the average. Prospects of these companies are now looking robust in terms of RoE and earnings growth, Morgan Stanley said. 

“We choose stocks rated ‘overweight’ by Morgan Stanley and where our analysts expect a positive change in RoE (return on equity), along with EPS growth in excess of 10 per cent over the next two years,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

SBI stock has rallied 6 per cent in the last 12 months till September 14 whereas the benchmark BSE Sensex has advanced 18 per cent.

Morgan Stanley believes that the government’s recapitalisation move enabled the state-owned banks (SOE) to recognise problematic corporate loans as non-performing loans (NPLs) and increase provisioning.

“We expect an improvement in overall provisioning and NPL slippages to drop sharply during the second half of FY19 (H2FY19). However, loan loss charges are likely to remain high as banks take coverage towards 60 per cent with Ind-AS rolling in from April 1, 2019 (our base case). Core pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) growth should start picking up from H2FY19 as NPL formation slows and higher rates help margins expand. Given its strong liability franchise and technology, SBI is better positioned relative to other SOE banks to sustain growth and ROE,” Morgan Stanley added.

Japanese brokerage Nomura in August gave a ‘buy’ rating to SBI with a target price of Rs 360. “Valuations at 0.9 times are not undemanding. We maintain a buy rating as the corporate cycle and core PPOP improve,” said Nomura. 

The state-owned lender suffered a major loss of Rs 4,876 crore for the first quarter to June, caused by higher provisioning on account of accumulated non-performing assets (NPAs), or bad loans. In a stock exchange filing, SBI said it earned Rs 2,005.5 crore net profit for the same period of last financial year.

Shares of Prestige Estates and Apollo Hospital have climbed 9 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, during the period.

Prestige Estates has a balanced portfolio of developmental and rental projects, both of which have good scale-up potential. Presence in healthy South Indian cities (Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad), will be complemented by diversification to NCR and MMR markets. “Valuations appear reasonable at 51 per cent discount to our March 2019 NAV,” Morgan Stanley added.

The company is also looking to acquire malls across major cities to expand its rental income base. 

In the case of Apollo Hospitals, Morgan Staley believes that valuations seem inexpensive at 15x F20 EV/Ebitda. Operational improvement in the ensuing quarters would be driven by all the three revenue segments, including hospitals, steady growth in standalone pharmacies and narrowing of AHLL retail losses, for the target to break even in the first half of 2020.

Apollo Hospitals is also one of the top picks of IDFC Securities. In a report in August, the brokerage firm maintained ‘Outperformer’ rating on Apollo with a target price of Rs 1,483. 

The domestic brokerage firm further said a leadership position, national footprint and multi-pronged healthcare delivery model make Apollo one of the stronger EM healthcare models. 

“Post a prolonged weak earnings phase emanating from an aggressive expansion plan, earnings recovery is visible from H2 FY18 onwards, driven by improvement in mature hospital profitability. The new hospital cluster has begun to contribute positively, led by improvement in Navi Mumbai unit. While the ASAP business will sustain growth momentum, reduction in operating losses at the retail health platform too should aid growth in consolidated profitability,” IDFC Securities said in a report.

Morgan Stanley has upped its target price for the Sensex to 42,000 for September 2019 from 36,000 in June.

Asian Paints, ICICI Bank, ITC, M&M Financial and UltraTech Cement are other underperformers that made their way to the Morgan Stanley list.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has ‘Buy’ rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 355 while it has ‘Neutral’ call on Asian Paints with a target of Rs 1,405.

Brokerage firm JM Financial is positive on M&M Financial with a target price of Rs 650. “We expect earnings CAGR of 53 per cent over FY18-20E with RoA and RoE expanding to 2.9 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, by FY20E."

Kumar Mangalam Birla, the billionaire chairman of the acquisitive Indian conglomerate that bears his name, said he’s hungry for more deals after creating the nation’s biggest mobile-phone operator.

His Aditya Birla Group continues to look for targets in the US, Europe and India that make business sense and are likely to add value, the 51-year-old said at Bloomberg’s India Economic Forum on Sept. 18 in Mumbai. He didn’t specify any names.

Birla, who runs a $44 billion conglomerate that sells everything from insulators to insurance, helps illustrate India’s emergence as a mergers-and-acquisitions powerhouse, with transactions involving local companies setting records by exceeding $100 billion this year -- a trend that PwC India predicts will continue in 2019. One main driver: banks are tackling bad loans by putting companies owned by defaulters on the block.

That’s because the nation’s central bank is pushing local lenders to restructure an estimated $49.3 billion of soured loans in the wake of a new bankruptcy law implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration.

“This government is starting to address it and taking the bull by the horns,” Birla said. “Bad loans have been around for a long time and just got brushed under the carpet.”

Though he didn’t name targets, Birla’s track record indicates he won’t just be spectating the expected flood of assets that will be put up for sale.

His companies have carried out scores of deals, with recent one being Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd.’s merger with the local unit of Vodafone Group Plc to create India’s biggest carrier. In July, his Hindalco Industries Ltd. announced the purchase of Aleris Corp. for about $2.6 billion to tap global automotive metal demand. UltraTech Cement Ltd. is also seeking to buy distressed Binani Cement, though that pursuit is in a legal wrangle.

Part of Birla’s appetite for deals is because of his optimism about India’s economy, which he likened to an elephant that’s starting to run. Gross domestic product grew 8.2 percent in the June quarter from a year earlier, the government said last month.

“You can’t ignore India,” Birla said. “There’s no legitimate reason for not investing in India.”"
29,2018-09-21,UltraTech,"By Anjani Trivedi
One of India’s most acquisitive companies is buying up cement kilns across the country, going from big to bigger. It’s got the right plan, but who’s buying the cement and actually building? 

Ultratech Cement Ltd. is one of the world’s biggest cement manufacturers, with the capacity to put out 90 million tons a year from plants sprinkled across India. It purchased distressed assets from Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. and is battling to buy even more out of bankruptcy. 

Ultratech is taking a smart tack in India’s fragmented cement industry: consolidation. After its acquisitions, the company, majority-held by the conglomerate Aditya Birla Group, will hold around 40 percent of the western and central Indian markets.


Bloomberg
Cement is big business for the Birla Group, whose industry spans textiles to telecom. It makes up more than 60 percent of the Group’s consolidated Ebitda, having pulled in $1 billion in the last fiscal year. The dividends from Ultratech are the company’s biggest and help fund its broader ambitions.

Meanwhile, Ultratech’s Ebitda margins are above global cement and aggregate peers at around 18 percent; its shipments rose 21 percent in the last fiscal year ended March.

With volume, comes pricing power. While that hasn’t fully materialized yet — India’s cement prices rose just 1 percent last quarter — consolidation will eventually give Ultratech more leeway. The company needs to raise prices with the costs of inputs like petroleum coke ticking up and a depreciating rupee.


Bloomberg
Yet the company’s cement-capacity utilization is already running at 70 percent. If it expands into a glut, Ultratech may eventually find balancing supply with actual demand a more effective way to influence prices, as its Chinese peers have demonstrated with widespread plant closures. With limited new supply, prices there have risen more than 20 percent so far this year; and the share price of Chinese cement makers like Anhui Conch Cement Co. and West China Cement Ltd. are up over 15 percent this year, despite a dismal stock market. 

But here’s the wrinkle: Where will all the cement go? Production is growing just south of 10 percent on year. Big bets on the government’s infrastructure-spending promises (so far, just that) and welfare pledges, like rural housing, are throwing companies into overdrive. Total capital expenditure by the government and companies remains muted, on par with levels in 2004. Public capital-expenditure growth on highways, railways, defense and metro rail projects isn’t ramping up. Companies only expect a 5 percent increase through mid-2019 from a year earlier, according to a survey by UBS. That’s below expectations for overall demand.

Another blow: The Indian Supreme Court, in an interim order earlier this month, banned construction activity in some states in the north, central and western parts of the country until Oct. 9th because governments there haven’t come up with policies to deal with solid waste management. 


Bloomberg
One bright spot for demand is rural housing, particularly ahead of a big election year. Government spending on such projects rose 60 percent in the past year and could increase another 40 percent. That won’t absorb the tons of cement being produced across the country — and raising prices will only get tougher. 

For Ultratech, market dominance is great as long as its books are in order. For now, Ebitda continues to tick up; but with its bottomless appetite for assets, so does its debt and the associated interest costs. Cash flows have come down along with cash in hand.

Ultratech is trading at an enterprise value of 16.2 times its one-year forward Ebitda, more than a 60 percent premium to its peers. If the government doesn’t start spending as fast as India’s largest cement maker, that number might start looking too rich."

The BSE Midcap index declined 1.93 per cent, while the BSE Smallcap index plunged 2.07 per cent.

The Indian market has been seeing a sharp selloff on account of depreciation in rupee and higher crude prices. This negative sentiment was further reinforced by the fear of liquidity crisis to support credit growth following the IL&FS scare, said Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities.

“We believe the long-term story of Indian market remains intact. Therefore, this fall should be treated as an opportunity to accumulate fundamentally strong companies where valuations have corrected to attractive levels,” she said.

The BSE Sensex tanked 2.24 per cent, or 806.47 points, to end the day at 35,169, registering its biggest fall since February 2, 2018. NSE’s Nifty50 dipped 2.39 per cent, or 259 per cent, to 10,599.

Rusmik Oza, Senior VP (Head of Fundamental Research), Kotak Securities said, “Sensex and Nifty slipped sharply on the back of selling witnessed across all Asian markets. Since most Asian markets are importers of crude the impact of rising crude prices and rising dollar Index will weigh on their trade balance. Among Asian markets, India is the highest importer of crude after China hence the impact on India’s trade deficit is very high.”

FPIs have also been selling in emerging markets whose impact was visible in Indian market too. The Nifty broke the 200-day moving average (DMA) placed at 10,777, which intensified selling by market participants.

“If Nifty sustains below the 200 DMA for more than a week, then the floor can shift to 10,000 on the downside,” said Oza."

13,2018-10-05,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine at length a plea by major cement makers on cartelisation charges levelled against them by real estate developers and upheld by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

A bench of Justices Fali S Nariman and Navin Sinha, however, said interim orders would continue, indicating that the companies would have to deposit 10% of their fine amounts. “The interim orders that have been passed by the tribunal in these cases will continue in the meantime,” the bench said.

CCI had held 10 major cement companies guilty of the charge levelled by Builders’ Association of India and fined them more than Rs 6,700 crore at the rate of 0.5% of their net turnover. The cement makers had first approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), but the tribunal dismissed their plea against the CCI finding on July 25.

The cement companies that moved the top court include India Cements, Ramco Cements, Nuvoco Vistas Corporation, Ambuja Cement, ACC, Jaiprakash Associates, Century Textiles and Industries, and UltraTech Cement. 

The case began in 2010 when the builders accused Cement Manufacturers Association of ganging up to manipulate cement prices, leading to project costs soaring, for which CCI, in 2012, slapped a fine of Rs 6,300 crore for contravention of Sub-Section 3(3)(a) and 3(3)(b) of the Competition Act, 2002. Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002, forbids anticompetitive agreements.

Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) — which ceased to exist in May last year following its merger with NCLAT — set aside this decision in December 2015, and remanded it back to CCI to decide again for violation of principles of natural justice. CCI then examined the issue again and confirmed its order in 2016. NCLAT upheld the penalty in July."

11,2018-10-05,UltraTech,"Nifty 50 companies are likely to report 11.4 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit for the September 2018 quarter. At 7.4 per cent, profit growth in the previous quarter had fallen below 10 per cent after three consecutive quarters of double digit growth. Revenue is expected to grow by 11.6 per cent in the September quarter, which would be the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Growth in revenue and profit in the year-ago quarter was 11.6 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.

Improving trend in the financials of top companies may offer some solace to investors amid a sharp drop in benchmark indices over the past few weeks. S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have lost over 7 per cent in a month. The current market turmoil is likely to result in mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio of companies, especially banks and finance companies. Its extent is difficult to measure at the aggregate level but may cause some pressure on the bottomlines.

Select companies in the automobiles, banking and finance, consumer goods, mining, and IT sectors are likely to support overall growth of the sample. The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by 18.8 per cent in the September quarter, faster than 15.2 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin is likely to expand by 60 basis points to 21.6 per cent.




SECTOR TREND

AUTOMOBILES
Two-wheeler companies are likely to drive earnings growth of the sector for the September quarter due to sustained volume growth despite many disruptions. The floods in Kerala and new rules of registration in Bengal did impact the volume growth. The volumes of Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto grew 6 per cent and 26 per cent, while that of Maruti Suzuki fell by 1.5 per cent during the quarter. The operating margins may shrink by 50-100 basis points due to higher input prices.


BANKING, FINANCE
Banks with higher exposure to corporate loans such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank may show deceleration in new bad loan recognition for the September quarter. Other banks with greater retail exposure such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank are likely to report sustained momentum in advances. Rising interest costs may put pressure on margins. In addition, mark-to-market losses on investments may widen due to a sharp fall in the stock market.


CAPITAL GOODS
A sustained order flow from the government should support the growth of capital goods companies. Project execution is picking up as most of the slow moving orders are out of the system. The order inflows momentum of Larsen & Toubro shows that it will be able to meet its order inflow and revenue growth guidance.


CEMENT
The September quarter is again expected to be driven by volume growth rather than price increase.

Cement volumes of the top five players by capacity Ultratech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to increase by 10-25 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter. Their revenue is likely to grow by 8-15 per cent while net profit may drop due to higher pet coke prices.


FMCG PREVIEW
A gradual recovery in rural demand may support the performance of FMCG companies. However, a below normal monsoon remains a concern. Companies are likely to raise product prices to pass on the higher input costs.


IT
A sharp depreciation of 4.3 per cent sequentially and 8.1 per cent annually in the average rate of the rupee against the dollar and momentum in projects on the digital platform will be the key growth drivers for the sector in the September quarter. TCS and HCL Technologies are expected to fare better while Wipro may continue to face pressure on the topline.


PHARMA PREVIEW
The September quarter performance of pharma companies is likely to indicate the bottoming out of price erosion in the US generics market. In the absence of any major launch in the US, companies are likely to report lack-lustre performance. There has also been rationalisation in the R&D expenses. The management commentary on the business prospects in the US market would be crucial.


METALS & MINING
Base metal companies such as Hindalco and Vedanta are likely to see a subdued quarter due to flat product prices year-on-year. LME aluminium prices were 2-3 per cent higher while LME zinc prices were down 10 per cent . A weak rupee would partially offset these negatives. JSW Steel and Tata Steel are likely to report decent quarters due to firm steel prices and weak rupee advantage.


POWER
Although monsoon is seasonally the weakest quarter for the sector, power companies are likely to report good growth. Power generation may grow by 6 per cent year-on-year. Higher merchant tariffs will help. It may turn out to be a decent quarter for a sector which has remained weak for the last several years.


TELECOM
The competitive pressure will continue to eat into profits and profitability of the telecom operators. Which means the commentary may not be much different for the second quarter compared with the past several quarters."
14,2018-10-08,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: The recent bloodbath in the domestic stocks has hurt small investors as hard as the country’s top billionaires.

The across-the-board selloff eroded market capitalisation of many bluechips, resulting in notional losses in the value of promoter stakes. 

Mukesh Ambani, who owns oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries, has $50.7 billion in wealth as of August 28, a day before the BSE Sensex hit an all-time high of 38,989.65 on August 29. He is now worth $39.5 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaire index shows.

The owner of the world’s largest oil refining hub at Jamnagar has lost all the gains he made so far this year on the surging shares of Reliance Industries, the second-most valued stock in India. RIL scrip has corrected 20 per cent (till Friday) from its all-time high of Rs 1,328.75 (hit on August 29). On Monday, RIL shares saw a 5 per cent rebound to trade at Rs 1,098 on BSE at 1300 hours.

Another group stock, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, has lost 40 per cent of its market capitalisation (m-cap) so far this year. Year-to-date, Ambani's wealth has shrunken by $750-odd billions. 

Kumar Mangalam Birla, who owns the Aditya Birla group, saw eight group companies erode nearly Rs 60,000 crore in market value. Six of the eight listed stocks have declined up to 70 per cent this calendar, data available with Ace Equity suggests. Vodafone Idea (Rs 23,000 crore), Grasim Industries (Rs 16,000) and UltraTech Cement (Rs 14,000 crore) have been the biggest wealth destroyers. On Monday, Birla's wealth stood at $5.91 billion, against a high of $9.38 billion hit in January. Year-to-date, he has lost $3.16 billion. 

Gautam Adani, whose Adani Group has interests in ports, logistics, shipping and rail, coal mining and management and energy, with renewable and, thermal power generation and transmission and agro commodities, has taken a $3.8 billion hit year-to-date, data showed.

Adani was worth over $11 billion in earlier in January. On Monday, he was worth $6.57 billion.

Among five of the group’s listed stocks, four – namely Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Adani Power and Adani Transmission – have lost Rs 40,494 crore in combined market value this calendar. Adani Green, the renewable energy business, on Monday traded at Rs 32, marginally higher than its June 2018 listing price of Rs 30.

17,2018-10-14,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: After five consecutive weeks, equity barometer Sensex managed to close a highly volatile week with gains, thanks to Friday’s fireworks on Dalal Street. 

A jump in the rupee and drop in crude oil prices soothed the nerves of traders and investors in the last session of the week, which triggered all-round buying and offered the bulls a booster doze to help regain control of the market. 

The BSE Sensex surged 356 points, or 1.04 per cent, for the week to settle at 34,733, while the NSE Nifty50 gained 156 points, or 1.51 per cent, to 10,472. 

The rupee, US dollar, bond yields and oil were the major factors swaying market mood through the week.

They will continue to dominate proceeding through the coming week, which will be a truncated one as Thursday is a trading holiday for equities, commodities and forex markets on account of Dussehra. 


Let’s take a look at the factors that might influence market sentiment during the week: 


Earnings can sway sentiment
The earnings season will be in its full swing next week as some of the top names such as Reliance Industries, IndusInd Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Infosys, Indiabulls Housing Finance, ACC and Ultratech Cement will disclose their second quarterly numbers. Upbeat numbers from these heavyweights will induce positive sentiment in the market.

Rupee, crude to remain in limelight
The rupee hit a fresh record low of 74.48 against the US currency last week, but rebounded smartly to log its biggest one-day gain in 29 months, by rising 55 paise to close at 73.57 to the dollar. If the rupee rises further, it will not be less than a blessing, considering how its movement has hurt stocks over the past few weeks. Crude oil prices steadied in global markets, giving some relief to India’s economics. Brent crude closed 17 cents higher at $80.43 on Friday. The International Energy Agency, in its monthly report said the oil market looked “adequately supplied for now” and trimmed its forecast for world oil demand growth this year and the next. This might help ease the oil counter quite a bit before US sanctions on Iran come into force on November 4. 


Domestic macros to be key driver
The market will closely watch the inflation data based on wholesale price index (WPI) for September. The retail inflation data, known as CPI, for September was less than projected but industrial production (IIP) print for August frustrated as it slipped to a three-month low of 4.3 per cent. Consumer inflation for September stood at 3.77 per cent, falling short of the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 per cent. 


Global macros to watch
Japan will release its August industrial production numbers on Monday. On the same day, the US will announce its sales data for September. China will reveal its September CPI numbers while the US will announce September industrial production figures on Tuesday. On Friday, China will disclose industrial production numbers for September and GDP numbers for third quarter. Markets across the globe will closely watch these numbers to assess the health of the world’s top economies. 


All eyes on FOMC minutes
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will release the minutes of its September 25-26 policy meeting, which should have cues to future rate decisions. It is an important event for markets, as the minutes usually explain the Fed panel’s policy stance. In the last policy meet, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points and signalled another hike in December and three more in 2019. 


Technical outlook
The Nifty50 formed a ‘Morning Star’ pattern on the daily chart on Friday, which would be confirmed if the index shows followup buying next week. In such a case, Thursday’s intraday high of 10,138 could emerge as a short-term bottom. “Nifty closed in the positive territory in the last trading week and with this, it has closed in the green on the weekly chart after five weeks. The hourly momentum indicator is in the buy mode with a positive divergence; hence the probability of an upside is quite high. The index has violated the formation of lower tops and lower bottoms. Hence, a bounceback till 10,650 and 10,700 levels can’t be ruled out. The support is pegged at 10,300 level,” said Jay Thakkar, CMT – head technical and derivatives research - AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers."

26,2018-10-25,UltraTech,"Indian companies are on course to miss their earnings targets yet again. Out of the 51 companies on the BSE-500 index which have come out with their second quarter results so far, profits of 28 have missed analysts’ expectations, heightening worries about further delay in the muchawaited earnings recovery and sharp cuts in forecasts.

Several blue-chips, too, have disappointed investors. Analysts said increase in input costs, lower volumes due to aggressive pricing or additional provisioning in case of some banks resulted in many of their profits falling below estimates.

With rising crude prices, weaker rupee and rising funding costs, analysts are likely to cut earnings estimates for FY19. “We expect sharp cut in earnings estimates in near term because of the poor show in the September quarter” said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India research, UBS. “Hope of earnings recovery in the second half of FY 2019 looks bleak now with the new developments like increasing rates, rising crude and liquidity crunch.” Top companies that did not meet earnings estimates include IndusInd Bank, ACC, Bajaj Auto, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, Ambuja, UltraTech Cement and Wipro. Shares of most of them have languished in the last two weeks.



Bajaj Auto stock fell nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday after its September quarter operating results missed street expectations. Last Wednesday, Reliance Industries had reported a 17 per cent rise in net profit, which have been lower than street expectations.

Earnings disappointments have added to the existing woes of investors, who have been worried about the impact of higher crude oil prices and falling rupee on the country’s finances. The tightening liquidity conditions, which is weighing down non banking finance companies, have contributed to the uncertainty.

“The fear of tight liquidity and higher interest rates is adversely impacting several domestic oriented sectors, which were the key to FY19 earnings recovery” said Gautam Duggad, head of research, Motilal Oswal Securities. “NBFCs will see downgrades after many years of strong growth”.

Analysts said further delay in earnings recovery could result in investors losing patience. Investors have been waiting for an earnings recovery for the last two years.

Market participants are now analysing the impact of the liquidity squeeze in NBFCs on the economy."
27,2018-10-25,UltraTech,"It might just turn out to be the worst October for the domestic stock market since 2008.

Back then, the flagship Sensex had cracked 23.89 per cent as compared to a fall of 7.38 per cent this month so far. In October 2009, the barometer had come off by 7.18 per cent. 

Sounds tempting to move in? After all, quite a few stocks have crashed to their all-time lows or tested 52-week lows in the ongoing correction.

But hold your horses, caution experts. They advise against picking up a stock just because it’s at a 52-week low, for the simple reason that it can continue to hit newer lows going ahead. 

Here, valuation is a key decider. According to analysts, one should go for a stock only if valuations look attractive compared to the overall state of the market.

Numbers tell you the story. The 30-share BSE index has hit its lowest level since April this year and the index has turned negative for the year. It touched an intra-day low of 33,553.18 today morning.


Catching the falling knife?
Nearly 60 per cent of stocks of the BSE 500 hit their 52-week lows in October whereas 32 of them were at their fresh all-time lows this month. 

Aditya Birla Capital, Bandhan Bank, DB Corp, IL&FS Transportation, Infibeam Avenues, Max India, PNB Housing Finance, Narayana Hrudayalaya, Inox Wind, Bank of Maharashtra, Cochin Shipyard, InterGlobe Aviation, Reliance Power, Tejas Network and Vodafone Idea are some that plumbed new lows in October. 

On the other hand, Dilip Buildcon, PC Jeweller, Dish TV, UltraTech Cement, Tata Communications, Canara Bank, Bharat Forge, Piramal Enterprises, Crisil, Bharat Financial Inclusion and DLF were among 294 stocks that tested new 52-week lows.

Stock picker Nikhil Kamath, co-founder, Zerodha, said, “Buying stocks around the 52-week lows is generally a bad strategy to follow as stocks are inherently affected by momentum. A stock at 52-week low is generally trending lower and the trend will most likely continue in the near future. It’s prudent to look at the size of the company. Smallcap and midcap stocks are best avoided near their 52-week lows.”

“Largecap stocks that form part of the Nifty 50 can be looked at. The factors to keep in mind here are debt on the books, outlook of the sector on the whole and in a lot of cases, it always comes down to the quality of the management. So, bear these factors in mind while picking stocks at 52-week lows,” he explained.

Of late, Indian equity markets have been battered by heavy foreign selloff as US economy started firing and bond yields there turned more attractive. Soaring crude oil prices, crisis in the NBFC sector and a falling rupee also hastened this selloff. 

Foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth of over Rs 21,000 crore in October so far. This followed Rs 10,824 crore outflows in September. 

“One can use stocks of 52-week lows as universe to select, but being part of this universe alone is not enough. Many of them may keep hitting fresh 52-week lows in the next 2 months,” said G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.


Investment options
Chokkalingam shares some key variables an investor should look at before buying a stock. They are as follows. 

1) Whether valuation multiples have been contracting below mean values for last 3-5 years. 

2) Whether the company in question has relatively better balance sheets. It should be least leveraged and there shouldn’t be any stress from receivables and inventories.

3) It should be part of good management.

4) The company's business should be reassuring in terms of sustainable growth and it should not be on a down cycle.

As for the stocks trading at their 52-week low levels, Anand Rathi Financial Services is positive on Sunteck Realty and Persistent Systems with a target price of Rs 545 and Rs 820, respectively. Sunteck Realty hit 52-week low of Rs 295.70 on October 23 and Persistent Systems fell to 52-week low of Rs 540 on October 22.

Edelweiss maintained ‘Buy’ on InerGlobe Aviation, the owner of IndiGo, post Q2 results. However, it slashed the target price to Rs 1,073 from Rs 1,153 earlier. The scrip hit 52-week low of Rs 697 on October 9 on the BSE.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse recently maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 480. The stock slumped to its 52-week low of Rs 294 on October 8.

About his approach towards the market, Shailesh R Bhan, Deputy CEO, Reliance Capital AM, told ETNow: “Our approach is simple. From a three-year point of view, we are studying which kinds of businesses have an earnings momentum, are directionally seeing an improving operating environment and how supportive the tailwinds are for those companies. That is our construct for investing. We continue to believe that the largecap space is still rational and over a three-year period provides a good opportunity.”

He added: “Over a period of time, people can look at other spaces as well, but at the moment given elections and the volatility, the largecap or multicap space is a better place to be in.”"
28,2018-10-26,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Century Textiles and Industries' minority shareholders on Wednesday gave their nod to the company's decision to sell its cement assets to Ultratech.

Also, the company's debt of Rs 4,300 crore at the end of June, 2018 will be brought down to Rs 1,300 crore with this transaction. 

""In the NCLT convened shareholders meeting on 24th October 2018, minority shareholders showed full confidence and support to the Company’s decision to sell its cement assets to UltraTech Cement Limited at an enterprise value of Rs.8621 crore with 81.39% votes in favour of the transaction,"" a release by the company said. 

There had earlier been some concerns that a section of the company was not satisfied with the compensation that the cement assets was getting from Ultratech. However, Wednesday's decision assuaged most fears. To be sure, 17% of insitutional shareholders as well as 23% of non-institutional shareholders did oppose the proposal but the final score tipped the scale in favour of the passage of the demerger as planned. 

Ultratech had announced in May that it will takeover Century Textiles and Industries' cement business that will add 13.4 MT ready capacity to Ultratech's current capacity, taking its total capacity to 116 MT."

1,2018-11-19,UltraTech,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."
2,2018-11-21,UltraTech,"One-off deferred tax gain supported bottom lines for much of India Inc during the September quarter. But that should not take away credit from those which managed to grow bottom lines on the strength of top line expansion.

September quarter earnings season broadly turned out to be better than expected, which took BSE benchmark Sensex to its record high mark. Sensex scaled a fresh all-time high of 40,676 amid the ongoing earnings season.

This was one of the better earnings seasons anytime in last three or four years, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Adviser.

“A number of companies have beaten Street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because we had the tax cuts in the middle of the quarter. A lot of companies adjusted that in the second quarter,” he said.

For instance, despite a drop in top line, Tata Steel reported a 6 per cent increase in consolidated net for the quarter at Rs 3,302 crore, thanks to the new tax regime.

JSW Steel posted 22 per cent rise in consolidated net profit, mainly due to a writeback of deferred taxes and accrued incentives from previous years. But the company’s revenue from operations actually declined 18.5 per cent to Rs 17,572 crore from Rs 21,552 crore a year ago.

But Mavani also points out that going by pre-tax profit or Ebitda number, a large number of companies also managed to grow on their own, actually showing margin expansions that beat Street expectations.

Data available with Ace Equity on November 6 showed 71 firms listed on BSE as largecap, midcap or smallcap reported over 100 per cent rise in net profit in Q2.

Even some of them like Dr Reddy’s Lab reported over 100 per cent expansion in net profit despite a 25 per cent rise in Q2 revenue. Others like SBI reported manifold rise in bottom line due to a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

SBI posted nearly six-fold rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter, supported by a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

Bottomline of the public sector lender grew 485 per cent to Rs 3,375 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576 crore in the same period last year. Gujarat Gas, GSK Pharma, Indian Bank, Jindal Saw, NIIT, JK Tyre, Deepak Nitrite, Motilal Oswal Finanical Services, Bank of Maharasthtra and Avani Feeds were among other major players that reported over 100 per cent profit growth in Q2.



Besides one-time tax gains, other income, improving asset quality and corporate-related actions supported bottom lines of select companies during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services reported 3,297 per cent profit growth at Rs 142.3 crore in September quarter against a Rs 4.5 crore in the year-ago period, while Indian Bank reported Rs 359 crore profit on increasing income and improving asset quality by controlling loan slippages and other factors, a top bank official said.

A sharp drop in provisions for loan writeoffs in the home finance arm during the quarter supported the bottom line of the Mumbai-based firm. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said a strong momentum was seen in the market is due to healthy Q2 earnings from big corporates. “This positivity is likely to stay in the short to medium term as concerns of the market are fading with tax cut,” he said.

Out of top 71, five players reported over 100 per cent sales growth, 25 others posted 10 to 70 per cent increase sales. Others reported up to 10 per cent rise or fall in net sales during the quarter.

Some 73 firms from across sectors such as consumer food, TV broadcasting, banking, NBFC, plastic products, power generation and engineering, among others, reported 50 to 100 per cent bottom line expansion.

The list included players like Multi Commodity Exchange, Bandhan Bank, SRF, GTPL Hathaway, Kukuyo Camlin, Varun Beverages, EIH, Petronet LNG, PSP Projects, Torrent Power, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, UltraTech Cement and Aarti Drugs.



“Corporate earnings have been subdued or below expectations over the past few years. However, we are starting to see a revival in corporate earnings growth, and expect it to pick up pace from H2FY20. This will help to drive the markets going forward,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

He said the recent corporate tax cut would provide a boost to corporate earnings over time. “We believe a bottom-up research-oriented process, coupled with growth at reasonable price (GARP) approach will help deliver superior returns over the long term,” he said."

5,2018-11-23,UltraTech,"Three meetings, two hotels, one city. These were crucial to an eight-month-long investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2010 and 2011 to expose a cartel in India’s cement industry, which resulted in a penalty of Rs 6,317 crore, the regulator’s highest in a single case to date.

The CCI has since carried out many probes into alleged anti-competitive agreements and companies’ abuse of their dominant position, but it is still best known for the cement cartel case mainly because of the eye-popping fine. It is nearly half of the Rs 13,523 crore the CCI levied in 135 cases till March 2018, according to the latest data available with the regulator. Of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 55 crore, or 0.4%.




Compare this to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which collected $172 million in criminal penalties in fiscal year 2018 (October-September), with the highest ever being $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015. It has also sent several executives to prison.

While the CCI cannot boast figures like DoJ, the very fact that it has the authority to severely penalise violators could be working to its advantage. Meanwhile, some of the recommendations made by the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC), which submitted its report recently, could make CCI more nimble in the resolution of cases and take it a little closer to its counterparts in the EU, the UK and the US.




 It was in 2010, almost a decade ago, that the CCI, which had only become operational in May 2009, decided to probe its most high-profile case — to find out if 10 cement companies colluded through the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) to limit supplies and raise prices. The CCI said that after two of three CMA meetings at Mumbai’s Grand Hyatt and Hotel Orchid in early 2011, the companies hiked cement prices, which, the CCI said, “establishes that they co-ordinated their decisions and fixed prices after due consultations”. There were also questions over whether Ambuja Cement and ACC, which are part of the Swiss company LafargeHolcim, had attended two of these meetings despite no longer being members of the CMA.




The companies and the CMA disputed the CCI’s findings and appealed the penalty. The case has made its way through the Competition Appellate Tribunal, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which replaced the former in 2017, and is now pending before the Supreme Court, which asked the parties to deposit 10% of the penalty last year. Aparna Dutt Sharma, secretary general, CMA, did not respond to a request from 
ET Magazine for comment. Questions sent to Lafarge-Holcim, UltraTech Cement and Jaiprakash Associates, which were handed the highest penalties, also went unanswered.

The delay in the conclusion of this case — and others where fines were levied — has meant that companies have not coughed up what the CCI asked them to. Should that be a cause for concern? Kaushal Kumar Sharma, the first director-general of the CCI, says it would be wrong to equate deterrence to realisation of penalties. Vaibhav Choukse, partner, competition law, J Sagar Associates, concurs. “Companies do not want to be on the wrong side of the competition law as there is a huge reputational loss from a penalty.” A listed company will have to make disclosures to the stock exchanges in case it is fined by the CCI, which could drive its shares down.

“It’s not that the CCI wants to make money. The CCI’s idea in the early days was to make a splash and say, ‘We have arrived,’” says a competition lawyer, requesting anonymity. Nisha Kaur Uberoi, national head of competition law at Trilegal, a law firm, says the CCI has created deterrents through a combination of factors: “its ability to levy India’s highest economic penalties on companies, imposition of individual liability as well as advocacy to foster a culture of competition compliance”. By individual liability, she is referring to the CCI’s powers to penalise the directors of an errant company.

Ashok Kumar Gupta, chairman, CCI, recently told ET that penalties are not an end in themselves in any enforcement process. “In numerous cases, parties rectify their anti-competitive behaviour during the enquiry process itself so the market correction as such has taken place.”




As of March 2018, the CCI had noted 940 competition cases, ordered probes into 400 and completed investigations in 288. Even before the cement cartel case, a CCI order in 2011 gave India Inc an inkling of the regulator’s powers. It investigated the realtor DLF’s conduct in relation to one of its apartment buildings in Gurgaon and found that the company had set terms unfavourable to buyers in their agreement, like their inability to raise objections to changes in the structure by the builder. The CCI report added: “Despite knowing that necessary approvals were pending at the time of collection of deposits, DLF Ltd inserted clauses that made exit next to impossible for the buyers.”




The CCI fined DLF Rs 630 crore, which the realtor appealed; the matter is now in the apex court. Also before the Supreme Court is an appeal related to a Rs 591 crore penalty on Coal India for discriminatory terms in fuel-supply agreements. DLF and Coal India did not respond to questions sent by 
ET Magazine. Besides looking at anti-competitive agreements like cartels and abuse of dominance, the CCI also has to greenlight mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain size. The CCI, set up under the Competition Act, 2002 (amended in 2007), replaced the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.


Change is in the Air
The CLRC, which the government set up last year, has recommended a series of changes to the CCI. These include a dedicated NCLAT bench for competition cases, given that NCLAT is overburdened with cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. Though there is no NCLAT-specific data, as of September 30, there were nearly 1,500 IBC cases pending before the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.

Some of the report’s suggestions could make the CCI dispose of cases quickly. The introduction of settlement and commitment procedures, for instance, could help avoid pendency of cases. In the EU, which has had settlements since 2008, half the cartel cases are resolved using settlements, in which the parties admit to their guilt in exchange for a 10% reduction in penalties. Since 2004 the EU has also had commitments, in which the parties agree to change their behaviour. The US DoJ has consent decrees, which need to be court-approved.




Another recommendation made by the CLRC is that the CCI should be transparent in how it arrives at penalties, like in the EU and the UK. “It’s as if the CCI is pulling figures out of a hat,” says Aditya Bhattacharjea, professor at the Delhi School of Economics and a member of the CLRC.

The CCI, according to CLRC recommendations, can levy a penalty of up to 10% of the average turnover of the preceding three years in matters related to abuse of dominance. In case of cartels, it can impose a fine of up to 10% of their turnover or up to three times their profit in each year of the period during which the cartel existed, whichever is higher. “Having penalty guidelines will be good for the CCI when it has to defend its orders in courts,” says the competition lawyer quoted earlier.


Come Clean
Regardless of when these recommendations are incorporated into the law, experts say companies could make use of an existing provision to minimise a crippling penalty. A company engaged in an anti-competitive agreement with its competitors can alert the CCI to the existence of the cartel and cooperate in the investigation in the hopes of being waived a part, or the whole, of its fine.

Panasonic Energy utilised the lesser penalty option and went to the CCI in 2016 and admitted that it was part of a cartel with Eveready Industries and Indo National (which sells under the Nippo brand), aided by their industry association, to control the distribution and prices of zinc-carbon dry cell batteries, since 2008. Eveready and Indo National also availed of the lesser penalty provision. As a result, the CCI waived 100% of Panasonic’s Rs 75 crore penalty, and reduced Eveready’s and Indo National’s fines by 30% and 20%, respectively, to Rs 172 crore and Rs 42 crore.


Tech Challenge
Cracking down on cartels without one of the participating companies coming forward is not easy, especially since in some cases the CCI may not have more than circumstantial evidence to base its conclusions on. An even bigger challenge is dealing with violations in the fast-evolving world of technology.

Acting on information filed by Jaipur-based Consumer Unity & Trust Society and Matrimony.com, the CCI in 2018 fined Google Rs 136 crore for promoting its own specialised search — say, for flights — to the detriment of other websites. The order was stayed by NCLAT. Google is also being probed by the CCI for tying some of its apps to Android and limiting handset makers’ ability to sell devices with alternate versions. “Android has enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. We look forward to working with the CCI to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less,” says a Google India spokesperson.

Google’s dominance has been under scrutiny in the EU and the US as well. Since 2017, it has been fined a total of $9.3 billion by the EU in three different cases related to its abuse of dominance by favouring its advertising and shopping services over its competitors’ and for bundling some of its applications with Android. (Google has appealed all three orders.) It is also being investigated in the US and so are Facebook and, reportedly, Amazon. “Other than in the EU, competition regulators are exercising caution (with tech companies) because consumers are benefiting from these companies,” says Bhattacharjea.

While India may have got a competition authority later than several other countries, new technologies are coming to India soon after they are launched elsewhere. This is why Sharma, former CCI director general, believes that handling tech matters may not be too hard for the CCI. One of the emerging areas of concern for competition regulators worldwide is artificial intelligence-powered pricing algorithms of competitors colluding to fix prices. Who is to be held responsible here in the absence of executives of rival companies acting in tandem?

In addition to instances of cartelisation and abuse of dominance in the old-economy sectors, the CCI will have to increasingly deal with competition cases in businesses like ecommerce, ridehailing, food delivery and online travel aggregation (the CCI is currently investigating MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, which merged in 2017, and Oyo Rooms over allegations of predatory pricing, among others). The CCI has also made clear its intent to pursue cases on its own without a formal complaint. But what is unlikely to change, till the CLRC recommendations are implemented, is the time it takes for a case to reach its conclusion."

Among other Sensex gainers were Bharti Airtel up 5.7 per cent to Rs 444.95 and IndusInd Bank up 2.6 per cent to Rs 1,484. HDFC was the biggest index contributor with 91 points.

Key factors behind the rally: 


Trade deal by year-end?

Sentiments improved on Dalal Street after reports said the US and China could sign a deal before the year ends. A senior US official over the weekend said an initial trade agreement is still possible by the end of the year, after Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump both underscored their desire on Friday to sign a deal.

The prolonged trade war between the world’s leading economies have been weighing on the market and economies. The resolution of the conflict may boost growth.


Laggards out of Sensex

BSE on Friday announced some changes to the composition of its flagship Sensex. The exchange has decided to remove Tata Motors, Tata Motors DVR, YES Bank and Vedanta from the index to make space for UltraTech Cement, Titan and Nestle India. This will be effective from December 23.

YES Bank has been one of the biggest disappointments in recent months as far as the stock market performance is concerned. It has dived 65 per cent year-to-date. SImilarly, Tata Motors is down 4 per cent YTD, Tata Motors DVR (17.9 per cent) and Vedanta (28 per cent) in comparison of 13 per cent gain in Sensex.

Technical factor

Nifty50 appears to have embarked on a fresh leg of rally as it erased the last two sessions of losses witnessed from the highs of 12,038-11,883 levels in just one stroke, said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

Hence, sustaining above 11,919 it should ideally test its life time highs placed around 12103. But beyond that in best case scenarios we can expect a target of 12350-400 levels. One can continue to retain a positive outlook as long as Nifty sustains above 11919 levels which can be ideal stop for fresh long positions on closing basis."

A slowing economy hasn’t stopped India’s benchmark equity index from climbing to a series of records this year, but this divergence may have run its course, according to BNP Paribas.

Asia’s third-biggest economy probably grew 4.6 per cent last quarter, which would be the slowest since the first three months of 2013, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of Friday’s data release. Meanwhile, the Sensex closed at a new high Wednesday and is up nearly 14 per cent for 2019. Stocks have climbed mainly since late September, when the unveiling of a corporate tax cut boosted the outlook for corporate earnings.

“Our recent meetings with policy makers and industry experts confirmed that there is unlikely to be a significant uptick in economic data in the near term,” Abhiram Eleswarapu, the firm’s Mumbai-based head of equity research, wrote in a note. “The index rally we had cautiously called for may be done for now.”

This view echoes that of Credit Suisse, which expects the growth slump to last longer than anticipated based on its interaction with investors. “With growth continuing to fall in Oct.-Nov., it seems unlikely that FY20 would see any growth in EPS and FY21 should see meaningful cuts too,” it said in a report this week.


Bloomberg
Investors are, however, unfazed by the economic slowdown. Net foreign buying in Indian stocks has reached $3.2 billion so far this month, set for the biggest tally since March, according to official data. The recent equity gains have also been fueled in part by hopes for a trade deal between the U.S. and China.

“The government may soon have to make the difficult choice between considerably slipping on its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP in FY20 to boost growth or potentially prolonging the slowdown by halting expenditure,” BNP said.

The brokerage remains overweight on India, and favors private banks, insurers and dividend-paying public sector firms.


Here’s a roundup of other brokerage views:

Goldman Sachs


Overweight India as it expects the economy to recover and corporate earnings to improve next year.
The growth recovery is likely to be led by a pick-up in the global cycle, the impact of easing local financial conditions and recent government measures.
India EPS growth will rise to 16 per cent next year from 12 per cent this year.
Expect the NSE Nifty 50 Index to reach 13,000 by the end of 2020, implying upside of over 7 per cent from the current level.


JPMorgan


While Indian stocks have underperformed in three of the last four years amid the slowdown in growth, they appear set to be the “turnaround story” of early 2020.
Expectations of a growth bottom and government reforms should sustain elevated nominal valuations. Relative valuations are “closer to average”.
JPMorgan sees a modest growth recovery in the second half of fiscal year 2020 driven by a favorable base effect, above-normal rain, government spending and impact from RBI easing.
Recommendations: ICICI Bank, Ultratech Cement and Ashok Leyland.


Societe Generale


Reforms hold the key to further gains in share prices.
Corporate tax reforms are bringing foreign investors back and have raised the longer term return potential of the market.
While the earnings trend is positive, equity valuations are higher than all major markets in the region.
Expect economic headwinds to start receding in the coming year."

Chopda further noted that even though national elections and current global outlook will have their temporary impact, the underlying drivers for M&A transactions will be the barrier breakers and carriers of strong deal trends going forward."

There are several factors that have discouraged cement players from raising prices in the December quarter.

Over the past three to four years, cement demand has shifted disproportionately to the non-trade segment from trade, which otherwise fetches higher margins and better realisations. The non-trade segment comprises companies, governments and other entities that directly buy cement from the manufacturers. Trade segment means manufacturers selling cement to distributors and dealers, which sell to retail customers.

Within the non-trade segment, infrastructure is driving demand but it is not enough to encourage players to raise prices as infrastructure segment accounts for 15-20 per cent of cement demand.

The trade segment attracts demand from housing sector, which generates 60-65 per cent of cement consumption. Since construction has slowed down in the housing sector, the demand from the trade segment has been fairly unstable and almost stagnant. Besides this, in the non-trade segment analysts point out that payments from the government entities have been slow. This has affected the working capital cycle, which in turn has created liquidity issues.



Incremental capacity addition has also been a key factor. In the next three years ending FY21, the industry would expand capacity by 60-65MT. This incremental capacity will likely limit any scope for players to raise prices as the focus would be on generating volumes instead of value. In such a situation, companies would not benefit from the softening in coal and diesel prices as they will have to pass on these benefits by selling cement at relatively attractive rates.

The lack of pricing power is likely to persist for at least two years as demand from the real estate sector, which accounts for the bulk of the sales, has been rather weak. Given these factors, there would be pressure on operating profit margins at least for the second half of the present fiscal. This indicates falling or flat realisations on sale of cement.

Taking into account these factors, it is very likely that demand may improve only in select pockets — in specific regions — than on a pan-India basis. The eastern and central regions are likely to see relatively stable demand, especially from the infrastructure and lowcost housing segments. Shree Cement, Heidelberg Cement, Ultratech Cement, and Ambuja Cements have strong presence in these regions."
7,2018-12-14,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty managed to finish Friday's session with mild gains after a seesaw session as speculations about the RBI board meet outcome kept investors at bay.

Weak global cues also weighed on sentiment. Global stocks suffered losses on concerns of China's slowing economic growth after data showed China’s November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003. 

However, a fall in the crude oil prices played ball and market managed to eke out gains in pockets of oil and gas, telecom, power and energy.

The Sensex settled in the green for the fourth successive session at 35,962.93, up 33 points, or 0.09 per cent. Overall, 21 stocks settled with gains in the index as against 10 that suffered losses.

The Nifty advanced by 14 points, or 0.13 per cent, to 10,805.45, with 29 stocks in the green and 21 in the red.

8,2018-12-17,UltraTech,"MUMBAI: Global brokerage Credit Suisse is said it prefers investment-related stocks in India over consumption-focused stocks for the new calendar year 2019 as the latter sector remains over-priced with risk of cuts to earnings estimates.

“The market continues to be in favour of consumption, as reflected in the sector’s high price-to-earnings ratios. In contrast, industrials stocks have mostly not participated in the market rerating over the past three years,” said Credit Suisse. “This underperformance of the industrial sector and corporate banks is expected to reverse,” it said.

Its top picks include Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Heavy Electricals, State Bank of India and ICICI Bank. Its least preferred stocks are UltraTech Cement and Hindustan Unilever. 

Credit Suisse has increased weightage on industrials space by removing 2 percentage points from metals. Industrials space is less expensive and is also showing good earnings momentum, said Credit Suisse. It has maintained underweight stance on consumption space and non-banking financial companies.

2019 will be a year of volatility in global markets given the cuts in global growth forecasts and tightening monetary policy of central banks, according to Credit Suisse. Indian market will not be immune to this stress but impact will be lesser this time as there has barely been any net buying of equities by foreigners in the last few years, the note said.

“Global equities have seen price-to-earnings multiples rise steadily in the past several years – if the unwinding of quantitative easing and rising economic as well as geopolitical uncertainty brings down these multiples, it should show up in India as well,” said Credit Suisse. “The premium of India's valuation multiples to that of global equities is already near an eight-year high,” the brokerage added.

Credit Suisse said general elections in the last two decades have not had a visible impact on market direction, but the noise levels should stay high in the run up to the general elections of 2019. Agriculture is likely to remain a source of distress for 200 million workers, said Credit Suisse."
9,2018-12-21,UltraTech,"The profitability of Indian cement companies should recover from the recent lows, but the pace will be slower than expected, said Morgan Stanley, downgrading its view on the industry to ‘in-line’.

The financial services company has downgraded UltraTech Cement to ‘equalweight’ from ‘overweight’ and cut target price by 17 per cent to Rs 4,116. It has also cut rating on Grasim Industries to ‘equalweight’ and lowered target price by 25.5 per cent to Rs 958.

Morgan Stanley has maintained ‘underweight’ ratings on Shree Cement and JK Lakshmi Cement, and an ‘equalweight’ rating on Ambuja Cement. ACC is Morgan Stanley’s only ‘overweight’ rated stock in the sector due to operating leverage and valuation relative to history.

Shares of UltraTech Cement ended down 1 per cent at Rs 4,047.30. Grasim Industries ended down 3.1 per cent at Rs 830.90.

Cement companies’ earnings in the first half of the ongoing financial year 2018-19 (April-March) was disappointing due to weaker-than-expected cement prices and higher costs, said Morgan Stanley.

The firm raised FY19 demand growth estimate to 9 per cent from 7.5 per cent due to strong first half of financial year 2018-19. However, it sees downside risks in the urban and semi-urban real estate segment even as infrastructure-led demand is likely to be sustained.

Morgan Stanley expects industry capacity utilization to rise a modest 1 percentage point from a year ago in the next financial year 2019-20, to 79 per cent. Potential moderation in demand in the second half of FY19 also caps upside risk to prices, said Morgan Stanley."
10,2018-12-23,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: As the adage goes, there is a black sheep in every flock but India Inc found out, much to its embarrassment, this year that it had quite a few who were not playing by the rule book.

When diamantaire uncle-nephew duo Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi emerged as kingpins in the Rs 14,000-crore Punjab National Bank fraud upstaging Vijay Mallya, wanted in India for Rs 9,000-crore bank loan default, it was inevitable that the year belonged to the black sheeps of corporate India when it came to hitting the headlines.

Once the poster boys of the spirit of Indian entrepreneurship, the flamboyant Mallya, Choksi and Modi also became convenient tools to be used by political parties -- ruling and the Opposition alike -- to score brownie points over each other.

Giving them company were the absconding promoters of Gujarat-based pharmaceutical company Sterling Biotech Group Nitin and Chetan Sandesara, wanted in connection with a Rs 5,000-crore bank fraud and money laundering case.

While a London court has ordered for Mallya's extradition to India at the end of a year-long trial -- although he intends to appeal against the order, it remains to be seen in the coming year how many of the corporate-honchos-turned-fugitives will actually be brought back to India to face the law of the land.

2018 was also the year when the Singh brothers, former Fortis and Ranbaxy promoters and the erstwhile young icons of healthcare industry, fell out and literally coming to blows accusing each other of assault besides blaming each other for the downfall of their business.

Malvinder and Shivinder are also facing a criminal complaint filed by the another firm they promoted, Religare Enterprises with the the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police for cheating, fraud and misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 740 crore.

While the brothers have appealed against the award of Rs 3,500 crore by an arbitration panel in Singapore in April 2016 to be paid to Japan's Daiichi Sankyo in a dispute related to the acquisition of Ranbaxy, the matter cast a shadow on IHH Healthcare's open offer for Fortis Healthcare with the Supreme Court ordering status quo with regard to the sale of controlling stakes in the Indian hospital chain.

The saga of Tata-Mistry fight continued, moving from the Mumbai bench of NCLT to the NCLAT in the national capital as ousted Tata Sons Chairman Cyrus Mistry sought to slug it out, persisting with his allegations of oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement by the company.

On the other hand, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) witnessed heightened activities at its different benches took up insolvency proceedings of 12 stressed assets which were referred to it by the RBI last year.

While Tata Steel acquired debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd with a Rs 32,500-crore deal and Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement bagging Binani Cement with a revised bid of Rs 7,950.34 crore, the proceedings had to reach all the way to the Supreme Court to decide the winner, thus exposing lacunae in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

In the case of auto component maker Amtek Auto, Liberty House won the bid offering to pay financial creditors Rs 3,225 crore upfront and make a fresh infusion of Rs 500 but lenders approached the Chandigarh bench of NCLT alleging failure on the part of the UK-based firm to comply with approved resolution plan.

It will only be known, hopefully, in the coming year who will bag the big-ticket stressed assets such as Essar Steel, Jaypee Infratech and Ruchi Soya which are still mired in litigations.

Amid the frauds, default and legal battles, the telecom sector witnessed an all-out tariff war with the new entrant Reliance Jio continuing to disrupt the industry, which saw completion of merger of Vodafone India and Idea, while Bharti Airtel also got the nod from its shareholders for its acquisition of Tata Teleservices.

Jio's sustained disruptive pricing continued to put financial pressure on other operators who experienced erosion in profitability and deteriorating operational matrix.

Such was the pressure of financial stress that Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of India's largest operator Vodafone Idea, approached the government seeking immediate relief for the sector.

At a time when many were following up on the happenings at the Westminster Magistrates' Court that was hearing the extradition case of Vijay Mallya, who left India for the UK in March 2016, state-owned Punjab National Bank on February 14 this year announced that it had detected a USD 1.77 billion fraud, making it possibly the biggest banking scam in the country. It filed a complaint with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

The focus immediately shifted from Mallya to high-profile jewellers Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi, who were accused by the CBI for siphoning off of funds using fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) issued from PNB's Brady House branch in Mumbai.

Following the script of Mallya, the uncle-nephew duo had already left India before the scam was unearthed and their whereabouts were unknown.

Later on when reports emerged that Choksi had moved to Antigua and taken a local passport, the Congress didn't let go of the opportunity to blame the Bharatiya Janata Party again.

Adding fuel to the political fire was Mallya, who claimed he met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley before leaving India in 2016, only for the minister to vehemently deny it.

Amid all the dramas, once in a while, big-ticket deals like Walmart's USD 16-billion acquisition of India's homegrown e-commerce major Flipkart; and merger of Hindustan Unilever, the Indian arm of Unilever, with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare valuing the latter at Rs 31,700 crore managed to draw attention as well.

Likewise, the long-running saga of sale of cash-strapped Fortis Healthcare to Malaysia's IHH Healthcare for Rs 4,000 crore after scrapping two previous selected suitors -- TPG-Manipal combine and Munjals-Burmans, kept the headline writers busy.

Yet, none came close to Mallya, Nirav Modi and Chokshi in keeping the headline writers busy from all aspects. Maybe in 2019, they will write a different story."
11,2018-12-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks fell in sync with their Asian peers on Monday, with both Sensex & Nifty shedding nearly 1 per cent as they extended their losing streak to the third consecutive session.

12,2018-12-25,UltraTech,"Tasked with a key job of helping recover unpaid corporate loans, the NCLT has helped resolve insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings involving more than Rs 80,000 crore in the year passing-by and the kitty is expected to swell beyond Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019 with several big-ticket default cases pending.

Plans are afoot to further strengthen the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by increasing number of judges and benches and provide adequate infrastructure to fast-track the process, according to government officials.

The new year will not only test the mettle of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), but also of the NCLT and its appellate body NCLAT, as several high-profile cases need to be resolved -- Essar Steel (involving over Rs 80,000 crore alone) and Bhushan Power & Steel (about Rs 45,000 crore due to its lenders) are just a few, experts said.

In 2018, over Rs 80,000 crore was recovered from various corporate debtors, which had defaulted payments, under the IBC through various insolvency proceeding at the NCLT and the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal), Ministry of Corporate Affair Secretary Injeti Srinivas told PTI.

As per estimates, the IBC has helped address stressed assets worth approximately Rs 3 lakh crore -- directly or indirectly -- since the new law came into force in December 2016.

""The estimated amount includes recoveries made through resolution plan and cases settled before admission by the NCLT,"" he added.

In 2019, the NCLT is expected to finalise corporate insolvency resolution process of several stressed assets through its 11 functional benches across India. These cases would include Essar Steel, Bhushan Power & Steel, Videocon Group, Monnet Ispat, Amtek Auto, Ruchi Soya, Lanco Infratech, Jaypee Infratech among others.

Acording to law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Executive Partner Punit Dutt Tyagi, the new year is likely to ""test the mettle of the IBC as well as of the NCLT and NCLAT"".

""Most of the major cases pending before the NCLT are likely to be resolved and these debtors are likely to come into hands of successful bidders,"" he added.

In 2018, insolvency proceedings against some companies including Bhushan Steel, ElectroSteel Steel, Binani Cement were almost completed and the new management from their successful bidders -- Tata Steel, Vedanta group and Adity Birla-led UltraTech, respectively -- have taken over the management control of the stressed assets.

Big Corporate houses including Arcelor Mittal, Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, UltraTech Cement, UK-based Liberty Group, Vedanta group, Dalmia Bharat group were among the leading companies which had submitted their resolution plans to acquire the debt ridden firms.

Other major insolvency cases being handled by the NCLT and the NCLAT include RCom, Videocon group, Alok Industries, Lanco Infrateck, Jaypee Infratech, Jyoti Structures and ABG Shipyard.

Although, the IBC mandates completion of insolvency proceedings within 180 days of appointment of a resolution professional by the NCLT, with provision for a further extension of 90 days totalling to 270 days, several matters are running behind the schedule.

""Although the 270-day deadline could not be met in a majority of the cases, the NCLTs and the NCLAT have largely delivered well-reasoned decisions. It is commendable since these tribunals are not just applying the settled law, but also interpreting new legislation such as the IBC,"" Tyagi said.

Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has appeared in some major IBC cases including of Essar Steel, said there is a shortage of staff and the government should appoint more judges.

""The NCLAT is managing well despite the odds. Judicially, they need many more members, at least double more. They are also hugely under-staffed. It's more quantity (that is required), but quality of staff also needs serious up-gradation,"" Singhvi said.

He also said the NCLAT premises are cramped and squeezed.

The senior lawyer said a huge workload is difficult to handle with such severe infrastructure problems and these issues must be addressed immediately by the government.

""There is no point in creating institutions and then crippling them,"" he added.

According to Srinivas, there are around 10,000 cases pending before the NCLT and the NCLAT at different stages and most of the new cases coming at these quasi-judicial forums are from the insolvency side.

""The government is focusing on these issues by increasing the number of members at NCLT and NCLAT. We would open more benches as per requirement and provide them more support in terns of trained staff, specially the young professionals and assistants, who would help the benches directly by doing research etc,"" Srinivas said.

He further said, ""We are putting a lot of emphasis on capacity building because these are all complex laws and new challenges keep coming. Whatever best capacity development can be done by holding seminars, conferences, all that has been done... We have tried to de-clog the NCLT.""

In 2017, the RBI had issued its first list of 12 companies defaulting on loan payments and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against them. Later, a second list was also issued and these matters are given a high priority in the NCLT hearings."

0,2019-01-04,UltraTech,"The Nifty 50 companies are expected to report moderation in topline growth for the third-quarter of FY19 on account of slowing momentum in some sectors and a stronger growth base in the previous year’s corresponding quarter. The growth may be faster in the fourth-quarter as the benefit of lower raw material costs to manufacturing companies is expected to reflect fully by then.

According to ETIG estimates, the aggregate revenue is likely to grow at an eight-quarter low of 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter compared with 13 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter.

Net profit will grow by 6.7 per cent, making it a third consecutive quarter of single-digit growth. Automobiles, cement, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and telecom companies may report subdued numbers, whereas private sector banks, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and information technology (IT) companies may show improvement.



“In the December 2018 quarter, we will see the impact of lower industrial metal prices. Crude prices also have fallen. This will help consumers of commodities and crude oil -based fuel and raw materials. The rupee depreciated by 9 per cent, which will affect importers and borrowers of foreign capital,” said Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities. Except tin, other metal prices have fallen by 14-26 per cent while the crude price has dropped by 24 per cent from the year-ago quarter.

The operating margin is expected to be marginally lower by 30 basis points (bps; 100 bps = 1 percentage point) to 20.5 per cent year-on-year.

Analysts believe that growth may resume in FY 20 as stability gradually sets in the banking sector thereby improving credit availability in the system. The street expects 18-28 per cent growth in the Nifty 50 earnings per share. “This will be facilitated largely by the turnaround in corporate banks’ profitability. However, performance of the other key sectors of oil and gas, and metals could depend on global growth conditions and domestic policies.”


Sector Trends

AUTOMOBILESSales volumes of the majority of listed auto companies either fell or grew in single-digits barring Bajaj Auto. Average discount level remained elevated amid dismal festive demand and mounting dealer inventory. This is likely to put further pressure on margins of auto companies.


BANKINGProvisioning requirement is expected to reduce as the rate of new bad loans reported by banks gradually abates. A lower yield on longterm government bonds should result in higher treasury income. These factors may support profit growth.


CAPITAL GOODSA sustained order flow from the government will support topline growth in the December quarter. Execution is picking up as companies have reduced the proportion of slow moving orders over the past few quarters.

The commentary by Larsen & Toubro, the country’s largest infrastructure company, will be keenly watched since the number of order wins that the company reported to the stock exchanges during the quarter was lower than expected.


CEMENTAll-India average cement price fell by nearly 2 per cent to Rs 308 per 50kg bag year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter. Intense competition has kept players away from raising prices even though demand has improved marginally across regions. Realisations therefore may remain under pressure despite lower raw material prices. Large-sized companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cement, Dalmia Bharat and Shree Cement are likely to post 10-15 per cent volume growth, but their revenue growth will be capped at 3-9 per cent.


FMCG PREVIEWFactors including the extent of festive demand and the effect of lower GST rates will be crucial for the FMCG sector. Rural demand, which has been a key growth driver for the past few quarters, may show signs of moderation. Flaring crude oil prices in the previous quarter will have a lag effect on the sector’s margins in the form of higher input costs. A drop in GST rates may offer some respite.


IT
A weaker rupee against the dollar will boost realisations of the IT exporters though the benefit will be marginally offset by unfavourable movement in other major currencies. The dollar-denominated growth may remain at 2-3 per cent quarter-on-quarter given a seasonally weak quarter.


METALSPrices of most commodities declined in the December quarter. Steel price declined nearly 15 per cent, a negative for players such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel. A drop in the aluminium price will affect Hindalco and Vedanta. Vedanta, which has an oil exploration division, would also be impacted due to the falling crude prices.


PHARMAPharma companies may report subdued performance given the headwinds in the US and the domestic markets. A deceleration in price erosion in the US generics market may offer some relief to pharma exporters. Investors would be keen on seeking clarification from Sun Pharma on corporate governance front."

2,2019-01-20,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Healthy macroeconomic numbers in terms of softer retail inflation and narrower trade deficit, along with improved global sentiment helped Indian equity benchmarks log decent gains last week. 

However, Dalal Street did witness bouts of choppiness during the week, as third quarter earnings failed to provide any decisive move to the market, and the weakness in rupee, following rise in global crude oil prices, continued to weigh on sentiment. 

Still, thanks to gains in select heavyweights, including Reliance Industries, headline index Sensex climbed about 377 points, or 1.05 per cent, to 36,386.60, while the NSE Nifty50 clocked a gain of 112 points, or 1.04 per cent, to 10,907, last week. 

Going into next week, corporate earnings, global sentiment, macro triggers and fund inflows will dictate market mood. 


Let's take a look at factors that will influence Dalal Street next week: 


Earnings pick up pace: Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Bharti Infratel, ITC, Ultratech Cement, YES Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are among companies that will report their December quarter earnings this week. 


Global sentiment: US stocks rose last week, giving a fillip to their global peers, amid buzz that Sino-US trade tussle may see an amicable resolution soon. However, the road to a trade deal looked bumpy. On Saturday, a Bloomberg report suggested that the Donald Trump administration is preparing an executive order that could significantly restrict Chinese state-owned telecom companies from operating in the US over national security concerns. Global markets would hope such a move does not jeopardise the prospects of a trade deal between the two countries. 


The Brexit saga: After facing a crushing defeat on her Brexit deal, British Prime Minister Theresa May will present her new deal before the lawmakers for their approval. But, experts are skeptical that her plan, which has just minor modifications, will be cleared easily. As per Reuters, markets now reckon the March 29 deadline of leaving the European Union will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organise a second referendum. Markets may have factored in the standoff on Brexit, the growing chaos may dent investor sentiment globally. 


China's GDP numbers: All eyes will be on China's fourth quarter GDP print as well as investment and retail sales for December. Weak factory output data and export data prompted China to announce fiscal stimulus measures. Now, another weak set of numbers may make investors run away from riskier equities, triggering a selloff in emerging markets. 


Crude's course: Oil prices are on an upward trajectory, underpinned by Opec-led supply cut. Opec on Friday issued a list of oil production cuts by its members and other major producers for six months starting on January 1 to boost confidence in its oil supply reduction pact, Reuters reported. If crude oil prices continue to rise, it will put pressure on the Indian currency, raising the risk of inflation. Market will certainly not take it lightly at a time when it is hoping a rate cut from the RBI in its next monetary policy meet just weeks away. 


Davos meet: The annual World Economic Forum in Davos is scheduled during January 22 to 25. Although experts are not expecting any major trigger for markets, it will surely remain in the limelight as trade dispute, Brexit and outlook on the global economy may heat up the Alpine meeting. However, the US President Donald Trump, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and British PM Theresa May will not be in Davos, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte will be there along with global political and business leaders and civil society figures to discuss the theme of this year's meet- the fourth industrial revolution. 


Technical outlook: The Nifty50 on Friday settled flat to form a small bearish candle on the daily chart. The index seems to be forming a multi-week Ending Diagonal, whose last leg is unfolding on the upside, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. 

“At this juncture, technical oscillators are looking mixed. Traders can retain their positive stance as long as Nifty sustains above the 10,800 level on a closing basis and look for a directional move to emerge on a close above 10,980 level,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."

Analysts in an ETNow poll had projected 40 per cent margins for the quarter under review. 


ICICI Bank ends lowerShares of ICICI Bank ended 0.72 per cent lower at Rs 365 amid reports that CBI has booked former ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon group MD Venugopal Dhoot in connection with alleged cheating and irregularities in loans sanctioned by the bank to the group in 2012. 


UltraTech falls on drop in Q3 profitUltraTech Cement on Thursday reported a 13.59 per cent drop in consolidated profit at Rs 394 crore for December quarter.

IndiGo flies 6% higherThe stock closed 6 per cent higher at Rs 1,174 as its Q3 profit crashed 75 per cent due to weak operating performance.

The Nifty50 index opened positive but failed to hold above 10,950 and drifted sharply towards the 10,756 level in the latter part of Friday’s session. It formed a Bearish Candle on the daily as well as weekly charts, which suggested supplies at higher levels.

As long as Nifty it holds below 10,850, it can slip towards 10,700 and then 10,650 levels, while a major hurdle is seen in the 10,880- 10,929 zone on the upside.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at strike price 10,800 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,900 levels. Meaningful Call writing was seen at 10,800 followed by 10,900 levels, while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. The option band signified a lower trading range between 10,700 and 10,900 levels.

India VIX moved up 1.49 per cent to 17.69. Volatility has to cool down below the 16 mark to get a decisive range breakout.

Bank Nifty broke its consolidation band in the 27,150-27,200 zone and extended its weakness towards the 27,050 level. It is making lower lows since last three sessions and formed a bearish candle on the daily as well as weekly charts.

10,2019-01-25,UltraTech,"YES Securities has a buy call on UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) with a target price of Rs 4,510.

The current market price of UltraTech Cement is Rs 3,705.15.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when UltraTech Cement price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage-
We expect overall cement demand in India to a slowdown in FY20E primarily led by the reduction in government-led infrastructure activities. Consequently, we estimate demand growth of 9.3 per cent/5.6 per cent/7.8 per cent during FY19/FY20/FY21 respectively for the industry (demand CAGR of 7.6 per cent over FY18-FY21E from 297 MT to 370 MT).

During the same period, we reckon UTCEM to deliver volume CAGR of 12.2 per cent led by acquisition and ramp up of new assets. However, we estimate pricing scenario to be subdued in the near future on account of slowing down in demand, influx of new capacities (to the tune of 64 MTPA over FY18-FY21E) and heightened the competitive intensity. Accordingly, we expect EBITDA CAGR of 9.2 per cent over FY18-FY21E.

UTCEM continues to be our top pick in the large-cap space as we believe it will be the biggest beneficiary of the next up-cycle on account of dominant capacity share (nearly 22 per cent by FY21E), strong brand presence, economies of scale and healthy balance sheet (net debt/equity of 0.41x by FY21E). We value UTCEM at EV/EBITDA of 16x and EV/tonne of $200 on FY21E and arrive at a target price of Rs 4,510 (+19 per cent upside). We have a 'Buy' rating on the stock."
12,2019-01-26,UltraTech,"The domestic equity market continued its whipsaw movement with a downward bias and shallow depth during the week gone by.

Secular sectors like FMCG have delivered good numbers, but cyclicals have disappointed the market.

Moreover, retail players have surprised everyone by delivering double-digit growth. Organised players have indeed gained at the cost of SMEs and MSMEs, which can be seen from their quarterly numbers.

This was also the vindication that GST and demonetisation have impacted a large population, which is also what is worrying the government since elections are around the corner. Hopefully, the Union Budget next week will assuage such concerns of the middle class. However, being a populist Budget, it might not be welcomed by the market given the effect it might have on corporate profitability. Nonetheless, all eyes will be on it for clarity on policy initiatives.

The political fever is hitting a high day after day, wherein economics has taken a back seat in all the decision-making processes of the government, which will further keep the market under pressure. In addition, very little has come out on the efforts to settle the trade dispute between the US and China, which has cast doubt on the resolution.


Events of the week
Uncertainty is at last over on YES Bank’s CEO issue with Ravneet Gill taking over the reins by March 1, 2019. This will not only provide stability to the lender’s share price, but will also be welcomed by market participants. Whenever such changes have occurred in the past, like in the case of Jubilant FoodWorks, SpiceJet, the market has always rewarded the stock and, hopefully, YES Bank too will get the same treatment.

On the earnings front, Asian Paints stole the show with a 14.6 per cent increase in PAT. Indigo reported a 75 per cent drop in bottomline. Ultratech Cement with a 15 per cent de-growth in PAT and ITC posting a mere 3.9 per cent growth in PAT disappointed!


Technical Outlook
After a failed attempt to move higher, Nifty50 has now given a bearish signal by penetrating the triangle on the lower side. The indecisiveness of past few weeks seems to have been resolved and it is expected that prices would head lower steadily. However, a break below the 10,650 on the Nifty50 would further confirm much lower prices with the 10,300 level on the Nifty being a possible scenario.

Sell on rise should be the strategy for traders. Individual shorts can be initiated on stocks that have slipped below their 100-day moving averages.

Agencies


Expectations for the Week
Mr Market is overcrowded with a lot of uncertainties given the global geo-political scenario, little clarity on the US-China trade settlement, EU slowdown, indecisiveness over BREXIT, US government shutdown and the domestic political conundrum, which will certainly scare away the bulls. Due to these uncertainties, the bulls are not going to commit money in a big way, which will keep the indices in the negative or sideways trading zone. Next week’s Interim Budget and, thereafter, the monetary policy will give provide further clarity to investors.

Currently, the market has taken a negative stance wherein the velocity is expected to remain muted. Investors should stay on the sidelines but keep money ready for deployment on any panic.

The Nifty50 closed the week 1.16 per cent lower at 10,870."

Technical analysts see stock-specific opportunities in the bearish market. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of seven stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over next 2-3 weeks.


Kunal Parar, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking

Tech Mahindra | Buy | Target price: Rs 793-810 | Stop loss: Rs 710
This stock has seen a breakout from the upper band of a symmetrical triangle formation on the daily charts. This may cause the stock to spurt from its current level. Moreover, the stock has been continuously trading with strong support from 200-day moving average (DMA), which shows that the long-term trend is upward. Daily momentum indicator RSI read 62.80 with a positive crossover, which signalled positive breadth on the counter.


UltraTech Cement | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,720-3,800 | Stop loss: Rs 3,330 
This stock has been trading with support from its upward rising trend line on the weekly chart, which suggests a likely bounceback on the counter. Daily momentum indicator RSI reading was at 33.10 with a positive crossover. Apart from this, the RSI has just come out of the overbought zone, which indicates a positive move on the counter.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher 

Hexaware Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 385 | Stop loss: Rs 315
This stock has been consolidating for some time in the Rs 310-330 range. It has seen a breakout above that range to signify strength and is showing immense potential to rise further in the coming days. The RSI has shown a trend reversal and given a buy signal to maintain the positive bias. “With good volume activity, we recommend a buy signal on this stock for an upside target of Rs 385, keeping a stop loss at Rs 315,” said Parekh.


Hindustan Unilever | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,930 | Stop loss: Rs 1,725
This stock has been sliding in recent times and it has seen a decent bounceback with a bullish positive candle to signify strength. It has the potential to rise further in the coming days. The chart looks attractive and with the RSI indicating a steep trend reversal to signal a buy, the bias has become positive. 


Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Angel Broking

Godfrey Phillips India | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,020 | Stop loss: Rs 903
The daily chart of this stock shows a series of ‘higher highs and higher lows.’ In the process, the stock finally broke out the trend line hurdle at Rs 930 with some authority. This move was supported by humongous volumes, providing credence to the price action. After this, the stock saw some consolidation but that could be seen as a good buying opportunity. 


Jubilant Foodworks | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,565 | Stop loss: Rs 1,212
After enjoying a good multi-year bull run, this stock slipped into the consolidation mode. Price action in past two days has been encouraging. Due to a massive bumpup on Friday, the stock finally seemed to have come out of the congestion zone. Its volume activity has risen substantially over the past three days, indicating the emergence of strong buying interest. “Considering this price and volume development, we expect the stock to resume its higher degree uptrend,” said Chavan. 


Titan Company | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,055| Stop loss: Rs 964
This stock has been one of the outperformers and is known for its steady performance. It has been enjoying a strong multiyear bull-run, started a decade ago. In between, all natural corrections in this stock were interpreted as good buying opportunities. The stock recovered sharply from recent lows and went on to clock fresh record highs. The daily chart looks extremely promising from a near-term perspective.

5,2019-02-08,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities suffered heavy losses on Friday, following weak trends in most global peers, as bleak economic data from Europe and lack of any sign of a resolution to the US-China trade tussle spooked investor sentiment. 

The European Commission on Thursday slashed its growth forecast for the euro zone this year and the next, stoking concerns that a global slowdown is spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grapple with trade friction, Reuters reported. 

“The market is reacting to global cues in the absence of any significant domestic trigger,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities. Besides, investors are taking extremely calculated steps ahead of the general elections. 

Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC, said there is wariness in the market about the general elections, which may cause some volatility in the short-term.

Tata Motors in deep painA record Rs 26,961 crore loss in December quarter triggered a sharp selloff in shares of Tata Motors. The scrip fell 29.45 per cent to hit a low of Rs 129 on NSE. On BSE, it fell 22.41 per cent to hit Rs 141.90. This was the second worst intra-day fall for the stock in its history. The scrip fell 40.50 per cent on February 2, 1993. However, the scrip pared some losses and closed 17.28 per cent down at Rs 151 on BSE. In a single day, the company lost Rs 9,124 crore on BSE to Rs 43,685 crore from Rs 52,809 crore on Thursday. 


Reliance ADAG group shares gainShares of Anil Ambani-led Reliance ADAG Group companies recovered after the recent drubbings. Reliance Capital (up 11.23 per cent), Reliance Power (up 9.55 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (up 6.54 per cent), Reliance Naval and Engineering (up 5.78 per cent) and Reliance Communications (up 4.82 per cent) closed with solid gains. In a media statement, Reliance ADAG group accused L&T and Edelweiss entities of ""illegal, motivated and wholly-unjustified actions"" in invoking share pledges of listed Reliance Group company and selling them in the open market causing a fall of nearly 55 per cent of Reliance Group shares over four days.


M&M falls after Q3Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) closed 2.64 per cent down at Rs 683 on BSE as the company reported a 60 per cent YoY jump in consolidated profit at Rs 1,476 crore. The stock fell as the company’s operating profit margin fell to 13.2 per cent from 14.7 per cent in the same quarter last year. 


Jet shares fall 5%Extending the losses into the second session in a row, shares of Jet Airways (India) closed 4.78 per cent down at Rs 225. The company on Friday said its board would meet on February 14 to approve the unaudited financial statements for the third quarter and nine months ended December 31. 


Britannia shares fall slowdown fearsShares of Britannia Industries fell 3.23 per cent to Rs 3,109 after it acknowledged a slowdown in the market place in recent months in a BSE filing. The company, however, expects that the steps taken in the Interim Budget to boost rural consumption would help it neutralise this slowdown. Global brokerage Macquarie has maintained an 'underperform' view on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,335 per share, highlighting that the domestic volume growth at nearly 7 per cent was below estimates.


Raymond jumps 5%After six days of successive fall, Raymond closed Friday's session 4.85 per cent higher at Rs 687.25 after it gave clarification about related party transactions. Shares of the company plunged the most in over two years on Thursday after media reported that it had “curious transactions” with an entity owned by its promoter. Later, the company said all of its related party transactions are undertaken in compliance with laws.


78 stocks signal potential riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 78 counters on the BSE. Among them were, Bharti Airtel, Rain Industries, Vivimed Labs, UltraTech Cement, Birla Cable and Parag Milk Foods. On the other hand, 56 stocks, including Tata Motors, Indian Oil Corporation, Mindtree, HDFC and Voltas showed bearish crossovers on BSE."
3,2019-02-08,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: After a gap of about six months, pricing power appears to be returning to India’s cement industry — at least in the key pockets of consumption. Interactions with dealers and analysts suggested that cement prices have risen in the South and East, with the former recording bigger gains.

In the South, prices per 50 kg bag have risen in the range of Rs 20-25, or about Rs 500 a tonne. In the East, in some areas, prices have risen by Rs 10-15 on a 50-kg cement bag.

Greater pricing power should favour manufacturers that have been recording either stagnant or declining operating profit or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) over the past three years. More importantly, if prices in these pockets were to sustain until mid-February, other regions may also report higher retailing rates.

In February this year, all-India average cement prices increased about 4.5 per cent to Rs 330 per 50 kg bag. Cement prices in the northern, western and central regions have been stable, in the range of Rs 290-350 per 50 kg bag.

Since late 2015, cement manufacturers have been following the strategy of garnering volumes to raise utilisation in an industry dogged by overcapacity. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data of eight core industries showed that cement output expanded 11 per cent in December last year.



In recent months, analysts point out that there has been a slight improvement in cement demand from the real estate sector. The housing sector generates about 65 per cent of cement demand, of which 35 per cent comes from rural housing and the remaining from the urban areas. Infrastructure and commercial segments form 35 per cent of cement demand.

The central government’s focus on low-cost housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana programme and other key infrastructure projects awarded through the roads and highway ministry should keep cement demand stable in the short run. Demand may rise further in the medium term, given the seasonality of the construction business.

Ramco Cements, Dalmia Bharat, Sagar Cements, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech Cement are expected to show better realisations in the coming quarters. Given these factors, analysts have raised their earnings estimates for these companies. According to Bloomberg, for FY20, these players are expected to see earnings growth in the range of 18-55 per cent."
4,2019-02-08,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: This bit will make it easy for you to forget the shock from Tata Motors.

At least 12 Nifty companies reported their highest quarterly profits this earnings season. They included Reliance Industries, TCS, Asian Paints, Titan, HDFC Bank and Bajaj twins Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv.

Most of them also reported highest-ever sales for a quarter. While not all of these companies are a outright ‘buy’ calls, analysts do fancy most of these counters, earnings reviews by analysts showed. 

This season Reliance Industries became the first private sector firm to report Rs 10,000 crore quarterly profit. The number of analysts recommending a ‘buy’ rating on the stock has jumped to 12 from nine a month ago, Reuters data showed. Analysts recommending a ‘sell’ rating on the scrip fell to two from four. The scrip has topped Nifty50 performance chart, rising 17 per cent in last one month.

RIL’s consolidated profit for the quarter stood at Rs 10,251 crore, beating Street estimate by 7.7 per cent. Sales were highest ever at Rs 1.71 lakh crore.

At FY20 PE multiple of 13.6 times, the scrip looks attractive, says YES Securities.

“RIL is our top pick in the oil & gas space, as we see benefits from refinery-petchem integration playing out in a tough macro environment and RJio and retail scaling up operations,” IIFL Institutional Equities said in a note.

Analysts are painting a rosy picture for Asian Paints too.

The number of brokerages recommending ‘outperform’ rating on the stock has jumped to 15 from 12 a month ago. The company’s record profits and sales were fuelled by nearly 20 per cent volume growth, which was the highest the company has witnessed since FY11.

“Though near-term headwind in the form of general elections could pose a challenge, Asian Paints’ long-term theme of market shift from unorganised to organised hands and premiumisation remain intact,” Reliance Securities said.

Bajaj Finance managed to impress Street with a 54 per cent jump in quarterly profit. JM Financial said the NBFC is well-positioned to deliver sustainable profit growth driven by strong customer acquisition, increasing rural footprint with diversified product offering, rising contribution of fee income, superior asset quality and a well-capitalised CAR of 21 per cent. 

Analysts have showed faith in ITC, as the scrip has slipped 2 per cent in last one month. Citi says Dalal Street may be missing the point that the margin lever for a business is price, and not volumes. Cigarette volume recovery builds the base for price hikes, they said, adding that the company’s diversification drive will pay off soon.

“High cash generation has enabled ITC to invest aggressively in other fast-growing businesses, enabling it to diversify into other, non-stringent segments. We expect revenues and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 10.2 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, in FY18-21E,” said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. 


Others
Tata Group firm Titan is another stock analysts are positive on. This jewellery maker has given guidance for 22 per cent growth in jewellery business in FY19. The number of brokerages recommending an outperform rating on the stock has increased to 17 from 14 a month ago. Calls recommending a hold rating on the stock have fallen to 3 from 5.

Brokerages are not that bullish on another Tata Group firm, TCS.

December quarter sales and profit of India’s most-valued listed firm came in at Rs 37,338 crore and Rs 8,121 crore, respectively. The target price for the stock has been cut by up to 16 per cent, as the software major’s margins failed to cheer investors despite record sales and profit.


Also Read: Brokerages slash TCS target price by up to 16%

Another IT firm Wipro has seen brokerages raise price targets on higher-than-expected margin growth in December quarter. But increased price targets are not enough to trigger ‘buy’ calls. Most brokerages have either retained ‘sell’ or ‘neutral’ rating on the stock due to muted guidance for fourth quarter, as growth continues to lag peers.

The numbers of analysts giving buy ratings on the stock has fallen to one from two a month ago, while analysts with ‘hold’ ratings has jumped to 17 from 15 and those with ‘underperform’ rating have risen to 10 from 9.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid and HDFC Bank are a few other companies which have reported record profits.

Among the Nifty constituents, Maruti Suzuki, Ultratech Cement, YES Bank, SBI, IOC, Bharti Airtel and NTPC missed our PAT estimates, while L&T, Axis Bank, ITC, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech exceeded our projections, Motilal Oswal said in a report."

With only a few months left for the general elections, the Modi government has expectedly announced some measures to provide relief to distressed farmers and individual taxpayers in the recent Interim Budget.

Budgetary allocations were also announced for farmers, the middle class and small and medium enterprises, and they are expected to boost consumption and investor sentiments.

RBI's recent surprise decision to cut interest rates by 25 bps is a pre-election stimulus gift from the central bank for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. With the general elections scheduled for May amid a host of global factors, there could be heightened volatility in the market. As history repeats itself, the stock market always favours a stable government and good economic reforms.

At present, investors are factoring in a BJP win in the 2019 general elections. If the outcome is in the favour of the BJP, this is likely to push the market higher. The basic growth drivers of the Indian economy will always remain in the limelight no matter which government comes to power. 

Also, global cues will continue to impact the Indian stock market, before and after the elections. As global volatility and the fact that India gets a reasonable part of foreign flows as part of emerging economies, a decisive government at the Centre would boost further flows.

The pre-election phase seems to be creating an opportunity to create wealth. At this juncture, investors should use this chance to build a solid portfolio of quality stocks that have attractive valuation and bright fundamentals for the long term. Largecap stocks are better placed than midcap and smallcap stocks to fare relatively better in times of volatility. Largecap stocks may help investors create wealth without taking extra risks or exposing themselves to volatility. 

Sectors such as infrastructure, cement, automobile, capital goods, FMCG and other sectors will remain key focus of the government, no matter which party forms government at the Centre. On the earnings front, growth estimate for FY 2019-20 remains positive on the back of an expected recovery in corporate banks’ profitability and a revival in the investment cycle.

The crisis in NBFC companies should boost profitability of corporate banks in the near term. Long-term investors can look at stocks like Reliance industries, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, L&T, HUL, M&M, Bajaj-Auto, UltraTech Cement and UPL."
7,2019-02-11,UltraTech,"Edelweiss Securities has a buy call on Grasim Industries with a target price of Rs 988.

The current market price of Grasim Industries is Rs 710.80.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Grasim Industries price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage: Grasim Industries’ standalone Q3FY19 EBITDA impressed yet again rising 18 per cent YoY (being 11 per cent ahead of estimates). While VSF performance is in line, the chemicals and textile segments led the overall outperformance. Factoring in 9MFY19 and Grasim’s proven ability to withstand global headwinds, we see no major risks to our FY19 and FY20 estimates. Besides, we are introducing FY21E with EBITDA growth of 8 per cent. While the overhang of capital allocation to group companies – Vodafone Idea (Idea) and Aditya Birla Capital (ABCL) – remains, we retain ‘BUY/SP’ on Grasim given : (1) 60.3 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement exceeds its current market cap (therefore a value play), and (2) sanguine outlook for the SA entity over medium to long term. Factoring in the recent cuts in target prices of key holdings and rolling over the valuation to Q1FY21E, we are tweaking down our SOTP based target price to Rs 988 (from Rs 1,066)."
8,2019-02-15,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Shares of most sugar producing companies were trading with gains in Friday's session after the government on Thursday hiked the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar by Rs 2 per kg to Rs 31 to help millers clear farmers' dues.

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

India VIX moves up sharply by 10.45 per cent to 18.90 level. A sudden spike in VIX has caused a pause in the positive momentum and VIX has to cool down below 16-15 levels to get a smooth ride in the market.

Bank Nifty remained highly volatile throughout the session, as it traded in a wider range between 26,700 and 27,200 levels. It formed a bearish engulfing candle on the daily scale, as there was selling pressure at higher levels. It has been stuck between 26,666 and 27,200 levels since last 11 sessions. Now it requires a decisive range breakout from the current trading band to commence fresh momentum.

On an immediate basis, the index has to hold above 26,850 to witness an upward move towards 27,000 and then 27,150 levels while on the downside major support exists at 26,666 level.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.24 per cent at 10,802 level. Long buildup was seen in TCS, Ultratech Cement, NTPC and M&M Finance while shorts were seen in HUL, Bharti Infratel, Titan and BPCL.

0,2019-03-01,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: When there is renewed interest in the stock of a sector leader, it is an indication of improving fundamentals in that sector.

This is exactly the case with India’s largest cement manufacturer by capacity, UltraTech Cement. In the three years through this January, the stock had underperformed the Nifty50 index. In the past one month, however, the trajectory has changed and it gained 12.6 per cent against a 1.2 per cent rise in the Nifty.

This new interest in UltraTech can be attributed to three main factors: improving prices, gains from the assets it acquired in the recent past and cost savings.



After a long time, cement manufacturers have not only been able to increase prices, but also sustain it. This is a favourable sign as analysts believe the industry is entering a demand cycle wherein manufacturers would be able see improvement in price realisations at improved utilisation levels. This should boost their operating profit (EBITDA) per tonne in the coming quarters.

In light of these facts, and post-acquisition of key cement assets, UltraTech’s operations are geared to make the most of the improving cement prices and stable demand from infrastructurerelated and slightly improved construction activities in real estate (largely low-cost housing). In a recent communication with analysts, the company’s management presented information about its acquired cement assets and cost-savings measures.

The company said its subsidiary, Ultratech Nathdwara (erstwhile Binani Cement with a capacity of 6.25 mt, which it acquired in November last year) has shown improvement in realisations and capacity utilisations. The unit’s realisation since the acquisition has improved to Rs 600 per tonne from Rs 100 and utilisation to 60 per cent from 50 per cent. This is largely because of the rebranding of Binani Cements’ assets.

UltraTech is likely to fully integrate another asset it acquired, Century Cement (14.6 MT), by the first quarter of FY20. At present, there is a gap Rs 10-15 per kg between the cement price of Century Cement and UltraTech. The company has stated that the EBITDA per tonne generated by Century’s asset was likely to improve by Rs 300-400 per tonne from Rs 367 when UltraTech acquired it. Also, the fall in crude oil prices should boost savings for Ultra-Tech that operates multi-fuel plants. In all, the company is expected to save cost by Rs 60-70 per tonne. In times when demand is improving and price hikes are sustaining, the improved performance of its acquired assets and cost savings should boost UltratTech’s earnings.

Analysts estimate UltraTech's EBIDTA per tonne to improve to Rs 940 by the end of FY20 from the estimated Rs 870 this fiscal year. On a one-year forward basis, the stock is trading at an EV/EBIDTA of 14.7, which is a 1.5 per cent discount to its five-year average."
1,2019-03-10,UltraTech,"The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has said that it did not find any contradiction in approvals of resolution for Essar Steel and Binani Cement in the context of ""value maximisation"".

The Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NLCT) has approved the ArcelorMittal's Rs 42,000 crore resolution plan, rejecting the Ruias settlement offer of Rs 54,389 crore.

Recently, in the case of Binani Cement, the Kolkata bench of NCLT approved the resolution plan of UltraTech Cement which was higher than what the Dalmia Bharat group had to offer even after the Committee of Creditors (CoC) earlier selected them as the higher bidder.

The case debated a lot on value maximisation in a corporate resolution plan.

""In Binani, the one which was approved was within the rules. The one which was rejected was because it was not balancing the interest of the stakeholders,"" IBBI chairman M S Sahoo told PTI when asked about resolutions of Essar Steel and Binani Cement.

""Value maximisation is the assets of the debtor and not of the creditor. This is not a recovery by finance institutes but value maximisation is for the corporate debtor,"" he said.

If the CoC has approved ""within the process"", then it is valid for both Binani as well as ArcelorMittal.

The Committee of Creditors (CoC) is supreme in commercial matters but that supremacy has to be within the framework of law, he pointed out.

""We continue to believe that our settlement proposal of Rs 54,389 crore is the most compelling one available to Essar Steel creditors and fulfills the IBCs declared overriding objective of value maximisation, which has been established time and again by courts at all levels,"" Essar said in their reaction after the NCLT approval.

""EXIM Bank decided to pursue the case before the adjudicating authority, with a prayer for equitable and fair treatment to all, while maximising the value detected ...We are happy that the judgement has agreed with the basic tenets of our stand and cemented a new perspective to the IBC,"" a senior Exim Bank official had commented."

7,2019-03-18,UltraTech,"Once again, Grasim Industries’ quarterly results surpassed market expectations. The company’s standalone revenue and net profit for the third quarter zoomed 21% and 28%, respectively, year-on-year (y-o-y). Though there was a small fall in the margin of its viscose staple fibre (VSF) segment, it was offset by the steady performance of its caustic soda segment and the recovery in its textile segment.

Along with its group companies, Grasim enjoys a 17% share in the global VSF market. To strengthen its position further, Grasim is now looking to expand its capacity by 50%. Since domestic and global VSF demand continues to be robust, this capacity expansion should play out in Grasim’s favour. The company’s VSF monopoly in India, slower capacity additions by other global VSF majors due to environmental concerns, better margins due to backward integration, introduction of value-added VSF products, etc., are the other factors in favour of Grasim. 

The company is also increasing the capacity of its chemicals segment. This is a step towards strengthening backward integration because Grasim’s VSF segment is a major consumer of caustic soda. The capacity expansion in the VSF and chemical segments will involve an outlay of around Rs 7,600 crore over the next three years. But it will not lead to any financial stress for Grasim because all its three segments have been generating free cash flows.


Analysts’ views 
Hold 2
Buy 12

In addition to its standalone businesses, the company’s subsidiaries have also been doing well. For instance, its Ultratech Cements—Grasim holds 60.3% in it—and Aditya Birla Capital—Grasim stake is 56%—continue to do well. With most cement companies increasing prices by `25-50 per 50 kg bag in recent months, cement companies are expected to report better numbers in the coming quarters. The concerns about Grasim’s loss-making subsidiary, Idea, have also been allayed due to its recent merger with Vodafone— the merger has restricted Grasim’s stake in Idea to 11.55%. As its standalone business as well as subsidiaries are doing well, analysts feel that the holding company discount, of around 45%, particularly considering the performance of its standalone business, is not justified.

This discount is likely to come down in the coming years. The deep cut in valuation in the past year was because of capital allocation concerns with respect to Idea. But, as Grasim’s holding in the merged entity, Vodafone-Idea, is just 11.55%, any infusion of capital will now be in proportion to Grasim’s reduced take and won’t bring its balance sheet under stress.

9,2019-03-19,UltraTech,"The promoters of Mindtree are in a desperate huddle, trying to retain the control of their firm from L&T that is pushing for a hostile bid. They have termed the move as a “grave threat” to the company's future.

L&T's ambition is backed by money; there is not much that can stop the firm eyeing a scale that it has long desired. 

For the founders of the Bengaluru-based firm, who hold about 13% of the company, there are fewer options. Two decades ago, L&T, the aggressor now, was in a similar spot. 

A M Naik, the non-executive chairman of the country's largest construction and engineering firm, thwarted hostile takeover bids from the Ambanis and Birlas in early 2000s when the company had almost slipped from his hands, a situation Mindtree sees itself in now.

In 1987, the late Dhirubhai Ambani had managed to wrest significant holding in the cash-rich L&T and then launched a hostile takeover bid in 1989.

However, political and other developments ensured Reliance remained a passive shareholder. Naik, who joined L&T as a junior engineer in the mid- 1960s and went on to become its Chairman, later recalled in a book the events leading up to Reliance's stake sale.

In November 2001, when Naik, then CEO and Managing Director, who was in Chicago, got a call from Mohan Karnani, then president of L&T cement business saying 'apna maalik badal gaya hai' (our owner has changed) and that the Birlas had bought complete stake of Reliance Industries in L&T in an all-cash deal.

""Within few minutes got another call from Anil Ambani, the then managing director of RIL, saying 'Anilbhai (Naik) you never wanted us. So we are going. We have sold the entire shareholding of Reliance in L&T to Kumar Mangalam Birla',"" the book quotes Naik as saying.

Naik recalled that he got another call, this time from Birla, who said ""you didn't come to us Naikji. So we have come to you.""

The mild-mannered Naik staved off Birlas entry into the company, pushing the case that firm should be allowed to retain its professional status. Known for his business acumen, he quickly drummed up support from political as well as institutional leaders to back his case. 

After months of haggling, Birla gave in, selling the stake to a trust run by L&T’s employees in June 2003. Birla got L&T’s cement division in the bargain, which we now know as UltraTech Cement.

""In the end we kept L&T independent. We ringfenced it from future takeover attempts by setting up the L&T employees welfare foundation that eventually bought Birlas stake. And the Birlas got our demerged cement business that added to their cement production capacity.""

This was to be Naik’s biggest contribution, turning the attentions of a hitherto pure engineering company oblivious to market realities, towards ways and means of protecting its independent status. 

""It relieved us of a non-core asset-heavy business, making us an AAA rated company by drastically cutting out debt equity ratio. It was a win-win for all,"" Naik said in the book.

""What seemingly started as a conflict situation with Grasim ended in a win-win solution for both the companies. Grasim became the largest and top quality cement producer and L&T emerged as one of the best engineering, manufacturing and projects company in this part of the world.

""A great moment of satisfaction came when, at the end, Mr Birla extended his hand to me and said, 'history should never, never forget you. You know what you have achieved: employee ownership of the company',"" Naik remembered."

11,2019-03-30,UltraTech,"The surprise is, not just private banks, but also most PSU lenders are doing pretty well, according to Kunal Bothra, a veteran market analyst. He also laid bare two stock plays for the next week during an interview with ETNow. Edited excerpts:

What will be your sense of this rally, especially the Bank Nifty and the way it has moved?

Yes, the Bank Nifty was one of the key reasons why you saw such a sharp move on the Nifty. It was primarily led by not just private banks which have been doing pretty well, but also most PSU lenders, which came as a very strong and positive surprise to the market. It is not just a feeble rally. 

Earlier, we were talking of PSU banks as one of the key sectors that tend to give you a rally of 8-10 per cent, but those rallies get sold into quite viciously and easily and these stocks make a new low. 

Now it is not the case in point, you now see these stocks trying to make or rather break the previous swing high, which still indicate that there is a new trend or pattern in the making for PSU banking names. 

Overall, I believe going forward, for the next week and series, you should see most sectors participating. The underperformers should try and play a catch-up in terms of sectoral participation. So, 11,500-11,400 is a strong support on the Nifty at least for the next week.


Anything interesting, first within the PSU banking space?

Yes. Two stocks should stand out in the PSU banking names at least in the chart pattern. I was looking at them. The midcap one is Union Bank. The stock is if I am not wrong trading around this 95-96 range. 

In the last two months, we have seen a recovery from 60 to 95 for the stock. That is, 50-60 per cent odd gains from those levels, but I strongly believe that with the kind of volume patterns in the last two months, the way the rally shaped up, Union Bank could be poised for much higher levels even as a medium term investment play.

If you are a short-term trader, you could look at 102-105 target, which I have been highlighting earlier on the channel and as a positional play you could look at even a possibility of 115-120 for Union Bank. 

SBI is coming out of a 10-year sideways range in 2009-19. Approximately, it is coming out of a big sideways range. This level of 320 breakout on SBI should take the stock to a new range altogether. That also remains a strong candidate for solid upside from the current levels.


What is your view as far as DLF is concerned? It did a QIP. Do you think real estate as a sector and within that, some of these favourites of the earlier bull run could be interesting names?

There should be new candidates for strong upside. Yes, DLF is one of them, more so because of its presence in F&O space and the volume surge.

The kind of news flow the stock has seen indicates that it could now be a good one to look at from an investment horizon. When you see such high-beta sectors, one or two candidates look fundamentally good and technically poised very well.

It generally garners more investor interest and DLF could be a candidate. What could probably transpire is that the beta might reduce, the volatility might reduce for DLF. You might see a stable uptrend shaping up.

When I look at the midcap space in the real estate pack, especially the non-F&O ones, one of the other charts that stands out very strongly is Sobha Developers. That stock is also poised for a very strong upside.

A couple of chart indicators on the longer term horizons indicate that the stock could be even poised for another 40-50 per cent upside, given the next one to two years. Sobha Developers could be the other stock from the midcap real estate space.


Any ideas interesting for our viewers next week?

Two ideas. One of them is SBI as we were discussing earlier. The PSU banking index looks extremely strong and there are a couple of candidates which should continue to move up higher. 

SBI seems to be one of them, the stock is at a multi-quarter high on a closing basis. You know the volumes in the last few days of this price upmove have been extremely strong and that itself indicates that the stock should be poised for much higher returns. 

As a positional play, SBI could be a decent bet, with 340 approximately as a target range and stop loss at 310. 

The other stock is a buy on UltraTech Cement. We have seen the stock charging up a couple of weeks ago with those 3,500 to 4000 levels. Then the stock consolidated and now it is trying to make a good comeback. 

So, UltraTech Cement could be a good buy, with target of 4,140 and stop loss at 3,900."

6,2019-04-04,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: A 25 basis points rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India failed to li ft the gloom that has set in on Dalal Street following weather forecaster Skymet’s projection of a below normal monsoon.

RBI’s downward revision in FY20 GDP growth estimate to 7.2 per cent further weighed on sentiment. 

“The rate cut was already factored in. What disappointed the market slightly was the status quo on policy stance. The market was expecting it to be changed to accommodative from neutral,"" said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities.

Rupee's plunge against the dollar also spooked investors. Around 4 pm, the domestic unit traded 62 paise down at 69.05 to the US dollar.

7,2019-04-05,UltraTech,"Mumbai: Nifty 50 companies may report a spike in March quarter net profit — the highest in two years. However, the aggregate topline growth of the Nifty 50 companies for the period is expected to be in single digits for the first time in at least nine quarters following a sluggish demand scenario.Net profit is seen rising faster on account of a lower base and exceptional costs in the case of some companies in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, the sample’s revenue is expected to grow 7.6 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of FY19. This compares with a robust 22.1 per cent growth in the December 2018 quarter and 15.1 per cent increase in the March 2018 quarter. Net profit is likely to grow by 32.2 per cent, the sharpest jump since the March 2017 quarter when it grew 44.8 per cent. In the preceding quarter, aggregate profit had fallen significantly by 24.6 per cent due to the sharp loss reported by Tata Motors, which took a $4 billion write down on account of its Jaguar Land Rover unit.

‘Pick-up in Growth Expected’

“Revenue growth on a year-on year basis may be slow compared to the previous three quarters as the base prices of most commodities had grown in Q4 of last year,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.

The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by a sharp 181 per cent largely driven by Coal India. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported higher employee benefit expenses due to revised pay for executives. This had reduced operating profit, thereby creating a low base.

Higher operating profit will likely expand the sample’s aggregate operating margin to 18.9 per cent for the March quarter from 7.2 per cent a year ago.

While the demand scenario looks dull, growth is expected to resume gradually in the coming quarters following the general election that will be held between April 11 and May 19 with counting on May 23.

“Liquidity squeeze is now slowly easing and hence the growth momentum could gradually pick up,” Jasani said. “Monsoon predictions (including that of El Nino developing) will be closely tracked. US-China trade negotiations and the general global growth slowdown fear could impact sectors and companies focussed on global trade.”

Sector Performance

Automobiles

Record high inventory at dealers and moderation in demand are likely to dent earnings growth. Tata Motors is likely to remain affected due to pressure on volumes at JLR.

Banks

Barring bad loan news related to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), the pace of slippages or identification of new nonperforming assets is expected to slow down further in the March quarter. Top private banks with greater exposure to corporate lending such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are expected to report better numbers. Net interest margins are likely to be under pressure given the liquidity crunch.

Capital Goods

Orders from state governments and public sector enterprises will support order inflow growth. Larsen & Toubro is expected to meet order inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent for FY19 following orders from heavy civil infrastructure and water and effluent treatment.

Cement

In the March quarter, all-India average cement prices rose 4 per cent to Rs 334 per 50 kg bag. The southern and eastern regions have shown an improvement in prices. Large companies such as ACC, Ambuja Cements, UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to report volume growth of 15-20 per cent year-on-year and revenue expansion of 15-17 per cent. Given benign raw material prices, net profit is likely to grow at a faster 20-35 per cent.

Consumer

March quarter results are likely to be impacted by moderation in demand amidst increased competitive intensity. Advertising expenditure may increase but will be offset by lower raw material prices. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post a resilient performance. Higher product prices may support ITC’s profitability.

Information Technology

Seasonal weakness amid unfavourable currency movements are likely to affect the performance of IT companies. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies are expected to report 1.5-2.5 per cent growth in dollar-denominated revenues. An indication from company managements on budget spending by clients will be crucial in determining demand trend for FY20.

Metals

A weaker rupee provided comfort to most domestic commodity companies as it made them more competitive. Realisations will also be higher as prices are in dollars. After a fall in the latter part of 2018, commodity prices, including those of steel, aluminium and copper, either stabilised or bounced back. The domestic steel companies raised prices thrice in the March quarter, leading to a 7-8 per cent price increase. This will support profit growth.

Pharmaceuticals

In the March quarter, pharmaceutical companies are likely to continue the improvement in performance seen in the preceding quarter. The receding headwinds in the US generics market are likely to support the performance of companies. Sun, Aurobindo and Cipla are expected to register better performance while Lupin is likely to underperform."

His affidavit, filed with the Election Commission of India (ECI) as part of his nomination papers for the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat, shows Amit Anil Chandra Shah held listed shares worth Rs 17.56 crore as of March 22, 2019.

Unlike his opponent though, Rahul Gandhi, president of the Congress Party, has equity exposure mainly through mutual funds. His affidavit for the Wayanad constituency shows his investments are in mutual funds only instead of directly holding stocks.

Shah also has exposure to Rs 3.08 lakh worth of unlisted shares. His wife holds listed shares worth Rs 4.35 crore and unlisted shares worth Rs 1.58 lakh. Overall his net worth stands at Rs 30.49 crore while his wife Sonalben Shah has assets worth Rs 8.35 crore. 

Shah has a widely diversified stock portfolio comprising mostly midcap stocks, though he also has substantial exposure to largecap plays like SBI, TCS, RIL, Tata Motors, Nestle, L&T, Maruti, Hindalco, ITC, HUL and many others. His wife’s stock portfolio is equally diversified, comprising many stocks common with her husband with very few new names.

Amit Shah’s portfolio does not include any shares of the Adani Group companies. He owns just over Rs 1 lakh worth of shares in Reliance Communications, Reliance Capital, Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Infrastructure, companies owned by Anil Ambani.

Rahul Gandhi has investments worth Rs 5.19 crore in 10 mutual fund schemes.

Among other movable assets, Gandhi has Rs 40,000 in cash, Rs 17.93 lakh in bank savings, Rs 39.89 lakh investments in financial instruments and Rs 2.91 lakh worth of jewellery, taking the total worth of his movable assets to Rs 5.80 crore. His immovable assets are worth Rs 10.08 crore and liabilities amounted to Rs 72.1 lakh."

In the short term, the Nifty is in a bull grip, and bears may make a comback only if the index falls below 11,550, say technical analysts who expect the index to touch 12,000 if it sustains above 11,750. TVS Motor, Maruti, UltraTech Cement, HDFC, RIL, ACC and M&M are the stocks they recommend for the short term.


When will the Nifty Hit 12,000? On monthly and quarterly charts, the index is trending upwards forming a series of higher-top and higher-bottom formation which signals a sustained uptrend across time frames. For FY20, we continue to maintain our bullish stance with an upside range of 11,850-12,200 levels. On the downside, 11230-11000 are key support levels and any significant correction towards them will remain as investment opportunity. We expect the Nifty to touch 12,000 on or before June 2019.


Where Nifty is headed ahead of elections: On the weekly chart, the Nifty has formed a long-legged Doji Candle, which indicates indecisiveness amongst participants. The crucial resistance is placed around 11,750-11760; if it crosses these levels, the index may witness new all-time high levels in the coming week. The chart pattern suggests that If the Nifty crosses and sustains above 11,750, it would witness buying which would take the index towards 11,800-11,850 levels. However, if it breaks below 11,600, it is likely to hurtle towards 11500.


Stocks to play during the elections: We expect banking, NBFC, metal and cement Stocks to perform well in the coming weeks. Stocks such as RBL Bank, HDFC Bank, Pidilit Industries, Tata Steel, SAIL, Muthoot Finance, HDFC, Ultratech Cement, India Cement and Reliance are expected to show bullishness in the coming weeks."

15,2019-04-21,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty put up a good show last week, as both the key indices logged gains of nearly 1 per cent on rally in select heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, TCS and Tata Motors.

Sensex and Nifty set fresh records at 39,487.45 and 11,856.15, respectively, during the week gone by, which saw fourth quarter earnings, FPI inflows and global sentiment setting the tone for the market.

The coming week has F&O expiry and fourth quarter numbers of some of the heavyweights that may infuse some volatility into the market and some knee-jerk reactions as well are expected due to the ongoing results. 


Here is a look at key factors that can sway the market through the coming week: 


F&O expiry: The market may experience bouts of volatility as the March series of futures and options contracts expire on Thursday and participants will roll over their positions to the April series.


Q4 earnings: The fourth quarter earnings will catch all eyes as the next week will see earnings of ACC, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bharti Infratel, UltraTech Cement, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp and YES Bank among others. If they come out with better numbers and positive outlook for the future, the market may see itself scaling new highs. 


Political landscape: Experts say political vibes may keep market under pressure till election results are out on May 23. ""Markets are expected to remain subdued and under pressure at least till the election season is over,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote. Even though there is a broader belief that Narendra Modi-led NDA will come back to power, the undercurrent of uncertainty over election outcome may keep the market slightly subdued. 


FPI inflow: Flow of foreign portfolio investments will remain an important factor for the market. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained net buyers in the market, putting in Rs 1,038.46 crore on Thursday, NSE data showed. In April so far, FPIs have pumped in Rs 13,006 crore, data available with NSDL showed. 


Rupee's health: The Indian rupee on Thursday staged a strong comeback by gaining 25 paise to 69.35 against the US dollar after three sessions of losses amid sustained foreign fund inflows. The domestic unit declined by 18 paise on a weekly basis. A stable rupee will give investors some comfort at a time when several factors are indicating at volatile sessions ahead.


Global sentiment: The quarterly earnings of the US companies will be in focus too. Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com are to report their first-quarter numbers in the coming week which will catch the attention of markets across the globe.


BoJ monetary policy meet: The Bank of Japan (BoJ) will announce interest rate decision on Thursday. As per Reuters, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its pledge to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1 per cent and long-term yields around zero under a policy dubbed yield curve control. It is also expected to forecast that inflation will remain below its target through the fiscal year that ends in March 2022. 


Technical barometer: The Nifty broke crucial support around the 11,760 level on Thursday, but somehow extended its higher-high higher low formation for the fourth straight session. The bulls looked exhausted after the recent rise, said analysts, who feel the index needs to hold above 11,700 to buck the weakening trend. Going ahead, if Nifty trades below 11,738 and closes below 11,700, it may result in the failure of the recent breakout, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."
16,2019-04-23,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Uttam Value Steel with over 0.28 crore shares changing hands was leading among the most traded stocks on NSE on Tuesday.

Shares of PC Jeweller (number of shares traded: 0.20 crore), Jet Airways (number of shares traded: 0.16 crore), Reliance Power (number of shares traded: 0.10 crore), YES Bank (number of shares traded: 0.10 crore), Suzlon Energy (number of shares traded: 0.10 crore), Reliance Capital (number of shares traded: 0.07 crore), South Indian Bank (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore), Raj Rayon (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore) and JP Associates (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore) also featured among the most traded stocks on the NSE.

The NSE Nifty index was trading 6.50 points up at 11,600.95 while the BSE Sensex was up 39.81 points at 38,684.99 around 09:17 am. 

In the Nifty index, Bharti Airtel (up 18.67 per cent), Zee Entertainment Enterprises (up 1.75 per cent), Bharti Infratel (up 0.70 per cent), UltraTech Cement (up 0.66 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 0.55 per cent) were among the top gainers.

17,2019-04-23,UltraTech,"Deutsche Bank has raised earnings per share estimates for cement companies under its coverage by 3-14% on assumption of better all-India pricing growth. 

The bank said Indian cement prices have been strong having gained 10% so far this year as industry cost leaders have lowered the competitive intensity and attempted to improve profitability after a weak calendar year 2018. Deutsche has raised its all-India pricing growth assumption by 6% year-on-year for the ongoing financial year from 4%, and has estimated that more upgrades are likely on the Street as improving realization trends are factored in.

Deutsche Bank has retained its buy call on ACC and raised target price to Rs 1,830 from Rs 1,790, and lifted target price to Rs 21,600 from Rs 19,330 on Shree Cement. 

The bank has raised target price on Ambuja Cement to Rs 235 from Rs 230 and increased UltraTech Cement target price to Rs 4,575 from Rs 4,240. 

Deutsche has raised target price on Ramco Cements to Rs 790 from Rs 785. 

Shares of these companies ended mixed in a subdued market on Tuesday. Shree Cement, UltraTech and Ramco ended down 0.2-0.6%, that of ACC and Ambuja ended up 0.3% and 0.1% respectively. 

While the bank has buy ratings on all these companies, ACC and Shree Cement are its top picks in the cement space. 
However, Deutsche sees demand growth moderating and believes monsoon will hold the key for recovery in demand. 
""Demand growth across most parts of the country has eased from the heightened double-digit levels seen in CY18, with channel members indicating demand has tapered to around 6-7% in recent months and is likely to be below 5% in April. 
They indicated a combination of election activity and low water tables have impacted volumes,"" said Deutsche. 

The India Meteorological Department has predicted a near normal monsoon this year at 96% of long period average while private forecaster has estimated that monsoon will be below normal at 93%."
27,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty broke their losing streak of three successive sessions with robust gains on Wednesday, thanks to heightened buying across sectors during the second half.

Analysts were not surprised. “This was expected. We were anticipating a sharp swing on either side ahead of Thursday’s F&O expiry,"" said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

Nirav Chheda, derivatives & technical analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities, attributed it to a positive undercurrent in the market. “The market undercurrent is positive. The losses of last three sessions were because of a rising VIX owing to election-related jitters. Now, the volatility has eased and the market played to the tunes of its underlying positive sentiment,"" he said.

That said, the market is likely to remain choppy till the election results are out, he added. 


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Wednesday's session:

Investors richer by Rs 1.42 lakh croreWednesday's gains shot up the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,53,17,138.47 crore from Rs 1,51,74,915.17 crore on Tuesday, making investors richer by Rs 1.42 lakh crore in a single day.


Stocks that saw spurt in OIWith a 71.28 per cent change, UltraTech Cement led the stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest (OI). It was followed by Siemens (59.64 per cent), Equitas Holdings (54.31 per cent), ONGC (51.81 per cent) and Power Grid Corporation (50.58 per cent). 


UltraTech logs healthy gainsAfter three consecutive sessions of losses, shares of UltraTech Cement closed 5.51 per cent higher at Rs 4,435.45 after its standalone profit for March quarter more than doubled to Rs 1,017 crore from Rs 488 crore a year ago. Standalone net sales jumped 18 per cent YoY to Rs 10,334 crore from Rs 8,750 crore. Domestic sales grew 16 per cent for the quarter.

Tata Motors extends lossShares of Tata Motors fell for the third day in a row, closing 3.33 per cent down at Rs 223.70. The stock has come off 5.17 per cent in last three sessions.

ACC declines 3% on Q1 numbersShares of ACC declined 3.07 per cent to close at Rs 1,606.90 a day after the cement maker reported a 38.19 per cent rise in consolidated March quarter profit at Rs 346.02 crore. Even though the numbers were in line, margins disappointed the Street. HSBC has a 'hold' call on the stock with a reduced price target of Rs 1,650. The brokerage highlighted that the Q1 results were not encouraging as the reported Ebitda came below the expectations. It said that margin expansion failed to play out due to misses on realisations, as well as on costs. 


Indiabulls Real Estate surges 10%Indiabulls Real Estate shares surged 10.23 per cent to close at Rs 116.35 ahead of its quarterly earnings and after the company said it is to sell its London property to its promoter for $258.7 million due to Brexit uncertainty.

Coromandel shares riseShares of Coromandel International closed 2.33 per cent up at Rs 436.30, a day after it reported a 22.8 per cent jump in March quarter profit at Rs 110 crore. 


Auto pack lone sectoral loserThe auto pack emerged as the only sectoral loser on BSE, falling 0.29 per cent on losses in shares of Tata Motors (3.33 per cent), MRF (1.47 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (0.60 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (0.26 per cent). Among the 16 components in BSE Auto index, 10 declined and six advanced. 


68 stocks ready to fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 68 counters on BSE. Among those stocks were Sterlite Technologies, InterGlobe Aviation, Maruti Suzuki India, Adani Ports and Indraprastha Gas. A bearish crossover indicates that the stock may fall in the coming sessions. Meanwhile, Indiabulls Realty, Zee Entertainment, NIIT, HCL Technologies, Bata India and Titan were among the 54 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on BSE. 


Dhunseri Group firms surge 20%Shares of Dhunseri Group companies surged up to 20 per cent after Tata Global Beverages (TGBL) said it will to acquire branded tea business of Dhunseri Tea & Industries for Rs 101 crore subject to due diligence and necessary approvals.

20,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Suzlon Energy with over 0.29 crore shares changing hands was leading among the most traded stocks on NSE on Wednesday.

Shares of Uttam Value Steel (number of shares traded: 0.14 crore), PC Jeweller (number of shares traded: 0.10 crore), ONGC (number of shares traded: 0.09 crore), Jet Airways (number of shares traded: 0.09 crore), YES Bank (number of shares traded: 0.08 crore), Reliance Power (number of shares traded: 0.06 crore), Tata Global Beverages (number of shares traded: 0.05 crore), Vodafone Idea (number of shares traded: 0.05 crore) and Gammon Infra (number of shares traded: 0.05 crore) also featured among the most traded stocks on the NSE.

ACC (Rs 47.58 crore) was leading the pack of most active stocks in value terms.

It was followed by RIL (Rs 35.40 crore), Maruti Suzuki (Rs 27.79 crore), HDFC (Rs 19.61 crore), YES Bank (Rs 18.58 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 18.36 crore), Lupin (Rs 17.92 crore) , IndusInd Bank (Rs 17.65 crore), ONGC (Rs 15.19 crore) and Jet Airways (Rs 15.06 crore).

The NSE Nifty index was trading 38.10 points up at 11,614.05 while the BSE Sensex was up 122.56 points at 38,687.44 around 09:17 am. 

In the Nifty index, Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (up 2.78 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (up 1.82 per cent), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (up 1.80 per cent), Indian Oil Corporation (up 1.51 per cent) and Zee Entertainment Enterprises (up 1.42 per cent) were among the top gainers. 

While UltraTech Cement (down 0.67 per cent), Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone (down 0.45 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (down 0.43 per cent), Grasim Industries (down 0.38 per cent) and NTPC (down 0.34 per cent) were the top losers in the index."
26,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Riding on the back of gains in Reliance Industries and FII darling HDFC twins, domestic benchmark indices jumped over 1 per cent on Wednesday, snapping their three-day losing spree. 

As worries over further hike in crude oil prices dimmed, Indian market started to look up.

Market sentiment got a boost from a report by International Energy Agency (IEA), a watchdog for oil consuming countries.

The IEA on Tuesday said that oil market is ""adequately supplied"" and ""global spare production capacity remained at comfortable levels."" 

Meanwhile, India VIX too eased 4.56 per cent. The advance-decline ratio however stood at 1:1. 

BSE benchmark Sensex ended 490 points or 1.27 per cent higher at 39,055 with 23 stocks in the green. NSE's Nifty closed the day at 11,726, up 150 points or 1.30 per cent. 


Factors:

Oil eases from 6-month high
Oil prices fell after an IEA report allayed concerns about tightening supply, ending a rally that took prices to their highest since early November on concerns that Opec output cuts and sanctions would take too much oil out of the market.

The IEA said in a statement on Tuesday that markets are ""adequately supplied"" and that ""global spare production capacity remains at comfortable levels."" Also weighing on prices, US crude stocks rose by 6.9 million barrels last week, more than expected, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. 


F&O expiryInvestors squared off position ahead of expiry of April futures and options contracts.


Hopes of normal monsoonThe latest South Asian Climate Outlook Forum on Tuesday predicted a normal monsoon in most parts of India barring the west coast peninsular, including parts of the state and northern parts of central India.


Earnings optimismSo far the earnings number reported by the largecap companies have been in line with Street expectations, thus fuelling hopes that the much-awaited earnings recovery will follow this quarter.


Expert Take:
Market rallied after a rangebound movement supported by short covering ahead of F&O expiry and in-line results for Q4FY19. Government 10-year yield slid as RBI announced open market operation, while rupee weakened due to uncertainty in oil prices. Prospects over quarter results may cap the anxiety on crude price volatility, while any consolidation will give an entry point to quality stocks

- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services


Market at a glanceIn the 30-pack index, HCL Tech was the best performing Sensex stock, rising as much as 3.40 per cent. ONGC, IndusInd Bank, YES Bank, Bharti Airtel and HDFC were among other stocks that logged gains. 

Tata Motors with a decline of over 3 per cent was the biggest loser. 

Auto stocks were the worst hit among Sensex stocks. Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp were the top three Sensex drags. 

UltraTech Cement surged over 5 per cent following a better-than-expected earnings for quarter ended March 31. Standalone profit jumped 108.52 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1,017.47 crore during the quarter under review. Net sales increased 18.10 per cent to Rs 10,334 crore in Q4FY19 over Rs 8,750 crore last year.

Midcap and smallcap indices too logged strong gains but still trailed benchmark Sensex. The BSE Midcap index rose 0.43 per cent and BSE Smallcap index 0.42 per cent.

Barring auto, all other eighteen sectoral indices settled higher. Oil & Gas and Energy were lead gainers. Telecom, Teck and Finance too managed to score big."
22,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s largest institutional investor, raised bets on banking as well as select auto, gas, retail and midcap IT stocks during March quarter, which saw domestic equity benchmark Sensex jump 7.22 per cent to 38,672 as of March 29 from 36,068 on December 31, 2018.

At the same time, LIC did some major portfolio overhaul, offloading shares of several telecom, metals, power generation, pharma, hotels, chemicals and cement companies.

The banking sector emerged a tempting bet during the quarter on hopes of earnings recovery and likely bottoming out of NPA provisioning. The insurance behemoth seems to have lapped up a number of banking stocks – both largecap and midcap. Shareholding data of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank and IDBI Bank all showed a spike in LIC holding.

LIC also upped stake in Indian Overseas Bank and Syndicate Bank, but offloaded shares in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI. 

During the quarter, LIC completed the acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in IDBI Bank. RBI in March categorised IDBI Bank as a private lender for regulatory purposes with effect from January 21, 2019. LIC held 44.31 per cent stake in the bank as of December 31.

Elara Capital in a report said there has been a structural shift in the private banking space in the past few quarters, wherein private lenders steadily raised their term deposit (TD) rates.

“This is because private banks’ credit growth is outperforming CASA deposit growth. We expect credit growth of 20 per cent YoY for Q4FY19E against CASA deposit growth of 12 per cent YoY for private banks,” the brokerage said

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of March quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. 

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in select auto firms like Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Motors and M&M. LIC was not among key shareholders in Hindustan Motors as of December 31, 2018.

At the same time, it offloaded some stakes in the beaten-down Tata Motors. LIC held 5.10 per cent stake in the auto major as of March 2019 against 5.17 per cent at the end of December quarter.

Tata Motors earlier this month reported a 5 per cent decline in March sales globally, including that of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) vehicles, at 1,45,459 units. It had sold 1,53,156 units in March 2018.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 22 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 40 companies in March quarter, but reduced it in nearly 60 others.

India’s leading gas players Gail and Indraprastha Gas saw a lot of interest from the domestic institutional investor. 

LIC also picked up over 1 per cent stake in Linde India, NIIT Technologies, UPL and Spencer's Retail during the quarter. It was not among the key shareholders in these companies at December end.



In the pharma space, LIC sold shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, GSK Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Lupin and Sanofi India, but bought additional shares in Cipla and Piramal Enterprises.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala recently said that the price erosion in the pharma sector is behind us. “Indian pharma market will tend to grow faster than it has grown. Pharma is not a market where demand can go down. You must know that 40-45 per cent of all medicines used in the US is made in India. I think it is a sunrise industry, it is not a sunset industry, it can never be a sunset industry,” he said.

Crisil, Tata Coffee, Bombay Dyeing, Indo Rama, Adani Ports, ONGC, OFSS, Rajesh Exports, Tata Chemicals, Exide Industries, Century Textiles, UltraTech Cement and Gillette India were among the other stocks in which LIC increased stake during the quarter.

However, it reduced stake in cement players ACC, Ambuja Cement, Heidelberg Cement, Jaiprakash Associates and India Cement and several hotel stocks including EIH, Hotel Leela Ventures, India Tourism Development Corporation and The Indian Hotels.

In the telecom space, LIC brought down its stake in Bharti Airtel to 3.72 per cent from 3.73 per cent in MTNL from 19.02 per cent to 18.49 per cent and in Reliance Communications from 5.97 per cent to 5.94 per cent."
23,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: UltraTech Cement on Wednesday said its standalone profit more than doubled to Rs 1,017 crore in March quarter against Rs 488 crore in the year-ago period. 

Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected a net of Rs 820 crore.

Standalone net sales jumped 18 per cent YoY to Rs 10,334 crore from Rs 8,750 crore in the year-ago quarter. Domestic sales volume for the quarter rose 16 per cent.

The company noted that while the cement industry has been seeing pick up in demand since FY18, there continues to be relatively low capacity addition, which has resulted in improving capacity utilisation, industry-wide.

On a consolidated basis, net profit stood at Rs 1,013 crore in March quarter.

The clinker capacity and cement grinding facility at Manavar, Madhya Pradesh, have stabilised, with the clinker capacity operating at 100 per cent utilisation, the company said.

The company noted that its variable costs rose 3 per YoY on account of higher fuel prices and impact of rupee depreciation."
24,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Shares of UltraTech Cement climbed over 5 per cent, erasing early losses after the company reported better-than-expected March quarter earnings numbers.

4435.45 on BSE."
25,2019-04-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: UltraTech Cement on Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings for quarter ended March 31, along with nearly 30 per cent rise in Ebitda. 

Shares of the company pared earlier losses after earnings announcement. The scrip was trading 1.63 per cent up at Rs 4272.20 at around 2.32 pm (IST), while the BSE Sensex was up 0.72 per cent at around the same time.


Here are top takeaways from UltraTech's fourth quarter earnings:

Bottomline: Standalone profit jumped 108.52 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1,017.47 crore during the quarter under review. The cement major had reported a profit of Rs 487.95 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, when the figure took a hit of Rs 226.28 crore due to stamp duty on assets acquired in business combination.


Topline: Net sales increased 18.10 per cent to Rs 10,334 crore in Q4FY19 over Rs 8,750 crore last year. Domestic sales volume jumped 16 per cent over Q4FY18.

“The clinker facility and cement grinding facility at Manavar, District Dhar, Madhya Pradesh have stabilised, with the clinker capacity operating at 100 per cent utilisation. Variable cost were up 3 per cent YoY on account of higher fuel prices and impact of rupee depreciation,” UltraTech said in a release.


Bonanza to shareholders: The board recommended a dividend of Rs 11.50 per equity share for the year ended March 31, aggregating Rs 315.84 crore. The company will absorb the dividend distribution tax amounting to Rs 64.92 crore, resulting in total payout of Rs 380.76 crore.


Outlook for the industry: The company also highlighted that the cement industry started witnessing pick-up in demand since FY18, achieving double-digit growth since the last two years, after a period of tepid growth. However, there continues to be relatively low increase in new capacity.

Going forward, the company also sees sustained demand for cement due to government thrust on infrastructure development, stabilisation of RERA and pick-up in urban housing. 

“UltraTech, with its expansion in the last 3 years is very well placed to participate in the growth of the economy,” the company said in a regulatory filing.


Corporate update: The scheme of arrangement amongst Century Textiles and Industries, the company and their shareholders and creditors, is now awaiting the approval of the NCLT and other regulatory authorities as may be required. 

“Upon completing this acquisition and with the ongoing capacity expansions, the company’s cement manufacturing capacity will stand augmented to 113.40 mtpa, in India, strengthening its position as the third largest cement player globally (excluding China),” said UltraTech. 

It also said UltraTech Nathdwara Cement is in the process of selling the non-core assets acquired in UAE/China, the sale proceeds of which will be used to deleverage the balance sheet.


EBITDA: The figure jumped 29.90 per cent YoY to Rs 2212 crore in Q4FY19, while EBITDA margin increased to 21.10 per cent from 18.90 per cent YoY."
28,2019-04-25,UltraTech,"Mumbai: India’s benchmark stock indices rose 1.3 per cent on Wednesday, snapping a three-day losing streak as an unexpected spike toward the end of the session caught traders off guard, forcing them to square off some of their bearish bets. The Sensex crossed the 39,000 mark once again though market participants are not certain if the renewed strength is here to stay because of worries about stronger oil prices.

The Sensex climbed 489.80 points to end at 39,054.68 while the Nifty closed 150.20 points higher at 11,726.15. Wednesday’s rise was the biggest oneday gain for the Sensex in six weeks and the biggest daily advance for the Nifty since January 31. HCL Technologies, ONGC, IndusInd Bank, YES Bank and Bharti Airtel were the biggest gainers on the Sensex, ending up 2.6-3.4 per cent. Heavyweights HDFC, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and Tata Consultancy Services gained 1-2 per cent. Tata Motors was the worst performer, down 3 per cent at Rs 223.70.



The Sensex and Nifty, which were trading modestly higher for most of the session, put on a spurt after better-than-expected earnings by UltraTech Cement. Messages doing the rounds on WhatsApp groups that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance is likely to show a strong win tally in the ongoing national polls after three phases of balloting so far could have also perked up Dalal Street sentiment.



Rally in oil prices eases a bit
The gains in the broader market were relatively modest compared with those of the blue chips. The mid- and small-cap indices rose about 0.4 per cent, lending weight to the premise that the late spurt in the Sensex and Nifty was on account of the covering of bearish positions. Traders had mounted such bets in the past three days due to the surge in oil prices, which is seen hurting the economy.

“Market will remain extremely volatile in the short term, but earnings, crude price and election outcome will decide the trend in the medium term,” said Gopal Agrawal, senior fund manager at DSP Mutual Fund.

The rally in oil prices eased a bit on Wednesday from six-month high levels after an industry report signalled a gain in US crude inventories. This partly offset concern over the US push to end the import of Iranian oil by countries such as India. Stocks in India witnessed their biggest one-day drop in percentage terms on April 22 after crude gained 3 per cent that day. That was the first threat to the pre-election rally that had been under way since March.

The volatility index India VIX ended down 3.8 per cent at 23.7 after gaining for six consecutive sessions.

Foreign portfolio investors bought local stocks worth Rs Rs975 crore and domestic institutional investors sold shares worth a net Rs657 crore.

An institutional equities head at a domestic brokerage said traders expect the Nifty to touch 12,000-12,200 at around the time of election results. The national polls are taking place in seven phases from April 11 to May 19 with counting on May 23.

Kotak Institutional Equities said the Indian market seems reasonably confident about the BJP forming the next government albeit with fewer seats. Pre-election opinion polls showed the BJP-led NDA coalition winning 270-310 seats, up from 225-232 in January and comfortably ahead or around the midway mark of 272.

The Nifty may hit 12,000 after the elections, said ICICI Securities chief investment officer Piyush Garg. That would take the indexes to new records. The Sensex hit a high of 39,487.45 and the Nifty a record 11,856.15 on April 18.

“12,000 on the Nifty may happen post elections. It looks difficult before elections,” said Garg.

Garg said a BJP victory is factored in and further gains would depend on the actual seat count."
34,2019-04-25,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: A surprise selloff at the fag-end of Thursday’s session made equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty close with deep cuts as the April series derivative contracts expired.

A spike in crude oil prices and a depreciating rupee weighed on investor sentiment. Weak global sentiment also kept investors jittery as most Asian and European markets suffered losses on concerns of fragile health of the global economy. 

China's SSE Composite Index fell over 2 per cent after the country's central bank doused hopes of further economic stimulus. People's Bank of China Vice-Governor Liu Guoqiang said on Thursday the central bank had no intent of tightening or relaxing monetary policy, Reuters reported.

“The market failed to maintain the opening gains due to a surge in oil prices, concern over global slowdown and the Chinese central bank ruling out any stimulus,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The company's standalone net sales jumped 18 per cent YoY to Rs 10,334 crore from Rs 8,750 crore in the year-ago quarter. Domestic sales volume for the quarter rose 16 per cent. 

As per Reliance Securities, a strong recovery in its operating performance after a long time and consistent approach to trim down the cost further along with a focus on improvement in RoCE augur well for UltraTech Cement.

The brokerage upgraded its recommendation on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold', with a target price of Rs 4,850.

""Upwardly revising our Ebitda estimate by 19 per cent/21 per cent for FY20E/FY21E to factor in healthy cost savings, strong volume and recent improvement in realisation, we upgrade our recommendation on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold' with a revised SOTP-based target price of Rs 4,850 from Rs 4,050 earlier,"" the brokerage said.

Nirmal Bang Securities says UltraTech is likely to continue to focus on supply push to gain overall capacity utilisation. However, it added that any input cost inflation will impact the margins as higher despatches and infrastructure sector-driven demand implies limited pricing gains.

37,2019-04-26,UltraTech,"I cannot see more than three credible NBFCs surviving this brutal shake out over the next two years, said Saurabh 
   
   
   Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

It is a dull market. Valuations are not that great but one always hopes tomorrow will be better. How does one make money in this kind of a market?
I partially agree with you about the dull market point and I will partly disagree as well. It is a dull market in the sense that like in the last six, seven years, we are set for another year of weak earnings growth. Even if you factor in a rebound in the private sector banks’ numbers, I do not think we will be seeing Nifty earnings growth going too far above the 11-12% mark. Clearly valuations are stretched in that regard and have been stretched for the last couple of years. 

Where I do not think it is a dull market and I do not see the uncertainty being as big as others are making it out to be is we are in a classical Indian setup of high government spending, rising cost of money, consumption is in decent shape, as is small ticket consumption; private sector banks are all set to have a good couple of years as NBFCs and PSU banks struggle and the currency is set to weaken thus favouring exporters. So IT, pharma, private sector banks, FMCG sectors that investors have known and loved for a long time, are set for a good couple of years and in that regard, I am not so sure the outlook is as uncertain as some are making it out to be.


If the evidence is backing the fact that election is more like a short term/sentiment market event, why is there so much of uncertainty? 
It is a natural human sentiment. We are caught between greed on the one hand, the greed that if I could get in early before the result and if I could guess the result, the natural tendency is to believe I could make potentially a lot of money in the next couple of months and the fear obviously is I know that earnings have not been the best for the last six, seven years; I know the earnings outlook even now. Even with an NDA victory, I know PE multiples are stretched and so hey, could the market correct sharply? 

It is a natural human tendency and this sort of investing is as best seen as a hobby. If you want to professionally invest or make good money with your savings, it is best to buy the classical compounders in our country which really are not swayed by elections. 

Kids will have baby milk powder ever after 23rd May, regardless of who wins the elections and in that regard, just to take an example, it is difficult to see why say a Nestle’s earnings should be swayed by the identity of the winner on 23rd May? Similarly, houses will be painted after the elections regardless of who wins and Asian Paints’ earnings therefore should hold up regardless. 

But the human mind does not like boring things. It wants excitement which comes from these sorts of big ticket events and people try to gamble around it. It is natural to want to do so but it does not make you a great deal of money if you want to gamble. It is a good hobby to have but that is not professional investing.


Chris Wood of CLSA is saying that the pain has been further exacerbated in the NBFC space by the blow up in the NBFC issues since the IL&FS crisis. He continues to see a slowdown in consumer credit caused by cut in funding to NBFCs. Do you think smaller NBFCs with a strong parentage would continue to do so in the near future as well?
Two years ago, I started sounding the alarm bell on various TV channels about the state of the NBFC sector and the associated problems with debt mutual fund sector which is very much the banker to the NBFCs and the HFCs. Clearly a lot of these businesses have unviable business models. You cannot be borrowing money in the short-term money market and be lending them for 20 year home loans, it makes no sense. 

I think we are half-way through the blow up. My reckoning is the rest of the blow up in the sector will happen in the six, seven months following the elections. As we read every day in the newspapers, debt mutual funds are having a serious problem with their exposure to the sector and to other promoter funding vehicles.

Those problems will exacerbate over the next six months and we are only half way through what will be a brutal shake out in the HFC and the NBFC sector. There will be a few champions who will be left standing but I think of the top of my head I cannot see more than three credible NBFCs surviving this brutal shake out over the next two years.


IT Well Placed Over Next 12 Months and TCS is Best PlayHow have you assessed the earnings so far and do you have any preferences within the IT pack?
A couple of things to remember, Indian IT obviously is a reasonably commoditised sector and our IT firms are not offering some cutting- edge science and technology. Therefore cost-efficiency and currency is central for them. A weakening rupee is super helpful for Indian IT. Over the next 12 months, the rupee looks destined to head to 75-76 against the dollar. 

That sort of a backdrop is a natural and a super powerful tailwind for Indian IT regardless of what is happening in America or Europe. Secondly, on the basis of what I read on tech commentary, the digital blueprint for the western world is pretty well laid out. It is relatively clear that the Accentures and the IBMs who ruled the roost are now once again back in the mode of giving plenty of work to the Indian IT services firms.

Indian IT services are back in the groove or executing low-cost projects on a well worn template. Finally, low-cost scale gorillas the world over are well placed to benefit from the global supply chains and to my mind TCS as the dominant scale gorilla in Indian IT and indeed TCS is a scale gorilla in global IT. It is a natural beneficiary of that climate. 

So currency, the maturing of the new digital blueprint and scale are the three things to look at and to my mind, TCS is the best play on that. One disclaimer, it is something that we have recommended to our clients over the last couple of months and therefore in some regard, I am already talking my own book. I believe Indian IT generally is well placed over the next 12 months and TCS is the best play. 


Time and again I keep on hearing this argument that Indian IT companies are going the commodity way. They are the ones who do not have a cutting edge and are not in product. But tlook at TCS. This is a business which is giving you free cash flow, the return ratios are strong, cash is coming back to the shareholders and margins are between 25% and 28%. How many businesses in the world can grow at 8%, 9%, 10% at that run rate and give you dividend and cash back or buyback every two years?
Absolutely, I agree with you. The financial strength of these franchises are unbelievable. if I hug back to my book Coffee Can Investing the two things I look for is return on capital employed consistently above 15% and revenue growth consistently above 10%. TCS’s ROCs are in the vicinity of 30% and at the moment they seem to be well set for dollar revenue growth of 10% which should be rupee revenue growth of at least 12-13%. This has all the hallmarks of what is already a legendary franchise and the ability to be a Coffee Can Franchise potentially over the next decade or so.


 In cement, ACC results showed a fair amount of cost pressure and the margins were bog down. But UltraTech Cement saw blowout earnings. Could some of the other companies like India Cement replicate the same kind of performance?
It is entirely possible that we get quarter to quarter numbers which favour certain players. You are right UltraTech’s numbers do look very impressive but the longer term pictures are worth looking at because to make really good money, you need to settle down on 10 large bets on high quality firms and ride with them. 

If I look at the cement sector, I struggle to find too many companies where I can consistently see ROCs north of 15% and consistent revenue growth in excess of 10%. Take UltraTech itself, ROC struggled to get into double digits forget exceeding 15%. Yes,they have had a good quarter may be and they will have several more, but I do not see the makings of a really lucrative stock in the franchise. It could have a good one or two-year run, but it is now one of those stocks where I can put it away and consistently expect 25% compounding. That is the big thing to look out for. Look for stocks which can consistently give you 20-25% compounding on the basis of really superior underlying fundamentals which can grind out superior performance year after year. Asian Paints or HDFC Bank are classic examples of that.


Any more additions to your compounder list? I remember few names from there. You had Abbott, Asian Paints, HDFC... any new additions?
A company which we have not discussed on your programme is Pidilite. It is a classic Coffee Can Compounder with market share of 70% odd in adhesives, ROC’s north of 25% and whilst growth has not been the greatest over the last couple of years, I think Pidilite’s just does not dominate adhesives, but now the waterproofing business as well which bodes well for the future. It is a well-run firm and part of our portfolio.


Most of us do not invest with a 10-15 years view. We have a 2-3 year view. On a two-to-three year view, would Pidilite, Asian Paints or perhaps a P&G make money?
I am not so sure about P&G. I do not know much about the name but on the other two names that you mentioned, if you get a chance to read Coffee Can Investing you will see that even over a three-year period, even if you do rolling three-year returns on these sorts of companies, you tend to get very good returns provided you are willing to give it three years.

Not only will you get good returns from franchises like HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, the Pidilite’s of the world, the volatility of your returns is as low as a Government of India bond. I have consistently tried to explain to people about this form of investing. You are getting returns well ahead of the Nifty 6%, 7% , 8% ahead of the Nifty for half the volatility of the Nifty. 

For a Government bond volatility, you get 20-21% returns pretty consistently even for a period as short as three years. That is all really one can ask for in equities. If you are getting returns well ahead of the Nifty, ahead of the benchmark, half the volatility of the benchmark is as close to a free lunch as people like me can get to in the Indian stock market."
38,2019-04-26,UltraTech,"From a long-term perspective, it does not look like a structurally very big change is happening for Idea or Airtel, said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, 
  
  
  , in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

What is your assessment of the kind of earnings that we have seen so far? Will there be a recovery or an improvement in headline numbers?
Yes, generally we see that the initial round of results that come in are in line or better than expectations. The back-benchers who are the culprits in pulling down the overall results come in later. So far, we have seen good numbers from banks like HDFC Bank; on the corporate banking side, we have seen good numbers from Axis. 

The auto sector has given weaker numbers but that was on expected lines. The volume details were already out. The negative surprise from Maruti in terms of the margins was something which will impact the segment for some more time but so far, the overall results have been broadly in line with expectations so far. 


Within pharma, are you looking at any specific names as good buys?
Pharma has so far been a mixed bag, a difficult sector to track because a lot of things are happening apart from the regulatory actions. A lot of these companies -- some of which are able to crossover to get a clearance - -are seeing some positive reaction. A lot of these companies are unable to do that and are consistently getting observations one after the other and are getting impacted. 

Apart from that, the pricing pressure continues to impact the pharma space. Volume growth is another factor, wherein the US and Europe is yet to pick up. Overall, only a handful of them have been able to do well. One of them is Divi’s Lab, which has consistently done well. It has cleared all the regulatory challenges and has been reporting good numbers. 

Apart from that, companies like Dr Reddy’s and Lupin on the larger front and Auro Pharma are starting to report good numbers and expectation of good delivery apart from the comfortable valuations are something are aiding some of these names in pharma space. 


Is there anything that appeals to you in the cement space? Do you believe that the overall cycle is turning fairly positive and that the demand supply mismatch now seems to be narrowing? Are fundamentals in favour of the space?
Cement is a very interesting space currently because of the subdued numbers that they have been reporting for quite some time. However, the capacity utilisations have now picked up. A lot of consolidation has happened, no new capacities are now being added and finally we should see going into FY20 some of the improvement in realisation and some raw material pressures easing off leading to healthy margins. 

Volumes for the space have been pretty strong. In the last couple of quarters we have seen the heavyweights reporting high single digit to some of the smaller names reporting double digit volume growth as well. It was the main concern was on the realisation front as well as on the cost front. 

In the last couple of months, the south-based companies have been increasing the prices which led to some volume not picking up in that space. However, in north- based companies, consolidation has happened and these should do consistently well. So, it is a structural change.We saw that in the very strong numbers for UltraTech Cement. It is much better than expectation and the street is becoming incrementally positive towards the stock. 

We are preferring some of the pockets in the cement space right from UltraTech, Shree Cement and JK Cement which is again a north-based player and Ramco Cement which in the southern market looks attractive in the overall cement space. 


What is your sense on the earnings of Piramal Enterprises?
I briefly had a look at the headline numbers. On its own it is a good set of numbers but compared to street expectations, there has been a miss and there was an one-time expense that the company has taken which is negatively impacting the sentiments as of now. 

Otherwise, the other broad operating parameters look pretty steady. Once we have a con-call with the management, things would get clarified. The street would take in things as it would get more details about the numbers and that should allay the negative sentiments. 


What is the expectation from Yes Bank? I guess one would be looking out for what strategy Ravneet Gill has in mind for next one to two years?
We are expecting a 24% year-on-year on loan book growth, mainly driven by the retail banking business. The NIMs are expected to remain stable at 3.4%; we expect PAT of about Rs 970 crores for Q4. 

The key things to watch out for is the fund-raising plans that the bank would have. That is a major block in terms of how the bank is able to grow in future. Due to management issues, they have not been able to come down and raise equities because at the pace they are growing, they would need fresh equity to charter their new growth plans. 

We have been hearing the news of a change in the entire top management. How the new CEO takes that forward, who are the new people who would join would definitely be something that the street would watch out for.


What is your take on the telecom space as a whole? The two incumbents are readying their war chest to take on rival Jio. Is there some potential for upside? 
Telecom has been another interesting sector at least in the current juncture where we are seeing two of the three larger players are coming out with rights issues, raising a war chest as you rightly said. The only issue is one needs to be cognisant of the fact that how long will this war chest last, given that the new player Jio is consistently on the prowl for market share.

They would need to continuously do a higher capex to move to the newer technologies, upgrade the service networks and the likes. So yes, at the current valuation, it does look like that on the back of the current fundraising, both Airtel as well as Idea could see some decent upside. We have also heard the Reliance management is still looking at increasing market share and not much of ARPU gains.

So for some more time, this fight would continue but eventually there would be some improvement in ARPUs which would help the entire sector. However, from a long term perspective, this does not look like a structurally very big change happening especially for the Idea as well as Airtel because of the capex-heavy nature. The debt would not go off. They would need to pay for the existing spectrum that they have bought and the incremental capex required for moving up the technology ladder would continue to keep up pressure on the balance sheet. 

So it is a tactical opportunity right now and may not be a long-term opportunity for retail investors."
39,2019-04-26,UltraTech,"Edelweiss Securities has a hold call on UltraTech Cement with a target price of Rs 4,801.

The current market price of UltraTech Cement is Rs 4,613.45.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year.


View of the brokerage: The robust Q4FY19 performance reported by the largest cement player UltraTech Cement (UTCL) resembled the dance of an elephant. 

Consolidated EBITDA at Rs 23.3bn (up 31 per cent YoY) beat our Rs 23.0bn estimate (highest on the Street) as marginal revenue disappointment was offset by softer costs. 

Given recent improvement in the cement pricing scenario, we believe UTCL’s performance could improve further; factoring the same, we revise up FY20E and FY21E EBITDA 12 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. 

However, under our valuation framework (14x EV/EBITDA rolling over to Q2FY21E EBITDA) the stock offers limited upside (given the recent sharp run). We, therefore, maintain ‘HOLD’ with revised target price of Rs 4,822 (Rs 3,971 earlier). 

We continue to stay positive on the cement sector factoring the industry clinker utilisation up-cycle and maintain that UTCL will be its prime beneficiary."

Analyst calls• Citigroup Global Markets has upgraded AU Small Finance Bank to buy from sell and raised target price to ₹720 from ₹535. Erosion in NIM due to yield compression has constrained ROA over the past four quarters despite realization of scale benefits in opex, said Citi. 

• IIFL has an add rating on Coromandel International with a target price of ₹ 440. Fertiliser MRPs are expected to fall ahead of the Kharif season, and this could potentially weigh on sales volumes and margins, said IIFL. 

• CLSA has downgraded Bharti Infratel to sell from outperform and lowered price target to ₹285 from ₹300, citing muted tenancy growth outlook. With Vodafone Idea looking to optimise its network operating costs and the continuing slowdown in new tenancies by Reliance Jio, the tenancy growth outlook for the company is likely to be muted in the near term, said CLSA. 

• Investec Securities has maintained hold rating on UltraTech Cement and increased target price to ₹4,712 from ₹4,476. UltraTech Cement's operational beat in the Q4 result was primarily driven by lower cost heads, as price growth disappointed, said Investec. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained buy rating on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company and revised fair value to ₹500 from ₹480. ICICI Prudential Life reported strong operational performance with increase in the share of protection APE and improvement in persistency, said Kotak Institutional.

36,2019-04-26,UltraTech,"Mumbai: India's benchmark indices ended down 0.7-0.8 per cent on Thursday in a late sell-off after global crude oil prices rose above $75 a barrel amid tightening sanctions on Iran. The rupee slumped 39 paise to close at an over six-week low of 70.25 per dollar due to the rising crude oil prices and selling in local equities. The Sensex dropped 324 points, or 0.8 per cent, to end at 38,730.8 and the NSE Nifty ended down 84.35 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 11,641.8.

However, traders rolled over bullish bets to the May derivatives series on Thursday — the expiry day of the April monthly contracts — in the run-up to the general election results on May

23. Analysts warned the build-up of long positions along with the spike in Volatility Index — the market's fear measure — has made stocks vulnerable to a sharp correction in the event of a disappointment in elections or further jump in crude oil prices.



The Nifty ended the April futures and options series with a gain of 0.6 per cent while Sensex gained 0.5 per cent. The India VIX gained 40 per cent — the highest gain in a series since January 2018 series, and touched a three-year high in between. The gauge is expected to rise to 30 in May series.

Market-wide future open interest stood at 1.36 lakh crore as against Rs 1.37 lakh crore on previous expiry day. The Nifty futures open interest on expiry stood at Rs 23,300 crore compared to Rs 21,000 crore on last expiry day.

“Futures market witnessed long side aggression as rollover percentage was high at 85 per cent along with long roll cost at elevated levels of 85 bps (basis points). The high roll cost was on the back of two reasons — one, the next series is longer with 35 calendar days and as 101of the 196 stocks have been moved into physical settlement, so the rush to roll long positions led to elevated roll levels,” said Yogesh Radke, head of alternative and quantitative research at Edelweiss Securities.

Cement and consumption sectors have seen more long positions being rolled over, led by stocks such as UltraTech Cement, PVR, Bata India and Havells India, while higher rollover of short positions was seen in automobile and metal spaces. The Nifty had touched a record high of 11,856.1, while the Sensex touched all-time high of 39,487.4 on April 18 in continuation of the preelection rally amid confidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition will return to power for a second term.

Radke said he expects volatility to move up ahead of the general election results with the Nifty likely to find support first at 11,500 followed by 11,300.

“Market will closely take cues from the outcome of the general election and in the event of a stable outcome, the index should scale new highs,” said Radke.

Jayesh Bhanushali, derivative analyst at IIFL, said confidence in the market has come down with the fear index moving to 23-24 zone. “When VIX gained 42 per cent in January 2018, the following series saw a correction of 6 per cent and when VIX gained 36 per cent in the September series after the NBFC crisis, then too, the market corrected in the next series by 9 per cent. This time too India VIX has gained 40 per cent in the April series and the scenario may repeat if the Nifty breaks the important support level of 11,500,"" said Bhanushali.

The 11,600 put option holds the highest open interest in the May series followed by 11,500 and then 11,000. The 11,800 call option holds the highest open interest among call options followed by 12,000.

“Long positions have been formed in the May series and the open interest base is higher. The range for the Nifty is showing the same set-up as the last series and Nifty range is likely to be 11,500 and 12,000,"" said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives, at ICICIdirect."
40,2019-04-27,UltraTech,"The domestic equity market traded largely sideways with an upward bias all through the week and Nifty ended higher. But smallcap and midcap indices still languished, indicating that the market is in no hurry to set a decisive path for itself yet.

Such divergent behaviour of the Indian bourses will generate no meaningful direction for the market. However, in the meantime, there are certain risks emerging from global markets. In the US itself, there is such divergence. Dow Jones is sitting near its all-time high with far lower momentum while S&P2000, the smallcap version of the US market, is far below its all-time high level, showing the unlikeliness that the bull run will continue in the US.

Despite months of efforts, China and the US still have not been able to resolve their trade dispute. Additionally, the US blanket sanction on Iran is also a destabilising initiative, which can derail global bull markets if the conflict escalates, and most likely it will.

Economically, the world is at its best time but politically, we are in our worst phase. This is the biggest risk to the bull market, which no one is factoring in currently.


Events of the Week

A mixed sentiment from the quarterly earnings kept the market on its toes during the week. Among the banks, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and AU Small Finance Bank showed strong bottom line growth. Sterlite Tech reported a 68 per cent year on year PAT growth and Ultratech Cement 131 per cent. There were certain companies which belied analyst expectations, such as Maruti which experienced a degrowth of around 5 per cent, while ACC grew only 38 per cent and ICICI Securities degrew 11 per cent.


Technical Outlook

Nifty50 is trading cautiously near its all-time high level. Nifty50 had made a failed attempt to cross its all-time high mark, but since then it has been languishing around those levels. Such consolidation is expected to last longer, but

any decisive breakout above 11,900 level will signal a resumption of the uptrend. However, in order to protect the long positions, one needs to keep a stop below 11,500 in Nifty50, which can take the market much lower if the support is broken.




Expectations for the week

Open interest is consistently reducing in the futures market given the already elevated levels and the uncertainty over the election outcome. Status quo is expected to be maintained going forward. Therefore, the market is expected to move either 2/3 per cent up or down from the current level.

At the sectoral level, FMCG, capital goods and healthcare are largely moving sideways with very little volatility. Whereas, realty, midcap, auto, metal, power and smallcap stocks are in a corrective mode with further downward pressure going ahead. This vindicates our stance of a non-bullish case for the market in the immediate time frame. Investors must not rush into the market in this indecisive phase and go shopping, at least not till May 23, when the election results will come out.

Nifty50 ended the week flat at 11,754."
41,2019-04-27,UltraTech,"It was a week of consolidation for the domestic equity market, as rising crude oil prices kept market participants cautious during the past five sessions.

42,2019-04-28,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: The stock market wrestled with volatility all through this past week, has as it meandered through the highs and lows each day only to end 0.20 per cent lower for the week. The reasons are not far to seek: election results are due in less than a month and the earnings season is on in full swing. 

Value investor Safir Anand summed up the market situation well in a tweet that he put out a few days back:

Report card
Some eight Nifty companies came out with March quarter results this past week and most of the results were in line with expectations.

Sabharwal said the uninspiring YES Bank earnings showed why the stock weakened a few days before the numbers were out and called it a case of insider trading. He said a sharp underperformance in the bank’s net interest income was more concerning than rising provisions.

43,2019-04-30,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks opened in the red on Tuesday, mirroring bearish sentiment in major Asian markets.

A lacklustre Chinese manufacturing data spooked investor sentiment, adding to the cautiousness as participants awaited the US Fed’s policy decision for clues on the US economy and the US central bank’s future rate trajectory.

A slight drop in crude oil prices and the rupee's rise against the dollar capped further downside in the market.

Election-related jitters, March quarter earnings and foreign fund flows were other key factors swaying the market on either side. 

Analysts are advising a prudent, stock-specific approach at this juncture. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 11 stocks that analysts say can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in 

HCL Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,270 | Stop loss: Rs 1,090
Long-term charts on the counter are looking interesting. The stock has witnessed a breakout this month to register new life-time highs after almost a year of struggle in the Rs 1,100–900 range. This range breakout itself is projecting a target around Rs 1,300. Going forward, sustaining above Rs 1,100 would be crucial for this stock to retain the positive momentum. “Positional traders, at this juncture, can adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines close to Rs 1,100 and look for a target of Rs 1,270 with a stop loss at Rs 1,090,"" said Mohammad.


Jindal Steel and Power | Buy | Target price: Rs 190 | Stop loss: Rs 167
This counter recoiled on relatively higher volumes from its support level of Rs 165, hinting at a near-term bottom around this level. Sustaining above Rs 168, it can test its recent swing high placed around Rs 191. “Positional traders should buy this stock by adopting a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines around Rs 170, and look for a target of Rs 190 with a stop loss of Rs 167,” Mohammad said.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager, Technical Analysis, YES Securities

State Bank of India | Buy | Target price: Rs 340-360 | Stop loss: Rs 297

On the weekly chart, the SBI stock has turned upward after taking support at the triangle pattern neckline placed around Rs 300-303. Further, volumes declined in the throwback, clearly suggesting a temporary pause before the stock resumes its uptrend. On the daily chart, it has broken out from a bullish flag pattern, suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions. The RSI has turned upward after taking support at the 50-level and has formed a positive reversal on the daily chart, suggesting bullishness in the stock. 


Shankara Building Products | Buy | Target price: Rs 595-620 | Stop loss: Rs 485
On the daily chart, Shankara Building Products is on the verge of a breakout from a bullish flag pattern neckline placed at Rs 540. A successful breakout backed by healthy volumes can trigger a bear trend reversal, taking the stock higher. Further, following a series of lower lows and highs, the stock now has started forming higher highs and higher lows, clearly indicating that the downtrend has been arrested. RSI has turned upwards, breaking out of the upper end of the bear territory i.e. the 60-level and instead took support at this upper end of the bear territory recently during a throwback.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

Ambuja Cements | Buy | Target price: Rs 240 | Stop loss: Rs 219
This stock has taken support near the significant 200-DMA, which is placed near Rs 216 and has made a recovery to indicate a positive bias. It can move further to Rs 240. The RSI has also shown a trend reversal to signify strength.


Jindal Steel & Power | Buy | Target price: Rs 190 | Stop loss: Rs 167
This stock has formed almost a higher bottom formation pattern on the daily chart, taking support near 50-DMA and has produced a positive candle pattern to signify strength. The RSI has also indicated a trend reversal, signalling a buy. ""With good volume activity witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 190, keeping a stop loss of Rs 167,"" Parekh said.


Gajendra Prabu, Senior Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

Hexaware Technologies | Buy | Target price: Rs 390 | Stop loss: Rs 332 
The stock formed and validated the Bullish Harami candle pattern formed on April 25 on the daily chart, which is a confirmation of the bullish reversal. It has provided a breakout of key short-term trendline. The price has started to form a higher top and higher bottom on intraday charts which is a bullish development. In addition, technical indicators are placed in favour of bulls. 


State Bank of India | Buy | Target price: Rs 339 | Stop loss: Rs 298
This stock has completed a Three Wave decline from Rs 339.60 to Rs 303,.60 which is a major “wave ii/b” with the internals of a-b-c and now stock is in progress of “wave iii/c” up which, it could initially head towards Rs 340 which is slightly below the previous 52-week high. A few weeks back, the stock provided a breakout of contracting triangle and for the last couple of weeks, the stock was in a throwback fall. It has been maintaining a higher top and higher bottom formation in the bigger picture which is a bullish continuation structure. Apart from this, it is trading above all key moving averages of 21, 50 & 200-day EMAs. 


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking

Multi Commodity Exchange | Buy | Target price: Rs 925 | Stop loss: Rs 790
On the daily chart, this stock broke above all its recent hurdles convincingly, courtesy to its quarterly results. The said breakout from the resistance resembles a bullish reversal pattern known as ‘Cup N Handle’ which is supported with a good increase in volume. In addition, RSI after forming a base around 50, has confirmed a bullish crossover with its smoothened averages supporting the buy call. 


Dr Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,100 | Stop loss: Rs 2,775
During the week gone by, pharma stocks put up an outperformance, suggesting that the pharma sector is finally joining the bulls’ party. This heavyweight pharma stock, too, has broken above its recent consolidation and is now trading at 52-week high which supports the optimism. In addition, prices have closed above the higher band of Bollinger band, suggesting a strong uptrending move in the near term. 


Jay Thakkar, CMT, AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

Aurobindo Pharma | Buy | Target price: Rs 870 | Stop loss: Rs 820
The stock has provided a breakout from the triangular pattern which is a continuation pattern. The momentum indicator MACD is well into buy mode on the daily as well as weekly charts. This stock is likely to inch towards its life-time high levels.


HDFC Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,410 | Stop loss: Rs 2,210
This stock has formed a falling channel in its Wave 4 and it has reversed well from the lower end of the falling channel. The stock has also taken good support at the lower end of the rising channel, hence the probability of Wave 5 up is quite high.


UltraTech Cement | Buy | Target price: Rs 4,780 | Stop loss: Rs 4,450
This stock has provided a breakout from the running triangular pattern with an increase in volumes, hence it is a price volume breakout. It has started Wave III of 3 of a minor degree and it is likely to inch towards its extension target of Rs 4,780. The support on the lower side is pegged at Rs 4,450.

1,2019-05-03,UltraTech,"From the broader universe, corporate banks would be the ones to watch out for. ICICI Bank, RBL Bank and DCB Bank are the stocks to be tracked, said Yogesh Mehta, Vice-President, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Which are the numbers that you have been tracking or which have stood out so far this quarter?
So far this quarter, the major disappointment which has surprised rather than shocked has been Maruti. There was a strong blip in the margin and profitability did not increase beyond Rs 1,600 crore on quarterly basis. There was disappointment on the new vehicle launch as well. 

The only other major disappointment was Yes Bank but it was a different issue. 

The positive surprise was from UltraTech Cement where capacity utilisation is on an all-time high and the new brownfield expansion from Jaypee and other plants has contributed very well and that EV to EBITDA and EBITDA per tonne has increased substantially. The stock has been upgraded with the positive surprise.


After Cognizant’s guidance cut, what is view on IT sector and some of the tech majors specifically?
Just a month ago, the IT sector was looking very strong but the way Cognizant has come out overnight with guidance cut, there has been some concern over growth for the IT sector. The IT sector is showing some kind of a blip. But companies like Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys and TCS and even L&T Infotech have gained large deals and clients in $20 million to $50 million bracket. 

So for Indian companies there should not be any hurdle but Cognizant growth guidance for at least 2019 calendar year has raised worry.

As a result, IT companies are down by 2-2.5% but the growth remains there on the global side because US GDP growth is around 3.5% growth rate in the first quarter of CY19. So far, it does not seem that Indian companies will have some bad days with the tailwind of rupee, and so our projection does not deviate at this point in time. IT could be a safe haven for at least next two, three quarters. 


Everyone has been talking about the NBFC space and raised liquidity concerns. Given that it is really the favoured pocket in the market right now, what would you advice investors?
We believe that with rising credit cost and the slowdown in the loan book growth, everything is slowing down for NBFCs. We believe liquidity issue and credit cost will be working against this business for the next three to six months and then it may get settled, but it depends on the circumstances at that point in time. 

For NBFC companies like Bajaj Finance, however, it is a different story and the AUM growth is around 45% to 47% and the loan book is also growing. We are projecting that 45% to 50% PAT jump could be there on YoY basis and Bajaj Finance could be the one where one can look with confidence. For the rest of the NBFCs, we believe there will be some tough time ahead.


What would you be watching out for in the coming weeks -- earnings, global cues or specific triggers?
We will be watching corporate earnings for the ongoing season and where the number of companies that are audited would be more in focus because on the global side, Fed meeting is already over. For now, the election noise will be there and will increase day by day till the results are out. 

Crude is in favour, the USD INR is in the favour and so on the macro and micro side, we are well placed and need not worry.

As for corporate ,earnings we need to see how much traction is coming with ICICI Bank when its results are out on Monday. Maybe post market, that will set the tone for the overall private sector banks performance and rest all will follow through. We will be focussing more on the results.


What about from the broader markets, is there anything that you are watching out for there? 
From the broader universe, I would say corporate banks would be the ones to watch out for. As I mentioned, the ICICI Bank result. On correction, also RBL Bank. It has strong traction on the results on every quarter with 35-37% AUM growth rate and that would be on the radar. DCB Bank has given a strong surprise on the NIMs as well as the business growth after five, six quarters of abysmal numbers. 

Basically it will be private financials and that will be the main focus area and if there is any correction in cement names like UltraTech, which has given strong numbers and a strong performance, that will be a buy on dip. It will again be stock specific. We can look at UltraTech Cement; Bajaj Finance numbers should be closely watched with 45-47% AUM growth if it is delivering there then again on any decline it will be a buy. 

On auto, we are on the sidelines, just watching them because the numbers are not coming through. We are just waiting for more opportunities there. Also, we are totally avoiding PSU banks. The numbers will flow and at that time we will decide. Since metals are cyclical, it is difficult to say anything on that."

7,2019-05-20,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity barometer Sensex vaulted over 950 points in early deals on Monday, propelled by exit polls that showed a clear and decisive majority for the Narendra Modi-led NDA in the general elections 2019.

The strong prospects of a stable government at the Centre gave a shot in the arm to the market even though it had been partly discounted earlier. Analysts say the rally could be even bigger if the results come in sync with these predictions.

""Most exit polls have predicted NDA to win the Lok Sabha elections with a good margin. This was partly discounted by the market over the past few days. The Street would like it even more if the BJP on its own gets a majority in the Lok Sabha. The fact that NDA may be able to attain the majority in Rajya Sabha only in 2020 or 2021 is a minor dampener as major reforms would need passage in both Houses,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC securities.

8,2019-05-21,UltraTech,"Mumbai: An increasing number of Indian companies are looking to divest their businesses over the next two to three years, and the most preferred way of doing this is by carving out non-core businesses or divisions within the group, a study done by global consulting group EY shows.

The survey of more than 45 Indian businesses ranging from $250 million to more than a billion dollar in revenues shows that most of the companies are looking at a liquidity event in the near future.

“One of the major reasons why corporates are looking to divest is that they now want to focus on the core,” said Naveen Tiwari, partner and head, carve-out and integration, EY India.

As per the global study, around 81% of the respondents within India confirmed that they are planning a divestment in the next two years. Of these, 67% of Indian companies expect more large-scale transformational divestments within the next 12 months.

As per data available with ET, 791 transactions resulting in divestments have taken place since 2016, valuing more than $50 billion. Some of the biggest divestments have been Reliance Infra’s sale of power business to Adani Transmission for $2.9 billion, L&T’s sale of electrical business to a clutch of PE investors for $2.8 billion, Jaiprakash Cement selling a part of its cement business to UltraTech Cement for $2.4 billion, and Lafarge selling its entire cement business to Nirma Ltd for $1.4 billion.

“It is a matter of capital allocation.

Because there is a finite pool of capital, corporates are looking to divest the underperforming businesses and reinvest back the proceeds into the core business,” said a PE fund manager.

At a time when most companies are going through a deleveraging cycle,one fourth of those surveyed said they are looking to raise capital to repay debt. As per an April 2019 joint report by Assocham and Crisil, of the total cases admitted under the Indian Bankruptcy Code that came into effect in 2016, there has been a recovery rate of 43%, resolution for 94 stressed assets has been reached for Rs 75,000 crore as on March 31, 2019 out of Rs 1,75,000 crore total claim of financial creditors admitted under the NCLT.

“This is a good trend. This is happening because borrowing has become rather limited and expensive. Also, companies that have large borrowings or huge debt are not favoured by the stock market...As a result, companies are trying to shrink their debt and focusing on core will help in doing so,” said Arun Duggal, chairman of rating agency ICRA and an eminent independent director."

Government spending on education, affordable housing and health sectors are expected to rise further post the formation of a stable government. Sharekhan believes the company is on a strong growth trajectory over the next two years with earnings slated to rise by 25 per cent CAGR driven by an increase in the operating margins and an improvement in execution (16 per cent CAGR) over the period of FY2019-21E.

After a dull start to the quarter, rupee bond sales by Indian companies are set to revive as borrowing costs have declined to the lowest in a year following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s landslide election victory.

Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Grasim Industries Ltd. and UltraTech Cement Ltd. plan to raise a combined 7.5 billion rupees ($108 million) selling five-year bonds. State-owned NLC India Ltd. priced 14.75 billion rupees of debt Monday -- its first issuance in a decade -- as average yield for 10-year AAA paper fell to 8.31 per cent, the cheapest since last May.

“Yields have come down and corporates waiting to refinance will borrow,” said Sandeep Bagla, associate director at Trust Group in Mumbai. “Issuance will pick up pace as clarity on the regime improves business sentiment.”

JSW Steel Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest producer, plans to raise 70 billion rupees via bonds and State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, is considering raising as much as 50 billion rupees through notes on Wednesday, according to exchange filings.

Local-currency issuance in the three-month period that began April 1 is about 700 billion rupees, or 25 per cent of the total raised in the March quarter, as companies held off fundraising during the six-week election process that ended May 19. Corporate bond sales in the year to March 2020 may be between 6.75 trillion rupees to 7 trillion rupees, up from 6.5 trillion rupees a year earlier, according to Care Ratings.

The potential for reforms after Modi’s comprehensive victory is likely to improve the flow of foreign capital to corporates, according to S&P Global Ratings. That’s good news for India’s credit markets, which have suffered from a crisis of confidence after shock defaults since last year by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and a string of downgrades at mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. and Reliance Capital Ltd."
13,2019-05-30,UltraTech,"As Dalal Street continues to speculate over a potential earnings revival time for India Inc, some 125 out of over 1,200 firms listed on NSE have doubled March quarter profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. 

Among the top grossers, textile player Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing posted 114 times or over 11,345 per cent YoY increase in profit for the quarter, while Kanoria Chemicals, Yuken India, Hathway Cable & Datacom, Linde India, EID Parry, TVS Electronics, Alfred Herbert, Bhagyanagar Properties and Shriram City Union Finance reported profit growth in the range of 10-55 times, or 1,000 to 5,250 per cent.

Except for Hathway Cable (down 9 per cent), Linde India (down 16 per cent) and TVS Electronics (down 95 per cent), net sales of these firms have increased from 8 per cent to 1,472 per cent during the quarter.

Is it worth looking at stocks of some of these companies to invest?

""Sustainability of profit growth should be the key determinant; make sure these are not one-off surprises,"" says Siddharth Sedani, Vice-President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

“Many companies would have reported strong numbers in Q4. Some of them delivered exceptional gains in terms of profitability. However, investors should look at the sustainability of those earnings and see how these numbers were in the past four to five quarters. One can consider companies with good management and promising earnings. However, global factors will continue to impact Indian markets,” he said.

India Inc’s March quarter earnings season has entered the last leg, with 48 companies from the Nifty pack and 28 from the Sensex pack having already declared their numbers till May 29. 

In the 50-share Nifty, as many as 33 companies have posted an increase in bottom lines, while 15 have reported a drop in profit.

Among others, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Globus Spirits, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TV18 Broadcast, Aro Granite Industries, Kirloskar Industries, Asian Hotels, Hatsun Agro and The Jammu & Kashmir Bank and Kakatiya Cement posted 500-965 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of TV18 Broadcast, Kirloskar and Kakatiya Cement increased over 50 per cent YoY for the quarter. 

Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on J&K Bank post Q4 results with a price target of Rs 80. “At 0.6 times on March 2021 adjusted book value (ABV), the valuation is reasonable given healthy loan growth and margins outlook, robust liability franchise, controlled asset quality and waning capital concerns,” the brokerage said.

Among Nifty companies, Ultratech Cement and Cipla posted 131 per cent and 106 per cent year-on-year rise in profit on a 17.38 per cent and 22.17 per cent YoY sales growth, respectively.

Dr Reddy’s reported 67 per cent YoY profit growth. It was followed by Grasim Industries (up 59 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 57 per cent), NTPC (up 48.70 per cent), Adani Ports (up 38.69 per cent) and Wipro (up 37.74 per cent). 

Reliance Securities has upgraded UltraTech to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ post Q4 results. Centrum Broking maintained ‘buy’ rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 640. 

Axis Bank and SBI posted net profits of Rs 1,505 crore and Rs 838 crore, respectively, for the quarter against net losses of Rs 2,188.70 crore and Rs 7,718.20 crore, respectively, in the same period last year. 

Yes Bank posted Rs 1,506.60 crore loss for Q4FY19 against net profit of Rs 1,179.40 crore posted for the same period last year. 

Among others, Tata Steel, UPL, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, JSW Steel and Tata Motors reported 77 per cent, 72 per cent, 62 per cent, 53 per cent, 49 per cent and 47 per cent YoY drop in profit for the quarter.



While commenting on the ongoing earnings season, Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interaction with ET Now said that only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. 

“The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60 per cent of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space,” he said.

DCM Shriram, Orient Cement, Godrej Agrovet, Nectar Lifesciences, Usha Martin, Sagar Cement, Insecticides (India), Brigade Enterprises, Godrej Properties, Bharat Forge, Procter & Gamble Health, Bluestar, Phoenix Mills, Butterfly Gandhimathi, Marico, Indiabulls Ventures and Orient Paper were among other companies on the NSE that reported over 100 per cent YoY profit growth for March quarter."
0,2019-06-03,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Strong across-the-board buying on hopes of another rate cut by the RBI boosted equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty to their record highs on Monday.

The Monetary Policy Committee headed by Governor Shaktikanta Das today started deliberations on the second bi-monthly policy review of the current fiscal and is slated to announce policy on Thursday and experts are of view that it may go for another round of rate cut, third in a row, in the light of weak GDP print, poor auto sales and other macroeconomic data.

Crude oil's weakness bolstered the rupee against the US dollar, which also influenced the mood of the market.

Global cues remained negative, pressured by the escalation of trade war and concerns of the global economic slowdown. However, the domestic market shrugged off weak global sentiment to scale fresh record highs.

Sensex closed with a massive gain of 553 points, or 1.39 per cent, at 40,267.62, while Nifty finished the day 166 points, or 1.39 per cent, higher at 12,088.55.


Let’s take a look at the highlights of Monday's session:


Investors get richer by Rs 1.78 lakh croreMonday's rally boosted overall market capitalisation of the BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,56,16,035.73 crore from Rs 1,54,38,014.55 crore, making investors richer by Rs 1.78 lakh crore.


242 stocks hit lower circuitsEven though equity benchmarks scaled record highs, the market breadth remained negative. On the BSE, 1,416 stocks declined against 1,194 stocks that advanced, while 159 stocks remained unchanged. 

As many as 242 stocks hit their lower circuits on BSE. Among them were Manpasand Beverages, Electrotherm (India), Mercator, Williamson Magor & Company and Atlas Jewellery India. On the other hand, Megasoft, Websol Energy System and Jaiprakash Power Ventures were among 159 stocks that hit upper circuits. 


Spurt in open interestWith a change of 100.45 per cent Apollo Hospitals Enterprise led the pack of stocks that witnessed biggest spurt in open interest (OI). It was followed by Repco Home Finance (39.07 per cent), Just Dial (34.58 per cent), Indraprastha Gas (32.06 per cent) and Bajaj Auto (22.14 per cent). 


94 stocks give bearish signalMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 94 counters on BSE, signalling that these counters may come under pressure in the coming sessions. Among those stocks were, NCC, Aurobindo Pharma, SRF, UltraTech Cement and Repco Home Finance. On the other hand, Havells India, Ajanta Pharma, NTC Industries, Jindal Hotels and Majesco were among the 32 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on BSE.


Apollo Hospitals Enterprise jumps 10%Extending gains into fourth consecutive session, shares of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises settled 9.71 per cent higher at Rs 1,360. In the last four sessions, the stock has climbed 14 per cent. The company last Thursday reported a 28.57 per cent rise in its standalone net profit to Rs 76.68 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.


Hero MotoCorp breaks 5-day losing runSnapping five-day consecutive losing streak shares of Hero MotoCorp closed with a gain of 6.01 per cent at Rs 2,842.50. The stock got traction after the company on Sunday reported a 13.5 per cent rise in sales to over 6.5 lakh units in May over the previous month. 


YES Bank shares rise on fundraising planFacing investor wrath over actual amount of its stressed assets, YES Bank is in talks with two private equity investors – Advent International and Apax Partners – to raise equity funds to build investor confidence after attempts for a share sale to a broader set of institutional investors did not materialise, ET reported, quoting two people familiar with the matter. Shares of YES Bank settled 0.95 per cent higher at Rs 149.35.


Bajaj Auto jumps 4%Shares of Bajaj Auto settled at Rs 3,039.90, up 3.92 per cent after the company reported 3 per cent increase in total sales in May at 4,19, 235 units as against 4,07,044 units in the same month previous year.


42 stocks enter oversold zoneMomentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 42 stocks in the oversold zone on BSE. Among them were, IIFL Holdings, Manpasand Beverages, Fiberweb (India), Sadhana Nitro Chem and White Organic Agro. However, Tata Teleservices, Esaar (India), PNC Infratech and Maithan Alloys were among the 25 stocks that entered the overbought zone."
1,2019-06-04,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: As the Nifty50 rules at all-time high, market breadth remains tepid, raising questions over the sustainability of the recent bounce.

More and more midcap and smallcap stocks are signalling bearish trends than the ones sending out bullish signals, suggests MACD, or moving average convergence divergence.

The momentum indicator signalled a bearish crossover – a sign of bearish undertone – on 46 counters, hinting at possible downsides.

These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included many midcap and smallcap names, including Aurobindo Pharma, NCC, Reliance Infrastructure, UltraTech Cement, Repco Home Finance, Opto Circuits India, Sintex Plastics, SRF and Kwality. 

Mastek, Ujaas Energy, IPCA Labs, Parag Milk Foods, Man Industries, Simplex Infra, Minda Industries, Aarti Drugs and Gallant Ispat are a few other companies on the list.









The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, 10 stocks are showing bullish trends on NSE. The list included Havells India, Ajanta Pharma, Orient Refectories, Hatsun Agro and recently listed Chalet Hotels. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, analysts maintain a positive stance, but believe weak market breadth could be a worry. Besides, some momentum oscillators suggest the stocks have become oversold.

“The current chart pattern signals the possibility of a breakout of a recent upward range movement. But the overall market breadth was not impressive on Monday, with midcaps and smallcaps rising only marginally. The next upside range to watch out for is at 12,150-12,180,” said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. 

Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking expects ‘gravity defying’ moves in coming days despite some of the momentum oscillators being in the overbought territories.

Nifty target for December 2019 is 13,000 and its model portfolio is set to outperform the benchmark target. The market is likely to see reduced volatility and broader market participation is expected, going forward, the report said.

""Both selection and allocation effect were positive for the month. R Model Portfolio has consistently outperformed the benchmark index in the last 6 months (4 months out of last 6) notwithstanding the higher market volatility.

""Key takeaways of the last month's performance are , according to the report - ""IT surprises with significant Outperformance as May'19 was quite eventful with the incumbent NDA coming back to power with a thumping majority. Though the outcome of General Elections was on expected lines, the outperformance of IT sector was surprising considering it is an export dominated sector. Our overweight allocation in the sector with focus on small allocation to Sonata Software delivered a decent alpha"".

R-Sec said on materials and Consumer Discretionary Allocation where the weightage is Outperformance. The report says: Cement sector reported a strong operating and earnings performance in Q4FY19. Conspicuously, the sector is seeing sustainability of price hikes leading to improvement in sectoral earnings visibility.

On Banking and Pharmaceuticals Allocation , the report says ""our Banking sector allocation underperformed in May'19 led by sharp price correction in Yes Bank and not having any PSU bank in our portfolio. While we are positive on SBI, we will look at adding SBI at lower levels, as it has seen a sharp run-up in the past month.

4,2019-06-05,UltraTech,"India’s cement industry, the second-biggest in the world, is set to cement its pricing power locally after a prolonged phase of capacity overhang that had prevented previous attempts at increasing realisations.

Last fiscal year was favourable for the cement industry for several reasons. First, the industry clocked double-digit volume growth for the first time in the past nine years. Second, even capacity utilisation, which reached close to 71%, improved 5% on year — the highest in the past seven years. Third, cement prices climbed about 2% in FY19. Fuel costs also declined, in lockstep with crude prices.

This year, the industry is expected to build on the achievements of FY19 and enhance realisations, by 2-5%. Infrastructure investments by the government should aid that effort. In each of the next five years, the Central government is expected to build about 6,000 km length of roads. Besides this, the low-cost housing segment is also likely to boost cement demand. Analysts point out that the government’s investments in infrastructure and its focus on the pace of execution should help sustain cement prices within a favourable range.


Sustainability of cement prices would determine the attractiveness of cement stocks. Given the present situation, companies in the northern, central, and eastern regions are likely to show better revenue growth for FY20. UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement, Ramco, JK Lakshmi Cement, and Orient Cement are expected to report higher realisations of at least 4% in FY20.

In the past four months, cement stocks are up in the range of 35-40% and trading at premium valuation to historical averages. Premium valuations are expected to be undergirded by expectations of higher volumes and realisations in FY20."

9,2019-06-08,UltraTech,"Domestic equity investors took money off the table for the week ended June 7, sending benchmark equity indices down for the first time in four weeks. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty kicked off the truncated week on a positive note after Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched Rs 1 lakh crore in May 2019 as compared to Rs 94,016 crore in the year-ago period.

Markets participants ignored CSO data which showed that economic growth slowed to a 5-year low of 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, pushing India behind China, due to a poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

However, sentiments got dampened after a private weather forecaster Skymet Weather said the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. Also, lack of a comment from RBI on the on-going NBFC crisis overshadowed the 25 bps rate cut and change in stance.

However, some buying on Friday capped the downside.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Markets started the holiday trimmed week on a positive note. The momentum was triggered by weakness in crude oil prices and hopes of RBI cutting rates in the bi-monthly policy. But the momentum was short-lived and markets traded lower after RBI cut repo rates by 25 bps and changed stance to accommodative from neutral that came mostly in expected lines. No further comments by RBI regarding the on-going NBFC funding crisis was taken as a surprise by the market that added to the negativity.”

As a result, the BSE Sensex closed 98.30 points, or 0.25 per cent down at 39,615.90 on June 7 against 39714.20 on May 31. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index closed 52.15 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 11,870.65.

Technical Analyst - Institutional Desk, Ashika Stock Broking


Where are We? Despite a strong start at the beginning of the month, the index failed to add further gains. The market breadth didn’t mirror the strength as the Nifty has shown in last few of the trading session while it continues to trade sideways with a minor loss. The whole lot of news flow kept market participants baffled despite a consensus for a price correction. Among the sectoral indices, strong underperformance is being witnessed in Nifty pharma, reality and media indices, which have fallen more than 4 per cent. The mid- & small-cap indices also failed to sustain at the intermediate highs and traded lower.


What is in Store? After a prolonged phase of indecision, the Nifty is now trading above the overhead resistance of 11,760 mark. Since the breakout, it’s trading sideways and well above the 50-DMA. However, a sharp reversal on June 6 and successive close below the 12,040 mark indicate short-term underperformance is likely. A breakaway gap with low pivot of 11,590 shall limit the downside. The broader range in the short-term remains in the 11,590-12,040 band.


What could Investors Do? Open interest concentration of both weekly and monthly expiry are at the strike of 12,000 CE, this in turn indicates that market participants expect a limited upside and 12,000 remain a key hurdle in the short term. We expect follow-up correction in the Bajaj Auto, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and UltraTech Cement. While Power Grid, RIL and Cummins India are likely to trade with a positive bias and may rally 5 per cent."

16,2019-06-19,UltraTech,"Brokerages remain cautious on the cement sector as price increases that began in April have failed to sustain.

Sluggish demand and the onset of monsoons suggest price moderation should continue and margins could peak near term in the June quarter.

Cement prices in June 2019 have corrected by 2 per cent or Rs 7 per kg, reversing the increase in May.

While Ambuja Cement and ACC declined 5 per cent each in the past month, UltraTech gained just a percent. The other two cement majors such as Shree Cement and Grasim gained 5 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.

“We see June quarter cement prices and margins at near-term peak and expect price moderation to continue,” said Sumangal Nevatia, analyst, Kotak Securities. “We believe large capacity addition will keep industry utilisations low over the next two years and will restrict sustainable improvement in margins.”

Companies such as ACC, Ambuja Cement and Grasim are currently trading 12 times their FY20 estimated EV/EBITDA. Shree Cement and UltraTech Cement are trading at 16 times. “We maintain a cautious stance on the cement sector on expensive valuations of large-cap cement names at 12-16 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA,” said Nevatia.

Analysts believe that steep increases in cement prices are not sustainable and there could be a decline once the demand from non-trade segment improves.



“Although cement prices have not seen much of a correction in North, demand has taken a knock and this remains a cause for concern,” said Sanjeev Kumar Singh, analyst, Emkay. “Most (dealers) expect some decline in cement prices going forward and some of them believe average price increase in FY20 should be limited to 3-4 per cent year-on-year”.

Sales volumes for the industry has seen a steep decline after March 2019.

In April the decline was 3.2 per cent yearon-year and 14.9 in May. Volumes for June are expected to fall by14-17 per cent year-on-year. This seems to be driven by higher spending during the pre-election period, unavailability of labour and surging temperatures. Industry experts, however, believe that the liquidity crunch has had a greater impact in causing demand to soften."

18,2019-06-21,UltraTech,"Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO at Acepro (Sarthi) Advisors, says while the Modi government maintained high focus on the infra sector all through past five years, somehow that did not percolate down to an improvement in financials of these companies and bigger infra names did not perform. That makes him wary of this basket of stocks, Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW


ET Now: Everyone heaved a sigh of relief looking at the way some of the beaten down, chopped out, out of fashion stocks made a comeback yesterday. Would you take heart from Thursday's price action or would you ignore it completely?


Kunj Bansal: I would ignore it completely. But that is not where the story ends. We have to look at a few other factors.

To arrive at a market view for the shorter term is always difficult. But still if one has to take a call, you have to look at the overall scenario and it certainly does not look good. The support from earnings growth has not been there for last three to four quarters. Inflation is under control, global oil prices although have come up in last two days but are still under reasonable control. With the Budget coming up, what will happen to fiscal deficit is a big question. Tax collections have not been growing and, to that extent, there are more negative factors and lesser positives. But still, the market is close to lifetime high, at least in terms of the largecap indices.

Broadly, liquidity inflow continues from domestic institutions. In terms of global institutions, flows are sometimes there, sometimes not. We are in a dichotomic situation in a market, as the supporting factors are not there but the market is still at a lifetime high.

Now, the market has largely remained rangebound in last one month and that is why Thursday’s comeback is probably ignorable. We might continue to remain in the range that we are in. One thing to look forward to is the Budget, and also how the monsoon plays out. June quarter numbers, in my view, are not likely to be great. The market will continue to remain rangebound at least till the Budget is out.


ET Now: The realty sector has been under pain, and you do not really expect a revival soon. What is making select stocks like a Godrej Properties or a DLF move? Are they good investment propositions even after the recent run-up?


Kunj Bansal: We all know expectation around RERA implementation has played out, that bigger players will benefit and weaker ones will move out of the market, selling their shares to larger companies. Consolidation is definitely in the offing and will continue. Among those large players, one factor investors are seeking is quality of management in terms of reputation, corporate governance, credibility, ethical practices; and the second is financials in terms of lower leverage. Companies that have both these characteristics would be clear beneficiaries.

That is where stocks like Godrej Properties fit in. They are ethical across business practices, especially in the real estate business,. The agreements were always drafted in a way that they were in favour of the builders and not in the favour of buyers so that is where the stocks like Godrej Property came in and displayed quality management, controlled financials and low leverage.

More importantly, whatever money is coming to the market is looking to invest in only two kinds of stock -- one where there is a clear continuation of growth. On a broader basis, growth has fallen to mid-single to high single digits across almost all sectors. Investors ploughing in money are looking for companies, and not sectors, that are still showing 15-20 per cent kind of growth rate. Secondly, the money is not finding high growth ideas and quality names. It is going into the established businesses with quality managements and that is what is helping these stocks continue an upward trend.


ET Now: What are some of your stock picks, particularly from those segments of the market where we see some excitement, be it infrastructure, engineering or cement?


Kunj Bansal: I am still not positive on infrastructure, despite the same government having come back. We saw high focus by this government on this space earlier also, and we will likely to continue seeing that now. Of course, the Budget will make it clear, but somehow that does not percolate down to an improvement in financials of infrastructure companies. In last four-five years, we have not seen any of the bigger infrastructure names performing. So, we are not really positive there. Although cement stocks are at high valuations, it looks like their demand will continue. In the midcap cement space, Ramco Cement is a good buy and in largecap space UltraTech Cement can be looked at. In the BFSI space, City Union Bank is a good buy. Old generation banks should perform in the short term. If not, then they will certainly perform in the medium term."

20,2019-06-24,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: After opening some 100 points higher, domestic equity benchmark Sensex slipped into the negative territory within the first hour of trade on Monday.

A surge in crude oil prices on worries over heightened tensions between the US and Iran, subdued rupee and uncertainty ahead of the Union Budget made investors to turn risk averse. The rupee opened 3 paise down at 69.61 against the US dollar on Monday. 

Sluggish progress of monsoon is also a concern; 84 per cent of the meteorological subdivisions have recorded deficient rainfall so far, MeT department data showed.

Mixed trading in other Asian markets amid hopes of thaw in Sino-US trade tensions failed to boost sentiment. The US President and his Chinese counterpart are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit and discuss the trade dispute later this week. Analysts advised caution. A stock-specific approach in such an unstable market can help maximise gains and minimise losses, they said.

Based on the recommendations of various analysts and brokerages, here is a list of 9 stocks that they say can potentially deliver gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical Analyst, HDFC securities

Timken India | Buy | Target price: Rs 790 | Stop loss: Rs 655
Timken has shown a lot of relative strength of late. The stock has broken out of the Rs 500-625 range a few weeks back on above average volumes. This shows significant accumulation has happened on this counter and it augurs well for the uptrend to continue. While the stock has consolidated for the past few weeks after the recent breakout, it has bounced back strongly from the low of Rs 652 this week. The stock has moved above its 13-day SMA. The 14-day RSI, too, has turned up and cut its nine-day EMA from below. ""Technical indicators for the intermediate term are giving positive signals. Buy this stock between Rs 680 and Rs 699 levels with a stop loss at Rs 655 and a price target of Rs 790,"" said Gangadharan.


Godrej Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 525 | Stop loss: Rs 445
Godrej Industries has bounced back strongly this week from the low of Rs 443, thereby forming a double bottom. The stock previously tested these levels in the middle of May, 2019. Technical indicators are giving positive signals, as the stock trades almost above the 13-day SMA. The 14-day RSI has turned up and cut its nine-day EMA from below. The MACD, too, has turned up and is now on the verge of cutting its moving average.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking

UltraTech Cement | Buy | Target price: Rs 4,890 | Stop loss: Rs 4,425
This stock had seen a bullish breakout in April after breaking out of the Rs 4,500 level, which acted as a stiff resistance for four times in the last two years. After the breakout, the stock witnessed a sharp bounce towards the Rs 4,900 level. However, in last few weeks prices have retraced back to the breakout levels, a natural tendency in price movement before achieving bigger targets.

On the weekly chart, prices seem to have resumed the primary uptrend by forming a bullish reversal pattern in the breakout zone. Volume analysis indicated high volume during the bounce, whereas comparatively low volumes during a downturn suggested accumulation on the counter. After forming a base around 40, momentum oscillator RSI gave a fresh buy signal with its smoothened average supporting a bullish view.


Dr Lal Path Labs | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,310 | Stop loss: Rs 1,065
After consolidating for last six months, this stock has broken above the higher range of consolidation, confirming a bullish pattern breakout, known as ‘Cup N Handle’. Momentum oscillator RSI has broken above the 60 range, which acted as a stiff hurdle four times in last three months. In addition, prices are well above major moving averages such as 20, 50, 200 days, which indicate overall bullishness on the counter.


Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities

Ambuja Cements | Buy | Target price: Rs 236 | Stop loss: Rs 201
This stock has found multiple supports around Rs 200 level after witnessing a sharp drop from Rs 245 mark over the past one year. A positive crossover in RSI and rise in Stochastic from its oversold zone indicate a probable turnaround in the stock. ""As per the current daily set-up, the stock may keep moving higher and revisit previous highs. Fresh long positions can be initiated in the stock for a target of Rs 236 with a stop loss of Rs 201,” said Jain.


Bank of Baroda | Buy | Target price: Rs 135 | Stop loss: Rs 110
This stock reversed from its lifetime high and later took multiple supports near its long-term 200-day moving average. Due to a rebound in the stock, key technical indicators-RSI and MACD have breached their bearish divergence trend. ""As per the current set-up and positive momentum in the sector, we believe the stock will bounce at least 50 per cent of the entire fall from current levels,"" Jain said.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher

Engineers India | Buy | Target price: Rs 130 | Stop loss: Rs 111
This stock has made a higher bottom formation on the daily chart, taking support near Rs 111 level. It has bounced back with a positive candle to move past the significant 200-DMA and has implied strength and potential to rise further in the coming days. The RSI has also indicated a trend reversal to improve the bias and has given a buy signal. ""With good volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 130, keeping a stop loss of Rs 111,"" said Parekh.


State Bank of India (SBI) | Buy | Target price: Rs 375 | Stop loss: Rs 333
This stock has maintained a good support near the Rs 334 level and has been consolidating for some time. ""It currently has indicated a positive candle with improving bias and we anticipate a further move in the upward direction in the coming days,"" Parekh said. The indicators have become favourable, with the RSI also indicating a trend reversal has given a buy signal.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

SRF | Buy | Target price: Rs 3,241 | Stop loss: Rs 2,848
This counter appears to be having a better relative strength when compared to Nifty. While Nifty has been falling for the last three weeks, this stock not only stabilised but went on to register new life-time highs. ""As the trend across the timeframes is strong, positional traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on dips, preferably around Rs 2,900 and look for a bigger target of Rs 3,241,"" said Mohammad.


UltraTech Cement | Buy | Target price: 4,790 | Stop loss: Rs 4,420
This counter appears to have formed a decent base around Rs 4,425 from where a decent pullback move can be expected. However, as the right technical stop is looking slightly far away, positional traders will be better off by buying now and on declines, especially in the zone of Rs 4,510–4,470 and look for a target of Rs 4,790, with a stop loss Rs 4,420 levels, said Mohammad.

24,2019-06-27,UltraTech,"The Emami Group is in exploratory talks with investors such as UltraTech Cement and private equity funds including KKR and Temasek Holdings to sell stakes in the cement business, valuing it at Rs 5,000-5,500 crore, said people aware of the matter. The Kolkata-based group is trying to reduce debt and focus on its core consumer business.

The Emami management hasn’t yet decided on whether it should exit fully or partially or undertake asset-level disposals of mines and plants. Emami Ltd shot up by 9.3 per cent to end at Rs 317.95 on Wednesday. It has however dropped 12 per cent in the past month compared with little change in the broader Sensex.

The cement business recently received regulatory clearance for an initial public offer (IPO). It’s looking to raise about Rs 1,000 crore through the proposed IPO, which included new shares worth Rs 500 crore, and the rest as an offer for sale from existing promoters.

Investment bank Nomura, also one of the advisors to the IPO, has been roped in for negotiations on a sale.

Earlier in the week, the promoters of the diversified Emami Group — with interests in fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG), paper, real estate and cement — sold an additional 10 per cent stake to raise Rs 1,230 crore and pare debt. In February, the promoters offloaded the first tranche of 10 per cent for Rs 1,600 crore. With the latest sale, the promoters' stake in Emami has dropped to 52.73 per cent, having divested 45.4 million shares in total.

Company executives told ET that the stake sale was primarily to reduce the debt at the promoter level, which now stands at Rs 2,200 crore.



“Currently, our primary objective and endeavour is to pare the promoter debt to almost zero in six-eight months. There will not be any further dilution of stake in Emami Ltd,” said Mohan Goenka, director, Emami Group. “We are a diverse group and have many assets of value which can be monetised. We are exploring all options, including strategic divestment, initial public offering or stake sale in group assets within the next six-eight months with an effort to meet our objective of debt reduction.”

KKR, UltraTech and Temasek declined to comment.

Emami Cement currently operates three manufacturing facilities at Risda in Madhya Pradesh, Panagrah in West Bengal and Bhabua in Bihar with a total capacity of 5.6 million tonnes. In addition, the firm has mining assets in Guntur in Andhra and near Jaipur in Rajasthan.

Emami started its cement business in 2007 and markets the product under the Double Bull brand. The company’s primary market encompasses West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

The group has a distribution network of more than 2,200 dealers and over 5,000 retailers in 160 districts, according to its prospectus. In addition, it has set up 110 warehouse-cum-sale depots at various locations to ensure efficient distribution.

Founded in 1974 by RS Agarwal and RS Goenka, Emami owns businesses in sectors ranging from FMCG and personal care to healthcare, cement, newsprint and paperboard, biodiesel and edible oil, real estate, solar power, writing instruments and pharmacy retail.

UltraTech, part of the Aditya Birla Group, has been consolidating through large acquisitions. It acquired part of JP Associates’ cement business in 2017.

KKR and Temasek have been looking at cement assets in the country. KKR bought Dalmia Cements and sold it in 2017 at a 150 per cent return in less than two years. KKR has also invested in south India-based Bhavya Cements through a structured credit deal. The PE firm was also in discussions with the Kolkataheadquartered group for a Rs 1,000 crore structured funding line, ET reported in February 15, but that did not materialise.

Temasek, among others, was eyeing a stake of up to 20 per cent in Wonder Cement, though the talks are yet to be concluded."
23,2019-06-27,UltraTech,"There is a stark divergence between Nifty constituents on both performance and valuations with one segment trading at a substantial premium and the other at a huge discount to the long-term average, said domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, adding that there is limited headroom for valuation re-rating at index level given the continued downside risks.

Some of the stocks where valuations are at a substantial discount to long period average are Eicher Motors, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coal India and ONGC, said the brokerage.

Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, Titan Company, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever and UltraTech Cement are trading at a substantial premium to their respective five or ten-year average price-to-earnings or price-tobook multiples, said Motilal Oswal.

Predicting the timing of fortune reversal for these names is always fraught with risks, more so in the current underlying economic scenario, the brokerage said.

“This polarisation on performance and valuations clearly underscores two things: one, investors taking continued refuge in the quality/earnings predictability theme in an environment of economic slowdown and two, there is a lack of pick-up in broader market’s earnings growth,” said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage said that the revival in Nifty earnings in FY20 is predicated on normalisation of credit costs in the banking sector. The banking, financial services and insurance space is expected to account for 70% of incremental earnings for the Nifty in FY20, the brokerage said.

“At 19.5x FY20E P/E, we do not see material room for further valuation re-rate,” said Motilal Oswal.

ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Titan, L&T, Coal India, Infosys, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki India are top large-cap ideas of Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage’s mid-cap picks include Federal Bank, DCB Bank, Indian Hotels, Crompton Consumer, KEC International, Ashoka Buildcon, Aditya Birla Fashion and Zensar."

25,2019-06-28,UltraTech,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 26 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

IIFL has maintained buy rating on ICICI Lombard with a 12-month target price of Rs 1,300. The company's FY19 annual report highlights investments in technology and virtual offices, which enable it to gain market share, IIFL said. ICICI Lombard is our top stock pick for 2019, the brokerage said, and forecasts a 33 per cent EPS Cagr over FY19-21. Shares of ICICI Lombard gained 0.36 per cent to Rs 1,121.30 on Thursday.


Jefferies has maintained its buy rating on UPL with a target price of Rs 1,125. The brokerage believes, UPL's recent acquisition of Arysta LifeScience is likely to catapult UPL as the 5th largest agrochemical firm globally. For FY20, UPL management expects capex outlay of approximately Rs 2,000 crore, the brokerage said. Shares of UPL declined 1.52 per cent to Rs 943.30 on Thursday.


Elara Capital has changed rating of Yes Bank to reduce from Sell and lowered its target price from Rs 192 to Rs 107. The brokerage believes further deterioration in asset quality in addition to delays in equity raising would increase volatility in the stock price. The bank's bond and nonconvertible debenture exposure to the DHFL and Anil Ambani groups have slipped to below investment grade and the composition of below investment grade loan portfolio is likely to rise by another 100bp, the brokerage said. Shares of Yes Bank declined half a percent to Rs 112.40 on Thursday.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has maintained buy rating on UltraTech Cement with a target price of Rs 5,280. The acquisition of Century’s cement asset and Binani has led to the company increasing its capacity market share and take its pan-India capacity market share to 20 per cent, the brokerage said. Over FY13-19, while compounded annual growth in operating profit stood at 7 per cent, profit after tax remained almost stable due to higher interest cost, the brokerage said. Shares of Ultratech Cement ended flat at Rs 4,605 on Thursday.

IIFL has initiated coverage on HG Infra Engineering with a target price of Rs 364. Revenue CAGR of 35 per cent over FY13-19 has largely come on the back of in-house construction with owned equipment, growing employee base and improving scale & processes, said IIFL. Existing order book of Rs 6,200 crore provides growth visibility for FY20-21, while a comfortable balance sheet with net debt equity of 0.4 times gives comfort on ability to bid for and execute the upcoming EPC and HAM project pipeline from NHAI, said IIFL. Shares of HG Infra ended up 2.4 per cent at Rs 280.45 on Thursday."

Even though margins suffered due to cost pressures, operating cash flows remained healthy, net debt/Ebitda increased from 2.3 in FY18 to 2.9 in FY19,"" said the brokerage.

According to UTCEM’s management, in FY19, India’s total cement capacity stood at 480 metric tonne (mt); of this, nearly 12mt was added during the year. 

Demand in FY19 increased 13 per cent, the highest growth since FY10. Demand growth from infrastructure was healthy, driven by the government’s focus on roads, metro rail projects, airports renovation, irrigation projects, etc. 

While there has been significant improvement in low-cost houses constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yozana (PMAY) in rural areas, the affordable housing segment in urban areas is also gaining momentum. As a result, the industry witnessed utilization improvement of 5pp over the previous year, reaching a utilization of 71 per cent. 

The company expects further improvement in utilization on likely sustained demand growth with incremental new supplies at a slower pace vis-à-vis the increment demand.

UTCEM’s total cement capacity reached 94.75mt in India due to the greenfield expansion at Dhar (3.5mt) and the acquisition of Binani’s assets (6.25mt). 

Along with its other subsidiary, Star Cement, the company’s total capacity stands at 98.75mt currently. Cement production jumped 17 per cent— from 57.23mt in the previous year to 67.20mt currently. 

The increase in production was on account of healthy cement demand growth and benefits from increased utilization of the capacities acquired (JPA) in FY18, where utilization improved from 53 per cent in the previous year to 72 per cent. 

Domestic sales volume registered a 20 per cent growth, which is higher as compared to the industry growth of nearly 13 per cent.

UTCEM’s raw material cost per tonne increased 4 per cent from Rs 819 per tonne to 854 per tonne due to higher slag, iron ore, aluminous clay and fly-ash prices. 

Also, it faced additional limestone costs due to transfer of limestone mines. Power and fuel cost per tonne increased 12 per cent year-on-year (YoY) as imported pet coke prices increased 6 per cent from $96 per tonne to $102 per tonne. Also, there was 8 per cent currency depreciation over the previous year.

The increase in freight cost due to higher diesel prices was partially negated with optimization of lead distance, realization of synergy benefits from the acquisition and the commissioning of 3.5mt capacity in Madhya Pradesh. 

During the year, company reduced the overall lead distance by nearly 5 per cent over the previous year (10 per cent since Jun’17). As a result of the increase in costs, the company’s consolidated Ebitda per tonne decreased by 7 per cent YoY to Rs 888. 

Consolidated Ebitda grew 10 per cent to Rs 6,800 crore in FY19. Over FY13-19, while Ebitda CAGR stood at 7 per cent, PAT remained almost stable due to higher interest cost. Over FY17-19 too, Ebitda CAGR stood at 14 per cent due to the JPA acquisition, but PAT CAGR was down 5 per cent. 

As per the brokerage, the company made several efforts to reduce the impact of rising costs. 

Total share of renewable energy (WHRS, Solar and Wind power) was 100bp higher over the previous year, increasing to 8.5 per cent. During the year, the company commissioned 26MW WHRS capacity, which is still under ramp-up; its full benefit should be realized FY20 onwards. 

Also, UTCEM is setting up 46MW WHRS capacity, which should get commissioned in FY21. This would cater to nearly 12 per cent of the company’s current total power requirement. 

UTCEM has also entered into agreements with third parties for procuring solar power under the ‘group captive scheme’, which is under implementation. 

The overall capacity of such tie-ups will increase from 62.5MW to over 500MW by end-FY21 and will cater to nearly 10 per cent of the company’s total power requirement.

Work on the 4.0 MTPA Bara Grinding unit is progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be commissioned by Q2FY20. 

Further, the company has plans to spend nearly Rs 2,000 crore in FY20, on the remaining work at Bara, WHRS projects, development of coal blocks at Bicharpur, packaging terminal at Mumbai, wall care putty projects and other normal maintenance capex. 

Moreover, the Century deal has received approval from the stock exchanges, the Competition Commission of India and shareholders. The deal now awaits approval of the National Company Law Tribunal, the Mumbai Bench and other regulatory authorities. 

At the consolidated level, the cash flow from operations after working capital changes grew by 33 per cent to Rs 5,200 crore. 

Also, working capital increased by Rs 930 crore in FY19 as compared to an increase of Rs 1,250 crore in the previous year. 

Capex for the year stood at Rs 1,500 crore as against Rs 1,900 crore in FY18. As a result, free cash flow increased by 82 per cent YoY to Rs 3,650 crore. 

At the standalone level, cash flow from operations grew 48 per cent to Rs 5,300 crore. Working capital increased by Rs 4,600 crore in FY19 as compared to an increase of Rs 1,260 crore in the previous year. 

Consolidated gross debt for the company increased to Rs 22,800 crore in FY19 (Rs 19,400 crore in FY18). 

Net debt for the company as of FY19 stands at Rs 19,600 crore. Net debt/Ebitda for the company increased from 2.3 to 2.9 in FY19. At the standalone level, investments increased as the Company infused funds to the extent of Rs 3,400 crore for the acquisition of UNCL.


Valuation and view
The acquisition of Century’s cement asset and Binani has led to UTCEM increasing its capacity market share and take its pan-India capacity market share to 20 per cent. 

""The acquisition of Binani’s asset by UTCEM is attractive as it provides scope for further brownfield expansion by 4-5mt,"" said the brokerage. 

The ramp-up of Binani’s assets and the Rs 740 per tonne improvement in profitability has been attractive. 

The company trades at 17.7 times/14 times EV on FY20/21E Ebitda. 

""We value UTCEM at 14.5 times September 21 EV/Ebitda and arrive at a target price of Rs 5,280 (implied EV per tonne of $215 on FY21 capacity),"" said the brokerage."

In the past three years, in terms of returns, ET Cement Index (covers key cement companies) and ET Construction Index (covers prominent construction companies) have been unable to beat the benchmark index Nifty by a wide margin. A key cause for this has been valuation of these companies. But now, with the broad market fall, the valuation of select cement and construction companies seemed to be in the fair range.

To boost further sentiment in these counters is the proposed investments in the infrastructure segment by the government in the Union Budget. Let us understand investments in the housing sector. As regards, urban areas, the government has sanctioned close to Rs 4.83 lakh crore in order to construct 81 lakh houses. According to the Union Budget document, construction of 47 lakh houses have already begun. As regards rural areas, through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), between FY20 and FY22, the government proposes to construct 1.95 crore houses. In the past five years, the government has constructed close to 1.54 crore rural homes.

In the third phase of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the government plans to construct 1,25,000 km of roads in the next five years. This would entail an estimated investment of Rs 80250 crore. In all, the government plans to invest Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure sector in the next five years.

Among the construction companies, select well-placed companies which have superior execution capabilities and relatively higher number of financial closure to their projects are likely to see increased interest from the street. These companies are KNR Constructions, PNC Infratech, Dilip Buildcon and Ashoka Buildcon. Among cement companies, those companies which have enhanced capacity through acquisition or organic route, stand to benefit considerably. These companies are Ultratech Cement, Dalmia Bharat, Shree Cement, and The Ramco Cements. 

In the past three years, ET Cement index has given 22 per cent returns while Nifty has given 45.6 per cent in the same period. In the past three years, ET Construction index has given 48.9 per cent while the Nifty has given 45.6 per cent in the same period. In the next three years, the aforementioned counters are likely to generate high interest given the increase source of orders from the government's humongous investments in infrastructure sector."

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 13 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

CLSA has retained sell rating on Bharti Infratel with a target price of Rs 250. Bharti Infratel’s merger with Indus Towers is likely in the coming months, said CLSA. This partstock/part-cash merger will have limited opex synergies, though mergeco EPS will be boosted by Indus Towers, said CLSA. Bharti Infratel’s elusive tenancy growth in the medium term underlines negative stock view, it said. Shares of Bharti Infratel ended up 1.85 per cent at Rs 264.70 on Thursday.


ICICI Securities maintained buy rating on UltraTech Cement with a target price of Rs 5,200. Acquisition of Binani Cement resulted in creation of intangible assets of Rs 17.1 billion, goodwill of Rs 17.6 billion and assets held for disposal (to be monetised likely in FY20) at Rs 550 crore, said ICICI Securities. With the integration and ramp-up of acquired assets largely behind, UltraTech's focus would shift to improving margins /return ratios and deleveraging the balance sheet. Shares of UltraTech Cement ended up 1.3 per cent at Rs 4536.30 on Thursday.


Kotak Institutional Equities maintained buy rating on Ashok Leyland with fair value of Rs 130. Ashok Leyland reported strong revenue growth in FY19 led by strong volume growth in the domestic M&HCV and LCV markets, the brokerage said. However, EBITDA margin declined due to intense competition and high discounting, it said. The brokerage expects the M&HCV industry to grow at a healthy pace in the medium term led by strong growth in infra activities and prebuying due to BS-VI emission norms. Shares of Ashok Leyland ended up 0.41 per cent at Rs 85.15 on Thursday.

Investec Securities has reiterated its hold rating on HDFC with a target price of Rs 2,215. HDFC remains the best quality housing finance company; however, growth and RoE of 16 per cent plus over the medium term seems difficult, said Investec. HDFC is cautious on wholesale segment, which grew 8 per cent YoY in FY19, said Investec. The focus on affordable housing was noted, but growth needs to pick up in medium/ high-income segment, said Investec. Shares of HDFC ended up 1.5 per cent at Rs 2261.45 on Thursday.

HSBC has retained buy rating on Cadila Healthcare and reduced the target price to Rs 260 from Rs 410. The brokerage expects clarity to emerge on FDA status of Moraiya plant by early August 2019. Looking at market dynamics and competitive scenario for key Heinz brands, growth of 6-7 per cent per annum looks reasonable, HSBC said. India sales should see recovery from Q2 of FY20, HSBC said. Shares of Cadila ended up 2.6 per cent at Rs 234.35 on Thursday."

Emami Group., an Indian conglomerate that runs businesses from cosmetics to a paper mill, has picked Arpwood Capital Ltd. and Credit Suisse Group AG to manage the sale of its cement unit, people familiar with the matter said.

The bankers will start reaching out to prospective buyers for Emami Cement Ltd., seeking a valuation of about $1 billion, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. A decision is yet to be made about the size of the stake to be sold and the group can add more managers for the deal later, the people said.

The Kolkata-based conglomerate led by R. S. Agarwal and R.S. Goenka is joining tycoons including Anil Ambani and Subhash Chandra in selling assets to pare debt as a cash crunch in Indian markets increase funding costs. In June the founders of the group sold about 10% stake in it its listed flagship Emami Ltd. to trim borrowings.

The conglomerate, which makes Boro Plus cream and herbal products under the Zandu brand, is in discussions with investors including UltraTech Cement Ltd., KKR & Co, and Temasek Holdings Pte. for a stake sale in the cement unit, the Economic Times reported in June.

16,2019-07-16,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices have turned rangebound amid economic uncertainty and earnings jitters. Investors are in wait-and-watch mode to see earnings catch up with valuations, though analysts are not sure that is happening anytime soon.

Despite this, over three dozen largecap and midcap stocks on NSE could see strong price-wise action in the coming days. Some 41 stocks are looking strong on technical charts for a bounce, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. These counters have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Infosys, Asian Paints, Jindal Steel & Power, United Spirits, JSW Steel and UltraTech Cement besides HDFC Life Insurance, Equitas Holdings, DCB Bank, Quess Corp, GSPL, IGL, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Tata Sponge Iron, among others. 







The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile 69 stocks are showing a bearish trend. They Bharti Airtel, DHFL, Allahabad Bank, Indiabulls Real Estate, Colgate-Palmolive and Petronet LNG.

RBL Bank, UCO Bank, Radico Khaitan, PNB Housing Finance, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, VRL Logistics and The Mandhana Retail are also looking weak on technical charts. 







“Traders could find opportunities on both sides of the trade and, hence, one should remain stock-specific with a proper risk management strategy,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation based on a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, it has been consolidating and its earlier support at 11,640 is acting as a key resistance. “The index needs to convincingly surpass the hurdle in the 11,640-11,700 zone to regain strength. On the flipside, the 11,460-11,430 zone is the immediate support range to watch out for. The index is witnessing a time-wise correction. Unless we see a breakout on either direction, traders should maintain a stock-specific approach,” Chavan said.

The odds are in favour of the bears as long as Nifty50 trades below the swing high of 11,640, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan. “The broader market indices are already reflecting inherent weakness. For Nifty50, the 11,500 and 11,461 levels will be the key levels on the downside below which it will be prone to a larger decline.”


Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of Infosys shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.3 per cent higher at Rs 781.85 on NSE."

19,2019-07-19,UltraTech,"Positive on Britannia and Bharti Airtel among largecaps and KEC International and Kalpataru among midcaps, says Sandip Sabharwal, investment adviser & founder, asksandipsabharwal.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Do you expect Reliance to maintain the same tone which is that the core business is slowing down, the new business is growing and we are excited about it? That is what they told us last time.Yes, that is what they will continue to maintain. What investors will be looking at is the net debt position, given the fact that they still have been investing significantly in telecom. My guess is petrochemical margins could be under a decent amount of pressure because most petrochemical prices actually cracked and the input prices did not crack as much. So, that will also be interesting to watch because that is a big cash cow for Reliance. 


Whether it is a stupid market or a nervous market or a skittish market, we are in a market where a little bit of selling is having a large impact on stocks. Traders and investors are acting first and analysing later. How long will this continue?Looking at things, fundamentally I do not see a very huge downside in the markets. However, as we have been talking since the Budget that the risk of the Indian markets underperforming remains high because of the entire taxation regime etc where the government has refused to budge. It puts a significant pressure and people talk of incremental 2-3% impact but when you have to analyse it from last year, till the last year, long term capital gains tax in India was zero. From zero, it went to 10% and on that you have a surcharge of 37% on the overall. So, the effective tax rate has gone from zero to 14-15%. 

That is going to impact some foreign investors who are looking to invest. On a post tax return basis, India might not be as attractive unless growth picks up significantly. Then no one looks at what taxes they are paying. That is something which could happen but it is not happening as on today. That is the reason we are seeing a disproportionate pull out from equities in India although bonds are getting flows.


For a foreign institutional investor who is coming via a fund based out of Singapore or the US, you can come via the trust route. Individual FPIs who are investing in their individual name will have to pay higher surcharge but the bulk of the money from institutional investors is coming by the company route. So, some would argue nothing changes?Yes, 60% is via company route. It does not change for them but for 40% which is coming via individual and trust route, the tax goes up. Now the government and the finance secretary have been continuously saying that you can convert yourself into a company but then you know how the tax authorities in India are. If they decide to change, then they will come under GAAR and then they will say you are changing just to avoid tax. 

So, it is not such a clean thing in India. The government should have actually said that we give you an open window for the next three months. Whoever converts into a company will face no action from tax authorities. If they just did that. then people could have taken their call. But if they leave it open ended and the tax authorities as it is are under pressure to collect more taxes because the government has aggressive tax revenue targets and the economy is not doing well enough to support that revenue projection. 

These are the issues. Otherwise, given the hugely improved liquidity in the system, given the fact that interest rates are going down, that the government is actually working on other fronts and small strategic disinvestments have been announced, IBC has been tweaked to make it more effective and they have moved very fast on that. There are a lot of things they are doing positively but unfortunately the sentiments are getting impacted by these events. 


What about IndiGo?The result should be pretty good because the ticket rates in the festival season were quite high, especially because Jet went down suddenly and all the advance bookings which people had to do, had happened at a very high rate and to that extent, the first quarter will be pretty good for most of the airlines. Whether the stock reacts to that or not, I am not very sure because one, there is a promoter tussle and second, the second quarter pricing is under quite a bit of pressure.


There is a point of view that once promoters enter into such a public spat, it is unlikely to be resolved, that there will have to be some kind of culmination of this spat with perhaps one of them giving way on their stake or in some way. What do you think the markets would want to hear in terms of commentary on that front?Historically, when such things start, they do not get resolved so fast. To that extent, investors should be wary of that impacting the operations. At this point of time, what the company, the management has been maintaining is that it has no impact on the operations of the company. And if that gets proven over a period of time, then this could go into the background. But given the fact that regulators are also looking into it and this spat is still simmering quite significantly, people need to be wary because hypothetically if one of the promoters which is Mr Gangwal decides to exit, then that exit will have to be at a market price or at a control premium. It involves a huge amount. So, who will fund that? 


We have seen good growth in ACC. Is cement something now to keep on the watch list?Cement is something which we have held more in our portfolios relative to what the weightages are, because my view has been that pricing is back with the companies and demand will be more than supply going forward. However, at this stage, what is happening is the demand has got curtailed because demand growth is not as good. So, demand growth has to pick up for the entire thesis to play as strongly as we think it should so that is something which will need to be monitored over the next few months. Overall, cement is a good space to be in.


What within cement?Among largecaps, we hold UltraTech Cement because it has operations all over and sufficient capacity which can be utilised further because of the acquisitions they have done. We also hold a cheap midcap, India Cements. 


Any thoughts on volatility? How are you reading the fact that the India volatility index is near one-year low? What is it signalling?I would think it is signalling very little trader interest in the markets and people are totally unconvinced about which side the market is going to go. So if VIX is very high, people are convinced are that market is going to fall. Normally VIX is very low if people believe markets are going to rise. But I guess is this time there is a lack of interest and that is leading to this sort of volatility.

I have always maintained that when we look at volatility, it is important to look at global volatility rather than India volatility because that actually determines the trends in global equity markets and there also, volatility has been reasonably suppressed.


We did see sharp selling across some of the PSU names, a lot of them in the energy basket. But it could have been more about the fact that they are all PSUs.Whenever the CPSE ETF comes in, prior to that, we see this sort of selloff in the PSU stocks because people think that they can get in there cheaper and I believe, there is a discount built in for retail investors in that ETF. People try to play that percentage arbitrage. 

I think that CPSE ETF is not a successful product. They have raised Rs 40,000 odd crore till now and the current size is just Rs 8,000-9,000 crore. It has been used as an arbitrage product by the market and this time also the government will collect whatever on disinvestment but then whether that will last in the ETF or not, we do not know.


What are markets pricing? Are markets telling you that Yes Bank is going to go belly up? Will Yes Bank create a systemic risk? If not, how should one understand a)this meltdown in Yes Bank stock; b) their business; c) the growth and d) the capital?Yes Bank is unlikely to go belly up given the fact that banks tend to have retail deposits which are normally sticky. We have not seen a run on bank deposits even in the 2008 crisis. There were rumours, but it never happened because there is some inherent conviction in the minds of depositors that a bank will not be allowed to fail. 

Second, what is most concerning and from the point of view of investors who are looking for returns from Yes Bank, is that their advances are more than their deposits. If your advances are more than the deposits, When the liquidity is ample, then there is no issue and when their rating was top rated, there was no issue. They could borrow in the wholesale markets and fund their retail growth and make much more margins as they did not have the deposits. 

Now it is a different scenario. For them. to get wholesale funding is tougher. It is more expensive and a lot of depositors might actually think that for 1-2% higher rates why should we go for Yes Bank? Why not put it in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, SBI? So, the larger banks tend to benefit today because they get more deposits. That is a bigger risk because what that does now is that the growth will need to be compromised. I think Yes Bank growth will fall significantly. It is difficult for them to grow at all in my view.


Do you think that the fund raise would be a crucial but a significant amount?Yes, the fund raise has to be crucial but today for them to raise $1-1.5 billion at the current market capitalisation is very tough. It is a vicious cycle. They should have done the fundraising much earlier which they did not do, thankfully for the investors who would have come in at that time, they could not do it. It is a tough space they are in. It is very difficult to put an equity value on that stock today because we do not know what the growth is going to be. 

If people are projecting 10% and growth actually is zero, then what happens to the balance sheet because in banks, the NPAs are calculated as a percentage? If your denominator does not grow, then your NPAs as a percentage also might not improve as much. There are a lot of things going on there. 


Some of the names in the auto ancillary space are seeing a little bit of traction coming in. Is there any trend that you are thinking of? Is this very stock specific? Bharat Forge is a case in point. What do you make of the move that we have seen in the account?Bharat Forge has been hit on two sides -- the slowing trucks market in the US and the slowdown in autos in India. But it has been growing its other businesses quite well. It has been getting orders in defence. It has done well in aero space. 

I believe it is a very interesting company at this stage. It is almost half from the top and there are no triggers per se which should take the stock up. But then it is a high quality cheap stock with a very clean balance sheet. I would think that these levels are good for long-term investors. 


Give a few more names that you will be looking at currently. I know you are looking at cement very favourably, any specific names or anything else in the market?There are specific companies across the industries. On the consumer side, given the correction, Britannia is in a good zone today. On the telecom side, if someone wants to play contrarian then Bharti Airtel is ripe for 15 odd per cent kind of returns. 

On the midcap side, we are holding the transmission companies KEC International and Kalpataru, I believe they are reasonably cheap. They have got a good outlook and they benefit from reduction in interest rates because they have reasonable working capital which get re-priced lower. These could be some of the stocks.


What exactly is your take on the IT space?There is a lag in the catch up to digital and I have also observed in the results which have come out till now, that although the larger companies are still coping up with this transformation, ome of the smaller fancied companies are finding it difficult. So the smaller companies are not reporting as good results but the larger ones are reporting good results. My guess is that there will be a derating in the smaller second tier IT companies. 

We have seen MindTree results were not great, Tata Elxsi was not great, yesterday Cyient was not great and I think those companies are now facing the pressure but the larger companies they are still able to cope up and they are growing the digital business significantly."

22,2019-07-19,UltraTech,"There is an extremely good opportunity to buy in the next 10-12 weeks through SIP in select midcaps and large caps, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What should one do with the midcaps that are cracking?The fear is overdone. Market is very despondent and that has more to do with some of the FIIs exiting because of the tax. A large part of the imponderables are on the positive side and we are calling it the 12-week factor, from here till middle of October. October onwards we are very bullish on the market and we think that in this fear, you should do a SIP for the next 10-12 weeks in select midcaps and select largecaps, because we think midcaps maybe on the way to the bottom. This is a very good selloff in the broader market and the largecaps. 

It tells you that inherently over ownership or the exit of some of the FIIs are giving you an opportunity. The cement numbers are a clear indicator for an economy and it says the economy is only going to get better from here. So, there is an extremely good opportunity to buy in the next 10-12 weeks through a SIP in select midcaps and large caps. 


Though the sentiment has turned really sour currently and we have been getting some really dire predictions on liquidity, growth, no one is seeing the light around the corner. We are now hearing an outlook which is a little bit more long term -- four to six quarters -- as opposed to a pick up as early as the festive season or the end of the year? Would you disagree?It is overdone and it is always the screen which tells you. When I was in Mumbai for many years, the best saying was what a Guajarati bhai told me: Bhav bhagwan che. Bhav is what is telling you that the fear is there. That fear is overblown and I am not saying that there is not macro weakness, but look at the cost of money on the bond yields, look at the rupee and global liquidity. It is just a matter of time, maybe once this expiry is over, you should start to see very good inflows from FIIs. 

Wait for the government to start to act on more consumption-led themes. They have already given you a wicket on some of the NBFCs and the recapitalisation of PSBs. Going ahead, they have a good opportunity of instigating growth through a lot of other measures. We are being opposite. We think these 11,400 on the Nifty is an ideal place to start a SIP in both the Nifty, Bank Nifty and select stocks both on largecaps and midcaps. 

After October, you will be very happy that you did this because fear is generally the best time to be contrarian and start to buy.


What is your view on Reliance?Reliance will give a slightly weaker number on the net and we have to see how the GRMs are. But do not miss the wood for the trees. Yesterday, they announced $1 billion capex in the gas basin of KG which is telling you they are putting their money where their mouth is -- whether it is technology in the shape of Jio and the other businesses which are online. They are taking on Netflix in OTT. And on the energy side on gas. In fact, for gas, this participation in new pipeline in partnership with GAIL should see a lot of flows from overseas and Reliance is one of the key players there. 

Any fall over here is a very good opportunity. In fact, Reliance, ITC, UltraTech Cement, ICICI Bank and Sun are five names which we are suggesting to very actively have a large SIP for the next 12 weeks. By the end of the year, you will be much happier that you bought this fear and Reliance would be one of the constituents. We think Reliance by the end of the year and maybe March 2020 should be closer to Rs 1,450-1,500."

3,2019-08-04,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Hopes that the government may exempt FPIs from the income-tax surcharge and do away with the proposal to raise the minimum public shareholding in listed companies to 35 per cent from 25 per cent helped market benchmarks to end with gains on Friday.

Even though it is too early to say that the government will roll back or dilute the provisions, market observers say any such step will stem the market fall.

""The recent selling spree in India can be attributed to higher taxation on trust entities of FPIs combined with the slowdown in the economy. We think soon the government may act by diluting the excessive provisions in the law. That may act as a relief. For that matter, any reversal in the Budget provisions which were taken negatively by the bourses might bring about a relief rally,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote.

Besides, RBI's monetary policy meet, earnings and flow of foreign funds will also influence the market significantly. 


Let's take a look at the factors that will guide Dalal Street in the coming week:


RBI's MPC
Will RBI go for a fourth rate cut in 2019 coming Wednesday? Economists and market observers say, probably yes, due to benign inflation and clear signs of weakness in the economy. As per a survey by Reuters, almost 80 per cent of 66 economists polled expected RBI to cut the repo rate by 25 bps. If it does materialise, the market will have a reason to rejoice. 


Key June quarter earnings
Among sectoral majors, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Titan, HCL Technologies, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Steel, Ultratech Cement, BPCL, Cadila Healthcare and GAIL will come out with their June quarter numbers during the week. While the numbers so far have been uninspiring, a continuation of this trend will further weigh on market sentiment.


Foreign fund flow
In just two sessions of August, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have taken out Rs 2,859 crore from Indian equities and debt, data available with NSDL showed. In the month of July, FPIs were net sellers at the tune of Rs 3,003 crore. The flow of foreign funds will remain a key trigger for the rise and fall of the market.


Trade war jitters
Hopes of a truce in the trade war were dashed last week when the US President threatened fresh tariffs on Chinese imports. China said it would take countermeasures. The world remains mute spectators as major economies suffer. Market experts expect more capital outflow from emerging markets in case of any further escalation on this front. 


Crude oil & rupee
The rupee dived 54 paise on Friday to close at an over six-week low of 69.60 against the US dollar as soaring crude oil prices and a fresh flare-up in US-China trade tensions weighed on emerging market currencies. Oil prices gained about 3 per cent on Friday. Elevated crude oil prices and falling rupee may spook investors as it will only add misery to the economy which already appears to be in poor health. 


Technical outlook
Nifty made a High Wave-like candle on the daily chart last Friday but formed a bearish candle for the fourth straight week. Analysts say a followup buying is essential for a trend reversal. ""If Friday's pullback sustains, Nifty shall initially head to test its 200-day simple moving average, which is placed at the 11,154 level,"" said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. After the 11,154 level, the 11,300 and 11,350 may act as strong resistance levels for the market. 

""In the short to medium term, the market may witness a bounceback given it's in oversold zone and any bounceback can further be extended to 11,200-11,300, if it sustains above the 10,900 mark. However, it would be tough for the market to breach the 11,300 - 11,350 zone. Hence consolidation is also around the corner. Short sellers should remain cautious as current levels favour the bulls,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research."
4,2019-08-05,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Strong selloff across Asian markets, triggered by renewed worries over the trade war, caused a lot of pain in the Indian market, and equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty suffered massive losses in early trade on Monday.

Sensex plunged 675 points, Nifty lurched towards 10,780 and midcap and smallcap indices dropped 2 per cent amid heavy selling across the board.

Lacklustre earnings, trade war jitters, an acute slowdown in the economy and FPI outflow were among the key factors behind the selloff. The uncertain situation in Kashmir also hurt investor sentiment to some extent. 

While the broader market remained depressed, analysts said a highly stock-specific approach can still help reap gains. 

Based on recommendations from various analysts and brokerages, here are 12 stocks that the analysts say should deliver gains over the next two to three weeks. 


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher


Reliance Industries (RIL) | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,290 | Stop loss: Rs 1,145

This stock has witnessed a decent correction recently and bottomed out, taking support near the Rs 1,150 mark. Moreover, it has bounced back with a positive candle pattern on the daily chart. The RSI also shown a trend reversal from the oversold zone to give a ‘buy’ signal. “With chart patterns looking promising, we recommend a ‘buy’ rating on the stock for an upside target of Rs 1,290, keeping a stop loss at Rs 1,145,” Parekh said.


Maruti Suzuki India | Buy | Target price: Rs 6,100 | Stop loss: Rs 5,400

This stock has fallen drastically in recent times and is signalling consolidation and a possible bounceback with positive candle formation on the daily chart. The RSI has indicated a trend reversal from the oversold zone to give a ‘buy’ signal. 


Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities


Tata Global Beverages | Buy | Target price: Rs 288 | Stop loss: Rs 249

This stock has been consolidating for last few weeks. After showing a positive trend recently, the stock has witnessed a smart upside breakout from the consolidation in the Rs 260-62 zone and closed higher. “We observe a larger sequence of higher tops and bottoms as per daily timeframe chart and a recent swing low of Rs 245.70 of 31 July could now be considered as a new higher bottom of the sequence,” Shetti said. The daily 14-period RSI showed a positive indication, which signals that the upside momentum could continue in the near term. 

Torrent Pharma | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,800 | Stop loss: Rs 1,590

This stock, as per the weekly chart has witnessed a sharp upside bounce in the previous week. The weakness in the broader indices of the last week has not damaged the stock price much, as it shifted into a consolidation pattern in the last few sessions. The overall smaller and larger timeframe indicates a near-term bottom reversal and more upside is likely. “The weekly stochastic oscillator signals a positive signal and we expect this upside breakout to sustain in the near-term,” said Shetti.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking


Pidilite Industries | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,380 | Stop loss: Rs 1,186

During the week gone by, this stock witnessed a quiet consolidation when the market was witnessing havoc. On Friday, when the broader markets hinted at a bounce back, this stock triggered a strong up move, breaking above its recent consolidation, confirming a bullish breakout. The said breakout is witnessed with strong bullish candle with a good increase in volume. In addition, the momentum indicator RSI has broken above descending trend line resistance, suggesting prices to retest its all-time high around Rs 1,300 and beyond in the near-term. Moreover, prices are well above major moving averages i.e. 50-SMA and 200-SMA, indicating an overall bullishness in the counter. 


TVS Motor Company | Buy | Target price: Rs 415 | Stop loss: Rs 348

For the last few months, the auto sector has been a clear underperformer as compared to other sectors. However, some technical evidence is hinting at early signs of a strong bounceback within the auto space. On the weekly chart, the stock prices of TVS Motor have formed a classical 'Dragon Fly Doji'. The momentum oscillator RSI is placed in the deep oversold zone, suggesting that the downside momentum has fizzled out and there is a strong chance of bullish reversal. On 31 July, the stock witnessed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart with RSI crossing above its smoothened average indicating a bullish reversal. ""In addition, we are witnessing a positive structure on the hourly charts, and with the all the above multiple time frame analysis we sense the stock as a safe bet in the current market turbulence,"" said Bhosale. 


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in 


RBL Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 449 | Stop loss: Rs 397 

This counter appears to be positioning itself for a pullback move after a vertical fall in the month of July, from the highs of Rs 663–381, with a short-term bottom in place around Rs 381. This was hinted by almost a flat price behaviour of the last three sessions with similar closes around Rs 400. “As risk-reward ratios are favouring bulls, positional traders are advised to go long and look for a target of Rs 449,” said Mohammad.


UltraTech Cement | Buy | Target price: Rs 4,759 | Stop loss: Rs 4,177

This counter appears to have been moving in a well-defined descending channel for the last 48 sessions with multiple touchpoints. In the last three sessions, this counter approached its demand line of the said channel and appears to be successfully negotiating the support present around those levels. “Sustaining above Rs 4,180, this counter shall eventually head towards the upper boundary of the said channel,” Mohammad said.


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research


Tata Global Beverages | Buy | Target price: Rs 290 | Stop loss: Rs 250

This stock is on an uptrend, above 200-day moving average, making higher highs and higher lows. The recent correction in prices seems to be over as current close is now above the consolidation zone and three white soldiers are also seen, confirming the resumption of the uptrend. “RSI is above 50, showing bullish bias and we expect Tata Global to move towards Rs 290 in the coming days,” said Nadeem.


ICICI Prudential Life Insurance | Buy | Target price: Rs 435 | Stop loss: Rs 378

This stock has resumed its uptrend after a price correction and recently it has closed above its 100-SMA on the weekly chart. With that, a channel formation is seen in prices, making the higher top and higher bottom. RSI is well above 50 showing positive strength. 


SMC Global Securities


Marico | Buy | Target price: Rs 395-400 | Stop loss: Rs 355

The 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) of the stock on the daily chart is currently at Rs 357.19. Short-term, medium-term and long-term bias is looking positive for the stock as it is comfortably trading above its all-important moving averages. Moreover, it is forming a “symmetrical triangle” on weekly charts, which is also bullish in nature. “On the front of the technical indicator, RSI and MACD also suggest buying for the stock so one can initiate long in the range of Rs 364-367 levels for the upside target of Rs 395-400 levels with a stop loss below Rs 355,” said the brokerage.


Muthoot Finance | Buy | Target price: Rs 660-675 | Stop loss: Rs 585

The 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) of the stock on the daily chart is currently at Rs 558.50. On the charts, the stock is continuously trading in higher highs and higher lows on weekly charts which is bullish in nature. Apart from this, it has given the consolidation breakout on daily charts and also has managed to close above the same. So, follow up buying may continue for the coming days. “One can buy in the range of Rs 612-616 levels for the upside target of Rs 660-675 levels with a stop loss below Rs 585,” said the brokerage.

6,2019-08-07,UltraTech,"New Delhi: To promote Jammu & Kashmir as an attractive destination for investments, the state department of Industry and commerce has reached out to several corporates including ITC, Tata Group, Suzlon Energy, Mahindra Agrotech, UltraTech Cement, and Radisson Hotels to participate in its first Investors Summit likely to be held in October-November, top officials said.

Prodded by the Centre, the department, along with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), is also planning roadshows and interactions with officials and investors from countries of the Middle East, Malaysia and Singapore to attract investments into Jammu and Kashmir, the officials told ET.

On Monday, the Narendra Modi led government in a historic decision revoked Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, with home minister Amit Shah blaming the special provisions for lack of investments and growth in the state.

J&K officials said they have requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind and five senior Union ministers to take part in the summit that will be held in two parts, first in Srinagar and then in Jammu.

Consultancy firm Ernst & Young has helped the officials identify areas of potential investment as well as key challenges such as land laws, poor transport, and delay in clearances that might affect the business environment.

Apart from tourism and hospitality, which are the major focus, they have identified pharmaceuticals, food processing, healthcare, education and manufacturing as likely focus areas for Jammu, and healthcare, dairy, renewable energy, handicrafts and horticulture for Kashmir, officials said.
J&K industry and commerce secretary Navin Kumar Choudhary said the department was in touch with all major corporate groups that are relevant to the new union territory’s demography and all details will be firmed up in about a week. “We have reached out to all major and medium level players,” he said. “Due to the geography we are more keen on medium and small-scale industries than big companies.""

CII northern region chairman Sameer Gupta said sectors such as IT, auto, wellness and medical tourism will open up soon. “Ladakh is the most suited for firms in solar power because of its radiation levels, so we are also targeting the power sector,” he said. “The area of Anantnag and Baramulla is well known for cement and other raw materials. We will also showcase case studies of medium and small industries that are operating successfully in J&K. J&K has the advantage of low cost of power, availability of water and low-cost labour, which can attract investors.""

Venguswamy Ramaswamy, global head of TCS iON, a Tata Consultancy Services unit focused on education, said the company in the last few months had looked at various aspects of investment potential in both Jammu and Kashmir, after visits and interactions with local industrialists. “We have already pointed out challenges such as lack of proper rail and road connectivity, and how the environment could be made more congenial to investors,” he told ET. “At TCS, we have already conveyed our intent to have more examinations in J&K for students so that they don't have to go out to qualify for jobs.”

Confirming ITC's participation in the summit, a company spokesperson said, “Given ITC's growing presence across agriculture, manufacturing and services, we evaluate opportunities in different states from time to time. The proposed investors summit will provide an opportunity to examine the prospects and potential in Jammu and Kashmir.""

Officials at the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) said the tentative dates for the summit is October 12-14, but said they are waiting for the dates to be firmed up before making final plans.

Local Kashmiri Industry associations, however, have asked for the summit to be postponed till the political situation settles in. They have also raised issues of non-availability of land for industrial development, delays in clearances, lack of power subsidy for the tourism sector, poor implementation of crop insurance schemes, rehabilitation of areas affected in floods, and decongestion in Srinagar that need to be addressed.

Rakesh Gupta of Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry told ET that the system of approval of clearances and corruption that prevents startups from taking off in Jammu & Kashmir had to be checked. “They have to first make it easier for existing and aspiring businessmen here,” he said. “It will be better if the summit happens after the land laws and other changes after the removal of article 360 and 35A are in place.”

Lalit Mahajan, president at Bari Brahmana Industries Association (BBIA), said the investors summit should listen to local voices, and ancillary units need to be promoted in J&K. “There is good potential for sugar mills around the Lakhanpur border and for growing aloevera in many dry places here but for that local businessmen need mentoring and encouragement.”"
13,2019-08-08,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices ended with robust gains on Thursday, buoyed by reports that the government was considering the option of doing away with the income-tax surcharge on the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) registered as trusts. 

The government is exploring various options in order to check incessant outflow of the foreign funds from Indian financial markets and infuse positive sentiment. Media reports suggested that a review of the long-term capital gains (LTCG) is also on the cards. 

ETNow reported that the Finance Ministry was studying implications of withdrawing LTCG levy on gains from equity if held for over three years. Even an easing of the dividend distribution (DDT) tax is under consideration.

The rupee's rise against the US dollar and improved global sentiment also influenced market sentiment. ""The market got a breather towards close on hopes that the government is likely to be lenient on a higher income-tax surcharge on FPIs, which influenced the bears to cover short positions. Prospects of lower interest rate and strength in the rupee boosted investor sentiment"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Sensex ended the day 637 points, or 1.74 per cent, higher at 37,327 while Nifty closed at 11,032, up 177 points, or 1.63 per cent.

19,2019-08-13,UltraTech,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Tuesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 38.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stock

Elara Capital has recommended accumulate rating on Cadila Healthcare with a target price of Rs 265 as they believe given its high US product concentration and key products facing competition, US sales is likely to remain flat over FY19-21. The brokerage has cut thier FY20E EPS by 15 per cent and FY21E EPS by 14 per cent, resulting in a 10 per cent CAGR decline in EPS over FY19-21E. Further, Heinz acquisition has led to higher leverage and depressed return ratios, according to the brokerage. Current valuations are reasonable at 15x FY21E P/E, but pending FDA resolution at Moraiya facility will remain an overhang. The stock declined 1.88 per cent to Rs 230.15 on Friday.


Centrum has reiterated its add rating on Mahanagar Gas with a target price of Rs 870. Given the June quarter results and guidance, we revise our FY20-21E volume growth assumptions to 5.7-5.9 per cent and EBITDA margin/scm to Rs 9 per scm, driving 6/4.4 per cent upward revision in FY20-21E EPS, said the brokerage. However, growth beyond FY23-24 remains at risk, given lack of inorganic growth opportunities and potential saturation in existing areas, according to Centrum. The stock declined 4.42 per cent to Rs 785 on Friday.


Karvy Stock Broking has maintained its buy rating on KEC International with a target price of Rs 364. The brokerage expect the existing strong order book to boost the revenues at 14 per cent CAGR during FY19-21E The revenues had a growth of 14.6 per cent YoY majorly on the strong growth of T&D business (25 per cent). The non T&D business just grew by 4 per cent due to decline in civil & solar segment performance and flat growth in cables segment. The stock closed at Rs 293 on Friday.

HDFC Securities has upgraded JK Lakshmi Cement to buy with a target price of Rs 381 Increased profitability along with slower capex pace should keep JKLC’s net debt-equity at comfortable levels below 1x. Post recent corrections in its stock price, JKLC’s valuations are attractive at 7.5x FY21 estimated EV of USD 69/MT, according to the brokerage. Weak future capex execution will impact its volume growth visibility, sharp pull back in cement prices, said the brokerage. The stock ended at Rs 332.15 on Friday.

Reliance Securities maintained its buy recommendation on UltraTech Cement with a target price of Rs 5,100. Consistent approach to trim cost along with focus on improvement in RoCE by balance-sheet deleveraging augurs well for UltraTech Cement. Demand should recover post monsoon followed by higher government spending, said the brokerage. It has raised EBITDA estimate by 11 per cent/13 per cent for FY20E/FY21E, mainly to factor in superior realisation and additional volume from Century Assets. The stock ended at Rs 4,277 on Friday."

INVESTMENT RATIONALE


Better realizations despite low demand off-take
The company has reported Higher profitability on better realization as cement prices increased across regions in Q1. Cement volumes improved 2 per cent YoY to 17.9 million tonnes, including newly-acquired Nathdwara plant (formerly Binani Cement).


Focus on integration and sweating of acquired assets
Nathdwara Cement (formerly Binani Cement) is fully integrated with UltraTech. Capacity utilization for Q1 at 60 per cent – low, due to an outage. The 21.2 million tonnes acquired JP Assets is now EPS accretive with 68 per cent capacity utilization; Century Cement is expected to merge in Q2FY20 pending few approvals. The management expects increased contribution via trimming cost and integrating acquired assets. Also, there are no further plans of organic/inorganic expansion.


Demand recovery and increased government infra focus
The recovery in demand post-monsoon and expected government spending will augur well for the company."
35,2019-08-29,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: The Ramco Cements could surprise the Street on earnings per share (EPS) gains, and odds are shortening on the mid-sized cement maker beating estimates of linear profit growth.

At the vanguard of that effort is cost control when growth, particularly in peninsular India, was rather uneven. This provided an edge relative to peers. Ramco was circumspect with capacity expansion and instead focused on improving cash-flows.

As a result, Ramco’s debt to EBITDA (operating profit before tax) ratio fell from its peak range of 3-5 to 1.5 in FY19. By implementing this strategy, the company has achieved capacity utilisation of 90 per cent in FY19 on integrated capacity. This is higher than the industry's capacity utilisation of 67 per cent.

At such elevated utilisation level and well-managed balance sheet, Ramco is now seeking to add capacity by 45 per cent to 20 million tonnes in the next two years.

On enhanced capacity, Ramco Cements is expected to see volume growth in the range of 8-15 per cent for the next two years.

This growth range would be little lower than that for sector leader UltraTech Cement.

With increasing expectations of stable demand growth of 5-6 per cent in the second half of the present fiscal, Ramco’s enhanced capacity should boost its earnings from selling per tonne of cement.

Ramco Cement is expected to benefit from stable demand in the eastern region, which would offset any volatility in demand in the southern markets.



In FY18, the company generated EBITDA per tonne of Rs 1,129, which fell to Rs 921 in FY19.

Analysts expect the company's EBIDTA per tonne to improve to Rs 1,100-1,200 range in the next two years due to the expansion.

More importantly, cement realisations could improve in the range of 3-4 per cent for the next two fiscals.

Given these factors, according to various estimates, Ramco’s EPS in the next two years is expected to improve in the range of 35-50 per cent.

On the valuation front, considering one-year forward earnings, the company is trading at an EV/EBITDA of 13.3, which is at a premium to its peers due to its size, high capacity utilisation and low cost."

11,2019-09-11,UltraTech,"Outperformance in small and midcaps likely to last for a few more sessions, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The smallcaps were on the move today. Do you expect sustained buying there?Last week and so far this week has been positive for midcap and smallcap stocks. Investors seem to be agreeable to buy at slightly higher levels as well. What we are seeing is definitely follow-through buying and stocks which have been beaten down completely in auto, banks, commodities seem to be outperforming at this point of time. All signals suggest that this kind of outperformance may last for a few more trading sessions. 

But more importantly, it seems at this point of time all the bad news has got discounted and we certainly have a bottom in place. Now, whether it is the ultimate bottom from where the market does turn, only time will tell. But at least this phase of the bear market seems to be over and depending on how the next few trading sessions are, that will determine the course of this particular phase of the bear market whether it is turning around to be a bull market or we are going to find and trade at lower and lower bottoms. We are at a critical juncture is what I see the stock markets at this point of time and we will have an earnings season over the next six weeks or so. It will be a very important earning season especially from management commentary point of view.


How you are looking at the overall metals basket? Could you pick out some of the largecaps within metals?Although traditionally we have not been very positive on commodities, these companies have seen a huge slide and right now, there is a lot of pressure because of domestic as well as global slowdown on account of trade war. 

But these are cyclicals and deep cyclicals and at some point of time, commodity prices will stabilise and start to move up. It could be 12 months, 24 months down the line. Maybe stock prices will start moving up even before that. But as and when we will turn around in these commodity prices, you can expect a fabulous rally in whole lot of commodities stocks as well. 

Over a three-year period, if they do have another upcycle from these levels, a lot of the commodity stocks can easily go up by 70% to 100% or so. These are not levels to sell off the commodity stocks like metals and maybe at corrections, if you are underweight in metals in a particular portfolio, you could look at selectively buying into some of the largecap metal companies and our preference would be for steel companies like Tata Steel or JSW and maybe Hindalco in aluminium, rather than a NALCO, where there is the possibility of M&A activity which may be earnings accretive over a longer period.


What about real estate? Do you see any reason to buy in at the bottom?Yes absolutely and especially cement companies which are focussed on the economy segment. Companies like Kolte Patil, Prestige Estates and to an extent even Godrej Properties could certainly do well, going forward. These companies have reported good earnings. You could include DLF also which is not exactly into economy segment but then there are certain special situations over there. One can have an exposure to real estate sector through these three-four companies.

Right positioning in terms of price and area and focussing on sales rather than developing a land bank, clearly has paid off for these companies and their balance sheets are in great shape, which we think will outperform going forward.


What is your view on the IT space?IT had served well for investors in the bear market and whatever little allocation investors had they had some at least capital protection as far as IT is concerned. Lot of the IT companies are more like utility companies. They will give any way from 8% to 10% type of top line, bottom line growth rate and that is fine in a bear market. But as and when the bull market starts to pick up, you will find IT companies start underperforming.

Then there is this entire fear within the IT space about overall global slowdown and that may certainly impact IT companies. It has not so far and whatever commentary has come through from the software companies, managements has been positive. But we have seen in the past that whenever the US economy goes for a soft landing, IT companies get affected and within that also, major sectors like manufacturing, retail as well as banking and financial services are under more stress than some of the other segments.

 I would be a bit cautious in software at this point of time. If I am convinced that the markets in fact are turning and we are going to get into higher tops, higher bottoms and the worst is over, then I would certainly think in terms of getting underweight into IT and overweight into some of the cyclicals.


How you are looking at cement as a pocket? Is the overall dynamics improving?Yes absolutely and there is a good deal of price discipline within the cement companies and although volume growth was certainly lacking in the last quarter, but that was more than made up by the kind of increase in operating profit margins that the sector as a whole witnessed and we are quite positive on cement. It is a cyclical industry, should benefit from higher government spending, increased infrastructure spending and there is adequate capacity within the sector to grow and take advantage of any increase demand which may take place.

I would prefer companies which are the largest in the space. Something like UltraTech Cement which will also benefit from merger of Century’s cement units as they start getting integrated. Alsom Shree Cement which has been one of the most successful cement companies in terms of low capital cost of setting up new cement plants and targeting the right market. Between these two companies, one should get decent returns as far as exposure to cement sector is concerned."

12,2019-09-12,UltraTech,"KOLKATA: Successful bidders of the current round of coal block auctions can use extracted coal at any of their plants including those at subsidiaries, provided the end-use plant is similar to the one specified during the auction. Earlier, operators were tied to the plant specified during the auction.

The Centre, however, has rejected prospective bidders’ request of selling coal to Coal India at notified prices for the non-regulated sector, which is almost 20% higher than notified. They asked for a higher price as this round of auction was for the non-regulated sector — for which Coal India charges higher.

Initially, the Centre had said that sale to Coal India will be at a discount of 15% on the notified price for sectors other than power utilities. Subsequently, they clarified that such a sale will be at a discount of 15% over the notified price for the power sector as well, offering Coal India over 20% margin for selling this coal in the open market. A block operator can sell up to 50% of their produce to Coal India in a year.

Utilisation of coal at any other plant by the bidder would, however, be subject to the ministry’s scrutiny and prior approval from the Centre. “The block operator needs to inform the government at least 30 working days before it starts to divert coal to any other plants,” a senior executive from a prospective company said.

Under the current round of auction, the government has offered to auction 27 blocks under three tranches — 8th, 9th and 10th — and successful bidders can sell 25% of the produce in the open market.



Three dozen companies, including Reliance Cement, UltraTech Cement, Balco, Ambuja Cements, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, Birla Corporation, ACC Cement and Vedanta are prospective bidders for the current round.

Out of the 27 blocks on offer, 20 mines are estimated to hold an extractable reserve of 1 billion tonnes. According to mining plans, these blocks can produce a total of 36 million tonnes a year, of which 9 million can be sold in the open market.

Financial biddings are to be held between October 10 and November 8. Final allotments are likely to happen by November 11."
21,2019-09-16,UltraTech,"The overall technical set up suggests that the broader market conditions may remain volatile with wild moves expected on either side, but a breakout above 11,100 could lead to an upside towards 11,300–11,400, according to technical analysts. Siemens, Divi’s Lab, Nestle, Maruti, UltraTech Cement, Hero MotoCorp and Avenue Supermarts among others are some of the stocks recommended by the analysts for the short term.


MEHUL KOTHARI
SR. TECHNICAL ANALYST, INDIANIVESH SECURITIES


Where are we : For the past four weeks, the domestic markets have been oscillating in a broad range. Initially, the Nifty was stuck between 11,200-10,600 but now that range has been compressed to 11,100-10,740. Generally, such consolidation leads to a faster breakout on either side. Technically, we have observed that the price action of the recent week has helped the index to convincingly cross the previous week’s high. This has happened after 10 weeks which is an encouraging sign for the bulls and indicates that the bottom of 10,740 should be held for some more time and the Nifty could reach higher levels.


What is in store: A breakout above 11,100 on closing basis could lead to an upside towards 11,300–11,400. However, a breach of 10,740 would bring the bears back and pull the index back to 10,600 level. Considering the derivative data, the long and short ratio of FIIs in index futures has reached near 23 per cent — the lowest it went since February 2018 (which was around 18 per cent). Generally, we have witnessed a sharp recovery in the markets in such conditions. Thus, chances are high that the breakout might happen on the higher side.


What could traders do: With regards to individual stocks, we are witnessing a trend line breakout in Maruti, UltraTech and Hero MotoCorp. Any dips could be used to accumulate them for positional trade. On the contrary, UPL is the stock which we would recommend to sell. The current price action on the daily chart has taken a shape of “rising wedge” pattern, which generally occurs after a drastic fall and could be considered as a dead-cat bounce. Traders can create shorts in the stock between ₹578-582 levels for the downside target of ₹555 with a stop loss of ₹592.

Where are we : Undeterred by Thursday’s fag-end decline, Nifty marched ahead in Friday’s session. Rather than looking at the presence of supply line around three-digit Gann number of 111(00), it is now essential to focus on the overall market structure which continues to be positive. The trend which has caught our attention is the participation of broader markets (NSE MidCap 100 index up over 3 per cent since recent low of September 4). It’s no longer only large-cap driven market. We have seen different stocks and sectors participating in last few sessions (So this market is not driven by only handful of large heavyweight stocks) which makes it difficult to break the spirit of the bulls.


What is in store: Despite the strong Friday rally, range expansion is highly awaited and current consolidation could probably end in this week’s trade. A typical trend is observed in last two week’s trade i.e. buy on dips which underlines market strength and resilience. The index has completed three consecutive shifts in orbits post June peak of 121(00) and since last one month it is locked in tussle between three-digit Gann number of 106(00)-111(00). Broad based participation, churning of sectors, presence of Gann anniversary period and comeback of BankNifty in Friday’s trade indicates case of a strong upside move towards 11,350.
What could traders do: Daily ratio chart of BankNifty versus Nifty shows a reversal from point of polarity zone around 2.5. The same coincides 50 per cent retracement of the previous upmove from September 2018 to July 2019, which suggests possible outperformance from banking stocks from hereon.

Where we are: Nifty is currently hovering around the psychological mark of 11,000 as tough war is witnessed between the bulls and bears from last couple of weeks. In the broader market we may see stock specific action spread across the various sectors taking cues from the domestic and global news flows. The next crucial supports placed near 10,900-10,920 zones below which it may drift towards 10,800 levels. The index may witness fresh round of short covering rally if it closes well above 11,120-11,150 levels.


What is in store: We expect Nifty to remain highly vulnerable to the global and domestic developments coupled with the ongoing weakness in the rupee and rebound in crude oil prices. As per the options data of the weekly options expiry, Nifty is having maximum call writing at 11100CE followed by 11200CE while on the flip side 10900PE is having the maximum open interest followed by heavy build up in 10800PE indicating the next crucial support. The overall technical set up suggests that the broader market conditions may remain volatile with wild move expected on either side.


What could traders do: At current juncture, the volatility has narrowed to 15 per cent as depicted by India Vix index with Nifty flirting with its short-term moving average. It is advisable to avoid any directional call in Nifty till clear trend emerges on technical parameters. Meanwhile short-term traders may put their long bet in counters like Siemens, Divi’s Lab, Nestle and Avenue Supermarts which has witnessed pattern breakouts followed by Bajaj Auto and Larsen & Toubro which has added long addition in the derivative space."

18,2019-09-16,UltraTech,"Despite the ongoing economic slowdown and below average monsoon in 2018, the cement industry did well during 2018-19 and reported a jump in volume of around 13%. Since this jump has happened after a 9% volume growth in 2017-18, it can be considered a remarkable feat. However, with around 3% decline in volume during the first quarter, 2019-20 started on a dull note. 

Water shortages due to weak monsoon in 2018 and delayed government spending on infrastructure due to general elections were the main reasons for this weakness. The second quarter, anyway, is a traditionally weak quarter for the cement industry due to the monsoon. 

Analysts, however, believe things will get back on the fast lane soon and the cement industry will end 2019-20 with a volume gain of around 5%. This is because the government has started clearing infra projects at a faster rate now and construction is expected to pick up post monsoon.

Being the largest domestic cement manufacturer, UltraTech can be treated as a proxy of India’s growing infra and housing spend. With operations in UAE, Bahrain, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, UltraTech is also getting into the global market. By reaching out to countries around the Indian Ocean and the Middle East, UltraTech Cement is also India’s largest exporter of cement now.

Due to its aggressive expansions, UltraTech has been able to increase its market share. For example, it was able to report 2% volume growth during the first quarter compared to 3% industry-wide fall in volume. After absorbing most acquisitions comfortably, the management’s focus now is on improving operational efficiency and profitability and it is yielding results. For example, UltraTech reported EBITDA/t of Rs 1,428/t (its highest ever) during Q1. 

To reduce cost and also to improve efficiency, UltraTech is setting up power plants using ‘waste heat recovery systems’ and another 46 MW of capacity is expected to be commissioned in 2020-21. The electricity generated from waste heat accounted for around 8% of its power requirements in 2018-19 and the same will increase to around 15% over the next two years. Fall in prices of coal and diesel is also helping profitability of cement companies, though a part of it is getting negated by the fall in cement price.

With major acquisitions behind, there should be an improvement on its free cash flow and management plans to use it for reduction of debt. For example, UltraTech reduced its debt by Rs 1,022 crore during the first quarter. The stock market will start looking more favourably at this counter once there is clear improvement in operational efficiency and reduction in debt.

We pick up the stock that has shown maximum increase in “consensus analyst rating” during the past month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (ie 5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock.

30,2019-09-20,UltraTech,"Mumbai: The GST Council on Friday announced rate cuts for the hospitality industry, but didn’t announce any major relief for auto and cement sectors.

GST Council, however, recommended lower 12 per cent cess on 1,500cc diesel and 1,200cc petrol vehicles with capacity to carry up to 13 people.

Analysts were of the opinion that after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashed corporate tax early on Friday, hopes of further GST cuts for auto and cement sectors had came down.

The GST Council in its meeting on Friday, approved the proposal to cut rates on hotel tariffs. The tax on room tariff of up to Rs 7,500 has been slashed to 12 per cent from the existing 28 per cent. There will be no GST on room tariffs of below Rs 1,000 per night

This will come as a boost to the sector, which has been reeling under the pressure of an economic slowdown. The move is expected to serve a dual purpose of boosting tourism and generate more employment.

Earlier in the week, hotel stocks had rallied on hopes of the rate cut. 

In a bid to boost exports, rate on precious and semi-precious stones were also reduced.

On the other hand, GST rate on caffeinated products has been increased to 28 per cent from 18 per cent, plus there will be an additional cess of 12 per cent. GST on railway wagons was also raised from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.

The GST council didn’t announce any major relief for the auto sector, which was widely expected.

Over the last one month, auto stocks including Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Hero Motocorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Atul Auto, Ashok Leyland, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, Hindustan Motors had railed 6-25 per cent on hopes of a cut in GST rates and after the FM slashed corporate tax rates.

Similarly, shares of cement companies such as The Ramco Cement, J K Cements, UltraTech Cements, ACC, Keerthi Industries, NCL Industries, Orient Cement, Kakatiya Cement, India Cements, Shiva Cement and Andhra Cements rose 5-73 per cent.

Earlier in the day, the government slashed corporate tax for domestic and new local manufacturing companies. The effective rate will be 25.17 per cent, including surcharges and cess. The measures will be implemented through an ordinance, she said."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements on corporate tax cut turned out to be the biggest news for domestic stocks, which triggered the biggest one-day rally on Dalal Street since May 2009.

Friday’s fireworks helped Sensex and Nifty closed the week gaining 1.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent to 38,014.6 and 11,274.2 points, respectively.


Here are a few stocks which hogged limelight during the strong week for the market:

Fate of MMTC, STC unknownIt’s no business as usual. The two stocks dropped 29 per cent each this week after Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said all options were open for closure or merger of the PSUs. “We have started discussions. One by one we will do,” he said on the sidelines of an event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry. MMTC ended the week at Rs 18.40. STC settled the week at Rs 92.40.

YES Bank cracks 19%The stock cracked 19 per cent to Rs 55.5 amid stake sale by promoter entities. Morgan Credits (MCPL), part of the promoter group of YES Bank on Thursday sold 2.3 per cent in the lender. Another report on Saturday suggests promoter group companies of Yes Bank along with co-founder Rana Kapoor have sold a combined 2.75 per cent stake in the lender through the open market. Brokerage Macquarie which recently met investors in Singapore and Hong Kong said that some investors believe the stock has negative net worth on fully adjusted basis and may have to be merged with a large, strong bank to prevent system freeze.


This sector cements gainsStocks such as Ambuja Cements, ACC, JK Cement and Ultratech Cement gained 5.8-7.1 per cent for the week. The cut corporate tax is likely to lift cement maker earnings by up to 18 per cent. “We expect approximately 9 per cent EPS increase for ACC and UltraTech among the largecap names, 12-18 per cent for JK Cement, Prism Johnson and Orient Cement, said brokerage Emkay Global. 


IT stocks fail to join the partyTCS fell 3.5 per cent for the week, Infosys 2.9 per cent and HCL Technologies 1.8 per cent. IT firms are not expected to gain much from the reduction in taxes. Most exports-driven IT companies have lower tax incidence due to exemptions and stand to benefit less from the tax incentives announced.


Auto stocks rallyThe GST Council rejected the proposal for GST cut for auto sector as state governments opposed the rate cut. For the week, Eicher Motors gained 6.9 per cent to Rs 17,843.90. Hero MotoCorp and M&M gained 3.2 per cent each. Tata Motors rose 3 per cent, Maruti 2.1 per cent and Bajaj Auto 1.2 per cent."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits” for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India. The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list” of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries to smaller names including Manappuram Finance , Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.

“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,” he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.”



India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.

Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9 per cent while small cap names gained 7 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3 per cent in the last three sessions.

The gains show that the “first round impact” of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.

Here are the key insights from the report



Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6 per cent above Tuesday’s close
Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75 per cent of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

0,2019-10-07,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: A lower corporate tax is likely to boost India Inc’s bottomline for the September 2019 quarter amid slower topline growth and shrinking operating margin due to sluggish demand.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates of the Nifty50 companies, aggregate net sales is expected to increase at a nine-quarter low rate of 5.5 per cent compared with the year-ago quarter. The operating profit is likely to fall by 4.5 per cent.

“We don’t expect any material improvement in Q2FY20 (the second quarter of FY20). Weak consumption demand will impact several sectors including automobiles and consumers. Weak global commodity prices will hurt metals and oil and gas companies,” said Gautam Duggad, institutional research head, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. He believes adjustments owing to deferred tax after the recent changes in corporate tax rates will impact profitability of large corporate banks.

The government’s recent decision to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25.17 per cent including cess and surcharge for FY20 may benefit the net profits of companies in the second quarter. But, gauging its extent is difficult since companies are likely to adjust for the taxes paid at the then prevailing rates during the first quarter of the fiscal. Assuming a flat tax rate of 25 per cent, the sample’s net profit may shoot up by 26.5 per cent year-on-year for the September quarter, which will be the highest in the past nine quarters.

Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities, drew attention to several macro parameters that portray a drab picture for the quarterly earnings season. “Advance and corporate tax collections have grown just 6 per cent till mid-September this fiscal; collections of GST for September were at a 19 month low; sales of automobiles fell for the eleventh consecutive month in September; index of core infrastructure industries fell at a 52-month low of 0.5 per cent in August. In this backdrop, Q2 growth numbers especially on the topline may not be exciting,” he said.

The operating margins of the Nifty50 sample is expected to contract by 170 basis points (bps) to 18 per cent, which will be the lowest since the December 2018 quarter.

“We expect sharp margin contraction year-on-year in autos, metals, technology and oil and gas companies. Cement companies should report strong margin expansion while for those in the consumers and capital goods sectors, operating margins would be flat,” said Duggad.

While demand is expected to remain sluggish in the next two quarters, industry observers believe that a turnaround cannot be ruled out during FY21. Jasani expects a better monsoon, though partly uneven, may result in a bumper Rabi harvest thereby sprucing up rural income. “The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is gradually expected to feed into the real economy and boost demand,” he added.

According to Duggad, the step to recapitalise the public sector banks, improving liquidity and tax cuts augur well for the demand trend. “We expect corporate earnings to pickup in FY21 even as FY20 earnings may remain volatile depending on the treatment of deferred taxes of corporate banks. We continue to prefer private financials, consumers, IT and select industrials,” he said.


SECTORAL TRENDS


AUTOMOBILES
The financial performance of the auto companies is likely to be under pressure owing to volume contraction over the past 12 months. During the September 2019 quarter, it fell by by16-33 per cent across categories. The discount level for passenger cars reached to a record high and accounted for 15-25 per cent of the ex-showroom prices in the quarter. This will weigh on margins.




BANKS
Banks will have to reduce their deferred tax assets in the aftermath of corporate tax cut, which will affect the net profit. The extent will depend upon whether banks mark down these assets in one go or over the remaining quarters of the fiscal. On the business front, loan growth has been lower amid slack demand. Asset quality may once again deteriorate after showing improvement in recent quarters.


CAPITAL GOODS
The continued order momentum from the state government and public sector companies is expected to keep the order books buoyant. L&T, India’s largest infrastructure company, is expected to report 20-35 per cent growth in orders for Q2. It has guided for order inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent for the current fiscal.


CEMENT
Falling demand from infrastructure sector resulted in 6 per cent drop in cement prices sequentially in the September quarter.

Due to the low base effect in the year-ago period, earnings of cement companies may show moderate growth. Large companies are expected to show revenue growth in the range of 8-12 per cent in the September 2019 quarter year-on-year.

Net profits of large-sized companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to grow by15-50 per cent, following benign crude oil prices and corporate tax cut.


FMCG
Revenue of the FMCG companies is expected to be affected by slow demand while net profit may show the benefit of corporate tax cut. Rural demand remains under pressure. Management commentaries on the demand outlook would be a key factor to watch out for.


IT
Top information technology (IT) companies are expected to report 1-5 per cent sequential growth in dollar denominated revenue. HCL Tech is expected to report the highest topline growth among peers helped by the additional revenue from the acquired business of select IBM products. Slower traction in the global banking and finance vertical may affect topline growth. Investors would keenly watch Infosys for a possible upward revision in FY20 guidance.


METALS
The earnings growth is likely to be muted due to listless volume growth and 6-15 per cent sequential drop in metal prices. The operating profit before depreciation (Ebitda) for steel companies may fall by ?1,000-1,500 per tonne.


PHARMA
Pharma companies are likely to maintain momentum. Sales growth from the US market is gradually picking up. Corporate tax cut may improve profitability of companies including Dr Reddy’s Labs and Cipla. Management outlook on performance of specialty drugs portfolio, volume growth in Indian pharma market and update on regulatory compliance will be key factors."

Why is there is such a large divergence between SBI and ICICI Bank?SBI has the government on its side. ICICI has no such backing. There is the quality of management which will end up making a difference when you are deciding on your portfolio. An overhang of policies and decisions will always lie on SBI and that is why the market rightly keeps on rewarding the better players on the private side than on the PSU side.

Apart from that, the commentary from ICICI Bank MD & CEO Sandeep Bakshi has been extremely positive, concentrated and on key matrices which are the liability numbers, increasing margins and concentrating on NPAs -- all three of which the market likes and would keep on rewarding it for a long time to go. Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are the key picks in our book. Quality, liability, franchises and slow and steady improvement in retail books and an outlook for corporate loans which has been fairly stable for quite some time.

Our belief remains that if you have to play the markets, you should go for the largecaps because a few of the largecaps will take the Nifty up whereas the broader markets will continue to be under pressure.

In these largecaps, one of our picks is UltraTech Cement. The reasons are simple. They still have large capacity utilisations; prices have been more or less stable but a volume pickup is also slowly coming in. There will be a demand towards infra though the expenditure from the government has come down and towards the realty sector which is showing signs of either flattening out or slight increase on the affordable side. 

So, UltraTech is a pick in the largecap space as far as the cement sector is concerned.


Are you telling your clients to buy the fear in pharma -- be it Aurobindo, Glenmark or Sun?No. The call from the research desk at least for the last couple of years has been negative as far as pharma is concerned. While average growth has been at around 9%, in September, 12% growth was seen. It is a trend that we would like to watch. Whether the sales growth continues beyond the average growth rate has to be seen.

Right now, because of the US market as well as internal pressures, I do not think it is a good bet to build a position in pharma. Apart from that, the regulatory hangover that has been there for most of these pharma companies. Questions have been raised as far as their plants are concerned and that is a cause of worry. We just have not been able to get our act into place as far as managing US FDA regulations are concerned. If we are really serious about this business, then you will have to be regulatory compliant. If you are able to manage to do that well, you will be rewarded as far as shareholder returns will be there. Right now, pharma does not lie in that space at all.


When it comes to some of those weak pockets like auto, metals, there seems to be a consensus building that nothing much is to be expected there. Are you still scouting for any opportunities at lower levels in some of those names?Nearly 60% of Nifty earnings are going to be weak for BFSIs as far as credit growth is concerned. The only advantage is that they get an advantage of the corporate tax structure in case it gets rolled out but from a perspective of growth of credit as well as NIMs that have been maintained, they have had massive amount of pressure. That is why the liability franchise banks are the ones that you have to look at. 

NBFCs are a clear avoid except for the larger ones like HDFC Ltd or CanFin Homes which have the capability of raising capital. Apart from that, auto is supposed to be weak. The good thing is that though wholesale offtake has been low, retail sales because of discounting that has happened in the festival season, has seen an offtake that has started from the dealer level. 

Once that inventory comes in, then the stabilisation of wholesale flow to these dealers will also happen and that will bring some stability in the downward spiral that the auto segment has gone through. Both telecom, pharma continue to be weak and it will continue that same trend because in the telecom space, clearly one player is trying to end up getting the maximum market share and all other players are wilting under the pressure that has been applied. Only a large player will be left standing right now which is Bharti. 

The others have practically given commentary which has not been very encouraging. I have already spoken about pharma, your US-led companies are going to face a tremendous amount of pressure. The silver lining in the entire thing is that the September figures for pharma have been encouraging with top line growth. We would like to continue watching this space before taking a call.


What is your expectation on the entire Infy versus TCS parameter, given that TCS is going to be delivering its numbers tomorrow?Actually the call has been to end up reducing positions on TCS and build it up in Infosys, purely on a valuation basis to make sure that they end up delivering on the two digit numbers. It might be slightly difficult for TCS but maybe there is an arbitrage that is available purely by valuation. But TCS runs the company far more efficiently than what Infosys has managed to do over the last four or five years. They have to get their act into place but still their earnings will be slightly better off than TCS in the current quarter."

Where are We? After the 2-day strongest move of the decade, the Nifty faced resistance at 11700 level which was its previous reversal area. The index has retraced almost 61.8 per cent retracement level of the earlier rise; whereas, the mid- and small-cap sectors lost their previous gains. It indicates bears are back after a short sting of the bulls. The index is hovering around its 200-day long-term moving average. Momentum indicator RSI reading comes at 53 level which shows neutral force in the market.


What is in Store? The index seems to be on the cusp of the bears till it sustains below 11400 level, which is an immediate hurdle for the bulls. The index is forming probable inverted flag pattern which indicates continuation of negative movement. Implication of the pattern will get invalidated above 11400 level. On the downside, the index can have potential support in the range of 11000 to 10900.


What could Investors Do? The earnings season has just started and it will be the key event to watch out for. Technically, the index had offered good investment opportunity as it is down almost 12-15 per cent from the top. The recent decline can be used to expand the portfolio as many stocks had retraced their important long-term support levels. Stock specific, investors can look at M&M, UltraTech Cement, JSW Steel and Torrent Power."
16,2019-10-15,UltraTech,"In the past six months, movement of key benchmark indices has been range-bound. This situation is likely to persist for some time. Experts point out that it has become difficult to predict demand across key segments in the present economic situation. Scattered and erratic buying trends imply that consumers have funds but they would spend only if a deal suits their cost arithmetic. Such times merit investments in a basic theme which works in almost all cycles of markets — multi-cap schemes.

The very structure of multi-cap schemes allows investments in companies of all sizes is an attractive proposition in present market conditions. Among multi-cap schemes, Kotak Standard Multicap is a distinguished performer. Three factors work in the scheme’s favour: In comparison with its peers, it has a low expense ratio. Second, it is the scheme’s performance which stands out. In the past five-year and 10-year periods, the scheme has given 12.1% and 13% returns respectively, while the average returns of its peers over the same periods are 9% and 11% respectively.

Third, in terms of composition, the scheme is welldiversified in large and midsized companies. Close to 77% of the scheme’s portfolio is in large-sized companies, which helps mitigate volatility in the scheme’s returns.

Expert Take

Harshvardhan Roongta, CFP, Roongta Securities
This is one of the few schemes which has been a consistent performer across market cycles. The investment style is growth-oriented. Being a multi-cap fund, the fund manager has the liberty to invest in quality companies irrespective of size. A major portion of the portfolio is in largecaps which provides relative stability from volatility. Investors looking for a quality multicap fund can choose this scheme without hesitation."

26,2019-10-22,UltraTech,"Ultra-Tech’s chief financial officer Atul Daga made two important observations in the quarterly earnings call that suggest the impact of a broader slowdown may now leave a more concrete imprint on India’s cement industry, the world’s second biggest.

First, Daga said that he was a bit surprised by the 2-2.5 per cent decline in demand even though he had budgeted for some shrinkage in sales in the second quarter, which coincides with India’s annual monsoon rains. Traditionally, the quarter is considered a bit tepid for cement companies.



Second, the finance head at India’s biggest manufacturer of the primary building material acknowledged that 6 per cent demand growth for the broader industry would be rather difficult to achieve in FY20.

Against this backdrop, Ultra-Tech’s financial performance fell shy of analysts’ estimates in the September quarter. Against Bloomberg’s net profit estimates of ₹716 crore, the company recorded a net profit of ₹639 crore. This gap is directly connected to a string of macro-economic factors affecting cement sales nationally.

Demand from individual homebuilders and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), and shortage of cash in several pockets beyond the metros have caused the pace of construction to slow. Flooding also halted construction activities in parts of peninsular India, exacerbating the impact on sales volumes in a traditionally sluggish quarter. Consequently, UltraTech’s revenue rose at 5 per cent to ₹9,129 crore in the three months under review, in comparison with the same quarter last year.

In such tough times, UltraTech is following a strategy expected of a sector leader. It has added capacity (organic) of 3.4 MT in the eastern region. According to the company’s management, in times of peak capacity utilisation, the company had noticed shortfall in supplies. Besides this, by the end of the December quarter this year, 12.6 MT of the 14.6 MT acquired cement assets of Century Textiles will be rebranded as UltraTech Cement. In the coming quarters, analysts believe that these assets can contribute ₹15-25 to the company’s EBITDA on selling each tonne of cement.

In the quarter under review, the company’s EBIDTA per tonne, thanks to the low base of last year, climbed 34 per cent to ₹1,145.

On the valuation front, considering its one-year forward earnings, the company’s stock is trading at EV/EBIDTA of 14.5. This amounts to a discount of 27.6 per cent to its five-year average EV/EBITDA of 20.1. For investors who are keen on cashing in on India’s infrastructure growth story, UltraTech should remain the preferred investment given its size, timely capacity addition and lean balance sheet."

• Reliance Securities has upgraded recommendation on the 
Shree Cement stock to buy from hold with a target price of Rs 20,900. Shree Cement has been moving in the right direction in its pursuit to dominate the markets by adding capacity at regular intervals, which will aid the company in growing its market share with strong profitability without much stress on balance sheet, according to brokerage. Hence, its premium multiple is expected to sustain, going forward which can be supported by thin liquidity and meagre non institutional holdings, it added. The stock gained 4.5 per cent to Rs 19,501 on Tuesday.

• Centrum Broking has retained its buy rating on 
Mastek with a target price of Rs 535 citing well navigated on the cost front despite the huge challenges. EPS estimates are trimmed modestly by 2.5/4per cent for FY20/FY21E.

• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on 
L&T Technology Services and revised target price to Rs 1801 from Rs 1821 earlier.

The stock ended down 10.4per cent at Rs 1472.60 on Tuesday.

• Nomura has a neutral rating on 
AU Small Finance Bank with a target price of Rs 590. The bank's second quarter core operating profit was over 15per cent ahead of expectation with 30 basis points sequential improvement in spreads, AUM growth of 38per cent year-on-year, lower opex growth of 21per cent year-on-year and stable asset quality. Growth pressure in the vehicle book should continue, given continued weakness OEM volumes, said Nomura. The stock ended up 5.2per cent at Rs 688.40 on Tuesday.

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on 
UltraTech Cement and has raised target price to Rs 5500 from Rs 5400.

40,2019-10-31,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: As benchmark equity indices hit fresh all-time highs, stocks of Bajaj group have emerged top wealth creators, with a 33.4 per cent jump in the combined market value so far this year. They beat Ambani, Adani and Tata groups to claim the crown.

Investors made money with both hands in five Bajaj group stocks that rose 17-53 per cent in the first 10 months of 2019. However, six other group stocks fell up to 14-52 per cent in the same period. 

Six Adani group stocks saw a 19.27 per cent rise in the combined market value. All of them have gained so far this year.

In value terms, two of Mukesh Ambani group stocks – Reliance Industries and RIIL – added Rs 2.19 lakh crore to increase combine market-cap to Rs 9.30 lakh crore, up 30 per cent from Rs 7.11 lakh crore at the end of 2018. On Wednesday, RIL became the sixth largest energy firm globally by market cap.

Tata group’s 27 stocks were worth Rs 11.83 lakh crore today, having added Rs 1.34 lakh crore to investor wealth so far this year, representing a 12.77 per cent expansion.

Nine Aditya Birla group stocks saw Rs 33,042 crore wealth erosion. Anil Ambani-led ADAG group also saw Rs 15,000 crore value erosion.

On Thursday, Sensex was just 100 points shy off its record high level of 40,312 while NSE barometer Nifty50 was 150 points away from its record high of 12,103.


Select Bajaj group stocks shine
In the case of Bajaj group, shares of Bajaj Finance have surged 54 per cent this year, followed by a 46 per cent jump in Maharashtra Scooters, 26 per cent rise in Bajaj Finserv, 25 per cent gain in Bajaj Holdings and 17 per cent rise in Bajaj Auto.

Bajaj Auto, in fact, is among a handful of auto stocks that has yielded positive returns globally this year. Both Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv have been reporting strong numbers for past few quarters. Bajaj Finance’s Q2 profit grew 63 per cent while that of Finserv 71 per cent.

“Bajaj Finance can definitely give a 10 per cent return, if you are not expecting it to double in four-five years,” said Siddhartha Khemka of MOSL. In the case of Bajaj Finserv, Hemang Jani of Sharekhan said: ""Within insurance, we like Bajaj Finserv because it has both life and general insurance businesses. Besides, compared with some of the other listed entities, it is quoting at a discount of about 16-30 per cent.""

Mukund Engineers, Mukand, Bajaj Consumer Care, Bajaj Hindustan Sugar, Bajaj Electricals and Hercules Hoists are the other of group stocks that are down 14-52 per cent year to date.

Aditya Birla, ADAG stocks drop
Out of the nine listed Aditya Birla group stocks, six eroded Rs 33,000 crore worth of investor wealth this year. Vodafone Idea alone has lost Rs 21,870 crore in value. Hindalco, Grasim Industries and Aditya Birla Money have erased another Rs 20,000 crore. UltraTech Cement added Rs 9,050 crore to the group’s value.

Six ADAG stocks saw 40 per cent erosion in market value. Their combined market value now stands at Rs 22,400 crore compared with Rs 37,880 crore at the end of December 2018. Shares of RNAM have jumped 103 per cent (or by Rs 10,000 crore in value) during the same period. Nippon Life Insurance acquired 75 per cent stake in RNAM from Reliance Capital for around Rs 6,000 crore.

Reliance Capital, RCom, Reliance Home, Reliance Infra and Reliance Power lost 88-95 per cent of their value in 2019 so far.


Adani stocks deliver 19% return
In case of Gautam Adani stocks, except for Adani Ports, all other stocks have performed pretty well. Adani Green surged 113 per cent, followed by Adani Gas (47 per cent), Adani Transmission (32.65 per cent) and Adani Power (30 per cent). Adani Ports rose just 1 per cent for the year.

TCS, Titan, Trent, Voltas and TGBL contributed the bulk of increase in Tata group market-cap, as 17 of the 27 group stocks are down this year. TCS alone added Rs 1.13 lakh crore to the group’s market-cap. Titan added Rs 35,773 crore to its market value. Rest three added a combined Rs 16,720 crore.


RIL a $200 billion company in making
While shares of RIIL have fallen 20 per cent this calendar, those of RIL are up 30.86 per cent. A few brokerages have projected RIL to become a $200-220 billion entity in next 4-5 years.

1,2019-11-05,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Stocks with little say in benchmark Nifty saw strong buying interest from mutual funds (MFs) in September quarter, as the hunt for value intensified on Dalal Street.

These DIIs hiked stakes in 17 Nifty companies by at least 100 basis points this past quarter, even when 14 of these stocks have failed to match the index’s 10 per cent return so far in Calendar 2019. These stocks mostly included Nifty non-heavyweights. 

This suggests fund managers are expecting non-performing largecaps to play catchup from here on as index heavyweights become crowded trades.

As many as 21 Nifty stocks are down so far this year. And data shows 20 of them have not much say in Nifty movement. In contrast, only three index heavyweights – RIL, TCS and HDFC Bank – have added half of the rise in Nifty market capitalisation this year. This might have made the non-performers look attractive.

“If you exclude the top 10 Nifty heavyweights, other index constituents have been a drag this year. Post corporate tax cuts, a lot of funds are looking to create alpha by investing in index non-heavyweights and non-index stocks,” said Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Domestic fund managers looked less sanguine about the basket of next-50 stocks (Nifty Next 50). Midcaps, too, failed to attract much mutual fund buying during the quarter.

Sunil Jain of Nirmal Bang Securities said MF money has been chasing only a few largecap stocks that are deemed safe bets. “But initial signs suggest risk appetite is coming back. If it sustains for the next couple of months, we may see fresh money going into index non-heavyweights and even into select midcaps,” Jain said.

Data showed MFs increased stake in Ultratech Cement by 400 basis points in Q2 to 8.1 per cent from 4.1 per cent even while the stock has risen just 4 per cent year to date.

The stock is not among the Nifty heavyweights that comprised HDFC Bank (11.25 per cent), Reliance Industries (9.68 per cent), HDFC (7.23 per cent), Infosys (6.26 per cent) and ICICI Bank (5.94 per cent). Top 10 Nifty stocks accounted for 61 per cent of Nifty weight as of September 30.

In IndusInd Bank, another minnow in Nifty, mutual fund holding jumped to 12.6 per cent at the end of second quarter from 9.2 per cent at the end of first. This stock is down 17 per cent for so far in Calendar 2019.

YES Bank saw MF stake rise to 9.3 per cent from 6.6 per cent, sequentially. This stock is down 61 per cent year to date. Coal India, NTPC, Cipla, Eicher Motors, GAIL and Dr Reddy’s Labs are a few other stocks which have delivered negative returns and yet mutual funds have raised their stakes in it by 100-200 basis points.

Meanwhile, BPCL has seen an increase in MF holdings by 250 basis points and Axis Bank by 240 basis points. The two stocks are up 45 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, so far this year.

In the case of Nifty Next 50, which comprises the next 50 largecaps after Nifty constituents, only five stocks saw MF holding go up by more than 100 basis points during the quarter.

The stocks included ICICI Lombard General Insurance (up 410 bps QoQ), HPCL (200 bps), Power Finance Corporation (170 bps), Motherson Sumi Systems (160 bps) and Avenue Supermarts (100 bps).

In the case of 100 Nifty Midcap stocks, only 14 saw over 1 percentage points rise in MF holding.

Mahanagar Gas, LIC Housing Finance, Alkem Laboratories, The Federal Bank, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, TVS Motor Company, Oil India and Jubilant FoodWorks were a few of them that saw MF holding rise by 180-420 bps during the quarter gone by."
0,2019-11-05,UltraTech,"Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group-owned Grasim Industries and Ultratech Cement have accused Harsh Vardhan Lodha-controlled MP Birla Group of copyright infringement.

In a suit filed in the Bombay High Court, the two companies said MP Birla Group has infringed on their copyright by using the word 'ultra' in its cement brands.

Mumbai-based Ultratech has said that two of Kolkata-based MP Birla Group brands—MP Birla Cement Ultimate Ultra and MP Birla Cement Ultimate Ultra 2—are infringing its trademark by using the word 'ultra'.

""Plaintiffs (Ultratech and Grasim) have filed the present suit to prevent the act of infringement, passing off and unfair trade committed by the defendant by using the impugned mark,"" said the petition, which was reviewed by ET.

Passing off in IPR law means making a false representation that is likely to induce a person to believe that the goods or services are those of another.

Ultratech is seeking relief by restraining the Kolkata-based group from using the mark.

Senior counsel Veerandra Tulzapurkar, who appeared for the Aditya Birla firm, argued that MP Birla Group started using the impugned mark in July 2019.

But senior counsel Ravi Kadam, who is representing MP Birla Group, said the defendant has been using the mark since March 2018 and that it has enough material to substantiate its claim.

“Since the matter is sub judice, Birla Corporation would not like to make any detailed statement on the dispute. However, the company is confident of defending its trademark, MP Birla Cement Ultimate Ultra, against any legal challenge,” said a MP Birla spokesperson in an email response.

An email query to Aditya Birla Group did not elicit any response till the time of filing this report.

Law firm VA Associates is advising Ultratech Cement and Grasim Industries in the dispute while MP Birla Group is being represented by Legasis Partners."

Brokerage calls

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Dr Lal Pathlabs and increased target price to ₹1,800 from ₹1,330. The company's Q2 results were ahead of estimates, with another quarter of strong volume growth. Overall, volume remains the point of focus, helping the company expand into the rest of India and reducing dependence on its home market of Delhi/National Capital Region (NCR), it said. The brokerage has raised FY20-22 EPS estimates by 8-12% to reflect recent tax cuts. 

• Ambit Capital has maintained buy rating on Magma Fincorp and lowered target price to ₹59 from ₹68. Poor track record of execution, deteriorating asset quality and lack of pricing power expose Magma to vagaries of market liquidity crunch, said Ambit. Shrinking margin profile with poor levers around growth would continue to keep RoA/ RoE muted. But Magma’s seasoned retail book doesn’t warrant deep discount valuation to 3-year rolling crosscycle average. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on Eicher Motors and revised target price to ₹17,000 from ₹15,000. Eicher Motors reported 24% YoY decline in consolidated Ebitda in Q2 of FY20 led by weak volume growth and margin pressures in VECV and Royal Enfield businesses. Kotak Institutional expects volume pressure to persist in FY21 due to (1) shift towards BS-VI engines and (2) increase in competitive intensity.

8,2019-11-11,UltraTech,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, bought select FMCG, public sector companies and pharma players with both hands in October as September quarter earnings season peaked.

The fund house purchased more than 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and India's largest hydropower producer NHPC.

ITC last month posted a 37.06 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,173.72 crore for September quarter, while NHPC is scheduled to announce its number later on Monday.

Stock brokers are positive on ITC. Anand Rathi Financial Services in a November 6 report said: “With strong operating cash flows, continuous capacity expansions across businesses and a healthy balance sheet, we continue to remain positive on ITC over medium to longer term perspective. We maintain a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 352 per share.”

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other top buys in October included SBI, Coal India, REC, Bajaj Corp, Bharti Infratel, Neyveli Lignite, Cipla, Ambuja Cement, Federal Bank, Texmaco Rail, Tata Steel, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Firstsource Solutions and J Kumar Infraprojects, among others.

The fund house added 2.50 to 95 lakh additional shares of these companies last month.

SBI, the country’s biggest lender by assets, reported a nearly six-fold rise in Q2 profit at Rs 3,375.40 crore, supported by a partial stake sale in life insurance venture.

HDFC Securities earlier in November gave a ‘buy’ call to SBI with a target price of Rs 312.

HDFC AMC also added shares of infra players IRB Infra (18 lakh shares), Larsen and Toubro (11 lakh shares), Dilip Buildcon (6.51 lakh shares) and PNC Infratech (3.89 lakh shares). Besides, it further bought Sun Pharma (23 lakh shares), Grasim Industries (21 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (20 lakh shares), GAIL (19 lakh shares), Indian Hotels (19 lakh shares), Delta Corp (17 lakh shares), Kirloskar Ferrous (16 lakh shares) and Mishra Dhatu Nigam (16 lakh shares).

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore. The company had posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore in the same period last financial year.

From among large cap firms, the fund house added nearly 6 lakh shares of the InusInd Bank and 3.87 lakh shares of Bajaj Electricals. Financial firms including HDFC, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank also drew some interest of the AMC.

It further increased its exposure in Bajaj Finance, UltraTech Cement, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Dr Reddy’s Labs, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, M&M, Titan, HCL Technology and Adani Ports.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced 3.78 per cent, or 1,461 points to 40,129 in October amid robust inflows by foreign institutional investors during the month. On the other hand, BSE Midcap and Smallcap index gained 5.39 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month included over 1 crore shares each in Infosys, ICICI Bank, and BHEL.

It also sold over 10 lakh shares each in Edelweiss Financial, Reliance Industries, SAIL, Ashok Leyland, Adani Power, HPCL, BPCL and Vedanta during the month gone by, according to data available with Ace Mutual Fund.

Commenting on general market trend, Kashyap Pujara, head of research at Axis Capital in an interaction with ETNow said, “What we are seeing as a trend is that not only have midcap valuations have become extremely supportive but also we have seen participation of institutions on midcaps go down by 600 bps. It is going to be a U-shaped recovery for the midcaps. They tend to do well when GDP growth surprises and we will see GDP recovery going forward. As the recovery gets a bit broad-based, we will definitely see midcaps outperforming the largecaps over the next two to three years.”"

14,2019-11-14,UltraTech,"New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group's flagship firm Grasim Industries on Thursday posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,472.77 crore for the July-September period helped by good performance of its subsidiaries UltraTech Cement and Aditya Birla Capital.

Grasim Industries had reported a net loss of Rs 1,319.79 crore in the September quarter a year ago, Grasim Industries said in a BSE filing.

Its revenue from operation was at Rs 18,430.27 crore, up 3 per cent, during the quarter under review as against Rs 17,892.42 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

""Consolidated EBITDA at Rs 3,180 crore recorded a growth of 7 per cent Y-o-Y and PAT (before exceptional items and one-time deferred tax benefit) was up by 6 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 639 crore driven by superior performance of the company's subsidiaries, UltraTech Cement Limited and Aditya Birla Capital Limited.

Grasim Industries' total expenses were at Rs 17,069.81 crore during the period as against Rs 16,541.52 crore, up 3.19 per cent.

Its revenue from Viscose segment was at Rs 2,431.42 crore, down 6.67 per cent, to Rs 2,605.36 crore of Q2/FY 2018-19.

""The weakness in the domestic VSF realisations impacted this quarter's profitability. The benefit of falling input costs like pulp prices will get reflected in the coming quarters due to inventory time lag,"" said Grasim Industries.

While, its cement business UltraTech' revenue was at Rs 9,620.47 crore, up 4.01 per cent, as against Rs 9,249.26 crore.

""UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century Textiles and Industries cement business... With this acquisition, UltraTech's cement manufacturing capacity stands augmented to 117.4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), including its overseas capacity. This makes UltraTech the 3rd largest cement company in the world, outside of China,"" the company said.

Revenue from Chemicals during the quarter was at Rs 1,347.30 crore, down 16.44 per cent, as against Rs 1,612.38 crore.

""Softening of Caustic Soda prices globally has led to decline in the domestic prices, resulting in lower profitability on YoY basis,"" said Grasim.

While its Financial Services segment revenue reported a 12.72 per cent increase at Rs 3,960.86 crore during the period from Rs 3,513.59 crore a year ago.

Revenue from others segment was at Rs 1,305.60 crore, up 13.32 per cent, as against Rs 1,152.10 crore.

On the outlook, Grasim said its VSF business will continue to focus on expanding the market in India and its chemical business is under an expansion mode for both chlor-alkali and specialty chemicals.

On UltraTech, it said: ""The company with its presence across the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand, despite the anomalies that may get created in demand patterns in some parts of the country due to extraneous reasons.""

""Grasim is incurring capex to increase capacities across its key business lines and is potentially well positioned to leverage the next phase of the economic growth,"" the company said.

19,2019-11-19,UltraTech,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."

20,2019-11-21,UltraTech,"One-off deferred tax gain supported bottom lines for much of India Inc during the September quarter. But that should not take away credit from those which managed to grow bottom lines on the strength of top line expansion.

September quarter earnings season broadly turned out to be better than expected, which took BSE benchmark Sensex to its record high mark. Sensex scaled a fresh all-time high of 40,676 amid the ongoing earnings season.

This was one of the better earnings seasons anytime in last three or four years, says Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Adviser.

“A number of companies have beaten Street expectations. I am evening out the earnings growth because of the tax adjustments which a lot of companies have done because we had the tax cuts in the middle of the quarter. A lot of companies adjusted that in the second quarter,” he said.

For instance, despite a drop in top line, Tata Steel reported a 6 per cent increase in consolidated net for the quarter at Rs 3,302 crore, thanks to the new tax regime.

JSW Steel posted 22 per cent rise in consolidated net profit, mainly due to a writeback of deferred taxes and accrued incentives from previous years. But the company’s revenue from operations actually declined 18.5 per cent to Rs 17,572 crore from Rs 21,552 crore a year ago.

But Mavani also points out that going by pre-tax profit or Ebitda number, a large number of companies also managed to grow on their own, actually showing margin expansions that beat Street expectations.

Data available with Ace Equity on November 6 showed 71 firms listed on BSE as largecap, midcap or smallcap reported over 100 per cent rise in net profit in Q2.

Even some of them like Dr Reddy’s Lab reported over 100 per cent expansion in net profit despite a 25 per cent rise in Q2 revenue. Others like SBI reported manifold rise in bottom line due to a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

SBI posted nearly six-fold rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter, supported by a partial stake sale in its life insurance business.

Bottomline of the public sector lender grew 485 per cent to Rs 3,375 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 576 crore in the same period last year. Gujarat Gas, GSK Pharma, Indian Bank, Jindal Saw, NIIT, JK Tyre, Deepak Nitrite, Motilal Oswal Finanical Services, Bank of Maharasthtra and Avani Feeds were among other major players that reported over 100 per cent profit growth in Q2.



Besides one-time tax gains, other income, improving asset quality and corporate-related actions supported bottom lines of select companies during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services reported 3,297 per cent profit growth at Rs 142.3 crore in September quarter against a Rs 4.5 crore in the year-ago period, while Indian Bank reported Rs 359 crore profit on increasing income and improving asset quality by controlling loan slippages and other factors, a top bank official said.

A sharp drop in provisions for loan writeoffs in the home finance arm during the quarter supported the bottom line of the Mumbai-based firm. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said a strong momentum was seen in the market is due to healthy Q2 earnings from big corporates. “This positivity is likely to stay in the short to medium term as concerns of the market are fading with tax cut,” he said.

Out of top 71, five players reported over 100 per cent sales growth, 25 others posted 10 to 70 per cent increase sales. Others reported up to 10 per cent rise or fall in net sales during the quarter.

Some 73 firms from across sectors such as consumer food, TV broadcasting, banking, NBFC, plastic products, power generation and engineering, among others, reported 50 to 100 per cent bottom line expansion.

The list included players like Multi Commodity Exchange, Bandhan Bank, SRF, GTPL Hathaway, Kukuyo Camlin, Varun Beverages, EIH, Petronet LNG, PSP Projects, Torrent Power, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, UltraTech Cement and Aarti Drugs.



“Corporate earnings have been subdued or below expectations over the past few years. However, we are starting to see a revival in corporate earnings growth, and expect it to pick up pace from H2FY20. This will help to drive the markets going forward,” said Sampath Reddy, Chief Investment Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance.

He said the recent corporate tax cut would provide a boost to corporate earnings over time. “We believe a bottom-up research-oriented process, coupled with growth at reasonable price (GARP) approach will help deliver superior returns over the long term,” he said."

23,2019-11-23,UltraTech,"Three meetings, two hotels, one city. These were crucial to an eight-month-long investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2010 and 2011 to expose a cartel in India’s cement industry, which resulted in a penalty of Rs 6,317 crore, the regulator’s highest in a single case to date.

The CCI has since carried out many probes into alleged anti-competitive agreements and companies’ abuse of their dominant position, but it is still best known for the cement cartel case mainly because of the eye-popping fine. It is nearly half of the Rs 13,523 crore the CCI levied in 135 cases till March 2018, according to the latest data available with the regulator. Of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 55 crore, or 0.4%.




Compare this to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which collected $172 million in criminal penalties in fiscal year 2018 (October-September), with the highest ever being $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015. It has also sent several executives to prison.

While the CCI cannot boast figures like DoJ, the very fact that it has the authority to severely penalise violators could be working to its advantage. Meanwhile, some of the recommendations made by the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC), which submitted its report recently, could make CCI more nimble in the resolution of cases and take it a little closer to its counterparts in the EU, the UK and the US.




 It was in 2010, almost a decade ago, that the CCI, which had only become operational in May 2009, decided to probe its most high-profile case — to find out if 10 cement companies colluded through the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) to limit supplies and raise prices. The CCI said that after two of three CMA meetings at Mumbai’s Grand Hyatt and Hotel Orchid in early 2011, the companies hiked cement prices, which, the CCI said, “establishes that they co-ordinated their decisions and fixed prices after due consultations”. There were also questions over whether Ambuja Cement and ACC, which are part of the Swiss company LafargeHolcim, had attended two of these meetings despite no longer being members of the CMA.




The companies and the CMA disputed the CCI’s findings and appealed the penalty. The case has made its way through the Competition Appellate Tribunal, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which replaced the former in 2017, and is now pending before the Supreme Court, which asked the parties to deposit 10% of the penalty last year. Aparna Dutt Sharma, secretary general, CMA, did not respond to a request from 
ET Magazine for comment. Questions sent to Lafarge-Holcim, UltraTech Cement and Jaiprakash Associates, which were handed the highest penalties, also went unanswered.

The delay in the conclusion of this case — and others where fines were levied — has meant that companies have not coughed up what the CCI asked them to. Should that be a cause for concern? Kaushal Kumar Sharma, the first director-general of the CCI, says it would be wrong to equate deterrence to realisation of penalties. Vaibhav Choukse, partner, competition law, J Sagar Associates, concurs. “Companies do not want to be on the wrong side of the competition law as there is a huge reputational loss from a penalty.” A listed company will have to make disclosures to the stock exchanges in case it is fined by the CCI, which could drive its shares down.

“It’s not that the CCI wants to make money. The CCI’s idea in the early days was to make a splash and say, ‘We have arrived,’” says a competition lawyer, requesting anonymity. Nisha Kaur Uberoi, national head of competition law at Trilegal, a law firm, says the CCI has created deterrents through a combination of factors: “its ability to levy India’s highest economic penalties on companies, imposition of individual liability as well as advocacy to foster a culture of competition compliance”. By individual liability, she is referring to the CCI’s powers to penalise the directors of an errant company.

Ashok Kumar Gupta, chairman, CCI, recently told ET that penalties are not an end in themselves in any enforcement process. “In numerous cases, parties rectify their anti-competitive behaviour during the enquiry process itself so the market correction as such has taken place.”




As of March 2018, the CCI had noted 940 competition cases, ordered probes into 400 and completed investigations in 288. Even before the cement cartel case, a CCI order in 2011 gave India Inc an inkling of the regulator’s powers. It investigated the realtor DLF’s conduct in relation to one of its apartment buildings in Gurgaon and found that the company had set terms unfavourable to buyers in their agreement, like their inability to raise objections to changes in the structure by the builder. The CCI report added: “Despite knowing that necessary approvals were pending at the time of collection of deposits, DLF Ltd inserted clauses that made exit next to impossible for the buyers.”




The CCI fined DLF Rs 630 crore, which the realtor appealed; the matter is now in the apex court. Also before the Supreme Court is an appeal related to a Rs 591 crore penalty on Coal India for discriminatory terms in fuel-supply agreements. DLF and Coal India did not respond to questions sent by 
ET Magazine. Besides looking at anti-competitive agreements like cartels and abuse of dominance, the CCI also has to greenlight mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain size. The CCI, set up under the Competition Act, 2002 (amended in 2007), replaced the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.


Change is in the Air
The CLRC, which the government set up last year, has recommended a series of changes to the CCI. These include a dedicated NCLAT bench for competition cases, given that NCLAT is overburdened with cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. Though there is no NCLAT-specific data, as of September 30, there were nearly 1,500 IBC cases pending before the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.

Some of the report’s suggestions could make the CCI dispose of cases quickly. The introduction of settlement and commitment procedures, for instance, could help avoid pendency of cases. In the EU, which has had settlements since 2008, half the cartel cases are resolved using settlements, in which the parties admit to their guilt in exchange for a 10% reduction in penalties. Since 2004 the EU has also had commitments, in which the parties agree to change their behaviour. The US DoJ has consent decrees, which need to be court-approved.




Another recommendation made by the CLRC is that the CCI should be transparent in how it arrives at penalties, like in the EU and the UK. “It’s as if the CCI is pulling figures out of a hat,” says Aditya Bhattacharjea, professor at the Delhi School of Economics and a member of the CLRC.

The CCI, according to CLRC recommendations, can levy a penalty of up to 10% of the average turnover of the preceding three years in matters related to abuse of dominance. In case of cartels, it can impose a fine of up to 10% of their turnover or up to three times their profit in each year of the period during which the cartel existed, whichever is higher. “Having penalty guidelines will be good for the CCI when it has to defend its orders in courts,” says the competition lawyer quoted earlier.


Come Clean
Regardless of when these recommendations are incorporated into the law, experts say companies could make use of an existing provision to minimise a crippling penalty. A company engaged in an anti-competitive agreement with its competitors can alert the CCI to the existence of the cartel and cooperate in the investigation in the hopes of being waived a part, or the whole, of its fine.

Panasonic Energy utilised the lesser penalty option and went to the CCI in 2016 and admitted that it was part of a cartel with Eveready Industries and Indo National (which sells under the Nippo brand), aided by their industry association, to control the distribution and prices of zinc-carbon dry cell batteries, since 2008. Eveready and Indo National also availed of the lesser penalty provision. As a result, the CCI waived 100% of Panasonic’s Rs 75 crore penalty, and reduced Eveready’s and Indo National’s fines by 30% and 20%, respectively, to Rs 172 crore and Rs 42 crore.


Tech Challenge
Cracking down on cartels without one of the participating companies coming forward is not easy, especially since in some cases the CCI may not have more than circumstantial evidence to base its conclusions on. An even bigger challenge is dealing with violations in the fast-evolving world of technology.

Acting on information filed by Jaipur-based Consumer Unity & Trust Society and Matrimony.com, the CCI in 2018 fined Google Rs 136 crore for promoting its own specialised search — say, for flights — to the detriment of other websites. The order was stayed by NCLAT. Google is also being probed by the CCI for tying some of its apps to Android and limiting handset makers’ ability to sell devices with alternate versions. “Android has enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. We look forward to working with the CCI to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less,” says a Google India spokesperson.

Google’s dominance has been under scrutiny in the EU and the US as well. Since 2017, it has been fined a total of $9.3 billion by the EU in three different cases related to its abuse of dominance by favouring its advertising and shopping services over its competitors’ and for bundling some of its applications with Android. (Google has appealed all three orders.) It is also being investigated in the US and so are Facebook and, reportedly, Amazon. “Other than in the EU, competition regulators are exercising caution (with tech companies) because consumers are benefiting from these companies,” says Bhattacharjea.

While India may have got a competition authority later than several other countries, new technologies are coming to India soon after they are launched elsewhere. This is why Sharma, former CCI director general, believes that handling tech matters may not be too hard for the CCI. One of the emerging areas of concern for competition regulators worldwide is artificial intelligence-powered pricing algorithms of competitors colluding to fix prices. Who is to be held responsible here in the absence of executives of rival companies acting in tandem?

In addition to instances of cartelisation and abuse of dominance in the old-economy sectors, the CCI will have to increasingly deal with competition cases in businesses like ecommerce, ridehailing, food delivery and online travel aggregation (the CCI is currently investigating MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, which merged in 2017, and Oyo Rooms over allegations of predatory pricing, among others). The CCI has also made clear its intent to pursue cases on its own without a formal complaint. But what is unlikely to change, till the CLRC recommendations are implemented, is the time it takes for a case to reach its conclusion."

26,2019-11-25,UltraTech,"NEW DELHI: Positive developments on the US-China trade war front and Sensex rejig were among the key reasons for a rally in domestic equity market.

BSE benchmark Sensex jumped 470 points to trade at 40,829. The index also hit a new lifetime high of 40,857.73 during the day. Its NSE counterpart Nifty soared 141 points to 12,056.

Among other Sensex gainers were Bharti Airtel up 5.7 per cent to Rs 444.95 and IndusInd Bank up 2.6 per cent to Rs 1,484. HDFC was the biggest index contributor with 91 points.

Key factors behind the rally: 


Trade deal by year-end?

Sentiments improved on Dalal Street after reports said the US and China could sign a deal before the year ends. A senior US official over the weekend said an initial trade agreement is still possible by the end of the year, after Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump both underscored their desire on Friday to sign a deal.

The prolonged trade war between the world’s leading economies have been weighing on the market and economies. The resolution of the conflict may boost growth.


Laggards out of Sensex

BSE on Friday announced some changes to the composition of its flagship Sensex. The exchange has decided to remove Tata Motors, Tata Motors DVR, YES Bank and Vedanta from the index to make space for UltraTech Cement, Titan and Nestle India. This will be effective from December 23.

YES Bank has been one of the biggest disappointments in recent months as far as the stock market performance is concerned. It has dived 65 per cent year-to-date. SImilarly, Tata Motors is down 4 per cent YTD, Tata Motors DVR (17.9 per cent) and Vedanta (28 per cent) in comparison of 13 per cent gain in Sensex.


FPIs bullish on India

Foreign investors poured over Rs 5,000 crore into the Indian equity market on Friday, as per data available on NSDL. Net inflows in the last week was at Rs 2,683.96 crore. Overall, FIIs have largely been bullish on the Indian market in November, investing Rs 17,548 crore.


Asian markets

A cautious rally in Asian markets also buoyed domestic stocks. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.7 per cent, after losing 0.4 per cent last week. Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.7 per cent, while Australian stocks rose 0.5 per cent and Shanghai blue chips 0.3 per cent. Heng Seng also gained1.5 per cent. Most European markets also opened with gains. FTSE added 0.7 per cent while CAC gained 0.6 per cent and DAX was up 0.5 per cent. 


Technical factor

Nifty50 appears to have embarked on a fresh leg of rally as it erased the last two sessions of losses witnessed from the highs of 12,038-11,883 levels in just one stroke, said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

Hence, sustaining above 11,919 it should ideally test its life time highs placed around 12103. But beyond that in best case scenarios we can expect a target of 12350-400 levels. One can continue to retain a positive outlook as long as Nifty sustains above 11919 levels which can be ideal stop for fresh long positions on closing basis."

31,2019-11-28,UltraTech,"By Nupur Acharya

A slowing economy hasn’t stopped India’s benchmark equity index from climbing to a series of records this year, but this divergence may have run its course, according to BNP Paribas.

Asia’s third-biggest economy probably grew 4.6 per cent last quarter, which would be the slowest since the first three months of 2013, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of Friday’s data release. Meanwhile, the Sensex closed at a new high Wednesday and is up nearly 14 per cent for 2019. Stocks have climbed mainly since late September, when the unveiling of a corporate tax cut boosted the outlook for corporate earnings.

“Our recent meetings with policy makers and industry experts confirmed that there is unlikely to be a significant uptick in economic data in the near term,” Abhiram Eleswarapu, the firm’s Mumbai-based head of equity research, wrote in a note. “The index rally we had cautiously called for may be done for now.”

This view echoes that of Credit Suisse, which expects the growth slump to last longer than anticipated based on its interaction with investors. “With growth continuing to fall in Oct.-Nov., it seems unlikely that FY20 would see any growth in EPS and FY21 should see meaningful cuts too,” it said in a report this week.


Bloomberg
Investors are, however, unfazed by the economic slowdown. Net foreign buying in Indian stocks has reached $3.2 billion so far this month, set for the biggest tally since March, according to official data. The recent equity gains have also been fueled in part by hopes for a trade deal between the U.S. and China.

“The government may soon have to make the difficult choice between considerably slipping on its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP in FY20 to boost growth or potentially prolonging the slowdown by halting expenditure,” BNP said.

The brokerage remains overweight on India, and favors private banks, insurers and dividend-paying public sector firms.


Here’s a roundup of other brokerage views:

Goldman Sachs


Overweight India as it expects the economy to recover and corporate earnings to improve next year.
The growth recovery is likely to be led by a pick-up in the global cycle, the impact of easing local financial conditions and recent government measures.
India EPS growth will rise to 16 per cent next year from 12 per cent this year.
Expect the NSE Nifty 50 Index to reach 13,000 by the end of 2020, implying upside of over 7 per cent from the current level.


JPMorgan


While Indian stocks have underperformed in three of the last four years amid the slowdown in growth, they appear set to be the “turnaround story” of early 2020.
Expectations of a growth bottom and government reforms should sustain elevated nominal valuations. Relative valuations are “closer to average”.
JPMorgan sees a modest growth recovery in the second half of fiscal year 2020 driven by a favorable base effect, above-normal rain, government spending and impact from RBI easing.
Recommendations: ICICI Bank, Ultratech Cement and Ashok Leyland.


Societe Generale


Reforms hold the key to further gains in share prices.
Corporate tax reforms are bringing foreign investors back and have raised the longer term return potential of the market.
While the earnings trend is positive, equity valuations are higher than all major markets in the region.
Expect economic headwinds to start receding in the coming year."

1,2019-12-03,UltraTech,"Pledging of client’s shares by Hyderabad-based Karvy Stock Broking to raise money to fund its real estate business has dented investors' confidence in stock brokers. Investors are shifting to larger brokers, says Jaideep Hansraj, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities in an interview with ETMarkets.com. Hansraj, who deals with 13.59 lakh customers, denied that it was a systemic failure and termed it as an isolated incident. Edited excerpts:


The mess at Karvy Stock Broking has actually dented stock investor confidence on brokers. What led to this? Was it a systemic failure?
Indeed, investor confidence has been shaken and several investors are shifting their demat accounts to larger, established players. While confidence in smaller, younger players may be impacted, there is a flight to safety to larger, established and regulated players. 

These cases happen where businesses hold their own interests higher than clients’. It is not a systemic failure, but an isolated instance of breaking norms of prudent business behaviour.

We believe that the financial services industry is all about trust, and any player taking this lightly impacts the entire industry. The broking industry is unique in itself that it is made up of a milieu of long-serving smaller players, start-ups, and some trusted large banking companies. 


Stockbrokers often crib about being over-regulated. But this kind of crisis keeps happening. Is the average investor safe with her broker?
Regulations are meant to safeguard the interest of the investors. In this case, it wasn’t strictly about regulation, but the interpretation of trust. The Depository Participant has a simple underlying principle that clients’ shares -- while under Power of Attorney (POA) for administrative purposes -- are held solely for them. They cannot and will not be used for anything else. 

You don’t need regulation for this, but a culture of ethical behaviour. The investor must know that in financial services, he has to trust the intermediary. Trust is built over the years of keeping client interest paramount. There is a value to this. There is safety in this.


What should investors do to protect themselves in such a situation?
Be smart, follow basics. Investors must choose carefully whom they want to do business with. One must not open an account with anyone just because the office is close to home, a friend has recommended, or it has a fancy website. The critical question to ask is – can I trust the institution and the people behind it? It is, after all, your hard-earned money. 


Let’s talk about the market. The indices have hit record highs while economic growth has slowed to a multi-quarter low. Isn’t that an aberration? What’s driving this rally? Is it sustainable?
There has been a disconnect between the macro-economic environment and markets, which could continue for some time. The Street seems to be factoring in a swift recovery in the economy, going by the rich valuations of the Nifty50. But we are not sure when the convergence between the economy and the market will take place. There is a mixed bag of factors in play here. 


Trust is built over the years of keeping client interest paramount. There is a value to this. There is safety in this.-Jaideep Hansraj
High-frequency indicators are not showing signs of macro improvement. But the broader Indices are close to near-highs. This is because of a faster recovery in earnings led by the corporate tax rate cut and lower loan-loss provisions for banks. 

After the reduction in corporate tax rate, earnings have picked up in Q2FY20, and foreing portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned positive on India. Sentiment and flows are also driving markets higher as there have been some positive developments on the US-China trade war. The series of intervention by the Finance Ministry in the last two months has also changed the mood of the market. 

There has been a remarkable difference in the performance of the top 20 stocks of the Nifty and the rest of the market. Most high-quality largecap stocks have benefited from the lower tax rate, and to that extent and their performance has further contributed to the Nifty’s up move. 


Midcaps and smallcaps are the talk of the town. But since the last time we saw a rally in midcaps, the equation has changed with market regulator Sebi’s reclassification of funds. Can one expect midcaps to rebound like in the past?
If you look at the valuations, both the midcap and smallcap indices are trading at a discount to the Nifty50. The midcap index forward PE is at a 12% discount to the Nifty’s forward PE. (In the middle of this year, the discount of the midcap index vis-à-vis the Nifty50 had fallen to 20%). 

Meanwhile, the underperformance of the smallcap index vis-a-vis the Nifty50 is closer to the three previous instances seen in the last 15 years. This portrays a good upside potential in the smallcaps against the largecaps. The midcap index too has broken the 200-week moving average on the upside and that could be a positive sign for the space.

For the mid and smallcaps to outperform the largecaps, we need a broad recovery in the economy with improved credit offtake along with better print of IIP and GDP growth. If the forthcoming Union Budget provides some incentives to taxpayers and investors, then we could see a broader rally in the market which could revive interest in the mid & smallcap space. 

A base for future outperformance of mid and smallcap has been set in this calendar year which could fructify in next calendar year as and when there is a broader economic recovery. One can increase exposure in mid and smallcaps vis-à-vis largecaps with a two to three-year view. 


Investors looking for value buys are facing a crucial question: which of the beaten-down stocks will rebound and which will probably never return to their previous highs again?
Investors need to be careful while evaluating value stocks and ascertaining whether they will recover or remain a value trap. Companies having deep value but lacking the ability to show revenue and earnings growth in future could be value traps and hence worth avoiding. Companies which are trading below their 10-year average valuations and can show revenue and earnings growth with recovery in their sector or economy, deserve to be evaluated and invested. 

Investors should have a specific checklist or parameters like quality of management, promoter holding and pledged shares, margins, return ratios, cash flows, working capital, etc. before taking the final decision to invest in any value stock. 

Excellent quality mid and smallcaps that have been beaten down due to the down cycle of the sector or economy and are available way below their RoE and RoCE, should be the preferred choice. Poorly governed companies with weak balance sheets and return ratios should be avoided as they may not be on investors’ and portfolio managers’ radar. 


How do you read the outcome from the just-concluded Q2 earnings season? Some say the numbers were good for select stocks mostly because of the corporate tax cut?
The September quarter results were optically healthy on earnings but weak on revenue growth. EBITDA looks very high due to the adoption of Ind-AS 116. Net Profit figures for many companies are not comparable on a YoY basis as many of them have moved to lower corporate tax rate and reduced their deferred tax liabilities or assets to account for the lower tax rate. Adjusted net profit of Nifty 50 declined by 3.2% YoY. 

Private sector banks reported weak earnings due to adjustment towards deferred tax assets, while SBI reported a significantly higher net profit as it continued with the earlier tax regime. Hence, if we see Nifty50 adjusted earnings growth excluding banks, then it has fallen by 10.5% in Q2FY20 on YoY basis. 

Nifty50 companies that outperformed our estimates on PBT basis include Cipla, Dr Reddy’s, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC and Tata Motors. Similarly, Nifty 50 companies that underperformed our estimates are: GAIL, Hindustan Unilever, IndianOil Corp, Tata Steel, UPL and Ultratech Cement. 

Sector-wise, banks, diversified financials, healthcare services, media and transportation delivered strong growth in net profit YoY while automobiles and components, gas utilities, metals and mining, oil & gas and telecom sectors declined YoY."

6,2019-12-10,UltraTech,"ET Intelligence Group: The median number of women on Indian boards doubled in the past five years, but they still form a small proportion of the total board members. A study of the Bloomberg data on gender composition of boards of 91 companies of the BSE-100 index reveals the median number of women on an Indian board was two in 2018-19, up from one five years ago. However, women constituted only 14 per cent of the board, albeit higher than the median 10 per cent half a decade ago.

India Inc has lagged behind the US trend on gender diversity on boards. The 2018 US Spencer Stuart Board Index shows that nearly onefourth of the directors of S&P 500 companies are women, with boards having 2.6 female directors on average. While 87 per cent of S&P 500 companies have two or more women directors, the corresponding number for Indian boards stands at 54 per cent.

The most gender-diversified board (of Apollo Hospitals) among the BSE-100 index has 42 per cent women on it, while the least diversified board (of ONGC) has 6 per cent representation of women. Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been the traditional laggards in improving the diversity quotient of their boards. They comprised four of the top ten BSE-100 companies with the worst diversity ratios at the board level in FY19. Bajaj group companies — Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finance — also figure in this list.



Contrary to the general trend of increase in board diversity, there are a handful of companies — Tata Global Beverages, Titan, Axis Bank, LIC Housing Finance and HDFC Bank — that have seen reduction in diversity on their boards over the past five financial years.

Having a woman director on the board seems to be for the minimum compliance of the Companies Act, 2013 for one-fourth of the BSE-100 companies. Of the 91 companies, 24 have been consistent in having only a single woman director through each of the past five years.

To be sure, the companies with the highest gender diversity ratio are market leaders or among the leading players in their industries in India. Apollo Hospitals is the country’s largest private sector hospital chain. Godrej Consumer Products is a market leader in household insecticides and is the second largest marketer of soaps in the country. UltraTech Cement is India’s largest cement producer, while Cipla and Infosys are leaders in their respective industries."

Going into the New Year, most analysts have a bullish view on domestic equities and expect a sharp recovery in second-rung stocks.

“One can easily expect Nifty and Sensex to move up by 8-10 per cent in 2020 from current levels. Calendar 2020 will see revival in interest for the second-rung counters. Money will flow towards quality smallcaps and midcaps faster,” says Vinay Pandit, Head of Institutional Equities at IndiaNivesh.

Marico: Marico has the potential to post double-digit revenue growth driven by a good product mix and innovations, demand improvement, expansion in international markets, maintaining leadership positions in key brands and gaining market shares in core categories over the next 2-3 years. The brokerage has recommended a ‘buy’ rating on the stock in a staggered manner for healthy returns over the long term.


Gujarat Gas: It is the largest city gas distribution company. Going forward, Religare Broking expects it to deliver strong growth across industrial, commercial and domestic segments in the existing geographies. In addition, its expansion into six new geographical areas recently should support volume in the medium to long term.


Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M): The tractor industry is likely to recover as normal monsoon, easing liquidity conditions and lower interest rates should aid domestic sentiments. M&M’s automotive segment is likely to witness challenges due to an increase in competitive intensity and BS-VI implementation. Nonetheless, Religare Broking believes these concerns are largely factored in and the core business is available at attractive valuations.

ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank appears firmly positioned to deliver healthy sustainable growth, supported by continued investments in technology and expansion in its digital offerings. The bank has navigated well through a challenging macro-environment with limited exposure to the newly surfaced stressed names. It has, in fact, built one of the highest provisioning coverage in the banking sector. ICICI Bank is one of the top picks in the BFSI space. Return on assets and return on equity are likely to improve to 1.6 per cent and 15.7 per cent, respectively, in FY21.


Ultratech Cement: Since FY17, the company has grown its capacity by 65 per cent to 109.4mmtpa, accounting for 23 per cent of all-India capacity. The company also has one of the highest exposures to the northern and central regions, which have the best utilisation and pricing outlook. Operating cash flow is likely to be strong at over Rs 8,000 crore annually. At the same time, capex should be limited to around Rs 2,000 crore each in FY20 and FY21, driving strong free cash flow generation of over Rs 6000 crore per annum (5% yield). As a result, net debt is expected to reduce from Rs 19,100 crore in FY19 to Rs 13,500 crore in FY21. MOFSL forecasts a CAGR of 30 per cent in EBITDA and 42 per cent in EPS over FY19-21, driven by a 14 per cent CAGR in volumes and better margins. The stock trades at a reasonable valuations of 11x EV/Ebitda.


Rusmik Oza, Senior VP & Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities


SBI: SBI is a preferred pick to play on the economic recovery. The retail segment constitutes around 30 per cent of the loan book and has been witnessing strong growth rates driven by home loans (up 18 per cent yoy) and Xpress credit (personal loans) (up 42 per cent yoy). The corporate book constitutes 40 per cent of the loan book and could see improvement as and when the economic activity picks up. Kotak Securities is optimistic that FY20 should see far better performance than FY19 and going forward the bank is well-poised to show sharp improvement in return ratios by FY21-22 on the back of recovery in loan growth, healthy operating profit growth and sharp reduction in credit costs. Post the Supreme Court verdict on Essar Steel case, the brokerage house expects healthy recoveries for corporate banks of which SBI could be the biggest beneficiary. Earnings could go up multifold between FY19 and FY22 leading to decent jump in book value.


Suven Lifesciences: Suven Life Sciences is a research-based service provider to global innovator companies by supplying intermediates for New Chemical Entities (NCE) development. Suven Lifesciences SUVN 502 molecule failed to meet the primary endpoints, which was clearly a negative, however, the drug was safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events. The company is getting demerged into two, namely, R&D arm (SLSL) and core CRAMS business (SPL). Management expects the demerger to complete by end of FY20. Post de-merger, Kotak expects the R&D expenses in the CRAMS business to reduce to 4-5 per cent of sales for FY21E and FY22E resulting in EBIDTA margins improving from current 35 per cent and 36 per cent to around 42 per cent and 43 per cent for FY21E and FY22E, respectively. Post the failure of SUVN 502, Kotak has deduced Rs 54, as the potential upside that could have come from out-licensing. Our revised target price works to Rs 391 valuing the stock at 19x FY22E EPS of Rs 19.4 arriving at price of Rs 369 (for base business) and adding the value of 3 molecules put together at Rs 22.


Sunil Jain, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Securities


APL Apollo Tubes: The company is the largest producer of ERW Steel Pipes and Sections in India with a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes (2.8x nearest competitor). APL is an outlier in the ERW pipe industry, having grown revenues at 23 per cent CAGR over last five years, it increased its market share from 12 per cent in FY15 to 18 per cent in FY19 combined with strong profitability (avg ROE of 19 per cent over last 5 years) in a low margin, commodity-convertor business. APL’s success is built upon the following characteristics – (i) Lowest cost producer owing to large scale procurement. (ii) 90 per cent of the revenues come from (B2C) its pan-India distribution network of 790 distributors and 50,000 retailers leading to higher margins and lower receivables. (iii) Multiple plants pan-India in close proximity to the distribution network ensures minimal logistical costs. (iv) APL has over 1,100 SKUs (unmatched by any of its peers). (v) Continuously enhanced brand awareness via advertisements (averaged at 5 per cent of profits historically). (vi) APL offers better incentives to the distributors who in turn push APL’s products. While APL’s products are priced similar to its peers, cost advantages allow it to incentivize distributors better than its peers. It is also available at attractive valuations at 18.4x and 12.9x for FY20 and FY21E, respectively.


DCB Bank: DCB Bank is a Mumbai-based private sector bank having a loan book of around Rs 25,000 crore. The lender’s core focus is towards self-employed clients with SME (53 per cent mix), retail (15 per cent mix) and agri (20 per cent mix) together forming 88 per cent of the loan book and the balance constituting corporate loans (12 per cent mix). Murali Natrajan, the current MD & CEO (joined in 2009), was instrumental in complete overhaul of the bank’s assets and liabilities restructuring wherein he moved the business model towards secured lending and reduced dependence on inter-bank borrowings. He led the turnaround in the bank’s asset quality wherein GNPAs declined from 9 per cent in FY09 to below 2 per cent by FY14. Superior asset quality has been the hallmark of DCB with the bank’s GNPAs/Slippages constantly remaining at around 2 per cent mark since FY14 despite a challenging macro environment and a loan book skewed towards SMEs. 

Strong branch expansion and addition of employees over FY15-18 had kept the cost/income ratio elevated at around 60 per cent historically despite strong core income growth of around 25 per cent. However, now with the expansion phase behind and the branch capacity buildup getting utilised, Nirmal Bang expects cost/income to decline to around 54 per cent by FY21E. ROE is likely to expand by 240 bps over FY19-21E to 13.4 per cent.


Jubilant Life Sciences: Jubilant Life Sciences is an integrated global pharmaceutical and life sciences company engaged in pharmaceuticals (60 per cent), life science ingredients (37 per cent) and other businesses including drug discovery solutions and India branded pharmaceuticals. The stock has corrected 45 per cent in last one year due to regulatory actions on its Roorkee formulations and Nanjangud API facilities and due to uncertainty of pharma business listing (which has been clear now). The company has a healthy pipeline of 8 products having market size of $300, which would be filed and commercialised in next 3-5 years.

Recently China government has decided to terminate the 17.6 per cent anti-dumping duty on imported pyridine (Jubilant’s key product) originating in India which is a positive development for the company. To unlock the value for shareholders, the board has decided to demerge life sciences business into separate company. The swap ratio is decided as 1:1 At CMP, Jubilant Life is trading at 9.6x/8.2x FY20E/FY21E earnings which are attractive.


Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities


Ashok Leyland: Ashok Leyland is solid pure CV play on the economic recovery which can deliver over 25 per cent CAGR returns over the next three years.

Bharti Airtel: Telecom pricing is improving and Bharti Airtel is a long-term growth play in the sector. Bharti will manage to raise sufficient capital to tide through the near-term challenges and grow the company."
