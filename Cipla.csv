8,2018-01-08,Cipla,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Five pharmaceutical companies including Cipla, Hetero and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories are under the Indian regulator’s scanner for allegedly overcharging for a new Hepatitis C combination which they launched without waiting for price approval.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has sent show-cause notices to these companies alleging overcharging for the combination drug used to treat the potentially fatal Hepatitis C virus that harms the liver, said people familiar with the development.

While NPPA had set this drug’s retail price in November, four companies started selling their versions as early as May 2017 for about Rs 1,000 more, without prior price approval from the regulator.

Notices were sent to Hetero Labs, Cipla, Natco Pharma, Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Dr Reddy’s for overcharging for a combination of sofosbuvir (400 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg), the regulator said in an emailed response to ET. Natco, Mylan and Hetero responded to the notices last week and the replies are “under examination,” it said.


NPPA sought to know how the companies arrived at the prices of their drug brands without due regulatory submissions and approvals, a person familiar with the development told ET on condition of anonymity. The notices specify recovery of overcharged amounts, penalties, a charge of 15% interest and prosecution measures as per the Essential Commodities Act.

“Quantification of overcharging liability with interest and penalty to be calculated after examination of companies’ replies… a penalty not less than 100% of the principal amount shall be imposed in such cases,” NPPA told ET.

Some companies that received the notices said although they had sought pricing price approval before launching the drug, the NPPA had delayed in setting the retail prices.


“It took months to get this (price) approval but in the meantime our patients were demanding (the drug),” said an executive of one company on condition of anonymity. About 60 lakh people in India have Hepatitis C and require access to such medicines, the person added.

NPPA approved a price of Rs 15,625 for the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir combination, excluding taxes, according to a November 2017 notification. Including the Goods and Services Tax, the maximum retail price of the drug is Rs 17,500.

Most brands of this combination were sold at Rs 18,500, according to minutes of an NPPA meeting held that month. Hetero, Dr Reddy’s and Natco were among the first to launch the product in India in May 2017.

“We have received a preliminary notice from NPPA routinely asking for certain information on the product in question.

We are in the process of collating such information to respond to NPPA,” a Cipla spokesperson told ET, adding that no penalty has been levied on the company.

Dr Reddy’s did not share any response with ET. Hetero said it has no comment to offer. Natco and Mylan did not respond to ET’s queries.

Seven sofosbuvir-velpatasvir brands, which are generic versions of California-based Gilead Sciences Inc’s Epclusa, are available in India.

Other companies that have introduced the product include Abbott and Cadila Healthcare, but it could not be confirmed if they were charged under a similar violation. Abbott, which sells it Velpaclear for Rs 17,500, denied receiving any notice from the NPPA. An email sent to Cadila remained unanswered."

21,2018-01-15,Cipla,"MUMBAI:Water treatment solution provider Ion Exchange is betting big on water infrastructure projects coming through the government as part of its plan to make larger investments in area of Build Operate Transfer (BOT) and Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.

The company was awarded a big project in Sri Lanka for water infrastructure worth Rs 1200 crore in 2014 and it now wants to pursue similar projects in India, aiming at the segment garnering more than 40% of the total revenue in the coming three years.

“We are scouting for projects both in India and abroad where the customer has a good credit rating and the project can be bankable,"" said Ion Exchange CMD Rajesh Sharma in an interview with ET. ""We expect such projects coming more in the areas of BOT and PPP,” he added. 

As part of its larger vision of environment management, the company will also soon enter into solid waste to energy projects in India with the aim of sharing the technology with different municipal corporations in the country. 

It is going to start a Rs 7 crore worth pilot project in Hyderabad, slated to be commissioned in January, where Ion Exchange will be using a unique technology to combine kitchen waste and sludge to produce energy upto 25 GW per day as well as 500 tonnes a year of rich fertiliser.

Ajay Popat, president of the company says that the company is entering waste to energy projects at a time when the government is being exceedingly vocal about the potential of waste to energy project, calling the company “well before time in exploring most divisions- be it RO, sewage recycling or waste management”. 

The company also commissioned the country's first reverse osmosis membrane (RO) manufacturing plant last year in Goa, built with an investment of Rs 50 crore for domestic use as well as exporting. 

Being the pioneer in introducing the drinking water treatment revolution RO to the country, Ion Exchange has literally been riding the waves of waste water treatment in India, providing solutions across sectors to help companies like Bajaj Auto, Hero Honda Motors in the automotive sector, Alkem and Cipla in pharma as well as Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel in the steel sector, among many others, in managing their water requirements, as well as recycling waste water for them to use for industrial purposes.

Sharma says that with the government stressing on prioritising use of freshwater by homes and agriculture, industrial use of freshwater will become costlier and reduce companies’ dependence on it.

Ion Exchange that competes in this spaces with names like GE Water, Thermax, VA Tech Wabag and Hindustan Dorr Oliver (HDO), has also recently become a favourite with investors as the share prices of the company has soared by almost 85% in the last one year, outdoing all listed peer companies. HDO has, in fact given a negative return with stock prices falling by almost 26% and the company also facing insolvency resolution process. Consistently making profits, it had reported a profit of Rs 8 crore in the September quarter and a profit of Rs 46 crore for 2016-17. 

Going forward, Ion Exchange has announced the expansion of its resins facility in Ankleshwar for Rs 20 crore and is eyeing two more water infrastructure projects in the South East Asian region."

Global pharmaceutical companies have bemoaned for years India's capricious policies on prices and patents. Now the government needs billions of dollars for its ""Make in India"" program, why can't the industry get a fairer deal?

When it comes to intellectual property, it's now understood -- and grudgingly accepted -- that India's use of compulsory licensing won't go away. Ever since New Delhi used this tool to force Bayer AG to allow a low-priced local copy of its expensive cancer treatment, there's been popular support for the idea of banning profiteering at the expense of lives.

As long as that nuclear option was used rarely, and only to address real public-health concerns, Big Pharma could live with it.

But pricing problems go beyond patents. In 2013, the list of essential medicines where the regulator has the right to cap prices was expanded five-fold. That led to some weird situations. Condoms were set at a maximum of 6.56 rupees apiece, 11 U.S. cents at the time, and raised a year later to 13 cents. Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc's legal challenge -- that its Durex contraceptives are devices, not drugs -- is being heard by India's Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, the regulator, has been advised by an expert committee that ""exotic"" condoms -- fruit-flavored ones, for example -- could be priced above the regular variety, according to a Livemint report last month.

If that seems frivolous, the regulator's bruising attempts last year to curb prices of heart stents and knee implants have graver implications. After India moved to cut the price of such implants by as much as 70 percent in August, Johnson & Johnson's non-U.S. revenue growth from knee devices declined 9.5 percent in constant-currency terms in the third quarter, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. 

All this suggests the industry would have welcomed a new pharmaceuticals policy, especially one that reined in the powerful and largely independent regulator.

That body invoked emergency powers to lower knee-implant prices when the product wasn't even on the list of essential medicine. A draft policy circulated last summer sought to curb this special power, requiring the authority to obtain government permission.

Yet, as Bloomberg reporters Ari Altstedter and Abhit Roy Chowdhury noted on Friday, the draft policy has gone back to the drawing board. No action is expected before the general election in 2019.

Chalk up the delay as a success for the domestic drugmakers' lobby. To make common medicines more affordable in a country where most drugs are bought out of patients' pockets, the new policy would have disallowed branded generics. The manufacturer would have stamped its name on the packaging for identification, but otherwise a strip of amoxicillin tablets would say just that.

But being able to brand a generic drug makes it possible to charge 96 percent more than for no-name formulations. That premium lets firms maintain an army of medical representatives who can persuade doctors to prescribe their pills. It's a minefield of unethical practices, but giving it up would be expensive.


Average markup for branded generics96%

Indian drugmakers such as Cipla Ltd., Cadila Healthcare Ltd. and Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. rely heavily on branded formulations, and would have been among the firms most at risk from regulatory changes, says JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Even Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., India's biggest drugmaker, is betting on increased use of branded generics in emerging markets. By 2021, it estimates such products will account for one-fifth of the $1.5 trillion a year spent on medicines worldwide. That's $300 billion -- or almost $100 billion more than at present.

To the extent a ban on branding of generics could have prompted more developing countries to follow suit, India's policy would have been a drag on profits. And at a bad time: There's pressure on domestic companies to clean up their act. As many as 44 drug-manufacturing facilities in India, which makes 40 percent of the generic drugs taken by Americans, are banned from sending products to the U.S.

A growing list of price controls, from condoms to stents, gives the global industry good reason to complain about India. But for the local firms, replacing the status quo with something that endangers a $300 billion opportunity isn't worth the risk.

23,2018-01-16,Cipla,"Just when the Narendra Modi government is struggling to meet the fiscal deficit target, it is set to reap a bonanza — the sale of enemy properties that belong to those who migrated to Pakistan and China. 

More than 9,000 enemy properties are worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore. The home ministry has started the process of identifying all such properties. At a recent meeting, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh was informed that the survey of 6,289 enemy properties had been completed. Singh directed that those properties which were free from encumbrance should be disposed of quickly for monetisation. 

Fiscal deficit for FY18 is likely to exceed the budgeted estimate of 3.2 per cent by about 0.3 per cent. Slow GDP growth, low GST collections, smaller dividend from the RBI and less proceeds from telecom spectrum have upset the fiscal math. Higher oil prices and proposed additional borrowing of Rs 50,000 crore for the current fiscal will further put pressure on government finances.

That's why the windfall gain of more than Rs 1 lakh crore is just in time. 


The passing of the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Bill 2016 paved the way for the government to monetise enemy properties.The amendment empowers the Custodian of Enemy Property to sell such assets which was not permitted under the old Enemy Property Act, 1968. 

According to data provided in the report of the parliament select committee on the bill, there are 9,280 immovable properties belonging to Pakistani nationals encompassing 11,882 acres. The total value of immovable properties that are vested with the custodian stood at Rs 1.04 lakh crore. Movable vested properties consist of shares in 266 listed companies valued at Rs 2,610 crore; shares in 318 unlisted companies valued at Rs 24 crore; gold and jewellery worth Rs 0.4 crore; bank balances of Rs 177 crore; investment in government securities of Rs 150 crore and investment in fixed deposits of Rs 160 crore.

Besides this, there are 149 immovable enemy properties of Chinese nationals with the custodian in West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Delhi.



An ET Intelligence Group investigation in 2008 had revealed that the shares vested with the custodian were in listed entities such as Wipro, Cipla ACC, Tata and DCM group companies, Bombay Burmah Trading Co., Ballarpur Industries, DLF, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Bajaj Electricals, India Cement and Aditya Birla Nuvo. 

Even if the government is bale to auction a part of the enemy properties, it will provide considerable fiscal cushion."

28,2018-01-21,Cipla,"In the early 1970s, a young Habil Khorakiwala had to persuade not just his father but also the extended family and even family friends to get a go-ahead to set up a factory outside Mumbai. His father Fakhruddin Khorakiwala, who led the retail chain Akbarally’s at the time and later served as the sheriff of Mumbai, was a firm believer in conducting his businesses within the city limits. He enlisted his friends to dissuade Habil.

“I would like to die once in my life, and not every day with fear,” Habil, who was about 30 then, eventually told his father, winning the argument and getting the nod to move out of the city and start Wockhardt’s factory, 335 kilometres away, in Aurangabad. Wockhardt — a name derived from the family firm Worli Chemicals and given a German tweak for effect — became a pharmaceuticals and healthcare success story over the next four decades.

Today, 45 years after he made that profound statement about dying only once, Habil Khorakiwala, chairman of Wockhardt Ltd, would like to repeat it to investors, regulators and naysayers.

In 2012, Wockhardt emerged out of a bruising debt-restructuring exercise, having sold its promising nutrition business to French FMCG major Danone for $356 million. Also, group company Wockhardt Hospitals sold part of its hospital chain to Fortis for Rs 909 crore to repay loans. Relief was short-lived, though. From 2013, regulatory action by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rocked the Indian pharmaceutical industry that was selling generic drugs in the US and Europe — and it hit Wockhardt too. 


The company is at curious juncture now as it figures out a way out of the prolonged mess. Four of its factories are still under FDA scanner. On a consolidated basis, there is a huge deficit in the profit and loss account. In 2016-17, Wockhardt recorded a net loss of Rs 226 crore on revenues of Rs 4,128 crore. And in the half year ended on September 30, 2017, it recorded a loss of Rs 470 crore on revenues of Rs 2,004 crore. The Indian business returned to profit in July-September after three quarters of loss, but still has a huge deficit to fill for 2017-18 to be a profitable year.

Over the last three months, the company’s share price has staged a smart recovery (See Seesaw Ride). While its ranking among Indian pharma majors in terms of market capitalisation has fallen from No. 6 in 2013 to No. 22 in 2018, it seems the markets are ready to bet on the stock and Khorakiwala once more. The scrip, having touched a 52-week low on August 22, 2017 at Rs 531.50, moved up more than 90% to a 52-week high of Rs 1,012 on January 8, 2018.

In an interview with ET Magazine, Khorakiwala, who has just released his autobiography Odyssey of Courage, lays out what seems like a pathway to recovery for the company. First, he expects all his factories to be cleared by the US FDA in the next 18 months. Second, he expects the anti-infective drug (medicines that act against infections) discovery programme that the company has been investing in as a contrarian bet over the last two decades to bear fruit in the next two years. At 75, Khorakiwala is again ready to live by what he once told his father. 



Swim or Sink
Khorakiwala needs everyone to take a couple of leaps of faith with him to turn around the US generics business and at the same time launch new drugs and put them through the paces. There is no dearth of sceptics. Shrikant Akolkar, a senior analyst for pharmaceuticals at India Infoline, counts himself among those bearish on the stock, and points out that the company’s troubles with regulators have been on for five years now. “Many Indian pharma companies sorted out their problems with regulators in two years,” says Akolkar.

In the interview, Khorakiwala chooses to resolutely look at the positives. He talks about the successes of the Indian pharma industry: how 98% of medicines consumed in the country are also manufactured here and how Indian companies still have 80% of the market share at home, unlike China or Brazil. He points out how Indian pharma has manufactured lowcost drugs — thereby helping combat HIV/AIDS in underdeveloped countries — and vaccines. He says Indian companies have a 40% share of prescription medicines in the US market. “These are headwinds, and I believe these will strengthen Indian pharma industry.”

He expects all Wockhardt facilities to come out of regulatory hassles in 12-18 months. “We have been in dialogue with the FDA on a regular basis and we understand what they need,” he adds. “Quality requirement is a moving target. It is not a fixed target. All our facilities are cleared by European authorities, so it is not that we do not meet quality standards. But US FDA expectations are higher.”

Satish Khanna, a pharma industry veteran turned entrepreneur, agrees with Khorakiwala and says that the US standards went through two major upgrades, once in 2005 and then around 2010-11, and it has presented Indian manufacturers with the choice of either investing heavily and playing with the big boys or remaining small and being out of the game. “Cost of failure is high and owners lose more wealth as market cap dips and investing to upgrade starts to make sense,” says Khanna, a former executive president of Lupin who is now heading Fullife Healthcare, a company focused on healthcare products.


Khanna feels the antibiotics scene is crowded today, and multinational pharma companies have shifted their focus to areas like cancer treatment, heart and lung diseases, diabetes and issues like menopause or ageing. Given that, it is interesting to watch Wockhardt’s moves on anti-infectives, now that these are getting ready to be rolled out.

Taking a leaf out of his generic business, where manufacturing was partly s hifted to some FDA-approved, third-party facilities, Khorakiwala has tied up with FDA-approved third-party manufacturers, including some Big Pharma players, to de-risk the launch of two antiinfectives in the developed markets.

Khorakiwala says it is a whole new game; the economics are different and it might free Wockhardt from issues that have tied down its generics business. “We began a programme of drug discovery 20 years ago. In the next few months all my five products will be in phase three of clinical trials. Two of them, WCK 4282 and WCK 5222, are global. We will be introducing them in the US and worldwide. For the others, we are doing Indian clinical trials and will go to emerging markets,” Khorakiwala says.

“About 30 years back, the Big Pharma had vacated antibiotics research as they could not get blockbusters. That is when we thought we could do well there,” he adds. Every pharma company, he says, wants to do drug discovery. At the time — 1996 — even his compatriots like Dr Anji Reddy of Dr Reddy’s, Parvinder Singh of Ranbaxy and YK Hamied of Cipla were thinking along the same lines, he says.


“In 1996-97, I spent two years understanding how it is done. I visited Pfizer’s R&D facilities, then Sandoz, which is now Novartis, and a few others and interacted with scientists to decide on what to do and how and why. I found antibiotics had reasonably shorter pathways, unlike some other areas,” he adds.

“We should introduce the drugs WCK 771 and WCK 2349 in India next year, sometime in the second half. It’s the same drug but one is injectible, and the other is a tablet. For the rest, clinical trials should be over by the end of 2019 and these will be introduced in developed markets in 2020.” He explains how price points for new drug discoveries are vastly different from generics. For a new drug, the major cost is research which one has to recover. Another difference is communicating with the medical profession. It is a new drug and requires a lot of proof. Then diagnostics have to be developed. Manufacturing is a relatively smaller part of the cost, and cost arbitrage not much of a benefit, making manufacturing in approved localities in developed markets an attractive proposition. 



Pulling Up the Stocks
The markets are smiling on Khorakiwala for now. As the family owns 70% of the company’s shareholding, there is scope for leveraging it for money, thereby opening up many possibilities. A pharma sector consultant, who knows Khorakiwala for many years but chooses to remain anonymous for the story, says the Wockhardt chairman manages to exude confidence even in tough times. “It is infectious, and can take many people along.”

“He is a fighter, has faced many difficult situations and overcome them. He doesn’t give up easily,” says DG Shah, secretary-general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance.

Although Khorakiwala, as chairman of the company, sees himself as a mentor to sons Huzaifa and Murtaza, who are executive director and managing director of Wockhardt respectively, and daughter Zahabiya, who manages the hospitals, he himself will have to give the shot in the arm.

29,2018-01-22,Cipla,"The amendment of the 49-year-old Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Act after which the Narendra Modi government plans to auction more than 9,400 properties of those who took citizenship of China has made China jittery.

Chinese investment in India has grown rapidly in the past few years. China fears India can confiscate assets of its companies, such as Xiaomi and Lenovo, if the two countries enter a military conflict. Last year, Indian and China faced off for months over construction by Chinese troops in the Doklam region. Though the conflict was resolved, tension persists in India-China relations.

""If China and India become involved in a military conflict, the assets of Chinese companies doing business in India may be confiscated by the Indian government,"" said an article in state-run Chinese news outlet Global Times.

It says economic reforms introduced by PM Modi have made India an attractive investment destination but the amended law can scare away Chinese investors. 

""...if the Enemy Property Act sparks alarm among Chinese investors and hinders India's efforts to make itself a sound investment destination, all these other attempts would have been in vain. To rebuild investor confidence, India requires legal reform. Confiscating assets left behind by people who took citizenship of China can easily be viewed by the public as a hostile act against China and damage China's outbound investment toward India,"" the articles said.

""In recent years, many Chinese companies, including smartphone maker Xiaomi and computer producer Lenovo, have turned their eyes toward India. In 2016, China's direct investment in India was reportedly several times the level of the previous year. This investment created many jobs for young people in India, which faces an unemployment dilemma. However, increasing investment doesn't necessarily mean that Chinese companies were unaware of the risks involved. Some Chinese people were scared during the border standoff. If India cannot reassure Chinese investors by taking steps to ensure the safety of their assets or personnel, the amendment of the Enemy Property Act will hit investor confidence,"" said the article.

31,2018-01-25,Cipla,"Domestic pharma companies received more than 300 approvals in 2017 to launch generic drugs in the US, which is an all-time high. The clearances came despite regulatory pressure from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and unprecedented warning letters issued to the pharma companies’ facilities.

The final approvals for Indian players are up by nearly 43% from 211 in 2016, and corner about 40% of all global filings in the highly lucrative around $70-billion US market. This, even as all drug biggies — including Zydus, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s and Cipla — faced regulatory ire, while some were pulled up for manufacturing lapses by the US regulator during last year.

In terms of each company, Zydus leads with 66 approvals in 2017, followed by Aurobindo (52), Glenmark (18), Lupin (17), Gland Pharma (16) and Cipla (10). Zydus cornered a majority of US filings as its Moraiya facility, which contributes about 60% of US sales, came out from under USFDA scanner in June last year. Sun Pharma remained static at 10 approvals, due to its Halol plant continuing under the regulatory glare.

The US generics market, a key driver of Indian pharma’s growth, has always been a dynamic market. But the pace of change has accelerated in the last few years. The increase in competition and consolidation of distribution channels have led to the US generics business getting commoditised. Price erosion has been at an all-time high and this has impacted operating margins significantly. Major domestic companies earn at least 40% of their overall sales from the US.

To maximise margins, companies are now launching complex generics and speciality products.

Glenmark Pharma chairman & MD Glenn Saldanha says, “While the number of ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) approvals continue to remain strong for us, we, however, have begun the process of transitioning the US business to a specialty/innovation business. While the generics business in the US will still grow, the future for us will be in the specialty and innovation business. We plan to file our first specialty NDA in the next few months in the US.”"

2,2018-02-04,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Dalal Street investors would want to quickly forget the Black Friday, but the bulls will have newer challenges waiting during the week ahead, with RBI policy review and adverse global cues threatening to keep investors on the tenterhooks.

Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty plummeted over 2 per cent on Friday, posting their biggest single day fall in nearly 15 months.

Re-introduction of LTCG (long-term capital gains) tax on equity, concerns over fiscal slippage, profit booking and a global sell-off together broke the back of the bulls, who were, till now, the clear winners in the battle.

The RBI policy review will be the next big event, scheduled for this week. Here is a look at the key events that will steer the domestic market in the coming week. 


RBI Policy meet: The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is slated to meet on February 6 and 7, with its decision due on Feb 7. This will be the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy meet of FY18. Speculations and reports suggest the central bank may tighten its stance, as the government’s fiscal deficit target has been revised upwards to 3.5 per cent from 3.2 per cent projected earlier. Retail inflation rose to a 17-month high of 5.21 per cent in December.

Other reports suggest inflation worries are overdone and RBI may cut interest rate by 25bps in April meet. “We expect RBI MPC to look through the jump in inflation to 5.4 per cent in April-June, which is spooking some parts of the market, as it emanates from the base effect of low 2.2 per cent April-June 2017 inflation,” analysts at Bank of America-Merril Lynch said recently.

“We still expect the RBI MPC to cut policy rates by a final 0.25 per cent in April,” it added.


Budget after-effects: It will be worth a watch how investors react when trading resumes on Monday. Friday's mayhem was knee-jerk reaction as the FM Jaitley delivered the bitter pill in the form of re-introduction of LTCG tax, thus spoiling the mood of investors in a big way. However, commenting on Friday's market fall, Jaitley said profit taking, Asian selloff and confusion over grandfathering were the main culprits behind the bloodbath on Dalal Street.


Next batch of quarterly earnings: Among prominent names, Bosch and Tata Motors will announce Q3 results on Monday, February 5; Hero MotoCorp and Lupin are slated to release their numbers on Tuesday, February 6, while Cipla and Eicher Motors will declare theirs on Wednesday, February 7. BPCL, HPCL, M&M, ONGC, SBI and Tata Steel will announce numbers on Friday, February 9.


Nifty may slide to 10,500 next week
The Nifty50 index on Friday formed a 'Long Black Day' candle on the daily chart and 'Bearish Engulfing' pattern on the weekly chart, prompting analysts to worry over next week's trading range. ""The pace with which the Nifty50 fell suggests a trend reversal in favour of the bears and, hence, a multi-week top might be in place at the recent high of 11,171, as the index breached critical short-term support points,"" said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. Selling shall get extended into the next week and take the index towards the 10,500 level, Mazhar added. Another market expert, Milan Vaishnav, CMT MSTA, feels the market may still take some time before it fully digests the Budget.


Macro numbers: The performance of India's services sector in January, 2018 will be known on Monday, February 5. The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) Business Activity Index rose to 50.9 in December from 48.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion, while a reading below 50 points toward contraction.


Global cues: The domestic market will take cues from global stocks and tread accordingly. US non-farm payrolls grew by 2,00,000 in January and the unemployment rate stood at 4.1 per cent, while wages saw their biggest jump since the end of the Great Recession, said a CNBC report. Economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting jobs growth by 1,80,000. US stocks are likely to show an impact of this robust jobs report, which will be watched keenly by markets across the globe, including India."

11,2018-02-08,Cipla,"MUMBAI: India’s third-largest drug maker Cipla and Mumbai-based Alkem Pharma are both foraying into the antidiabetic drug market in the country through partnerships with multinationals for the highly fought over gliptin class of oral agents.

Cipla has tied up with Swiss drug maker Novartis and US firm Johnson and Johnson to market their anti-diabetic drug Vildagliptin and Canagliflozin, respectively. Alkem has teamed up with South Korean drug maker Dong A to launch the latter’s Evogliptin.

Alkem is in the process of filing for regulatory approvals, and is expected to launch the drug in six to eight months. “We have just scratched the surface with regards to gliptins,” said Satyen Manikani, strategy and business development head at Alkem.

For Cipla, one of the oldest drug makers in the country, it’s a late entry into gliptin space. “This is for the first time we are entering the diabetes market in a big way,” Umang Vohra, CEO at Cipla, said during the company’s third quarter results announcement.

Historically known for its respiratory portfolio, Cipla will use its over 10,000 strong sales force to make a dent in this space. The other players who have tied up with Novartis for Vildagliptin are USV Pharma, Emcure, and Abbott.

Gliptins, or class of DPP4 drug inhibitors, are considered far more effective in controlling blood sugar levels than the previous class of drugs.

In India, the gliptin market is one of the most competitive with over 160 brands vying for a pie of the ?10,000-crore anti-diabetes market. Four gliptin drugs — Sitagliptin, Vildagliptin, Saxagliptin and Teneligliptin — are sub licensed to over 20 drug makers who are engaged in a price war.

Alkem is bringing in a fresh brand. Evogliptin has been approved in South Korea and the company is waiting for an approval from the USFDA authorities for its North American launch.

Shares of both Cipla and Alkem Laboratories closed almost flat on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday at ?569.80 and Rs 2,155.00, respectively."

But the bulls made a remarkable comeback on Thursday, with the benchmark Sensex rising over 500 points in intraday trade on some solid Q3 earnings numbers. However, they lost some steam towards the end, and the Sensex ended the day at 34,413, up 330 points, with Sun Pharma (up 6 per cent) being the top gainer and Power Grid (down 1 per cent) the worst laggard. With this, the index snapped a seven-day losing streak.

The Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) rose 100 points to close at 10,577, with 41 constituents in the green and 9 in the red.

“Positive domestic earnings and optimism in Asian peers led the Indian market higher, after RBI’s status quo stabilised the market. However, investors will continue to keep a watchful eye on global volatility, with Europe continuing to look vulnerability ahead of the BoE rate decision,"" said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.

The market breadth remained in favour of advances with an advance-decline ratio at 5:1.


Here's a look at everything that buzzed on Dalal Street during the session:


Q3 earnings fire up rally
Shares of Bharat Forge, Heidelberg Cement, Cipla and Muthoot Finance spurted after solid Q3 numbers. While Bharat Forge posted 77 per cent rise in Q3 net, Cipla's profit rose a modest 5 per cent. However, its revenue from India, its biggest market, rose 15 per cent to Rs 1,601 crore. Muthoot Finance reported a 59 per cent rise in its net profit at Rs 464 crore against Rs 291 crore in the corresponding quarter previous fiscal. Heidelberg Cement's Q3 net stood at Rs 31.76 crore against loss of Rs 3.58 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

Although global peers reflected mixed mood, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) shunned worries and bought handsomely in pharma, bank, capital goods, metal and realty sectors.

“Market managed to end with decent gains amid volatility, providing some relief to the participants. Global cues are dictating our market trend, and it'll remain so in near future, in absence of any major event. However, earnings will continue to trigger movement on stock-specific front.

The Nifty50 index opened with a gap down amid concerns over weakness in global markets and corrected towards the 10,400 level. However it closed in the negative, by losing more than 120 points. In the process, the index formed a bullish candle on the daily chart, as it recovered from the lows and closed higher than its opening level.

The index is now close to its major support at its rising trend line, which connects the swing lows of 9,687, 10,033, 10,074 and 10,350 levels. On the weekly chart, the index faced hurdle at the rising supply trend line at the beginning of February and now it has come to the lower band of the support trend line within its rising channel.

The short-term trend would be under pressure as long as the index doesn’t cross and hold above the 10,650 mark, but if it manages to cross and hold above the 10,500 mark, then a bounceback towards the next hurdle in the 10,600-10,650 zone cannot be ruled out.

On the downside, immediate support is seen at 10,400, below which it may continue its decline towards 10,350 and then the recent swing low of 10,276 levels.

On the option front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,000 followed by 10,500, while maximum Call OI was at 11,100 followed by 11,000. Major Call writing was seen at all strike prices from 10,400 to 10,700 while Put unwinding was seen at 10,500, 10,600 and 10,800 levels.

Fresh Put writing was also seen at lower strike prices like 10,400, 10,100 and 10,200. Option data suggested that the trading range is shifting slightly lower and upside is restricted because of negative global cues, higher volatility and fresh Call writing.

India VIX moved up 8.55 per cent to 19.29. Higher volatility could continue to keep the market in volatile swings with limited upside.

Bank Nifty opened with a downward gap and remained volatile in a 200-point range. It formed a Doji candle on the daily chart, which indicated buying interest on declines even after a short-term negative trend. As long as it remains below the 26,000 mark, Nifty could continue to see weakness and head towards its swing low of 25,000.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.83 per cent at 10,485. Long buildup was seen in HPCL, Hindustan Zinc, SAIL, Torrent Pharma, DCB Bank, Cipla and Reliance Capital, while shorts were seen in Glenmark, IndusInd Bank, Shriram Transport Finance, HDFC, PC Jeweller, Idea, ICICI Bank and Hero MotoCorp.

19,2018-02-18,Cipla,"Every morning, in front of the DDA park in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, she loads her cart with fresh vegetables. Tomatoes and peas, cucumbers and radishes, and bunches of coriander leaves. Her regular customers trickle in, calling her Amma.

Her cart almost empties out by evening. The 50-year-old, feisty vegetable vendor can be temperamental with her haggling customers. Unlettered, she often fumbles with her calculations. Then the buyers help her out, adding this and multiplying that. What they don’t know is her name: Lalita Devi. And her story.

She grew up, poor and unschooled, in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh. She got married in her early teens and moved to Delhi, but life in the capital turned out to be hard. Her husband left her when she was in her 30s, leaving her to take care of her two daughters and a son.

Illiterate and unskilled, abandoned by her husband two decades ago, Lalita Devi, 50, turned into a vegetable vendor in Delhi to take care of her three children.
“I started a tea stall,” she says. It didn’t bring her enough money and she began selling vegetables. “God is kind. I have a decent life. Who would have given a job to an unskilled, illiterate person like me? I can now manage my family,” she says. Her daughters, aged 20 and 25, are at home. Her son, 22, helps her out with the vegetable cart. How much does she earn? She doesn’t know but she says it is enough to feed her family and pay the rent of Rs 3,000. A long way away in Tripura, Abhishek Saha has another story to tell. The 33-year-old was a sales executive with the pharmaceutical company Cipla in Bengaluru. Two years ago, he returned to his hometown Agartala to set up Babuana Tea Stall. He sells sandwiches and three types of tea, charging `10-40 a cup, and tops it up with great service. “I have junked a regular job to be an entrepreneur. It gives me freedom to do things my way,” he says. Saha, who gets 400-plus customers daily, has big plans: “I want to expand first to Guwahati and then to Bengaluru.” 




Self-employment is common in India. Sometimes, it is out of choice, like Saha’s. But more often, it is out of compulsion, like Devi’s. They represent two ends of the spectrum of India’s self-employed, which is 47% — almost half — of India’s 470 million workforce. Based on government data, about 215 million people are self-employed (See Who are India’s Self-Employed?). They include street vendors, rickshawpullers, carpenters, plumbers, chaiwallahs, grocers, taxi drivers, doctors, accountants and pakorawallahs.




Most of the self-employed are below the economic radar. They are homeless, office-less and unbanked. They are vulnerable and footloose and live on the fringes. They rarely figure in government policies or statistics, or even statements.


Economics Wrapped in Politics 
Now, change is afoot. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants India’s self-employed to be visible, counted and strengthened. Last month, selfemployed pakoda sellers made headlines when Modi said, “Youth selling pakora outside… and earning Rs 200 a day also means creation of jobs.” Never mind the political storm it created. For millions of self-employed workingliving on the fringes, getting on the nation’s radar is a good start. If India has to progress, mainstreaming its self-employed will be an important stepping stone. In the second most populous country with 470 million workforce, employment today is a hot button issue. A year away from the general election, Modi knows that confronting it head-on rather than sidestepping it may be a smarter strategy.




Modi’s statement on pakora sellers wasn’t a random remark. It was seconded by BJP president Amit Shah in Parliament. The backdrop is a growing realisation that the government or, for that matter, any future government, will not be able to create formal jobs for over 6-7 million joining the country’s workforce annually. In 2016-17, actual jobs created were 4.1 lakh as against the BJP’s electoral promise of creating one crore jobs annually.

There is an attempt in the NDA government to look at the problem from a different angle. From demonetisation to GST, formalisation of the economy has been a constant theme for the Modi government. With 80% of the workforce engaged in the cash-heavy informal sector, the attempt has been to integrate them into the country’s economy. And, while in transition, why shouldn’t this huge chunk of the workforce get counted on the economic map? Why shouldn’t a domestic help earning Rs 15,000 a month or a cab driver with a monthly incomeas high as Rs 50,000 figure in the government’s job statistics?


A hotel management graduate from Bhubaneshwar, Dimple Narula, 38, worked in hotels before turning entrepreneur in 2007, supplying corporate lunches. Now, she caters to parties, weddings etc and has 10 staff members.
This begs the question: what constitutes a formal sector? The Economic Survey 2018 defines formal employment as, one, where the employers are providing some kind of social security (like EPF and health or life insurance) to their employees, and, two, where firms are part of the tax net. 

Pakora sellers find no place here. Not yet. According to the first definition based on social security, 31% of India’s non-agricultural workforce, 75 million out of an estimated at 240 million, have formal employment. According to the employers-in-the-tax-net definition, 54% (or 127 million) of the non-agricultural workforce is in the formal sector.

Counting self-employed among those having jobs may become contentious, but this line of thinking is likely to dominate the political discourse before the next Lok Sabha elections. Some government officials in the know say that the Union labour ministry is contemplating a formula under which 40-50% of the 104 million beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana) could be statistically bracketed as employed if an ongoing survey demonstrates that people have become self-employed after availing of the loan. Mudra loans (up to Rs 10 lakh) are disbursed for non-agricultural activities, including dairy, poultry and beekeeping.

Technology, the Job SlayerCreating jobs is India’s biggest worry and it will only get worse. The NDA government is coming to terms with it.

According to a Bloomberg News analysis, India is expected to have a billion people aged between 15 and 64 years of age by 2027, which means the world’s largest — and youngest — workforce. As the economy progresses, millions of people employed in lowproductivity farm sector will have to be moved to higher-productivity non-farm jobs. Barring China, this scale of migration has no precedent in history. Unfortunately, the opportunity that China had – to turn into the world’s factory that could absorb millions of the country’s agri-workers — may not be available for India. This is the age of Brexit and deglobalisation championed by US President Donald Trump and export barriers are set to rise.


An engineer, Pratyush Baranwal, 33, worked in the corporate sector before returning to Indore to set up a dairy farm. He started with five Gir cows, has 14 now and plans to quadruple in four years. He makes a quarter of what his corporate salary.
Meanwhile, technologies like robots and 3D printing has jump-started a re-shoring of manufacturing facilities back to the developed world. India’s IT industry is in a crisis, with technological changes forcing them to pivot or perish. While experts disagree on the degree of disruption technology will cause, the automation wave is certain to cull jobs across geographies and sectors. Amid all this, the sharing and gig economy is growing by leaps and bounds, forcing a debate on the fundamental question of who is an employee. In the US self-employed workers today stand at 34% and are forecast to touch 43% by 2020. This trend is already playing out in India, with cab-hailing apps like Ola and Uber employing 5,50,000 and 3,50,000 drivers respectively in India as of July 2016, according to Statista.

These convulsions of change notwithstanding, India historically has had a problem creating jobs. Its employment elasticity – a measure of the percentage change in employment with a 1 percentage point change in economic growth — has been among the lowest. It is now declining – from 0.3% between 1991 to 2007, it has halved today. Partly, this is because India’s growth, dominated by the services sector and not labour-intensive manufacturing, has had a bias for skilled workers.





With little options, a majority of India’s workforce is engaged in informal, unorganised, low-income, low-productivity jobs. Says Manish Sabharwal, cofounder, Teamlease: “This is not self-employment. This is self-exploitation. They need to be moved up from subsistence-based livelihood.” He makes the distinction between good self-employment and bad self-employment: “Policy makers in India should focus on increasing formal wage employment and good self-employment.” (See column “End Self-Exploitation”) 


Entrepreneur vs Self-employed
Often, “self-employed worker” and “entrepreneur” are interchangeably used. But there is a difference. “Self-employment in advanced countries is different from that in developing countries,” says Delhi-based Majid Nomaan, senior employment specialist, ILO.

In developed countries where social security is available, self-employment is more about entrepreneurship. “In societies with high poverty, self-employment is more about seeking livelihood for survival,” he adds. According to PRICE (People Research On India’s Consumer Economy), of the 281 million households in India, 108 million are selfemployed of which 55 million (20%) are engaged in farm-related activities, 10 million (4%) are petty traders like street-side vendors, 26 million (9%) are shop owners or traders, and 14 million (5%) are non-professionals like cab drivers and carpenters. Just 3 million or 1% are well-paid professionals like doctors, architects and accountants. “Self-employed isn’t a homogeneous group. Income instability is their biggest problem. One serious illness can set them back by years,” says RK Shukla, director, PRICE.


12th pass, mother of a 7-year-old, Neetu Narula Chakravarti, 36, was never keen on studies and wanted to do her own thing. For two decades now, she offers beautician’s services at homes in Delhi.
Gurbachan Singh, visiting faculty at the Indian Statistical Institute, gives another reason why some people opt for self-employment. “It is linked to the country’s financial infrastructure. A more developed financial sector leads to less self-employment,” he says. Poor avenues for financial investment or little knowledge of how to go about it makes many opt for self-employment. The scope of tax evasion makes it even more attractive. 


Mainstreaming the Margin
India’s self-employed will remain humungous. 

A KPMG report expects micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to play a critical role in creating jobs. It forecasts them chipping in 15% to the GDP by 2020, up from 8% today, BUT creating half of the total new jobs. This will more than double the current MSME workforce of 106 million. This won’t be an aberration. 

Globally, developed economies lean heavily on a strong MSME to chase growth and create jobs. In countries like Germany, US, UK and Singapore, MSME contributes over 40% to the GDP. It is also an employment engine — creating 67% of total jobs in Brazil, 62% in Germany, 53% in the US and 52% in the UK. The Modi government is tackling the job issue with a four-pronged strategy. Investments, policy initiatives and sector focus will be evaluated on the basis of their job-creating capabilities. 



A Mumbai-based post-graduate in physics, Trupti Sarangi, 44, quit working when her daughter came along. She works to satiate her creativity in baking, and earns Rs 30,000 a month.
A new industrial policy is likely to be unveiled in April-May (See “ A New Industrial Policy is On the Job ”). If government officials in the know are to be believed, the focus of the policy will be on finding ways to gainfully employ the youth who enter the workforce every year, apart from checking job losses triggered by Industry 4.0, the global phenomenon of automation in manufacturing. Formalisation of the informal sector is another area where the government is focusing. 

The intention is to widen tax base. Under the new GST regime, the number of indirect tax payers rose by 50% or by 3.4 million. The government is pushing for digital transactions including the UPI even as it is incentivising employers to hire staff on rolls. Under the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana, employers are incentivised to register in the EPFO: the government will pay 8.33% (it is 12% in labour-intensive textiles sector) of PF contribution for all new employees enrolled in EPFO in the first three years.

On a base of 80 million employees’ provident fund subscribers, a recent report expects the count to rise by 7 million in 2017-18. “If we want growth with jobs, the push has to be on small industries, and not on the middle or the top,” cautions Arun Maira, former member of the now disbanded Planning Commission, who last week attended a roundtable on the draft industrial policy.

 Adds Prantik Ray, professor (finance), XLRI: “The difficulty to access financial products is one of the key reasons why the self-employed are not able to move ahead.” This is where Mudra scheme fits in. “The biggest beneficiary of initiatives like ease of doing business will be the MSMEs. They bear the biggest brunt of the inefficiencies in the system,” says Nitin Atroley, office managing partner (north), KPMG India. 

The government is said to be looking at measures to tackle the NPA and insolvency issue in the MSME sector as well. A host of schemes has been rolled out to improve the quality of life of the self-employed: the National Health Protection Scheme, which will cover 10 crore poor households, the low-cost Pradhan Mantri Jivan Jyoti Bima Yojana (life insurance) and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (accident insurance), and the Jan Dhan Yojana aimed at financial inclusion. Will this help? India’s job problem is huge and complex with no easy answers. 

The NDA government, in its last year, is short on time. And India’s jobseekers short on patience. In politics, perception management is as important as the change on the ground. Expect the Modi government to lean on both as it braces for the next general elections."

23,2018-02-21,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: After a three-day losing spree, the bulls staged a respectable comeback on Wednesday amid heavy buying on IT and energy counters.

The S&P BSE Sensex gained 141 points to settle the session at 33,844, with TCS (up 3 per cent) being the top gainer and Sun Pharma (down 6 per cent) the worst laggard. The broader Nifty50 index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had a touch-and-go moment with the 10,400 level.

The index eventually failed to top that level and settled 37 points higher at 10,397. Out of the 50 components, 29 advanced while 21 slipped. 

“After a consecutive downtrend, the market today managed to close on a positive note due to the outperformance of the IT index and a rebound in PSU bank stocks. Investors are waiting for fresh triggers to get direction. Quarterly earnings showed a pickup but concerns over inflation and possible rate hike in the US may keep the pressure,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The market breadth remained in favour of declines with the advance-decline ratio pegged at 1:2. Here’s a look at the top newsmakers of the session:


IT stocks log big gains
The day belonged to IT players, as the Nifty IT pack surged over 2 per cent to 12,660 with nine out of 10 constituents ending in the green. A slew of factors such as a fall in the rupee, Nasscom’s prediction that revenue from software services exports will rise 7-9 per cent and change in CLSA’s model portfolio where the brokerage raised the IT sector to neutral from underweight and gave wings to IT companies. Big boys such as TCS (up over 3 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 3.54 per cent) and HCL Tech (up 4 per cent) were shining spots in the pack.




Sun Pharma catches cold
Shares of drug major Sun Pharma cracked over 6 per cent to settle at Rs 524 apiece on BSE. The stock dragged the Nifty Pharma index lower, which closed 2 per cent down at 8,843. Other culprits in the pack included Cipla (down 1 per cent), GlaxoSmithKline (down 1 per cent) and Aurobindo Pharma (down 1 per cent). 




Spurt in open interest
Shares of Bharti Infratel witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest at 65.05 per cent. Grasim Industries (46.42 per cent) and Godrej Consumer Products (46.14 per cent) grabbed the second and third slot, respectively.




Gruh Finance on a high
Shares of Gruh Finance, a subsidiary of HDFC, swelled over 7 per cent to settle at Rs 545 apiece on BSE. The company had reported a 28.3 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 82.16 crore for December quarter against Rs 64.04 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. In the intraday trade, the stock jumped 9 per cent to hit a high of Rs 554.90. 




Fear eases
India VIX, the fear guage, saw a sharp decline of 5.61 per cent to 15.92, suggesting normalcy is returning to the market. The India VIX index is a volatility index that is a broad measure of the market’s expectation of volatility over the near term.




Banks recover
After creating a kind of pandemonium among investors, financial stocks got back to recovery path. The Nifty PSU Bank index, which has seen relentless selloff in the last few days, today climbed over 1 per cent to settle at 3,170.70, with 7 out of 12 constituents ending in the green. Punjab National Bank, the root cause of the recent ruckus in the banking stocks, today settled flat at Rs 117 apiece on BSE.

29,2018-02-26,Cipla,"By Rohit Srivastava

Where are We? After three weeks, this week we closed positive which was a sigh of relief. On the other hand, bond yields have been rising for many months as a underlying risk to equity valuations and world markets just started taking note of it. The dollar remains in a primary bear market which is helping EM flows and inflation expectations which can be positive.


What is in Store? The Nifty and the Bank Nifty may recover further. We may go to 10,600 or even 10,800 for the Nifty. The Bank Nifty can go to 25,870 or best 26,575. My best case for now is that we will not see a new high in the Indices yet. Chances are we will see a correction again in the coming months because of the ongoing rally in interest rates and commodity prices, especially crude oil. Rising costs will be an issue for some industries. A retest of 10,000-9,800 for the Nifty is not ruled out.


What could Investors Do? Traders should use the current rally in stocks to lighten up, if not done so already, there may be opportunities to be on the short side of the market. Investors on the other hand will have to consider asset allocation to the right stocks and sectors to minimise the downside or even generate alpha. I believe there is defence in the oversold pharma sector and specific stocks like Biocon or Cipla can provide some upside. Metal stocks like Vedanta, Hind Zinc, have corrected a lot recently but metal prices are still strong and so they may outperform the market as commodities prices rise. Lastly, IT stocks have started to outshine as the rupee has been depreciating on a relative basis to other currencies.

IT stocks appear like a good short-term bet for alpha.

34,2018-02-28,Cipla,"MUMBAI: Once bitter pharma rivals Swiss drug maker Roche Pharma and India’s third largest drug maker Cipla have tied up to promote and distribute tocilizumab (Actemra) and Syndyma, the 2nd brand of Roche’s cancer therapy, bevacizumab (Avastin) in India.

This partnership is in line with Roche and Cipla’s efforts to improve healthcare and increase access to innovative, life-changing medicines in India, particularly to patients who currently do not have access to them, the companies said in a joint statement.

“We believe that everyone who needs our medicines should be able to access and benefit from them. This partnership will significantly advance our efforts to expand the reach of, and improve access to, our innovative medicines”, said Lara Bezerra, Managing Director – Roche Pharma India

Roche said this partnership will also enable it to focus on bringing new, transformative medicines to patients in India. The company said it we will continue to collaborate with various stakeholders to help transform healthcare in India.

Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralises the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Various clinical trials have proven its efficacy and safety in different solid tumours and is approved by regulators worldwide for certain type of brain tumour, cancers of the kidney, lung, colon and rectum and certain types of gynecological cancers viz. ovarian cancer and cervical cancers. It is usually given as part of a combination of cancer medicines.

Actemra® (tocilizumab Injection) is a recombinant humanized anti interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody. This IL-6 protein is believed to play an important role in RA. Studies have shown the drugs work in treating rheumatoid artharitis.

For Roche the entry of biosimilar drugs or the high end copy versions of its biologic drugs has eaten into its revenues. However India with its vast disease profile continues to be an important market for the company. For Cipla that had built its business by challenging the patents of multinational companies, the new business strategy is to adopt more of an collaborative effort with its past rivals. Few years back Cipla also entered into a voluntary license agreement with US drug maker Gilead to market its Hepatitis C drugs.

Roche and Cipla have fought several legal battles on patent issues in the past on cancer drugs. But this new agreement seems like Cipla is looking at new strategies to grow its business, analysts said."

0,2018-03-01,Cipla,"One of the most radical changes in the Indian pharma industry over the last decade has been the shift in the go-to-market strategies of leading players. The latest is the case of Cipla. 

In a foes-turn-friends move announced on February 27, the Mumbai-based drug maker announced that it will partner Swiss biotech company Roche to promote Actemra (tocilizumab, used in chronic arthritis) and Syndyma (bevacizumab, an anti-cancer drug used in multiple indications) for the Indian market.

The move shows how the fierce Cipla of about a decade ago has mellowed. 


Troubled history
In 2008, Cipla chairman Yusuf K Hamied had kicked up a storm with the audacious launch of Erlocip (erlotinib), a copy of Tarceva, Roche's blockbuster lung cancer drug that had been granted a product patent in India a year earlier.

Cipla had then stoked nationalist fervour and cited ""public interest"", saying it intended to make the drug available at a third of Tarceva's price of Rs 4,800 per tablet. 
A slugfest over intellectual property rights ensued, causing bad blood between Indian and multinational firms, and a global controversy. 

Pro-multinational lobbies questioned India's intellectual property laws on international forums. The Indian side, backed by jingoist health activists raising the 'patients before patents' card, talked up affordability and accessibility of life-saving drugs. Cipla filed a petition in the Supreme Court after a 2015 court order held that it had infringed Roche's patent.


Happily ever after?
However last year, Cipla withdrew its case, informing the court about an out-of-court settlement with Roche and acknowledging the patent rights of Tarceva. The other terms of the agreement were not disclosed. 

In 2014, Cipla signed a deal with US-based Merck to sell Isentress (raltegravir), an anti-AIDS drug in India in what the two companies described as complementary strengths of scientific excellence and marketing reach. 

The same year San Francisco-based drug maker Gilead pivoted to a collaborative model for innovative drugs, rather than confront potential patent assertions. That move was seen as a shrewd strategy to avoid litigation, long-drawn disputes, and uncertain delays in launching drugs. It struck deals with about a dozen Indian drug makers, including Cipla, for royalty-based marketing for its hepatitis C cure Sovaldi (sofosbusivir).


Why the sudden shift in tone?
The realities of the Indian market have changed, says the marketing head of one of the top five Indian drug makers. From being the top seller 10 years ago, Cipla has been relegated to the third spot, after Sun Pharma and Abbott.

""Branded generic drugs can go only that far…. Beyond that, innovative molecules will drive growth. We have no other way but to shake hands,"" he says."

8,2018-03-08,Cipla,"Women’s participation in large listed Indian companies has been rising consistently, data complied by the ET Intelligence Group from the annual reports has revealed. It rose to 23% in FY17 for a sample of 70 companies from 21.6% in the previous fiscal. The sample companies constituted nearly 50% of the total market cap of the listed companies in India.

“Many companies have incorporated programmes to hire women that is creating a sizeable demand. Also, bias against hiring women is abating, which has helped in improving their participation,” said Saundarya Rajesh, founder-president, AVTAR Career Creator.

For India Inc, the share of women in the total workforce is the highest in IT companies followed by banking and finance sectors, while it is the lowest in automobiles, metal and mining sectors. IT and BFSI have women participation ratio in the range of 20-36%.

As of December 2017, TCS was the top women’s employer with 137,590 women on its payroll, or 35.2% of the total workforce. Infosys reported the highest proportion of 36.1% of women employees in FY17.




According to data from Bloomberg on women’s participation in executive roles, Cipla topped the chart with half of its executive team comprising women. It was followed by ICICI Bank (27%) and GSK (26%).

The share of women on corporate boards has also been on a rise, thanks to the enactment of a law that stipulates at least one women director in a company with paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore or turnover of Rs 300 crore.




The share of women directors in the Nifty 500 index companies increased to 14% in 2017 compared with 5% in 2012, according to Prime Database. These Nifty 500 companies had 4,750 members on their boards, and Godrej Consumer, Infosys, Cipla, Vedanta and Tata Global Beverages have 33-46% of their board member as women.




There is empirical evidence showing that companies with women’s participation in the workforce report better return on investment. A Citi research report on gender diversity published in 2017 says pursuing gender equality could lift GDP of OECD countries by about 6% over the next one-two decades."

In this scenario, Tushar Mahajan of Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities has a piece of advice for you. “On largecaps, one could start nibbling into some of the more beaten down names,” he said in an interaction with ET Now.

A couple of global brokerage firms, including CLSA, Macquarie, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, came out with their ‘Overweight’ and ‘Buy’ ratings on some of the large cap companies after the recent correction. Take a look:


HCL TechnologiesCredit Suisse has maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on HCL Technologies with a target price of Rs 1,100. The scrip was at Rs 938 on March 20.

On the other hand, CLSA has maintained 'Buy' on the IT major and rated it as its top pick in the information technology space, citing strong growth prospects. “With strong growth prospects, potential for value creation from the IP business and an attractive valuation for HCLT, it is our top pick in the sector,” said CLSA. The brokerage has a target price of Rs 1,170 on the stock.


HDFCCredit Suisse has also maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on HDFC with a target price of Rs 2,250. The global financial services firm remains positive on its growth prospects. “Competition is picking up in corporate segment and RERA would lead to some consolidation of the smaller players,” it added.


Larsen & ToubroGoldman Sachs has maintained ‘Buy’ rating on the infrastructure player with a target price of Rs 1,600. Shares of the company were hovering around Rs 1,300 on Tuesday. L&T is part of the conviction buy list of the global financial services firm. “We believe outlook for L&T appears bright as the company moves out of a decade-long capex cycle,” the brokerage firm noted.


Tata SteelMacquarie is positive on steel stocks as it takes the line that the correction in steel stocks is overdone. The financial services firm is positive on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 800 with ‘Outperform’ rating. “Domestic steel fundamentals remain robust,” Macquarie said.


CiplaMacquarie also maintained ‘Outperform’ on Cipla with a target price of Rs 670. The pharma major is among the top largecap pharma picks of the financial services company. “The company remains confident of a swift resolution of all observations with no impact on any existing or pipeline products.

1,2018-04-04,Cipla,"Market's fabled mood swings have been well-chronicled. Sample this. The last session of 2017-18 ended up being the 28th fall for the Sensex since its all-time high on 
January 29 this year. And it went up for 12 sessions during the period.

Volatility is here to stay. The point is how to ride the wave.

In fact, domestic equities have seen such fluctuations more frequently, especially since the re-introduction of Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax in this year's Budget. A string of frauds in public sector banks, rising bond yields and trade concerns involving the US and China have only worsened things.

The 30-share BSE index has tanked over 3,000 points to 33,174 on March 27, from 36,283 on 
January 29. India volatility index, Vix, continued to hover above 15-mark during the period. It was 11.49 on April 3, 2017. 

Despite the correction, market experts believe that it is difficult to predict the bottom of the market. So, what can equity investors do if they have an ability to digest the volatility? 

Shyam Shekhar, Chief Ideator and founder, ithought, in an exclusive chat with ETNow said, “I would buy some large companies in metals and steel. Besides these, I would also consider companies that have completed capex or where the acquisition decisions are already out in the open.”

Rusmik Oza, Head-midcaps at Kotak Securities, said, “The markets may not have bottomed out as the broader mid caps are still in correction mode and the Nifty is trading below the 200 DMA. Midcap index forward P/E is still at more than 300 bps premium over that of Nifty, signalling room for further correction in the midcap index. After the fall, many large caps have come in the ‘Buy’ zone and risk-reward ratio of large caps has improved and become favourable.”

As much as 90 per cent of stocks in the Nifty 50 index had delivered negative return to investors since 
January 29, with Tata Steel and ICICI Bank sliding over 20 per cent each. 

Other major losers included State Bank of India (SBI), Lupin, Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Vedanta, Adani Ports, Hindalco, Axis Bank and YES Bank with a fall between 15-20 per cent during the same period.

Oza added that the potential downside in the Nifty could be in single digit whereas the potential upside could be in double digits. “Within the largecap, we are preferring good quality, defensive bets at this juncture as markets could be volatile in the near to medium term due to international and local political news flows. Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank, ITC, Vedanta, Cipla and Power Grid are among our preferred picks at present.”"

3,2018-04-05,Cipla,"Equity investors on Dalal Street became richer by over Rs 2.50 lakh crore on Thursday, as the equity market rejoiced RBI’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged and the leeway it gave to domestic lenders to absorb their loan losses.

Firm opening in European markets, positive services PMI data and buying across the sectors also supported market mood. The BSE Sensex climbed 577 points, or 1.75 per cent, to end the day at 33,596, whereas NSE’s Nifty index jumped 196 points, or 1.94 per cent, to 10,325

As many as 48 stocks closed in the green in the Nifty50 pack, with Hindalco gaining the most at 6.52 per cent, followed by Vedanta (up 5.56 per cent), State Bank of India (up 5.46 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (up 5.19 per cent). Cipla and Bharti Airtel declined 1.72 per cent and 0.27 per cent, respectively.

In the money policy review, RBI kept the key policy rate unchanged at 6 per cent for the fourth consecutive time since August last year in view of uncertainties around inflation.

Indian services sector activity returned to its growth track in March, driven by greater inflows of new work, following which firms increased their staffing levels at the fastest pace in 7 years, says a monthly survey.

The seasonally-adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index improved from 47.8 in February to 50.3 in March, indicating that business activity stabilised during the month. The index slipped below the 50-point mark, that separates expansion from contraction, in February.

 “Keeping interest rates unchanged has been as per expectations. This along with the leeway given to banks to absorb loan losses (done over last few day) has provided fuel to the stock market. RBI has been conscious of lower inflation risk and uncertain global trade environment,” said Prateek Agrawal, Business Head and CIO, ASK Investment Managers.

Metal stocks were top gainers on BSE. The Metal index rallied over 4 per cent. It was followed by Bankex (up 2.78 per cent), Realty (up 2.55 per cent) and Consumer Durables (up 1.85 per cent). Other sectoral indices on the stock exchange also ended in green.

Other Asian peers also bounced from recent lows on Thursday, taking cues from a stronger session on Wall Street as investors judged recent trade war fears were overblown. Dow Jones Industrial Average index settled 230.94 points, or 0.96 per cent, up at 24,264 in the previous trading session.

Devang Mehta, Head of Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management said there has been consistent improvement in certain macros and important data points like better than expected 3rd quarter GDP, pick up in the manufacturing sector and industrial production, excellent auto sales numbers and pick up in credit growth.

“With revised lower inflation trajectory by RBI, Equity markets were clearly enthused. We continue to be bullish on domestic themes where there is good predictability of earnings growth,” he said."

The CII-PwC report showcased the contribution of Indian companies beyond foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Africa, including key CSR and skill development initiatives. 

According to the report, there exists substantial potential for trade growth between the two countries. 

Exports from India to South Africa include vehicle parts, transport equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, footwear, chemicals, textiles and rice. 

The report noted that value of bilateral trade has increased from USD 2.5 billion in 2003-04 to USD 11.79 billion in 2014-15, a growth of more than 400 in ten years. 

However, trade between the two countries declined slightly to USD 9.5 billion in 2015-2016. 

A number of factors explain this decline, including South Africa's credit rating downgrade, policy uncertainty, political and economic uncertainty as well as exchange rate fluctuations, the report said. 

It projected that Indian business footprint in South Africa is likely to grow further, adding the South African business footprint in India is also expanding with the prospect of great returns for the African companies investing in this market. 

""Leading Indian companies such as Wipro, Coal India, Cipla, Jindal Steel and Power, Mahindra and Mahindra have recently made investments in South Africa,"" said CII in the report. 

It further claimed that in the healthcare sector, the entry of Indian pharma companies Ranbaxy and Cipla brought in drastic reduction in the cost of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) in South Africa, saving thousands of lives. 

""As this report outlines, Indian companies are demonstrating their commitment to sustainable development in South Africa across education and healthcare schemes to job creation, agricultural projects and empowering women,"" said Dion Shango, Senior Regional Partner & CEO PwC Southern Africa."

35,2018-05-14,Cipla,"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Indian companies in traditional sectors like agriculture, petroleum, pharma, transportation and legal are aggressively hiring technology talent to stay ahead of the curve in the face of digital disruption.

With artificial intelligence (AI), big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics rapidly changing how society can access services, companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Vedanta, RPG Enterprises and Cipla have stepped up hiring of people trained in such cutting-edge technology to ensure they are ready when rivals enlist new technologies to dislodge competition.

According to a LinkedIn research, the pace of hiring digital talent in these sectors is five times higher than that of their overall hiring. “As the technology keeps changing at a very fast pace and with new innovations coming up in this arena, it is important for us to be ahead of the curve,” said Prince Augustin, executive vice-president-group human capital & leadership development, Mahindra & Mahindra. “Thus the pace of hiring of digital talent is greater than that of the overall hiring.”

The Indian automobile sector is going through rapid transformation with the advent of new technologies in areas such as electrified and driverless vehicles. As a result, several automobile manufacturers are actively looking at hiring talent with technology expertise in artificial intelligence and digital. “We will be using AI and emerging technologies across the Mahindra Group, and we are taking it very seriously,” said Augustin.




“Many of our businesses generate copious amounts of data. Years of operations have resulted in huge databases and we are now aggressively embarking on optimising this data to drive personalisation for customers for business outperformance. We have started reaping exponential benefits and are planning to scale up our investments in talent and new technologies,” he said.

The trend is visible in mining too. A few months ago, diversified miner Vedanta, which plans to ramp up production and revenue by 50% in the next two years, hired four chief digital officers. Their job is to get in touch with line managers and check efficiency and enhancements. They do benchmark research and then design for it and outsource designs as well.

“They are technology people and oversee IT. They are on top of IT people and oversee them,” said Suresh Bose, head, human resources at Vedanta group. For instance, drones are now being deployed in mining and there is need for people who know how they work. As example, Bose explained how the company is looking to use blockchain technology. “I have personally started it for the HR function as well, and that will be a key changer for end-toend,” he said.

Tyre-to-IT conglomerate RPG Enterprises has created the post of chief digital officer for each of its group companies, like Ceat Tyres, KEC International, etc. “In our human resources function, we have a digital officer who is driving a series of initiatives in HR digitisation across group companies,” said S Venkatesh, who leads group HR at RPG.

Experts say there is a need for people across functions, as technology is now not just in the background, but it is at the core as well as the forefront of any business. “Technology and digital today cut across multiple functions and industries. Traditional businesses have no choice but to ramp up digital and new technology talent to enhance productivity and ensure ease of business,” said K Sudarshan, managing partner, India, at EMA Partners, an executive search firm.

Some of the areas that are in focus include AI, digital transformation, data sciences, machine learning, deep learning, IoT, virtual reality and blockchain, among other emerging technologies. “To build these capabilities in our businesses, we are hiring at multiple levels within each business. We have large number of new hires in AI as well as in IoT and other emerging technologies in various businesses across the Mahindra Group,” said Augustin.

However, there is still paucity of talent in the new and fast-changing digital space and young talent from niche AI consulting firms, consumer internet and technology companies, banking sector and top-notch national and international universities are filling in the demand gap. “We are able to get younger minds that have high learnability towards changing platforms and algorithms, which result in creative solutions to complex problems…. Fresh graduates with niche specialisations like deep learning and AI for business, etc., are another stream of talent pool,” said Augustin.

RPG is hiring people from large analytics firms, data scientists and people with knowledge of cutting-edge digital technology. “We will step up our digital hiring going forward,” said Venkatesh. But more than technology, companies may need to work on changing mindsets. “Without that, technology will remain an underleveraged tool,” said Prabir Jha, chief people officer at Cipla."

48,2018-05-18,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Biotech firm Stempeutics Research today said it has inked an out-licensing deal with drug major Cipla for its stem cell therapy product Stempeucel, indicated for treating critical limb ischemia. 

 ""Under this agreement, Cipla will get exclusive marketing rights for five years in India for critical limb ischemia due to atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (CLI-PAD) with Stempeutics manufacturing and supplying the product to Cipla,"" the company said in a statement. 

 CLI-PAD is characterised by narrowing of arteries in the legs limiting blood flow to the muscles due to the build-up of fatty deposits called plaque, Stempeutics said. 

 ""The product is expected to be available in the Indian market in the beginning of 2020 after undergoing the phase 3 clinical trial in India, which is expected to commence in 2018,"" it added. 

 Stempeutics CEO BN Manohar said, ""Although alternate treatments exist for CLI-PAD, only 50 per cent of patients can be managed with contemporary vascular techniques, while satisfactory clinical outcomes are evident in about 25 per cent of the patients,"" Manohar said. 

 Stempeucel has significant potential to overcome limitations of traditional treatment approaches for CLI due to anti-inflammatory properties, ability to promote neovascularisation and promote healing of non-healing ischemic ulcers, he added. 

 Founded in 2006 by Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG), Stempeutics later entered into an alliance with Cipla in 2009. It is an advanced clinical stage biotech firm."

""Expect the margin expansion story to continue on operating leverage driven by US sales ramp-up, better profitability in markets like Europe, and ongoing cost control initiatives. We factor in about 245 bps improvement in core EBITDA margins over FY18-20,"" it said.

Deutsche Bank (DB) believes that an increase in R&D costs and limited scope for cost savings will cap improvement in EBITDA margin trajectory. 

Citi remains positive on Cipla's ability to outperform most peers on earnings traction, given its relatively lower exposure to the US and improving quality of launches in the market. It has cut the target price to Rs 650 from Rs 680 earlier, maintaining 'buy' rating.

With improving sales and margins outlook, Cipla is best placed among largecap pharma stocks, Macquarie analysts said. The brokerage house has lowered the target price to Rs 636 from Rs 670 and has maintained 'outperform' rating on the stock.

67,2018-05-25,Cipla,"Praful Bohra, Research Analyst, Equirus Capital, points out to ET Now, that a low double-digit price erosion is being factored in by most companies.Edited excerpts:

What is happening in the business cycle of pharma majors back home because the trouble does not seem to end?
The downward trend that started in the US pricing a couple of years back is still going on. This quarter, there is pricing pressure which is likely to continue because company commentaries show they are still talking of a low double digit price erosion. That is significantly higher than the 5% we were all baking in earlier. Overall, the dynamics have changed considerably and pricing pressure is something that the companies will have to live with now.


What could change for the Indian pharma sector? Will USFDA problems get reduced, will pricing improve, will new approvals come in? We can talk about what has gone wrong but a year from now things would change. A year, a-year-and-a-half from now, will the cycle reverse again on the upside this time?
If you look at the whole dynamics, there has been some green shoots in the US market for now. Large companies like Teva and Mylan are rationalising the portfolios. Probably that is going to help the players. To that extent, there have been some green shoots. Somewhere, this has to end. Maybe at some point of time, companies will say we cannot really go below this point because that is going to hurt the ROCs and it is going to hurt the margins. 

Beyond a point, it will be unviable for a lot of companies to manufacture and a lot of companies will go through portfolio rationalisation. That is happening to even smaller players like Cipla and Lupin. Even the larger players like Teva, Mylan are rationalising their portfolios. 

How much this is going to benefit the industry would really depend on how much the overlap is. Say for example, an x company has 35-40% overlap with Teva. Then they are probably going to benefit a little more than someone else who has got a relatively lesser overlap. 

It would still vary from company to company but on a broader level, there has been some green shoots. Companies are probably at the bottom of the pricing pressure. Some companies have witnessed pricing erosion in the range of 15-20% in the past. That is probably something that we are not hearing anymore. Most companies are talking of a low double digit kind of a price erosion. I think incrementally we would not see the pricing pressure that we have seen in the last two years but it would still be more than 5% that we saw in the past from FY14-15 levels."

Technical analysts believe immediate support for the Nifty is between 10,500 and 10,560 and the index is likely to face resistance at 10,650-10,740 levels. Some advise focusing on individual stocks and liquidating positions at higher levels. Information technology is likely to outperform the Nifty index while the pharmaceutical sector is in the process of bottoming out, said technical analysts.


Where are We?
The benchmark Nifty bounced back from the intermediate supports of 10,400-10,420 levels. This bounce could possibly continue until 10,800-10,820 marks. Failure to sustain above these levels would trigger sideways down trend with intermediate support placed at 10,400 levels.


What’s in Store? 
In the given scenario, we believe the IT sector is poised to outperform the Nifty Index. Within the same, Infosys is gearing up on higher time frame chart to move in uncharted territory. At CMP of Rs 1,228, initial target is placed at Rs 1,400-1,450 levels. Tech Mahindra to follow the pursuit until the Rs 800 mark 


What could Investors Do? Within the pharma sector, Ajanta Pharma at CMP of Rs 998 is poised to move south initially until the Rs 800-mark and could extend lower moves till Rs 750. Similarly, Cipla could possibly edge lower from the current level of Rs 535 until Rs 450-460 mark. Avoid bottom fishing in Sun Pharma as weakness within the ongoing trend still persists.

Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Cipla price can reach the defined target.  Cipla Ltd., incorporated in 1935, is a large-cap pharma company with a market cap of Rs 43142.31 crore.Investment rationale by Reliance SecuritiesLooking ahead, we envisage Cipla’s US business to witness a strong growth on the back of ramp-up in existing products, low base, new launches and aggressive filings (filed 24 ANDAs in FY18 & 32 in FY17; plans to file 20+ ANDAs in FY19; 104 ANDAs pending for approval), while India business is expected to witness a healthy growth. However, factoring in weak 4QFY18 along with adverse product-mix and slower-than-expected growth in operating profit, we cut our EPS estimates by 14.3% and 14.0% for FY19E and FY20E, respectively. At CMP, stock trades at PE multiples of 22.0x and 18.4x of FY19E and FY20E EPS, respectively, which appear to be expensive.

76,2018-05-31,Cipla,"Reliance Pharma Fund has surprised investors with its stellar performance in the last one year. The fund has managed to beat its benchmark and peers by a wide margin. No wonder, mutual fund analysts and advisors can't stop praising the great stock picking skills of Sailesh Raj Bhan, fund manager of Reliance Pharma Fund.

Reliance Pharma Fund has offered around 16 per cent returns in the last year, while its benchmark, S&P BSE Healthcare Index, returned -0.02 per cent. The pharma category offered an average return of 1.82 per cent during the same period.

“The fund follows a concentrated approach with around 40-50 per cent invested in the top five holdings. And the top five stocks have done well in the last one year. So, we can say the returns are a result of great stock picking by the fund manager,” says Vidya Bala, Head of Mutual Fund Research at FundsIndia.com.

The top five holdings of the scheme were: Divi's Laboratories (11.76 per cent), Abbott India (10.34 per cent), Cipla (9.55 per cent), Sun Pharmaceuticals (9.22 per cent) and Sanofi India(8.86 per cent). 

The scheme had a host of exceptional performers in its portfolio. The scheme bets around 12 per cent on Divi's Laboratories, which has returned an eye-popping 87.31 per cent in a year and 7.56 per cent on Biocon which has given 114 per cent returns in the last year. The scheme has 10 per cent allocation to Abbott India which has returned 66 per cent in the last year. Another great bet of the fund manager was Sanofi India, which has returned around 25 per cent in one year. 

“The fund manager’s stock calls have clearly gone right in this case. Also, the scheme is concentrating on domestic consumption more than export based businesses. This strategy has also yielded them good returns,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan, Founder, Prakala Wealth Management. Chokkalingam adds that, “The bet on Biocon and Divi’s has pushed the fund performance mostly.”

Reliance Pharma Fund's performance is even more commendable considering the entire pharma category has been in the doldrums in the last three years.Mutual fund advisors ask investors to have realistic expectations from the scheme in the coming days. ""The scheme has performed exceptionally well but investors should keep their return expectations low. The scheme has done well in the last year but we should remember that the entire category is down. Investors should get in if they can stand at least two to three years of volatility,"" says Chokkalingam."

18,2018-06-10,Cipla,"Country's fourth-largest drug maker Cipla is bullish on growth and is looking for a billion dollar consolidated revenue for the domestic market in FY19, a senior company official said.

The company reported revenues of Rs 15,219 crore, growing 6 per cent, with income from the India operations seeing a 6.3 per cent jump at Rs 5,687 crore in FY18.

""In terms of the domestic business we are on a strong footing as growth was in healthy double digits,"" Cipla global CFO Kedar Upadhye said at an earnings conference here.

""We are quite confident and we are set for a billion dollar consolidated revenue in the domestic market in FY19,"" Upadhye added.

The drug maker expects the in-licensing deals with innovator companies, focus on certain therapeutic segments and sales force productivity optimisation measures to aid growth in India.

""This financial year, our focus remained on strengthening our portfolio and deepening our presence in priority markets. We are happy that our efforts on cost and efficiency improvement helped us deliver the full year margin ahead of our guidance range,"" Cipla managing director and global CEO Umang Vohra said.

The focus for next year will be to continue on the growth trajectory in key markets, he added.

Commenting on inorganic growth plans, Vohra said, ""We have taken an enabling resolution, does not mean that we will be doing deals worth Rs 4,000 crore. As and when they become available, we will be hopeful (of acquisition), but we will not buy unless we see a synergy value in the transaction.""

Last year the company had taken an enabling resolution to raise funds of about Rs 2,000 crore of debt and Rs 2,000 crore of equity.

The company is also looking at consolidating its position in South Africa, US, Europe and emerging markets.

""We will ramp up our US business, which is poised for good growth during this year with our key differentiated launches,"" Vohra said.

The company is also looking at significant investments in R&D to build a strong pipeline, with over 20 targeted filings in FY19. This year will also see higher investments towards clinical trials for key respiratory assets and focus on building specialty assets, Vohra added."

Capital goods and telecom sectors are some other sectors which have lost clout in last decade while others such as cement and real estate sectors have, for long, had no representation in the index. 

In the case of pharma sector, it would now be represented only by Sun Pharma, which would have a weightage of 1.7 per cent in the 30-pack. Cipla and Lupin were shown the door in the December 2017 rejig.

The sector’s weightage in Sensex had risen from 1.1 per cent in FY10 to 8.3 per cent in FY16, only to decline thereafter.

""The weight of the healthcare sector will now be at an eight-year low, with the exclusion of Dr Reddy’s Labs and also due to the significant underperformance of the sector over the past two years,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.

Healthcare is not alone. Weightages of capital goods and telecom sectors, too, have hit new lows. The capital goods sector accounted for 10.7 per cent weightage in the index in FY08, which has fallen to 4.7 per cent now. Telecom sector's weightage has dropped from 5.4 per cent in FY10 to 3.7 per cent now.

Cement and real estate now have no representation in the index.

The product is being launched with an approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, it said in a BSE filing.

Buprenorphine and naloxone are used to treat adults with opioid dependence/addiction.

Dr Reddy's will be the third company to exit the Sensex pack as part of the index reconstitution. India’s healthcare sector will have the lightest weighing in eight years on the benchmark Sensex when Dr Reddy’s Labs exits the crucial gauge next week after a tepid run from the entire pharmaceuticals industry since 2015, ET reported.

In December, two pharmaceutical stocks — Lupin and Cipla — had been replaced by YES Bank and IndusInd Bank in the Sensex as part of the rejig.

Global brokerage firm Nomura has a 'buy’ rating on the stock with a 12-month target price of Rs 2,704, implying a potential upside of near 20 per cent from the current market price.

The company's management believes that its US business should grow with 15 plus launches in FY19. The drugmaker is likely to complete remediation activities by June-July for both Srikakulam and Duvvada plants. 

""Hence, it is unlikely that we will see lucrative approvals coming in from these two plants in FY19, leading to further erosion in the US base business,"" said HDFC Securities in its research report.

In December, two pharmaceutical stocks — Lupin and Cipla — had been replaced by YES Bank and IndusInd Bank in the Sensex as part of the reconstitution.

Any change in index weights can result in portfolio churns for major funds in the long run.

With the inclusion of Vedanta in the benchmark, the metal sector weight will increase to 2.6 per cent from 1 per cent, but it is still far from the peak of 8.1 per cent in FY11.

The Sensex, a gauge comprising 30 top shares, is set to be reconstituted on Monday, June 18.

The Sensex EPS for FY19 and FY20 will see upgrades of 1.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent, primarily due to a higher increase in free float PAT as the free float market cap of the new stock to be included is 1.7 times of the stock to be excluded from the index, according to a study by Motilal Oswal Securities.

The brokerage now estimates Sensex EPS at ?1,870 for FY19, up 36 per cent year-on-year and ?2,241 for FY20, an increase of 20 per cent YoY. Excluding corporate banks (SBI, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank), Sensex constituents are expected to post 24 per cent profit growth for FY19.

Over the years, the sectoral representation in the Sensex has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy. New businesses have evolved, while some of the erstwhile dominant sectors have lost relative importance.

The banking and financial sector will have a weight of 40.4 per cent, the highest, with private banks at 28.8 per cent and PSU banks at 3 per cent.

Technology has the second highest weight in the Sensex at 12.7 per cent. Auto has bridged the gap versus technology, especially over the past two years. The gap between auto and technology has narrowed from 710 bps in FY 2016 to 250 bps now.

With the change in constituents, HDFC Bank will lead the Sensex weightage with 11.8 per cent, followed by Reliance Industries (9.1 per cent), and HDFC (8.7 per cent).

Weights of capital goods and telecom are now at all-time lows of 4.7 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. Notably, telecom’s weight is down from 8.6 per cent in FY08. Both sectors have representation of just one stock each — Larsen & Toubro and Bharti Airtel."
31,2018-06-17,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: The global trade wars are back, and this time scarier than before. While the denuclearisation deal between the US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un lifted the market higher last week, the hefty tariffs announced by the former on China, is likely to sour investors' mood.

 Emerging markets remained unscathed after the US Federal Reserve's hawkish tone, and the bulls on Dalal Street showed a great resilience. Last week, the broader NSE index gained 0.46 per cent and BSE posted a weekly gain of 0.50 per cent.

Here are key developments investors might want to look at for the coming week:

Trade 
War Ahoy!
 US President Donald Trump announced late Friday that he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. And Beijing immediately vowed to responded, thus igniting fresh trade war concerns between the two biggest economies. India too joined, as the government decided to increase import tariffs on 30 items from the US amounting to $240 million in response against tariffs imposed by the latter on aluminium and steel imports in March.


Slippery Slope
 The much-talked about Opec meet will be held on June 22 and 23 to review their production agreement. Opec and other exporters including Russia appear poised to ease voluntary production limits, which have helped shrink a global oil glut since they went into effect in January 2017. However, many producers have tapped out and would prefer to hold back supply, which supports prices. Those nations include Venezuela, where output has cratered amid a prolonged economic crisis, and Iran, which is facing renewed US sanctions aimed at cutting off its oil exports, says a CNBC report.
 Opec meetings are closely watched because the producer group pumps about 40 per cent of the world's oil.


Sensex Rejig
 The BSE Sensex composition is all set for a reshuffle on Monday, where Vedanta will replace Dr Reddy's Labs. With Vedanta's inclusion, the weight of metals sector in the benchmark index will increase to 2.6 per cent. The existing metal player in the headline index Tata Steel carries 1.3 per cent weight. Vedanta, too, will have 1.3 per cent weight. On the flip side, the healthcare sector will hit an eight-year low as it stands to lose most in terms of weight (-70 bps to 1.7 per cent), with Dr Reddy's exit. Earlier, in December 2017, Cipla and Lupin were excluded from the benchmark. Now, Sun Pharma will be the only such stock in the benchmark index.


ECB Forum
 A three-day ECB forum on central banking will start on Monday in Sintra, Portugal. The ECB (European Central Bank) in its policy meet last week said it would end asset purchases by the end of the year, but also pledged to keep interest rates at current record lows at least through the summer of 2019. The more dovish-than-expected outlook for borrowing costs weighed on the euro and boosted the dollar. But Sintra speakers will still be listened to because any signs of a European growth setback could complicate the QE exit path, says Reuters in a report. The forum will see the likes of ECB chief Mario Draghi, Bank of Japan’s Kuroda and the US Federal Reserve’s Jerome Powell.


BoE Rate-Setting Meet
 The Bank of England (BoE) will decide on interest rate on Thursday. It is expected to maintain status quo this time. BoE voted by seven to two to keep the bank rate at 0.5 per cent on May 10, due to a sharp slowdown in GDP growth in the first quarter. This apart, Brazil, Mexico, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand and Hungary all have central bank meetings next week.


RITES IPO 
 State-owned RITES (Rail India Technical and Economic Services) is all set to launch its IPO on June 20. The price band of the offer has been set between Rs 180-185 per share with face value of Rs 10 each. At the upper price band of the offer, the company aims to raise Rs 466.2 crore. The three-day public offer will close on June 22, Friday. The IPO is part of the government's disinvestment programme. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced Indian Railways’ plans to list its subsidiaries after the merger of the railway budget with the Union budget.


Tech Charts
 The Nifty50 index on Friday slipped to near 10,750 level in the intraday trade before erasing the losses of entire day to settle in the black, suggesting that the bulls were not in a mood to give in easily.

 On the weekly timeframe chart, the Nifty formed a small-body positive candle with a minor upper shadow. This pattern indicated rangebound movement in the market, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.

 During the week, trading took place in a 138-point narrow range, leaving a dominant upper shadow. It should be a cause for concern, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

 ""Unless the index closes above 10,930, the bulls will not gain an upper hand. A breakout is needed for them to reach safe shores. A close below 10,755 shall re-establish the supremacy of the bears. Traders are advised to remain cautious,” Mohammad said."

34,2018-06-19,Cipla,"Reasonable valuations along with expectations of potential upside made pharmaceutical stocks buzzing among investors on Dalal Street as well as mutual funds in June.

ICICI Prudential, country’s biggest mutual fund in terms of assets, has come up with a way to tap the opportunity with a sector-specific scheme -- ICICI Prudential Pharma Healthcare and Diagnostics (PHD) Fund. The new fund offer will open for subscription on June 25. 

There are hopes that more institutional money will come into the pharma sector. Aditya Birla Sun Life has also applied with the markets regulator Sebi to launch a new scheme.

After underperforming benchmark equity index during the last three years, the Nifty Pharma index has jumped 12 per cent in June so far, whereas Nifty is up around 0.13 per cent. 

Many market mavens are also bullish on pharma stocks.

V Srivatsa, fund manager, UTI Mutual Fund in a chat with ETNow said, “Pharma can be a surprise pack for the next year because we believe that the earnings have bottomed out.” 

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has rallied over 23 per cent this month, while Alembic Pharma, Lupin and Piramal Enterprises gained up to 20 per cent during the same period.

Largecap stocks, including Sun Pharmaceuticals, Aurobindo Pharma and Glenmark Pharma, have climbed between 10 per cent and 16 per cent this month. Cipla and Cadila Healthcare rallied 15 per cent each during the same period.

The Nifty Pharma index corrected more than 20 per cent over the past three years (after 30 per cent CAGR over FY11-15). Hit by regulatory clampdowns, channel consolidation in the US and increased competition had kept pharma stocks under pressure. 

“Despite the all-too-visible business challenges, they persisted with higher R&D activity (related to complex generics and specialty business), which aggravated the pain,” said HDFC Securities in a report.

The brokerage firm believes that FY19 may see a gradual comeback for largecap pharma companies, driven by actual and likely regulatory resolutions, moderating price erosion and several product launches across generic and specialty categories in 2HFY19. “We believe earnings have bottomed out, while the base is favourable. We upgrade Sun Pharma to Buy,” said HDFC Securities. 

March quarter result of pharma companies remained weak with continuing pricing pressure in the US generic business, the solace was the pickup in domestic business and emerging markets business, according to Sharekhan. 

“Net profit of companies was dented on account of one-time tax adjustment related to changes in US tax rates and continued pricing pressure in the US business. Most pharma companies under our coverage universe are trading at 8-18x their FY2020E earnings. We advise selective buying and prefer companies such as Biocon, Cipla and Divi’s,” the brokerage house said in a report.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries received positive news recently, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearing its Halol plant, which had been under supply restrictions due to quality control failures.

The company will now be able to restart supplies to its largest market, the US, from this facility, which contributed around 15 per cent to the company's US revenue in 2015.

IDFC Securities maintains ‘Outperform’ rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 574. “Receipt of Halol EIR is major positive development for Sun’s US business. Sun Pharma is clearly the best placed amongst large domestic peers,” the brokerage house said. 

Market expert Ajay Bagga told ETNow, “The beneficiaries of the stronger dollar will clearly be IT and pharma. IT is already moving. I think pharma has started a move again so that also one can look at. The only space in pharma to avoid is the leverage bets where there is too much leverage on the balance sheets. It will take some time to work out but otherwise, there are a lot of companies which are turning around. The US revenue forecast into the EPS is at historical lows and probably have bottomed out.”

Going by market experts, India has established itself as a global manufacturing and research hub in the pharmaceutical space. India contributes nearly 10 per cent of the world production volume and 50 per cent of its revenue comes from exports. The government’s initiative such as Pharma Vision 2020 to make India a global leader in manufacturing is one of the catalysts for the sector. 

“India has the second largest number of USFDA-approved manufacturing plants outside the US with 2,633 FDA-Approved Drug Products,” said ICICI Prudential AMC.

Sanjiv Bhasin of India Infoline suggested that an investor should make an SIP in Dr Reddy, Sun Pharmaceutical, Lupin, Aurobindo, and Biocon. “Strides Shasun or a Cadila could be the second guard stocks to own but these five large caps should be the best bellwethers one they become a very good proxy against any weakness in the rupee,” Bhasin told ETNow."

44,2018-06-22,Cipla,"Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor talks to ET Now about his favourites in auto, pharma, OMCs and commodity sectors.Edited excerpts:


Does Tata Motors seem to be the haziest story in the auto pack right now?
Yes and it is not that the street is just discovering that now! Tata Motors has been a rank underperformer compared to Nifty as well as other auto stocks in the last three years. That stock has either not given returns or has been in the negative in last 12 to 18 months.
We can see a change in growth trajectory in Bajaj Auto and some of the other companies but in Tata Motors, the uncertainty on growth continues. More than 80% of earnings come from the JLR but a big question remains on how sustainable the growth is for JLR in China, Europe or US. The tariffs war development may be a couple of months old, but the Tata Motors growth disappointment or underperformance has been going on for at least 8 to 10 quarters now.


Among auto stocks, which would be your top bet? Please do not say Maruti.
Among auto stocks, in terms of two-wheeler companies Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto are the preferred bets . Otherwise, Maruti is a high conviction bet on declines. It has been on a slight downtrend where according to technical analysts, the supports lie. Fundamentally, in terms of valuations at about 80 times one year forward and about 16% to 18% growth being sustained for the next at least two-three years led by volumes, led by new product and variant launches, Maruti is a terrific story going ahead.


OMCs were highlighted in trade yesterday. They have had a rough patch in the last six months. A good 25% to 30% odd correction has already played out in OMCs for the last quarter or so. Is there merit in nibbling into OMCs?
OMCs had a dream run between 2015 and 2016-17 on back of low oil prices and lower underrecoveries/subsidy contributions. We are back to the scenario of five years ago with high crude prices and under recoveries and oil PSUs taking that additional burden because the consumer prices cannot be raised in line with crude prices. That is one side of the story. I would be neutral to negative on as far as the oil OMCs -- IOC, HP, BP -- are concerned. 

In HPCL, there is an additional complication of a merger with ONGC going through. That is going to cause some sort of disturbance in the stock price as well.


How are you placing yourself in pharma?

Vivek Mavani: I will break up pharma into three parts. Fortunately, all the three parts of pharma seem to be firing as far as the growth is concerned. If we look at the Indian pharma focussed on exports, they have had a rough run over the last two-three years on back of regulatory and USFDA and quality issues.

The Halol unit of Sun Pharma getting certified a few days back is a huge shot in arm and a huge trigger on the export side. Domestic pharma has continued to consistently deliver earnings growth quarter of 15% odd, quarter after quarter, year after year.

Cipla is a very interesting bet really. Among the midcaps, Cipla has no regulatory issues and a consistent growth story. Alkem and Ajanta Pharma are again interesting domestic consumption plays. 

The third leg which has been a rank underperformer over the last 12-13 years have been the multinational pharma companies. They seem to be coming back very strongly. Glaxo or AstraZeneca were forgotten names. I am sure an entire generation of young traders and investors probably have never even looked at some of these companies which were darlings of the markets may be 15 to 25 years ago. That segment seems to be coming back in a major way and I see lot of opportunities in multinational pharma as well.


Do you have a call on Rites or Fine Organics?
I have not really looked at Fine Organics. But the other IPO which is closing today, Rites is quite an interesting play. It is a consultancy business, asset light, with high return on capital, return on equity and generates free cash flows. It is also a debt-free company in the infrastructure consulting space. Major part of work is coming from railways and capex is being planned out over the next 5-10 years. Rites could be sustainable. It has a steady earnings growth story with the hefty payouts for investors going forward. Valuation too is also not very demanding. Rites is something worth investing in both in the IPO and on listing and the oversubscription numbers at the end of second day itself speaks about it.


Coming on the commodities basket, is there still merit in looking at a Hindalco, Tata Steel as well as Vedanta at these levels?
Commodities are an interesting sector. The China factor seems to be coming back but for a different reason. In commodities, I am not so bullish on Tata Steel or Hindalco but some of the other names like Jindal Steel and Power, which has a huge deleveraging story over the next two-three years. The gross debt would come down by almost Rs 15,000 crore from about Rs 42,000 crore of peak debt in 2017.

In the next 18 months or so, the gross number should be around Rs 28,000-29,000 crore and driven by higher volumes which would jump from about 3.5 million tonnes to about 6 million tonnes by 2020. On back of higher prices, higher volumes, higher prices and a meaningful debt reduction, JSPL looks a better bet than Tata Steel. 

In the non-steel category, Hindustan Zinc looks attractive because zinc prices are still at elevated levels and Hindustan Zinc is quite an interesting bet with free cash flows, tonnes of surplus cash sitting on the balance sheet and expected hefty dividend payouts.

When the Government of India will divest the 26% stake nobody knows but assuming that does not happen in the near future, just the earnings growth and dividend payouts are enough triggers for me."

49,2018-06-25,Cipla,"IDFC Securities has an outperform call on Cipla Ltd. with a target price of Rs 639.0 . The current market price of Cipla Ltd. is Rs 614.25 Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Cipla Ltd. price can reach defined target. Cipla Ltd., incorporated in the year 1935, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 49438.74 crore.


Investment rationale by IDFC Securities
With flat profits over FY13-17 at ~Rs15bn, Cipla reported ‘below potential’ earnings for a prolonged period, as revenue growth failed to match aggressive growth investments. Signs of profitability turnaround were visible in FY18 with change in strategy and management. Scale-up in the US business through the launch of niche ANDAs should add to this momentum. Over the medium term, we expect Cipla’s relatively small US business (~$385m in FY18) to grow briskly as on-going R&D investmentsin developing complex drugs including multiple inhalation products begin to yield results. This will complement the steady profitability growth in Cipla’s sturdy domestic formulations franchise. We estimate 20% EPS CAGR over FY18-20E, as Cipla capitalizes on its ‘underleveraged’ R&D capabilities. Maintain Outperformer with a price target of Rs 639."
50,2018-06-25,Cipla,"CLSA is bullish on Sun Pharma, Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's Laboratories in the pharmaceutical space. 

The firm believes the recent rally in the sector is different as it is coming off on the back of improving fundamentals in the US, which include good approvals for select companies, enriched commentary on US pricing and progress on resolving regulatory issues. 

""Improving visibility in the US and normalisation in India along with ongoing cost control measures give us confidence that 21% YoY growth in adj profits for our coverage universe is achievable,"" said CLSA. 

The firm said stocks that are well positioned include Sun Pharma for its specialty pipeline in the US, Torrent for its India positioning and Dr Reddy’s as a high-risk, high-reward trade.

CLSA is positive on the outlook for Lupin, Cipla and Glenmark as well."

1,2018-07-04,Cipla,"Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, tells ET Now that consumption pattern improves in a year when monsoon is good and there are large MSP hikes. Discretionary spending improves, specifically in terms of rural and semi-urban economies.Edited excerpts: 


Prem Watsa of Fairfax Financial Holdings has expressed confidence that if the PSU banks were to be privatised, he would be very keen to take them over. What is your view on these banks?
There are two aspects: one, in terms of the core fundamentals for these banks and the regulatory changes that we are witnessing in terms of asset resolutions. Second element is valuations. What we have seen over the last so many quarters in terms of first the IBC coming through; the next proposal has just come through in terms of an AMC. A large number of public sector banks are still reeling under pressure both in terms of recognition of quality on their balance sheet and at the same time a large part of the public sector banks are coming under the PCA rule. 

Credit growth for these banks is going to be very difficult. At the same time, the balance sheet expansion and the capital adequacy ratios probably are not the right elements for a lot of these banks, specifically in the midcap and smallcap universe. 

Again, asset quality pressures and the provisioning can continue. There is obviously provisioning related to NCLT. Valuations are obviously very cheap. On a price to book parameter, you take the biggest name right from SBI to the smallest banks and the valuations continue to be extremely cheap compared to their private sector counterparts. The inherent risk and the headwinds that the markets perceive that these banks can still go through over the next two to three quarters to say the least, still leaves a bias towards the private sector banks. 

Large retail private sector banks like HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Bank are growing their balance sheets very strongly. Even on the asset quality side, a large part of their recognition in terms of corporate retail lending banks have probably improved. So, the retail lending has improved, the corporate stress has largely got recognised and though price to book might be little bit expensive, the bias stays towards the private side at this point of time.


The Cabinet cleared the MSP hikes today. Investment wise, is this of material significance?
 Markets have been gearing up on expectations of large MSP hikes. At the same time, there are concerns that if the hikes are substantial, what kind of an impact will that have on inflation and in terms of controlling of the fiscal deficit. Those are two things that the exchequer needs to probably balance or counter balance.

But a large element in terms of MSP hikes going through and the assumption that the monsoons are equally good this fiscal is predicted. The consumption patterns will definitely improve. Historically, in a year where monsoons are doing better along with expectations of larger MSP hikes, discretionary spending obviously improves, specifically in terms of the rural and the semi-urban economies. 

Having said that, the government’s spending programme in terms of rural infrastructure and rural consumption is expected to grow multi-fold as that is going to get front loaded as well. So, rural themes or rural discretionary spending patterns are going to determine a lot of volume growth in consumer staples among FMCG companies. You are probably going to see a spike in autos and even paint and cement consumption will go up because kutcha houses will start becoming more pucca in terms of cement outlook. Asbestos sheet plays actually are doing well. There are a whole host of plays that can actually do well along with the usual plays of agrochemicals and anything related to farm and farm equipment.


Do you like the metals pack even now after the rally or would you rather book profits given what is expected of commodity prices in the near term? 
It was a fabulous year for metal companies, both ferrous as well as non-ferrous in the year gone by. The threat of trade wars is driving LME prices lower. In that sense the expectations of dumping of a lot of Chinese stuff worldwide ex-US is probably causing that amount of pain. From an immediate near-term perspective, the kind of headwinds these metal companies might face can be very profound. 

Having said that, the steel players which are domestically driven at this point of time still are in a very good position. The numbers through our channel checks still suggest that they are holding up in terms of expectations of volumes sustaining for the steel companies. The input costs obviously had an impact on EBITDA and the EBITDA per tonne which they reported in the last two quarters. 

But a large part of the impact of the input cost is probably stabilising now on expectations of passing that through to consumers. The volume growth and realisations growth should give leverage on their balance sheets and EBITDA multiples. The demand outlook still looks extremely robust. 

JSW Steel, Tata Steel still are hold for us. A contra bet can be Steel Authority because a large part of their capex is behind them. What they have reported in terms of their bottom line losses can easily reverse as the leverage element gets played on their balance sheet. The number of semis on their product list is also reducing. The products mix is improving and that can give earnings upgrade as well. So, Tata Steel can be a contra bet with the long-term perspective.


Do you believe there is merit in adding further weightage to IT as well as pharmaceuticals in your portfolio right now?
The upward movement has been quite stupendous for both these sectors but a large element in terms of where the markets find safety at this point of time remains in these two sectors. The other element in terms of pharma specifically is a lot of concerns that were raised in terms of USFDA and pricing pressures that has probably played out in terms of earnings downgrades. A lot of resolution has actually started coming through and a lot of these companies have invested very heavily on R&D for creating niche pipelines.

The niche speciality pipeline is something which is going to differentiate the larger pharma players from the smaller ones. So the niche players are obviously going to still have the earnings benefit over the next few quarters. Obviously. the earnings trickle down in terms of upgrades, will start happening from the second half because the first half will still be a little bit patchy in terms of reported numbers as well as margins which can still get squeezed because of pricing issues. 

But as these drugs start getting approvals over the next few quarters, earnings should show a steady improvement. Sun Pharma for example had already indicated in their concall a double digit revenue growth. The resolution of their issue with Halol facility is obviously going to propel earnings growth. You are probably seeing other players including Lupin, Cipla having a very strong pipeline. Even Aurobindo Pharma has a strong injectable pipeline. 

Select pharma names obviously look attractive from a long-term perspective. For IT in general, my own sense is that the kind of earnings growth that one really expects in dollar and constant currency terms will show a gradual improvement because BFSI has been the laggard for the sector. As discretionary spending patterns start improving, BFSI will start contributing more meaningfully. 

The EBIT margins have stabilised and so has the attrition levels. Utilisations are going up, the onsite offshore mix probably improving for these players. Though the element of wage hikes in Q1-Q2 cannot be ruled out, the second half in my opinion can be equally strong. 

Select players within top tier IT space and even some niche midcap players probably look attractive but the logic here has to be to buy in a staggered manner because the run up has been quite sharp."

4,2018-07-10,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Last month, a French company elevated its chief financial officer in India to head its business unit as chief operating officer (COO). Reason: to lead its inorganic growth plans in India, as the company felt that its finance head could double up as head strategic business initiatives.

“Our client was confident that its CFO could take up the role of COO as well and help in acquiring business in India,” said Suresh Raina, managing partner at Hunt Partners. There are many such cases of CFOs donning the hat of chief executive officer (CEO) and chief operating officer (COO). Exactly a year ago, Samrat Gupta was elevated from CFO as CEO of Tata Motors Finance.

Last month, NS Kannan, who served as a CFO at ICICI Bank, was appointed the CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company.

“Over the past 12 to 24 months, the CFO searches have evolved from just pure finance roles to CFOs who can co-pilot with CEOs in transforming the organisations and businesses,” said Monica Agrawal, head of financial services, India, Korn Ferry International.

Agrawal also cites the instance of Korn Ferry International’s CEO Gary Burnison who had joined the firm as CFO. “Ever since he took over as the CEO, our organisation has grown multifold as reflected in the stock price,” she said. The firm is listed on the NYSE.

With the rising demand for CFOs or CEOs in waiting, the salary of CFOs has risen by over 40% over last year or so. Due to paucity of this talent pool, pay packets have shot up by as much as Rs 5 crore over the past two years, according to search firms and human resource firms such as Korn Ferry, Transearch, BTI, Hunt Partners and IKYA.




“CFOs, unlike couple of years ago, are no longer just number crunchers,” Agrawal said. Compensations for CFOs range between Rs 2 crore and over Rs 5 crore (depending on the company’s size). This usually does not include stock options. Asmall cap company of Rs 100 crore in turnover is now ready to pay anywhere between Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 2.5 crore excluding variables (a jump of at least 30-40%), according to Uday Chawla, managing partners, Transearch India. Transearch is currently busy with about nine CFO search mandates from MNCs and Indian conglomerates. “From last year, we have seen a jump of more than double in demand for CFOs,’’ Chawla said. “Most companies prefer CFOs who have some experience in business operations,” he said.

The salary difference between an Indian and a global CFO is finally shrinking. “Capability of Indian CFO talent in comparison to worldwide talent, India’s rank in global’s MNC’s contribution to growth and business, has further put emphasis on Indian CFOs and thus enabled comparison of CFO compensation in India vis-a-vis the rest of the world,” said Lohit Bhatia, CEO-staffing at Ikya Human Capital.

Indian CFO transitioning into larger role of CEO is continuously happening in large companies: TCS (Rajesh Gopinathan), Siemens (Sunil Mathur), Cipla (Umang Vohra), Pfizer (S Sridhar), Quess Corp (Subrata Kumar Nag) are a few market leaders in their segments where CFO has been transitioned into CEO role after very successful stints.

“CFOs are also being looked at as an alternate to manage interim business period, between incumbent CEO’s exit and new CEO hiring, that is why probably running business as well is considered an additional advantage,” said James Agrawal, managing director of BTI Consultants India.

According to Agrawal, sectors such as infrastructure, energy, healthcare, consumer services and ecommerce will further throw up demand for finance candidates with a strong focus on fundraising and investor relations experience.

Largely, the reason for high demand in CFOs is due to the evolving role of CFOs. “Financial function is becoming more complex over the years. From a pure accounting and book keeping role, it has become more strategic and business oriented,” said Raina."

6,2018-07-11,Cipla,"Biocon has decided to put the development of a biosimilar of etanercept on the backburner, as the Bengaluru-based company hopes to reap the benefits from partner Mylan’s new tie-up with local drug maker Lupin. Biocon and Mylan have been working for a decade on a biosimilar version of the drug, originally sold by Amgen under the brand name Enbrel and used for the treatment of illness such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

According to people familiar with the development, the complex structure to replicate Enbrel led to a slowdown in the development of the drug and it had not moved from the preclinical stage.

The Biocon-Mylan JV had announced plans to develop and market five highly complex biosimilar drugs and insulin copies for emerging and regulated markets like the US and Europe. The combined opportunity of all these drugs was estimated to be $61 billion. Etanercept (Enbrel) was one of those drugs. However, in a decade's time, the partnership has managed to get approval for only two anti-cancer drugs — trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim — and an insulin product, glargine.

Last month, Mylan announced that it had tied up with Mumbaibased Lupin with an upfront payment of $15 million to market biosimilar Enbrel in markets like Europe, New Zealand and Asia, raising doubts in the market about its JV with Biocon for this drug. It also led to speculation in the industry that Biocon’s Enbrel version had failed to take off.

Biocon said it was “incorrect to say its Enbrel programme has failed” and the reason for the slow development was because the company chose to focus on other drugs in its pipeline.



The company led by Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw also said it would benefit from Mylan’s tie-up with Lupin.

“Mylan and Biocon have an exclusive agreement on its partnered portfolio including etanercept. In line with this agreement, we decided to accelerate the opportunity for monetisation of this molecule through Mylan’s commercial arrangement for Lupin’s more advanced etanercept programme for select markets,” a spokesperson told in response to ET’s query. “Biocon benefits from this due to its economic interest vis-à-vis Mylan in line with our existing partnership wherein Mylan leads the commercial efforts and shares profit with Biocon,” the spokesperson added.

Enbrel is a drug of Amgen/Pfizer. It is a fusion protein unlike other biologic drugs which are monoclonal antibodies. The science of making the follow-on version, industry watchers say, is one of the toughest. That is why there are fewer biosimilar versions of this drug compared with other biologic drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Indian drug maker Cipla too had tied up with a Chinese drug maker for biosimilar Enbrel, but the deal fell through. Sandoz, the generic arm of Swiss drug maker Novartis, has also delayed the launch of a biosimilar Enbrel. In 2017 Japanese drug maker Diiachi Sankyo broke its partnership with Coherus Biosciences to manufacture a version of Enbrel, which had annual sales of $11 billion in 2017.

Korea’s Samsung Biologics has launched its Enbrel biosimilar in its home market, while Mochida Pharma launched the drug in Japan. India’s Lupin, along with partner YL Biologics, submitted Phase 3 data for an Enbrel copy to Japanese drug authorities and is waiting for a response."

9,2018-07-13,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: A likely flash of brilliance may not just be enough for this sector to win over analysts. 

Pricing challenges remain, but the good part is regulatory environment is improving for the pharma sector. The industry is expected to make an earnings rebound in the June quarter -- up to 50 per cent surge in net profit -- largely driven by a low base and rupee tailwinds. 

If analysts are to be believed, this sector is up for a gradual comeback in FY19, but the current valuation may not be that compelling to go long-term bullish on the space.


50% spike in Q1 profits?Edelweiss Securities expects the sector to report a jump of 17 per cent in revenues and nearly 50 per cent in profits. Motilal Oswal Securities, whose pharma universe bounced back in January-March following four consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings decline in 2017, is seeing 44 per cent profit growth.

Phillip Capital sees its pharma universe reporting 42 per cent YoY growth in earnings on a 12 per cent rise in revenues growth. This brokerage noted that the ANDA approvals rate in the three months to June improved to 200, from 112 in the preceding quarter, even as the quarter witnessed only a few new launches by domestic drug makers. 

The brokerage is positive on Biocon, Cipla, Divi's Labs, IPCA Lab and Sun Pharma, and negative on Glenmark and Lupin as far as quarterly earnings go.

The earnings recovery hinges on bottoming out of pricing pressure in the US market, but the worst, insofar as earnings are concerned, is over for the healthcare sector, Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Large cap drug makers may take a lead, thanks to regulatory resolutions, moderating price erosion and new product launches in the second half of the financial year, said HDFC Securities. The brokerage is expecting pharma stocks under its coverage to report first double-digit revenue growth in six quarters.


Pricing pressure loomsIn case of price erosion, analysts feel that significant price erosion may happen only for drugs where there are fewer than three manufacturers. Besides, they feel that the government many bring in more life-saving drugs under the DPCO (Drug Price Control Order) ambit ahead of state and general elections.

""Lowering drug prices by adding drugs to DPCO is expected to gain a favour of citizens during the 2018 state and 2019 general elections. The impact of adding new drugs to DPCO is to lower both the revenues and profits of pharma companies whose drugs may be added to DPCO,"" said Karvy Stock Broking.


Regulatory issues easingThe recent favourable inspections at Sun Pharma's Halol plant, Cadila's facility and Dr Reddy’s Medak, Srikakulam SEZ and UK facilities demonstrate that the worst in terms of regulatory issues is over, said Edelweiss Securities.


Rupee depreciationDuring the June quarter, the rupee depreciated 3.8 per cent against the dollar and 12.7 per cent against the euro. It though appreciated against three BRICS currencies Russian Ruble, Brazilian Real and South African Rand, which could influence the EM market growth for the firms. 

A 1 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has a benefit of average 1.1 per cent on Ebitda even as hedges and interest payments may trim some of the benefits, BofA-ML said on its coverage stocks.


M&A activity to pace upKarvy expects that the drug makers may resort to divest ANDAs or businesses that lack core competence.

""We strongly believe that divestitures, mergers and acquisitions would be the key driver of growth for the large generic pharma companies in India and the US. Timing of mergers and acquisitions may be uncertain, but will be primarily driven by the level of competition and valuations,"" it said.


ValuationsThe valuation premium pharma stocks have enjoyed in the past over the benchmarks is falling, but analysts largely have mixed views on whether the time is ripe for investors to invest in the sector.

""Consensus downgrades during the June quarter was 7-8 per cent for FY19/20E earnings. The sector trades at 18 times rolling one-year forward earnings, implying a 10.4 per cent premium to Nifty versus 42.5 per cent a year ago,"" Edelweiss said. The brokerage expects Dr Reddy's, Cipla and IPCA to do well.

According to Sharekhan, many frontline stocks are still trading close to their long-term average valuations following sharp downgrade in earnings estimates for the past six quarters. It prefers Biocon, Cadila, Cipla and Sun Pharma as investment options.


What to look atUpdates regarding FDA, key product approvals, management commentaries and the exchange rate would be key in deciding earnings upgrades or downgrades, stated Sharekhan."
10,2018-07-14,Cipla,"The key to investing is being incremental. If you go for the big win every single time, you are gambling and that is how people get into trouble, says Prof Aswath 
   
Damodaran, Stern School of Business, NYU, in a discussion with Ajaya Sharma of ET Now. S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC and Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC also debate the trade-off between numbers and narratives with Damodaran.Edited excerpts: 

I want to start by understanding your thought process on narratives versus numbers. How have you arrived at this hypothesis? How important it is for investors to understand the relationship between these two variables? 

Aswath Damodaran: The key to understanding is to see how the world has shifted around us. Thirty-five years ago when I first started doing valuations, getting data was extremely difficult and working with the data was really difficult as well. So it took a lot more time in valuing companies in terms of pulling their numbers together and working on the mechanics. Today, we are surrounded by data. In fact, I promise too much data not too little data, where being inundated with data often pulls us in different directions. 

We have these incredible models and in a sense we have lost control of the process. We no longer value companies, models value companies for us and that’s a very dangerous place to be in because I have seen bankers enter numbers into models without any sense of how the numbers work with each other and the reason I have had to develop stories is to give some discipline to my own number crunching. I am going to enter numbers into spreadsheets to pump out valuations and I have to learn to tell a story that ties the numbers together. So, it’s almost self taught. I had to do it to slow myself down. 


Valuation is a process in which you have to assume a lot — be it growth, profitability or the way possibly the business chain pans out. How important it is for a money manager or an investor to take both the variables hand-in-hand and not lean towards one more than the other? 

Aswath Damodaran: The key is to listen to other people’s stories and try to make them your own. When I buy a company or invest in one, I am not investing in a CEO story — I am investing in my story for that company. So I have to learn to look at the story that the CEO says and have to do it with respect because that person knows more about the company, but I do recognise that they can come under biases because they want to make their companies look much better than they really are. And I have to learn to take their story and make it my own. I think it’s important to listen but it’s much more critical to think for yourself. 


You have taught hundreds, thousands of fund managers in these last 25-30 years. Do you think that a lot of them who have more tilt towards the factual data, the spreadsheets -- the real the way story in a company or the rationale for buying a stock or a sector -- actually people lose sight on that and hence they never get the real grip on why there is a compelling case to get into a stock?

Aswath Damodaran: You start to delude yourself. Once you want to invest in a company whether you are long or short, you want your story to be true. As human beings we have an infinite capacity for self delusion, which is we find facts that back our stories. I tell people the biggest skill that I see in successful money managers is humility to the acceptances that their story might not be the right one. 


Let’s understand the narrative for the pharmaceutical sector. Till a couple of years back, Mr Hamied of Cipla said that India will become the pharmacy of the world and these were very high growth companies. Then the environment changed. The US drug regulator became much more stringent and the narrative completely changed. Valuations of this entire sector almost halved from top. If you could share some examples the way you avoided some accidents.

S Naren: In pharmaceuticals, the main area where these changes in narratives took place was in America and sitting in India, we got it right to only to a certain extent. What we did not see in the narrative was that there was a buyer side consolidation. The buyer side consolidation changed the power of a seller-buyer interaction from the seller to the buyer and that reduced the margins in pharmaceutical industry for people who are supplying to the US. 

Second, FDA issues and other things became big because 30% to 40% of the tablets made in US were actually manufactured in Indian FDA facilities. That reflected in the kind of vigilance that FDA showed. It was at least possible to start predicting some setbacks in a few companies. But you started thinking will these setbacks happen in other companies as well? So, that has been a much more difficult narrative to follow. 

Whereas if you look at something like NPLs in the public sector banks, the narrative changed from 2010 to 2018 but being a local issue, it was pretty evident that you knew that NPLs were coming and were not getting recognised at one point of time. As it was a local narrative, we were very vigilant about it because we had access to information on the listed borrowers. We knew some of them would not be able to pay their debts.


A couple of years back, you were one of the early people who got into oil marketing companies. At that time people were questioning whether deregulation would be executed the same way the way it has been promised but that narrative actually played out pretty well in numbers and the valuations of these large enterprises also quadrupled. How did you get it right?

S Naren: Oil prices fell between 1999 and 2004 and there was a big rally in some of the oil marketing companies. The interesting thing about the narrative on oil marketing companies has been that when oil goes up, the OMCs do not deliver returns. So far, the government has not imposed any subsidy on oil marketing companies but the stocks have got derated in last six months. 

The narrative is when oil goes up, there is a risk of subsidy which is built because it happened in the last cycle from 2004 to 2007 by the then government. That cycle thinking does happen again because you are still worried that if oil went up, subsidies would come in. So, you have a 2004 to 2007 narrative playing out in 2018. Is it still valid today? The answer is no. But if there were to be subsidies, then the narrative of history of 2004 to 2008 would be played out again.


Chakri, you have been operating currently last couple of years in India but have been wearing a hat of an emerging market fund manager for some time now. Haved you faced this tug of war in other markets as well? Give us some example when you are managing money in London and New York?

Chakri Lokapriya: Narratives and numbers do matter across geographies, across markets and as Naren was pointing out there is probably lesser in one country versus the other. But again in today’s world where data, information everything moves much faster than it did before a business model that happened in the US, it would take many years for it to be replicated in India if you rewind back let us say 20-30 years ago. But today that knowledge transfer happens much more faster and therefore it is sometimes become easier where you just look back at the other markets that you invest in, made a mistake where or eventually that the narrative went wrong or the numbers did not keep up with the narrative and try to avoid those in the local market that you are operating in. 


The other thing is that being a fund manager or even an individual investor who analyses the narrative for a sector or stock and then takes bet or sometimes waits patiently for the numbers to start trickling in before building a position. Does it have more relevance for a particular size of a company? Is it more large cap oriented issue or more midcap or you think it is agnostic of a size of the company?

Chakri Lokapriya: It is a good question. To think about it. every large company today was small at some point in time. Let us take Reliance IndustriesNSE 1.61 %, one of the largest companies in India and so long the narrative and the numbers behind the company was its refining business and its E&P business. 

Today the company is growing big in telecom where it is killing the competition and now it is going into ecommerce. It is also one of the biggest retailers. So here you have one of the largest companies in India which has grown over time with the narrative of all oil analysts. 


 You must be getting a lot of sell side guys coming and talking to you about individual stock ideas where there is a promise and there is a case to look at that company or invest in that company but the numbers are not visible right now. By the time you actually look at that company or dip your toe in the valuations, the situation would have completely changed. Would it be inappropriate chasing a story or taking risk when numbers are not visible?

Chakri Lokapriya: As the country evolves, new businesses evolve. A new business -- social needs, consumer needs -- creates other new businesses with new business models. Indians love going to the movies and love eating popcorn at the movie theatres. They did not have good facilities and companies like PVR which were born about 10, 15 years ago and had single digit PEs, were expanding across the country from one multiplex to another. 

Over time, as that promise became a reality they started delivering on numbers and expanding throughout the country. From a single digit PE companies today they are trading at about 35, 40 times and the earnings are still keeping up. Now, it is a different question how fast they can grow, will regulations change so from that perspective yes, as new needs emerge or if an entrepreneur is able to identify and then capitalise on it, it can create value. How are you analysing the narrative of global stock markets right now? Market capitalisation globally is at an all-time high. Of course, companies in US mainly FAANG are leading that and making the investors across the world jittery about where is it heading. So how are you analysing the numbers and the story for the US markets?


When you talk about the markets, there is always a macro component in the story to meet the big shift over the last decade, which is the recognition that interest rates were low not just because central banks wished them to be so, but because the global economy has changed in the long term becoming a lower inflation-lower growth economy, which is going to translate into lower interest rates. It also translates into higher PE ratios for any given level of growth because your opportunity costs have changed. 

Aswath Damodaran
: When people talk about mean reversion in PE ratios, look at PE ratio 20-30 years ago, they are almost asking markets to do the impossible as to price stock as if it was 1986 when T-bonds were at 2018 levels. And it’s not just T- bonds but the bond rates across the world — interest rates were at historic lows and they would stay there. 

That is a reality we have to recognise now and that’s one of the reasons I am always cautious about mean reversion for people expecting things to revert back to the way they used to be. 

And I think you can have a stock where the story for the stock shifts enough that the mean reversion doesn’t work anymore. It’s not like the stock is overvalued — it’s a new story driving the stock and it also depends on where in the lifecycle you are looking at companies. I think Indian companies historically have been more mature because you did not go to the market until you were a more mature company. So when you are looking at a more mature company, you are in chapter 33 of a book — you can’t rewrite the story, you can’t make up new stories, but look at an Ola you are in chapter 2 of the story. You do not know where the story is going to evolve. The younger the company, more critical the story becomes. The older the company becomes, the more the story gets established and the numbers start to matter. 

India’s weight in the MSCI EM index was say less than 2% earlier, now we are 8.5%. What stage of the cycle are Indian markets right now as compared to the developed markets? Are we catching up? How do you see the next 3-4 years? 

The way I see Indian markets, as I see big emerging markets, is always three steps forward and two steps back. You are never going to have this linear rise where you go from being successful. In fact, when you see markets year after year, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. I am not forecasting anything drastic but there will be disappointment down the road — that is the nature of the markets. I think in the long term, the trend line has to be up because India’s share of the global markets is not as large as it should be given how big it could be as a percentage of the global economy. So I think there is plenty of room to run but there will be disappointments along the way. 


The best example right now on narrative versus numbers is the way earnings in India have been over last three-four years -- the earnings cycle. One section of the market believed that earnings have been disappointing but if you take private banks, at least the broader market companies have started showing some improvement in earnings last two-three quarters. We are again sitting here looking at a new quarter ahead. How you analyse the earnings cycle so far versus what the narrative was couple of years back and versus the numbers which have been delivered so far?

S Naren: See some of the narratives becomes very interesting. Suppose oil were to come down and commodity prices came down and inflation comes down, then at that point of time what becomes interesting is that earnings come down. If inflation comes down, does it help earnings? It does not. In India inflation came down from 10% to less than 5%, did it help earnings? It actually reduced earnings. 

So, do you actually give a higher valuation to the earnings which come when inflation is much lower and oil is much lower and therefore all your macro indicators are much better? The answer is yes. Did it help the small and mid-cap sector, certainly. If you look at the period when oil came down and interest rates came down, small and mid-caps got rerated much more significantly. 

The market has its own way of looking at things and that is why the market did not obey earnings and that is why now putting a linear progression and saying now earnings is coming so market is to go up to the extent that earnings goes up is again not logical because now you are in a higher oil world, in a higher interest rate world and a higher current account deficit one from an Indian context. Earnings may come when the markets can get derated compared to where it was two years back because the macro conditions also play a role.


You cautioned investors pretty early on the midcap end of the market. Do you think a reasonable amount of correction has happened there or is there scope for further correction? The rally in midcaps started in 2013 end. By 2018, the data which I was looking at was at least three, four times over 50% of BSE 500. Now we are down to say 30, 40 times broader markets. What are your thoughts?

S Naren: As fund managers, we all want cycles to last for six months to a year and then you can turn bearish and bullish alternately. But markets need not obey and have short cycles. So, we look at other indicators. Last year, there was a huge inflow into smallcaps and midcaps. Now, we have to see whether the froth of inflows into small and midcaps have got reversed. I had two examples; one was metals and the second was pharma. In metals, in 2008 metal prices peaked and it bottomed in 2015. It looked like in one year pharma has corrected but there was one more year of correction. It is only in the last few months they have rallied. So, somewhere we want market peak to market bottom to be just a short period of time and that need not be.


Right now in India there is a cult of trying to find multi bagger stocks. People are value investing. The word is very actively used on most forums. How do you think prudent investors should try to understand the narrative from their point individually, as Professor Damodaran said not from the management side and still not lose sight of numbers, so that they can both walk hand in hand?

Chakri Lokapriya: As Professor Damodaran says and I am trying to recall what I learned, you start off your valuation with a simple narrative of how you see your company unfolding over time and then you keep your assumptions simple and see how it progresses and you tag on as the company delivers. I do not think that it is possible for you to discover a multi bagger. Yahoo did not see its end coming. They got offers multiple times over and finally got sold for a pittance. 

From that perspective, as managements deliver on numbers and they have the vision and expand their horizons, the narrative builds on and tags on to you and the numbers also show up. That is the way I would approach. I do not think I have the capability to find multi baggers on day one.


Aswath Damodaran: I agree entirely. The key in investing is to be incremental. If you go for the big win every single time, you are gambling and that is how people get into trouble. I think the notion that you can invest to get rich is the most dangerous notion in investing. You invest to preserve wealth and to grow wealth, you do not invest to get rich. If you get rich think of it as icing on the cake, you got lucky but if you go out and say I want to make a small amount of money into a large amount of money you can end up with no money at all. So, I think that is the reality investors have to face is be patient, be incremental and the multi baggers will fall in over time."

20,2018-07-23,Cipla,"New Delhi: The domestic stock market logged solid gains in early trade on Monday amid heavy buying in industry heavyweights such as ITC, ICICI Bank, Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank and Bharti Airtel.

During the week gone by, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty traded in a narrow range with a negative bias due to weak global cues, volatility in rupee and official data showing a surge in inflation.

Global cues were not clearly supporting the domestic market, as trade tensions between the US and other major economies continued to add fears on investor minds.

Analysts say while the market is likely to take some time before it chooses its direction, investors can look at stock-specific opportunities.

Based on recommendations of top brokerages, we picked up 10 stock ideas that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 14-21 sessions.


Analyst: Jay Anand Thakkar, CMT, Anand Rathi Shares

IDFC | BUY | Target Price: Rs 48.50 | Stop loss: Rs 42.80
IDFC has formed a falling wedge pattern, which is a bullish reversal pattern. It has been formed after a substantial fall; hence the probability of a reversal is quite high. The momentum indicator MACD has provided a buy crossover with a positive divergence. “We recommend buying this stock for the short term,” the analyst says.


Can Fin Homes | BUY | Target Price: Rs 350 | Stop loss: Rs 318
This stock has formed a falling wedge pattern which is a bullish reversal pattern. It has been formed after a substantial fall; hence the probability of a reversal is quite high. “The momentum indicator MACD has provided a buy crossover with a positive divergence, hence we recommend buying this stock for the short term,"" says Thakkar.


Analyst: Vaishali Parekh, Prabhudas Lilladher

IndusInd Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 2,000 | Stop loss: Rs 1,860
The stock has given a correction from the peak of Rs 1,990 to show signs of bottoming out at around Rs 1,880 levels and has currently indicated a positive candle pattern in the daily chart to signify strength for further upside movement in the coming days. The RSI also has shown a trend reversal from the oversold zone and has given a buy signal on this stock. ""With consistent decent volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 2,000 keeping a stop loss of Rs 1,860,"" says Parekh.


Exide Industries | Target Price: Rs 295 | Stop loss: Rs 250
This stock has more or less formed a higher bottom pattern in the daily chart and is indicating a positive candle to signify a positive bias and potential to rise further to scale till Rs 290-295 levels. It has maintained above the significant 34-WMA and 50-DMA moving averages to signify strength. Also, the RSI has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy recommendation on the stock.


Analyst: Gajendra Prabu, HDFC Securities

ITC | BUY | Target Price: Rs 300 | Stop loss: Rs 259
This stock has formed a bullish candle with a long lower shadow on the weekly chart, which indicates that the momentum is in favour of the bulls. The stock price has started a new rising leg post a throwback fall (which ended at Rs 266) and in smaller degree higher top and higher bottom formation is developing. Price is in the internals of “wave C”; so more upside move is expected in the coming days. In addition, the price is placed well above the key moving averages of 21-, 50- and 200-day EMAs; this could add strength to the bulls. “Traders may look to buy the stock at Friday's CMP and add in dips to Rs 266 for the upside target of Rs 300 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 259 (on a closing basis),” he said.


Manav Chopra, CMT, Indiabulls Ventures

SBI | BUY | Target Price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 250
After a recent decline, this stock has formed support near the 200-DMA and is making a higher bottom. The intraday charts indicate a bullish structure and break above the Rs 266 would confirm a fresh momentum. On the daily charts, the MACD has given a bullish crossover and has formed a hammer pattern on the weekly charts, which indicate limited downside.


Cipla | BUY | Target Price: Rs 680 | Stop loss: Rs 590
This stock has held support at Rs 600 and seen a strong reversal candlestick. There is breakout on volumes as the prices have exceeded its 20-day average and oscillators remain in the buy mode. “Expect the prices to exceed the weekly resistance zone of Rs 640 as the undertone trend remains bullish,” he said.


BEL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 115 | Stop loss: Rs 98
The stock after a series of positive divergence in the RSI has bounced from the oversold levels. There is an emergence of morning star candlestick pattern which hints for short-term bottom in place. “There will be a strong support at Rs 100 on the downside, which is likely to provide a cushion in case of decline. Maintain a buy-on-dips approach,” he said.


Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chartviewindia.in

DCB Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 176 | Stop loss: Rs 154
The recent correction brought down this stock towards its long-term support levels placed around Rs 155 from where it bounced back on multiple occasions in the past. In the last couple of trading sessions, this counter has rightly attracted buying support from the lower levels of Rs 157 as pointed out by long lower shadows. “Positional traders should initiate fresh longs with a stop below Rs 154 on the closing basis for a target of Rs 176,” he said.


Sterlite Technologies | BUY | Target Price: Rs 370 | Stop loss: Rs 297
After a multi-month correction from the high of Rs 415, this counter appears to have posted durable bottom around Rs 255 and resumed its upward move. Considering strong momentum and swift runup in the last couple of days, traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines in the zone of Rs 320–310. Sustaining above Rs 300, it can be expected to scale to much higher levels. “Positional traders are advised to buy for an initial target of Rs 370 with a stop below Rs 297 on a closing basis,” he said.


Analyst: Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA

Thermax | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,120 | Stop loss: Rs 1,005
The stock scaled above Rs 1,309 level at its high in 2018 and since then in has been seeing a corrective decline. Recently, it tested lows around Rs 990 and has attempted to form a potential base. There are strong possibilities of a technical pullback. The daily MACD stays in continuing buy mode. An engulfing bullish candle has emerged on the daily charts. On the weekly charts, a candle with a long lower shadow emerged. All this points to a potential bottom formation on the charts. “A buy signal has emerged over Stochastic on the weekly chart with a bullish divergence against the price,” he said.


GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare | BUY | Target Price: Rs 7,200 | Stop loss: Rs 6,150
For the whole of 2018, this stock has not made any meaningful headway and has been trading in a broad range. Currently, it has formed an ascending triangle pattern which is bullish. A positive crossover is seen on weekly MACD and it is now bullish while trading above its signal line. On the weekly chart, it remains in a consolidation pattern and is supported by the 50-week moving average. The weekly RSI is neutral, but it is seen marking higher bottoms and inch higher. The stock is seen sharply improving its relative momentum and is in leading quadrant compared against the Nifty Next50 index. A Golden Cross was also observed on the weekly charts as the 50-period moving average has crossed the 200-period moving average from below. Any move below Rs 5,950 would be negative for the stock.

25,2018-07-26,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Foreign capital rushing out of companies is well known. But there are some that have bucked the trend. 

Domestic money capped the downside in markets when foreigners were busy selling their holdings in the June quarter. Escalating trade tension and macroeconomic concerns forced foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to sell shares worth of more than Rs 20,000 crore during April-June whereas mutual fund houses pumped in more than Rs 35,000 crore during the same period.

Data available with Ace Equity showed that mutual fund houses increased their stake in close to 260 companies on the BSE500 index in the June quarter. Of these, 66 firms also managed to attract foreign money. Does this make a case to zero in on these companies?

Together, mutual fund (MF) houses as well as FIIs raised their stake in such firms across sectors, including auto ancillary, select public as well as private banks, cement, chemicals, graphite electrode majors, IT, pharma and power.

Considering the robust outlook for graphite electrode, both MFs and FIIs increased their holdings in Graphite India and HEG Ltd. 

Management of Graphite India in its annual report talked about higher demand for graphite electrode in 2017, which is expected to sustain and grow, going forward. Jefferies maintained ‘Buy’ on the company with a target price of Rs 1,275.

There were a lot of concerns over China adding graphite electrode (GE) capacities that will lead to decline in GE realisations. However, Jefferies in a report said management of HEG does not see competition coming from Chinese players.

Among largecaps, mutual funds increased their holdings in Reliance Industries to 3.28 per cent in the June quarter against 2.80 per cent in the March quarter. FIIs too hiked their exposure to 24.53 per cent, from 24.46 per cent, during the same period. Shares of the company rallied 9 per cent in April-June. 



Global brokerages recently maintained their positive stance on the oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance after the company’s 41st annual general meeting. 

Morgan Stanley believes that RIL’s focus to capitalise on last six years’ investments should help in raising return on equity. It also estimated that the company’s return on capital employed (RoCE) can rise 400 basis points to 12.40 per cent by FY20. The brokerage house maintained ‘Overweight’ on RIL with a target price of Rs 1,241.

Mahindra & Mahindra, Sun Pharmaceuticals and Oil India stood among other largecaps where fund houses and FIIs upped their stake during the quarter gone by.

Hiren Ved of Alchemy Capital Management in an interaction with ETNow said, “Rural demand is picking up and we will continue to see a lot of money and credit being pumped through the bottom of the pyramid, which will lead to very good demand trends for the consumer companies.” 

He further said pharma still has headwinds, but can give good opportunity in the next six months. 

In the pharmaceutical space, Cadila Healthcare, Cipla and Pfizer also emerged as their favourite during the quarter.

On a sectoral basis, Ambuja Cements, Heidelberg Cement, Orient Cement and Star Cement stood out among cement players where MFs and FIIs showed interest. Axis Bank and Canara Bank also managed to attract institutional investors during April-June period.

Canara Bank on July 25 posted an 11.88 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 281.49 crore for the quarter ended June against Rs 251.60 crore in the same quarter last year. Asset quality of the lender also improved. The lender suffered a net loss of Rs 4,859.77 crore in the sequential quarter ended March 2018.

Midcap as well as smallcap IT firms, including Larsen & Toubro Infotech, Mphasis, NIIT Technologies, Sonata Software and Zensar Technologies, attracted domestic as well as foreign inflows.

NIIT Technologies recently reported a 67.4 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 85.8 crore for the three months to June, driven by growth across segments like banking and financial services (BFS) and insurance. It had registered a net profit of Rs 51.3 crore in the year-ago period.

The company reported a better than expected Q1 on revenue growth and order intake though margin execution was a bit lower than our expectations, according to ICICIdirect. The brokerage house has ‘Add’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,121.

Plastic product player Nilkamal too was on their buying list during the quarter. FIIs took their stake to 3.61 per cent from 3.45 per cent while MFs increased their holding to 12.33 per cent from 11.10 per cent.

Carborundum Universal, Monsanto, Nalco, Jamna Auto, Minda Corp, Exide Industries, VST Industries, Oberoi Realty, L&T Technology Services, Manappuram Finance, Godrej Consumer, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, ICIC Prudential Life Insurance Company, JSW Steel, Tata Metaliks, Himachal Futuristic Communications and TVS Srichakra were other players in which foreign institutional investors as well as mutual funds upped their stake in the June quarter.

Edelweiss Securities is bullish on L&T Technology Services (LTTS). The brokerage house said LTTS yet again posted a strong performance with Q1 FY19 USD revenue growing 4 per cent QoQ (beating Street’s estimate of 2.9%) and EBITDA margin expanding 150bps QoQ to 17 per cent. Because of the company’s high-growth potential, Edelweiss retained ‘Buy’ on LTTS with a target price of Rs 1,725."

3,2018-08-04,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: The health ministry may soon ban over 300 fixed-dose combination (FDC) medicines, accepting recommendations of a sub-committee of India’s apex drug advisory body. The move, which is expected to impact top MNCs such as Abbott as well as domestic players such as Piramal, Macleods, Cipla and Lupin among others, could be challenged in the courts once again.

If the initial draft ban notification that ET has viewed are implemented, the ban would cover popular cough syrups, pain killers and flu medicines like Phensedyl, Saridon and D’Cold Total. The draft lists out 343 FDCs that the ministry plans to ban manufacture, sale and distribution of and has been prepared based on recommendations of the Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB).

The Supreme Court had last year asked the DTAB to recommend to the health ministry which FDCs should be regulated or restricted or banned outright along with reasons for doing so. This followed an extended legal battle between the government and drug companies over the FDC ban issue.

The final notification is expected in the coming week, said officials in the know. “The health ministry will duly ban 343 FDCs,” confirmed one official.

However another senior health ministry official cautioned that the draft will get amended before the final version is presented. “The matter is still under examination,” he said.

FDCs are cocktail drugs that consist of two or more therapeutic ingredients packed in a fixed dose. The FDCs in this draft include combinations like paracetamol + phenylephrine + caffeine, chlorpheniramine maleate + codeine syrup and paracetamol + propyphenazone + caffeine. The FDCs that could be banned account for about two per cent of India’s over Rs 1 lakh crore drug market, according to market research firm AIOCD PharmaTrac.



The annual sales value of these medicines has shrunk from nearly Rs 3,000 crore in 2016 to Rs 2,183 crore now.


Analysts See Limited Impact of Ban
Makers of these drugs have either changed the compositions of their FDCs or discontinued production of some brands that fell into the ‘banned’ category to focus on other products in their portfolio.

Some analysts believe that the impact of the ban will be limited. “Apart from a couple of big brands like Phensedyl, most of the other brands are very small and the ban will have marginal impact.

Companies knew that this was coming and so they have launched variants that would be compliant with regulations and are hoping that they will be able to switch a significant number of their patients to these variants in case the ban is reinstated,” said Abhishek Sharma, Pharma Analyst at IIFL.

One official of a pharmaceutical company added that the industry would wait for the final decision before taking a call on the next steps.

In certain cases where companies may have a line of products under the same brand and the ban would impact only one, they would focus on building the other products in that line, said the person, also requesting anonymity.

The proposed ban follows a longdrawn court battle between the government and hundreds of pharmaceutical companies since 2016 over the health ministry’s decision to ban 349 such drug combinations for allegedly being “unsafe” and “irrational”.

The banned combinations belonged to several therapeutic areas like cough and cold syrups, respiratory formulations and even topical dermatological medicines. Pfizer, Glenmark, Procter & Gamble, Abbott, Sanofi, Wockhardt, Cipla, Lupin and Dr Reddy’s were among the companies that opposed the ban in 2016. The Delhi High Court, which had heard a chunk of the petitions against the move, ruled in favour of the industry and had said the government had not gone through the statutory bodies that are to take a call on such matters. The government appealed the matter in the Supreme Court, which in turn asked the sub-committee of the DTAB to submit its recommendations to the government.

Following consultations with over 400 pharmaceutical companies and various other industry bodies and patient groups, the sub-committee recommended that 343 of the 349 FDCs should be banned, said a senior government official requesting anonymity.

According to documents viewed by ET, the sub-committee had found that “most” of the companies appealing the ban had not generated safety and efficacy data of their own for their FDCs.

The published literature they provided to justify the FDCs was “not relevant” and relied on a few “biased” studies, the sub-committee is learned to have stated."

Iran Sanction Announcement
The White House would make an announcement on Monday detailing the reimposition of sanctions on Iran that Trump has ordered for this week. In a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency that has lost half its value since April due to fears about US sanctions likely to be imposed this week, Iran will ease foreign exchange rules, state TV reported on Sunday. Starting this week, Washington will re-impose sanctions on Iran’s purchases of US. dollars, trade in gold and precious metals and dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software.


China's Media Directly Attacks Trump
China’s state media on Monday lashed out at the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump in an unusually direct attack, accusing him of “starring in his own carefully orchestrated street fighter-style deceitful drama”. US President Donald Trump had tweeted on Saturday that his strategy of placing steep tariffs on imports of goods from China is “working far better than anyone ever anticipated,” and that Beijing was talking to the United States about trade.

19,2018-08-09,Cipla,"The launch pipelines for Indian companies is quite strong and going ahead that will help them deliver better numbers in the US, Amey Chalke, pharma analyst, 
  
  
  HDFC Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What is the call on Cipla and Lupin?
First the call on Cipla. The numbers were largely in line with our estimates. However, there was a slight miss on the margin front. Since this is a strong quarter for Cipla, I was expecting higher margins. On the management commentary, they have been hopeful that the US trajectory going ahead will remain bullish. However, everything is building in the numbers because we are expecting around 14% US top line growth over next two years.

The earnings growth is in the range of 30% to 32% for two years. We are still getting the FY20 EPS of at around 22-23 PE multiple which is significantly high. That is the key reason why we are neutral. 

As for Lupin, the quarterly performance was very disappointing. However, there is a valuation support for the stock. Two key inspections are expected to happen over next two to three months. The stock should not fall more than 5% to 10% from here.


What is the challenge for largecap pharma? In IT, the valuation had got crushed in the downturn. But that may not be the case for pharma. Most of the forward-looking estimates are still indicating that pharma PE multiples are between 15 and 20 and that is not exactly cheap for a business where there is struggle and challenge.
I understand that but a company like Lupin is on a favourable base in terms of earnings. But in case of Cipla, they are on normal base at this point of time. If we are assuming 30% growth on normal base, that is, it would be a difficult task compared to 30% growth on favourable base which is halved from last year.


What do you make of Mylan cutting guidance? The fact that the industry leader and innovator is showing continued pricing pressure in the US, what does that mean for Indian generic makers?
There are mixed signals coming in from many companies in the US. Some companies say the pricing pressure is elevating but some companies say it is back to normal. That is a bone of contention at this point of time. The launch pipelines for Indian companies is quite strong and going ahead that will help them to deliver better numbers in the US."

21,2018-08-09,Cipla,"Sharekhan has a buy call on Cipla with a target price of Rs 720.

The current market price of Cipla is Rs 621.15.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Cipla price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by Sharekhan:

Numbers below expectation: For Q1FY2019, Cipla reported 11.7 per cent y-o-y growth in its revenue to Rs. 3,939 crore, mainly impacted by continued pricing pressure (low double digit), slow ramp of gDacogen and $5million sales loss due to rationalisation of low-margin SKUs in the U.S. business. Operating profit for the quarter grew by 12.4 per cent y-o-y to Rs. 726.4 crore and operating profit margin improved by mere 10 BPS to 18.4 per cent (impacted about 40 bps mainly due to China API supply issues and increase in crude oil prices). Adjusted profit grew by 26.6 per cent y-o-y to Rs. 389.1 crore. Adjustment for the quarter includes Rs. 57.6 crore (net tax) income from divestment. Further, impact of new product launches and two limited competition launches will be visible in the coming quarters, along with strong India business (as Q2 and Q3 are strong quarters).


Stable outlook: Management maintains guidance of double-digit sales growth despite challenging environment because of new product launches planned for FY2019E and FY2020E (one niche product every quarter). During Q1FY2019, the company launched two key differentiated products, namely Isoproterenol HCI Injection and Testosterone Cypionate Injection and AG of Aloxi in the U.S., impact of which shall be visible from Q2FY2019E. Moreover, recent launch of Diclofenac sodium topical gel will help ramp up the U.S. business. Cipla has an exhaustive pipeline of inhalers and complex generics, which has a huge market size. These opportunities will give an escalated growth trend to the company’s revenue and will boost the topline in the long run. Moreover, management has indicated that there is scope for margin expansion despite commencement of Advair trial expense. Cipla has also cleared all regulatory hurdles by receiving Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) for key plants at Goa, Indore and InvaGen.


Maintain Buy with upward revision of PT to Rs. 720: Taking cues from the post result call (increased tax rate guidance to 28 per cent vs. earlier 22-23 per cent), we have revised our earnings estimates downwards by 6.5 per cent each for FY2019E and FY2020E. We have also introduced FY2021E earnings. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with upward revision of the price target (PT) to Rs. 720 (valuing it at 18x its average earnings of FY2020E and FY2021E)."
22,2018-08-09,Cipla,"Umang Vohra, Global CEO and Kedar Upadhye, Global CFO of Cipla, discuss the first quarter results and the future plans with ET Now.
  
  
  Edited excerpts: 


The quarter seems to be marginally weak as far as US sales are concerned, but overall on YoY basis it is looking strong. What is your view?

Umang Vohra: Our numbers are actually higher than our internal estimates. We are satisfied with the growth numbers. There has been strong momentum across most of our markets. And of course, there was a base effect in India vis-à-vis last year and that is why the growth looks a lot higher. Otherwise, we had to deal with very tough environment. We have had commodity price increases. We are seeing volatility in foreign exchange rates. There are picing pressures across the world. So, it has been a tough, very challenging environment. We are happy with our numbers and overall it is satisfying.


 Despite the margin miss that we have seen at gross level, EBITDA miss is not that high.which means that you are focussing quite extensively on cost control.

Kedar Upadhye: In this quarter, the mix of geographies and products was healthy. There was some benefit of currency and there were some impact of the cost inflation because of Chinese sourcing, commodities and oil price hike. That is how it got balanced out. But our controls on the expenditure remained in this quarter and that directionally will continue in the balance of the year as well. 

As a result of all of that, the EBITDA margin was about 18.4 percentage, a 300 bps improvement on Q4 results. We are happy we are doing a little bit better. Currency also came to little bit of help. But going forward, as we continue to scale up the contribution from our limited competition launches in US, you could see margins improving further.


Let us talk about the road ahead. Can you maintain the guidance of the high margin approval that has already been provided? Do you stand by what you have provided for per quarter?

Kedar Upadhye: That is what has been happening in the last few quarters as well. In fact, a few days back, we spoke about our approval for a very nice product in US and that will continue in the balance quarters as well. Directionally we are focussing on that. Launches are important and getting market share and scaling up the revenues is also equally important so we are focussing on both these priorities for the US market.


 Do you expect Cipla to be in a sweet spot as you may emerge as a beneficiary of the changing environment in the United States? There is a low base effect at play, a solid pipeline is also expected to benefit from quicker review cycle. A lot of important drug patents are also coming to a close.

Umang Vohra: We would like to believe we are a lot more advantage compared to some of the other players. But I have to say that US markets are going to be a lot more competitive than we used to see it about two to three years back. 

But yes, compared to others, we have a lot more advantages. The base is not high and at the same time, the number of approvals come relatively fast. It is more predictable and yes we have gained. 

What is also working for Cipla is the diversity of our global footprint. In India and South Africa we have very strong businesses. We almost call both South Africa and India our home markets and in the emerging side of the world we are well diversified. This diversity of businesses is probably playing to our strengths right now. But we are very cautious because the pricing environment around the world is very difficult right now and we are doing our best.

We hope to do better in the quarters ahead.


Is the US pricing pressure bottoming out?
Kedar Upadhye: We will have to watch out. Our experience is that the pricing pressure works product by product. The products in which you have higher number of players, complexity is low. Typically, there the pricing pressure is the highest. If you have some hypothesis of limited competition, be it some intellectual property position, be it some litigation advantage, be it some control over API or difficult to manufacture process, there the pricing pressure is relatively lower. 

In my view, pricing pressure is generally at a portfolio level. It goes more product by product but yes, we are seeing early signs of things stabilising but we will have to still watch out for it.


As far as the guidance goes, reiterating $1 billion revenue guidance for India formulations would mean 12 to 14% growth for the year. Do you stand by that?

Umang Vohra: No. Let me start with India first because our business will respond to that. India as a country is going to continue to show volume growth. We have a large population, it is underpenetrated in healthcare and so we are looking at strong volume growth across India. 

There are lots of patients who are now getting access to healthcare because they either get covered under the government insurance schemes Ayushman Bharat or they get covered in several other schemes that they have enrolled in. Affordability has gone up and so healthcare will get a major boost. 

What we are trying to do in India is to create a system where we look at ourselves as a part of the solution to a patient, not just a seller of pills. Partnering with several of the multinational companies to bring their products to India is one end of covering the pill spectrum but we are also looking at what we can to do around shaping the entire oncology universe, about providing training to care givers, about the entire diabetes franchise and how we can create more awareness for diabetes in teir-3 and tier-4 cities. 

At the same time, many people with asthma are not aware of it and do not take the right treatment. They do not get themselves measured and diagnosed. We are trying to create a lot of things around the ecosystem. We are not doing it by ourselves, we are going to partner but that is what we are excited about in the India story."

23,2018-08-10,Cipla,"Mumbai: Private equity firm True North Capital is in advanced talks with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals to buy up to a fifth of the active pharmaceuticals ingredient (API) division of the Mumbai drugmaker for Rs 1,200-1,500 crore, underscoring the allure of India’s burgeoning API business for global funds.

If successful, the transaction will help the Glen Saldhana-controlled company take a bigger step in the API business through rapid expansion and acquisitions, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told ET.

Glenmark, which has been fighting larger rivals Sun Phama, Dr Reddy’s, Lupin and Cipla to get into the elite league in the Indian pharma space, decided to hive off the consumer care and API businesses in May and raise funds for expansion.

The company has mandated Avendus Capital to run a formal process to find a buyer.

The process has seen interest from larger private-equity rivals, including Carlyle Group and Advent International, but True North clearly has an edge, said one of the sources cited above.

“The talks are at the penultimate round. We are still a few weeks away from a binding offer,” said one of the sources.

True North declined to comment, while an e-mail sent to Glenmark did not elicit any response.

True North, previously known as the India Value Fund, is one of the oldest and most aggressive investors in the Indian healthcare space.

The firm manages $3 billion and is seeking to raise another $1 billion in an India-specific fund, its sixth since inception.

“Large pharma companies are looking at alternative routes to monetise their business as they keep looking at ways to grow,” said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital.

Founded in 1977 by Gracias Saldanha as a generic drug and active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer, Glenmark is the 13th largest drugmaker in India and dominates in the dermatology (share of 9.2 per cent), respiratory (4.75 per cent) and cardiology (4.26 per cent) markets.

Glenmark’s API division manufactures and supplies more than 190 APIs to customers worldwide.

Its API business spans more than 80 countries, including regulated markets of the US, Canada, Europe and Japan. Glenmark, which entered into the API business in 2003, has manufacturing facilities in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The API business grew 8.5 per cent in FY18 to Rs 878 crore from Rs 809 crore in FY17.

The company has reported a consolidated net profit for FY 18 at Rs 803.87 crore. It stood at Rs 1,108.75 crore in 2016-17. Revenues stood at Rs 9,103.07 crore for the year, slightly lower than Rs 9,185.68 crore in FY17.

The company has a net debt of Rs 4,700 crore and according to analysts, the debt reduction would be the key to the company. “Net debt reduction in another key trigger for the stock,” JP Morgan analysts Neha Manpuria, Sahil Dhingra and Kevyan Kadakia wrote in a note on July 18.

“We like Glenmark’s long-term business potential with a mix of complex generics and innovative pipeline opportunities, strong EM and India business. However, the recent disappointment on earnings and net debt reduction will increase focus on the company’s ability to show sustained base business improvement, margin expansion and cash flow generation. Delays in key approvals in the US are a downside risk to our earnings, but news flow on GNP’s innovation R&D pipeline could be a positive catalyst, in our view.”

With Beijing clamping down on polluting industries, India plans to step up API manufacturing. API prices in India have gone up substantially after China’s moves."

The US stocks declined on Friday as a deepening economic crisis in Turkey dragged on bank shares and triggered a move out of riskier assets.

A slump in the Turkish lira worsened after US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from the country. Investors fled to safe-haven assets, pushing the dollar higher and weighing on US bond yields.

Market participants will be eyeing the macro data of retail inflation for July scheduled to be announced post market hours.

There will be some support with report that foreign investors have pumped in over Rs 8,500 crore into the Indian capital markets in the last eight trading sessions on improvement in crude oil prices, stabilising rupee and better corporate earnings.

38,2018-08-14,Cipla,"A falling rupee may not spell good tidings for the Indian economy, but it can benefit exporters that may fetch you decent returns on Dalal Street. 

The local currency has been in a hole for some time now as it went past the 70-mark for the first time ever on Tuesday. 

A weakness in the rupee could support top line of domestic pharma players with a substantial bottom line from exports. However, they have not shown any traction so far this year. 

Information technology firms, which have huge overseas clients, can be the other biggest beneficiary from a tumbling rupee. The sector has already outpaced broader market in 2018. 

On Tuesday, the Nifty pharma index was up 3 per cent while the Nifty IT index rose 1 per cent even as NSE benchmark notched up around 70 points.

The Nifty IT index has rallied nearly 30 per cent so far this calendar whereas the rupee tumbled 10 per cent on a year-to-date basis till August 13. The Nifty Pharma index slipped over 4 per cent during the same period. 

From investing point of view, Chakri Lokapriya, CIO and MD, TCG AMC, told ETNow, “IT and exporters will continue to do well both for fundamental reasons and the rupee rate. Currency analysts have forecast rupee at Rs 70 plus over the coming year or so... IT is still not an overheated trade. There are still lots of money to be made out there and so are the other export-related sectors.”

The key trigger for the rupee’s fall is coming from the selloff in Turkish lira, which in turn, contributed to the overall emerging market weakness. 

Saurabh Mukherjea, founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, recently said, “I have been saying for the past 8 months that buying leading IT services, pharma and chemical exporters makes sense as does unearthing smaller companies who have credible export franchises.”

The Nifty IT index was trading up by over 1 per cent today while the Nifty Pharma was marginally in the red at around 11.30 am.

For investors, Sharekhan is bullish on Cadila Healthcare with a target price of Rs 450 in the pharma space. Nirmal Bang is positive on Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 764. 

Elara Capital recommended IPCA Labs with a target price of Rs 860. It's also bullish on NIIT with a target price of Rs 138. 

“NIIT has transformed its revenue profile from an India-centric, retail-oriented IT training business to an exports-oriented, asset-light B2B training outsourcing business over FY10-18,” Elara said in a report.

On a year-to-date basis, IT majors including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies, surged 51 per cent, 36 per cent and 11.55 per cent, respectively, till August 13. Similarly, Mindtree and KPIT zoomed 62 per cent and 59 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

According to Phillip Capital, risk aversion and rising volatility led to the market moving towards tried-and-tested defensive plays such as TCS, Infosys, HUL, HDFC, and Asian Paints. This is also a typical election-year phenomenon -- seen in the last two elections -- given the comfort for large-cap defensive plays.

On the other hand, Biocon, Cipla and Divi’s Labs advanced 2-7 per cent YTD, whereas Cadila Healthcare, Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy’s Labs came off by up to 18 per cent in the pharma space.

Sanjeev Prasad, Senior Executive Director and co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities, told ET Now: “You have to look at every stock, not just depend on some programmed trade. You have to look at everything on the bottom and based on that see whether the price value creation makes sense or not. This holds across every sector, every stock. I am not running a programme which says if macro is bad, just go and buy some IT and pharma; macro is good, buy corporate banks or metal and mining stocks.”"

Cadila Healthcare (down 4.01 per cent) remained the only stock in the pharma index that suffered losses despite reporting better numbers for the June quarter.

Cadila on Monday reported over three-fold jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 460.5 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 on account of robust sales, PTI reported. 

Snapping the losses of two consecutive sessions, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty closed higher on Tuesday owing to gains led by bank, energy, metal and FMCG stocks.

Buying was observed in most sectors today as positive inflation numbers influenced the sentiment. The retail inflation fell to a 9-month low of 4.17 per cent in July on declining vegetable prices. 

After hitting a four-year high in June, the WPI inflation has ebbed a little to 5.09 per cent in the month of July, official data released today showed. 

But, the unabating fall of Indian rupee remains an overhang. The local currency, in line with the currencies of other emerging markets, has been in a hole for some time now as it went past the 70-mark for the first time ever on Tuesday. 

Sensex climbed 207 points, or 0.55 per cent, closing the day at 37,852, with 18 stocks advancing and 13 declining.

45,2018-08-18,Cipla,"Turkey’s financial issues and a falling rupee back home did create a scare for equities, but benchmarks Sensex and Nifty stood firm and ended the truncated week in the green. The NSE index, in fact, summoned courage to hit off a new record in the end.

For the whole week, the 30-share Sensex notched up 79 points, or 0.21 per cent, closing at 37,948. As for the Nifty, the record high came at 11,471, up 41.25 points, or 0.35 per cent, against a close of 11,430 on August 10.

Overall, fortunes seesawed the whole week. The beginning was on a downbeat note, with Fitch Ratings’ latest report that its outlook on the Indian banking sector is likely to remain negative until the banks address their weak core capital positions against mounting bad loans and poor financial performance. 

In between, India’s trade deficit soared to a near five-year high of $18 billion. But it was the final day of trade that helped markets regain composure and settle the week in positive territory.

But there are top stocks and sectors that were up and running the whole week. A look.


@fresh all-time high: More than 25 stocks on the BSE 500 index scaled their fresh all-time high during the week gone by. Some of the stocks on the list included Varun Beverages, Jubilant FoodWorks, 3M India, Havells India, Berger Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Exide Industries, Bata India, Graphite India, Page Industries and Tata Consultancy Services.


Nifty top gainer: Sun Pharma played to the gallery, gaining the most, on the Nifty50 index. The scrip jumped 12.55 per cent to Rs 623.50 on August 17, from Rs 554 on August 10. The drug major got traction on better-than-expected results for the first quarter to June on the back of stronger sales in the US. It posted consolidated net profit of Rs 982.51 crore for Q1 FY19 against net loss of Rs 424.92 crore for Q1 FY18. In a separate development, the company received approval for CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) 0.09 per cent, from the USFDA. CEQUA is indicated for treatment of patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye).


Booster dose: Most pharma stocks advanced on the back of a weak rupee. The local currency plunged more than 9 per cent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis and around 2 per cent in August. A weak rupee boosts revenue of pharma firms in rupee terms as the sector derives a major share of revenue from exports. Besides Sun Pharma, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Cipla advanced up to 8 per cent last week.


Rupee impact: Oil marketing companies (OMCs) came under pressure as the rupee went below 70 per dollar for the first time. Loss in the rupee against the dollar makes oil imports costlier for these companies. The sharp decline in the currency can be attributed to a weak external position with respect to current account deficit as well as an unstable political and currency environment in Turkey. HPCL, IOC and BPCL declined 4.09 per cent, 5.98 per cent and 6.50 per cent, respectively, during August 10-17.


Top gainers of BSE 500: With a rally of 47 per cent, Housing Development & Infrastructure stood out in the crowd. It was the top gainer on the BSE 500 index for the week ended August 17. It was followed by Apollo Hospitals (up 25 per cent), Kwality (21 per cent), United Breweries (15 per cent) and Rain Industries (13 per cent).


Top losers of BSE 500: Reliance Naval (down 17 per cent), Sobha (down 12 per cent), IL&FS Transportation Networks (down 11 per cent), Chennai Petroleum Corporation (down 10.76 per cent) and Allahabad Bank (down 10 per cent) ended up being top losers of the index during the week gone by.


Order boost: Shares of Ion Exchange (India) hit upper circuit of 5 per cent on Friday after the company signed up a job contract from a Vedanta unit. The company informed bourses that it has signed a contract for engineering, procurement, supply and construction of water treatment plant worth of Rs 438.84 crore from Cairn Oil & Gas, a division of Vedanta Ltd.


Apollo Hospitals: The stock spurted over 25 per cent after the healthcare company posted 71.02 per cent increase in its standalone PAT at Rs 60.2 crore for the first quarter ended June. Revenues grew by 16 per cent to Rs 1,910.4 crore for the first quarter from Rs 1,650.4 crore in the same period a year ago."

52,2018-08-24,Cipla,"In pharma, the rally is spreading to midcaps and Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL, would prefer to be stock specific in this sector. Sofat tells ET Now he is 
  
  
  bullish on Swaraj Engine. Edited excerpts:

There was a 14% upmove in the Sun Pharma stock in the month gone by. Today, they have got an USFDA nod for two drugs with a size of about $180 million. Is there still value on the table for not just Sun Pharma but for any other pharmaceutical names as well? The rally is spreading its wings in midcap pharma names like Divi’s Labs which saw a big move in the previous two days?
We would be stock specific in the pharmaceutical sector. The undercurrent of weakness in the generic market in US is still there. Within the sector, we would prefer something like Aurobindo Pharma which is trading at around PE multiple of around 12.5 which has a large pipeline of ANDA approvals. 

With regards to Sun, even after one takes into consideration the upside from Halol and the positive news flow, we do feel that going forward, the margin of improvement is going to be a key pressure point for the company, considering that their entering into more specialty segment will entail a lot of investments.

As of now, we are more bullish on companies like Aurobindo, Cipla and Torrent rather than looking at companies like Sun, Lupin etc.


DRL has got necessary approvals for Srikakulam plant. Yesterday they got an EIR.
In case of DRL, our view is similar to the case of Sun Pharma. We do not believe that the issues which the sector is going through are completely done with. Right now, we would be focussing more on companies like Cipla as well as Aurobindo, rather than looking at stocks like DRL. 

We already saw that they had lot of pressure earlier from the Russian market and we have seen a lot of FDA issues getting sorted. Right now, we would like to maintain a cautious stance on this particular company. 

With regards to Nestle, our view is that the valuations may be a bit higher but it is still not as high as something like HUL which is currently trading at close to around 52 times. Nestle is trading at around 46 times FY20. In Maggi, they have stabilised their market share at close to around 60%. Before the fiasco happened, their market share was close to 70%. Even segments like pasta, they are at number one. 

Overall, having that leadership approach, will ensure that the stock will continue to be at a premium valuation and considering earnings growth of around 25% going forward, valuation will sustain with some upside of close to around 15% from current levels.


What are you recommending when it comes to IT majors in lieu of the currency position?
We are right now quite bullish on Tech Mahindra, considering that we see going forward a rebound happening in the telecom space. because of new investment happening on 5G as well as among their key clients because of consolidation, some work could start after two-three quarters. On the enterprise side as well, the growth is quite decent. Overall, with the double digit kind of a growth and earnings growth of close to around 16%, Tech Mahindra looks quite interesting to us.

Even on the larger cap side, Infosys is trading at a discount to TCS. Right now, that discount is close to around 30%. I think that gap can reduce going forward. 

There are tailwinds in IT sector. In addition, the improvement that we are seeing in the BFSI space in US is likely to lead to further upside in the sector. We will continue to be overweight on the sector going forward as well.


One midcap idea from you?
One mid to smallcap idea that one can look at is Swaraj Engine which is a supplier of engines to M&M. Currently the market share is close to around 30% and going forward, we expect considering that rural economy is doing well and 90% of the business comes to Swaraj Engines. 

Going forward, growth number is going to be pretty robust and PAT growth close to around 25%. In terms of valuations, the stock is quite attractive at around 16.5 PE considering that the ROE is beyond 30%. From a risk-reward perspective, considering that it is a zero-debt company with a significantly high dividend payout, that is one stock that one can look at for a minimum 20% upside in next one year."

60,2018-08-30,Cipla,"ET Intelligence group: Lupin, the country’s third-largest pharma company, is exiting the Nifty50, months after Aurobindo Pharma was excluded from the index.

While Lupin’s investors may not be happy about the development, it may just be the indication which potential investors in Lupin have been waiting for.

The exit was imminent, given the company’s under performance in recent years. Most of the headwinds faced by the company have, however, been sectoral in nature. Pricing pressure in its key markets of US and Japan, delay in approvals of key products, the US FDA’s clamp down on two key plants, and intensifying competition ensured that the stock lost 40 per cent of its value over the last two years.

Lupin has gained over 50 per cent in absolute terms since its inclusion in the Nifty in September 2012.



However, the jury is still out on whether the worst is over for the company. But there are factors pointing to an improved performance in the latter half of this fiscal. The management, in the latest quarterly earnings call, indicated a subdued performance in the current quarter, but an improved performance in the second half of this fiscal, aided by the launch of key products and ramping up in specialty business.

The company has optimised its R&D expenditure to about 10 per cent of revenues. While warning letters to company’s plants in Goa and Indore remain a concern, the management is hopeful of resolving the issues with the USFDA by the end of the fiscal. The near-term underperformance provides good opportunity for long-term investors to accumulate the stock of the generics company. It is currently trading at 29 times its estimated earnings of FY19 – lower than the valuations of Sun Pharma and in line with those of Cipla and DRL.

Incidentally, stocks such as Ranbaxy Labs and Aurobindo Pharma improved their performance on the bourses after their exit from the Nifty. Some interpret this as an indication that a Nifty exit happens at the fag-end of the company’s under-performance."

62,2018-08-31,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities opened on a volatile note, tracking weak Asian cues in the wake of renewed trade war jitters.

Asian stocks declined after media reports suggested that Trump administration might impose another set of tariffs on Chinese goods. 

Bloomberg reported, quoting people familiar with the matter, that Trump said he was ready to impose more tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China as soon as the public comment period on the plan ends next week.

Investors risk appetite was subdued ahead of Q1 GDP number today.

After hitting its fresh all-time low of 71-mark against dollar in opening trade, the local currency was trading 17 paise down at 70.91 in early trade.

Month-end dollar demand from importers and rising crude oil prices in the international market during the last couple of sessions mainly pressurised the local currency.

0,2018-09-03,Cipla,"Automobile and pharmaceutical companies have emerged as big beneficiaries of the commerce ministry's export incentive scheme 'MEIS' as they have received the major portion of the disbursals.

Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), the government provides duty benefits at different rates depending on product and country.

Rewards under the scheme are payable as percentage of realised free-on-board value and MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties including the basic customs duty.

The top 10 companies that have obtained maximum disbursals during 2017-18 under the scheme includes JSW Steel (Rs 301.5 crore), Ford India (Rs 272.8 crore), Bajaj Auto (Rs 246.5 crore), Dr Reddys Lab (Rs 240.6 crore), Aurobindo Pharma (Rs 211.3 crore), Mylan lab (Rs 192.9 crore), Hyundai Motor India (Rs 189.3 crore), Vedanta Ltd (Rs 180 crore), Lupin Ltd (Rs 155 crore), and Nissan Motor India (Rs 150 crore).

The other firms which have gained from the scheme include Tata Motors, Hindalco Industries, Hetero Labs, Maruti Suzuki India, Cipla Ltd, Reliance Industries, General Motors India and Shahi Exports.

Similarly in 2016-17 also, companies from automobile and pharmaceutical sectors topped the chart in getting the maximum benefit under the MEIS.

In 2017-18, the ministry disbursed about Rs 31,000 crore to exporters under the scheme, while it was over Rs 23,000 crore in the previous fiscal.

Going ahead, the government may have to change the scheme as it was challenged by the US in the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement system.

The US had alleged that such incentive schemes were harming American companies and they are not in compliance with the global trade rules.

Government officials have earlier stated that they may look at reviewing the existing export incentive schemes to ensure that they comply with the WTO norms.

The US had alleged that thousands of Indian companies are receiving benefits totalling over USD 7 billion annually under various export promotion programmes."

7,2018-09-07,Cipla,"MUMBAI/HYDERABAD: Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma on Thursday announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the commercial operations and three manufacturing facilities in the US from Sandoz, a Novartis generics division, for $900 million. The deal makes Aurobindo Pharma the secondlargest generic player in the US by number of prescriptions, ahead of other generics drug makers like Mylan, Lupin and Taro (subsidiary of Sun Pharma).

The acquisition, the largest outbound pharma deal by an Indian company ever, includes Sandoz’s dermatology business and a portfolio of oral solid products and has been done on an all-cash basis, without taking in any cash or debt from the acquired business, according to an exchange filing by the company. The deal will be financed through debt.

The acquired business has been carved out by the management of Sandoz for divestment. The portfolio generated $1.2 billion in sales in December 2017 and $600 million in the first half of 2018. Aurobindo is buying the business valuing it at 4 times its FY18 EBITDA multiple, with the expectation of being EPSaccretive from the first full year of ownership.

The deal will give Aurobindo access to authorised generics and in-licensing products, branded dermatology products, three manufacturing facilities at Hicksville - NY (Derma) Melville - NY(Derma) Wilson- NC (OSD), and 100 per cent shareholding in Eon Labs, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sandoz. Additionally it will “add approximately 300 products, including projects in development, as well as commercial and manufacturing capabilities in the US, complementing and expanding the group’s portfolio and pipeline,” the company said in a regulatory announcement.

The acquisition is in line with the company’s strategy to grow and diversify the business in the US said N Govindarajan, managing director of Aurobindo Pharma. “Acquiring these businesses from Sandoz will allow us to further expand our product offering and to become a leading player in the generic dermatology market… we will be focused on leveraging our group’s market-leading, vertically integrated and highly efficient manufacturing base to enhance the market position and mediumterm profitability of the businesses we are acquiring,” he added.

The Sandoz portfolio encompasses a wide range of therapeutic areas, including topical antibiotics, gynaecological and dermatological antifungal agents, anti-acne agents, local anaesthetic analgesics, anti-itch, and a dermatological chemotherapeutic agent.




Aurobindo Buys US Units of Sandoz for $900 M

The oral non-dermatological portfolio covers a wide range of therapeutic areas, including auto-immune disease, anti-neoplastic agents and a variety of hormonal agent. Jefferies was the advisor to Aurobindo in the transaction. MUFG Bank is the sole underwriter.

Along with Intas, Aurobindo has been among the most aggressive Indian pharma acquirer for generic targets to consolidate its position in the developed markets of US and Europe even as several local players like Lupin or Cipla have been facing mixed results with their overseas bets.

The Sandoz transaction is the third overseas acquisition by Aurobindo in less than two years. In January 2017, it agreed to buy Portugal’s Generis Farmaceutica SA from Magnum Capital Partners for €135 million.

It also acquired the European business of Canadian generic maker Apotex for €74 million earlier this year. The company was in exclusive negotiations with US pharma company Mallinckrodt for months to acquire its specialty generics portfolio that included its portfolio of opioid and painkiller drugs for a similar sized takeover, but the talks did not fructify even after a year of interminttent negotiations.

The market cheered the news, with shares of Aurobindo jumping by 8 per cent during market hours, closing at Rupees 760 on Thursday. The deal adds massive scale, the oral solids and dermatology businesses will see progressive pricing pressure, but the deal value looks very accretive despite not so great outlook on the segment, and given Aurobindo’s own manufacturing base in India, they should be able to extract cost synergies from this, according to a note by Rakesh Nayudu of Haitong.

In 2016, Aurobindo had unsuccessfully bid for Teva’s Actavis UK Ltd and Actavis Ireland Ltd units but were pipped by Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd, which paid close to £600 million (around Rupees 5,000 crore) to win the deal but in the November of the same year, it took over a few products from Teva in France. For the June quarter ended 2018, Aurobindo reported a net profit of Rupees 455 crore with a revenue of Rupees 4,250 crore."
10,2018-09-08,Cipla,"The Supreme Court told the government it could not use a technical advisory body’s report to prohibit 15 types of combination medicines manufactured in India since before 1988, said lawyers present during the proceedings, providing relief to several pharmaceutical companies including Abbott, Cipla and Intas.

The order effectively brings several popular cough syrups, painkillers and cold medication out of the health ministry’s impending ban list, providing relief to drug companies pegged at over Rs 740 crore annually.

The court has said that the government can still look into the safety of these 15 drugs, known as fixed-dose combinations (FDCs), but would have to initiate a fresh investigation in case it wants to ban them, said lawyers.

The court was hearing a case filed by Griffon Laboratories, which had challenged a decision by the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) subcommittee to study these 15 FDCs despite previous orders by the apex court that had said these combinations were not to be considered by the panel. Griffon makes cough syrup Grilinctus, which is now out of the ban list following the developments on Friday, said Anupam Lal Das, the Supreme Court advocate-on-record who had filed the case on behalf of Griffin.




“The SC had specifically quashed the ban notifications with regard to these 15 FDCs in its earlier judgment (December 2017),” Das said.

“Our contention was that the subcommittee was still looking into these drugs in violation of the court’s order.” FDCs are medicines with two or more therapeutic ingredients packed in a single dose. They are available in various forms such as tablets and syrups.

Other brands expected to be excluded from the ban list include Abbott's Phensedyl, Tixylix and Tossex, Cipla’s Cofdex, Nocold and Bromolin, Reckitt Benckiser's D-Cold Total, Glenmark’s Ascoril C and Intas' Despol Plus and Despol Forte.

Companies such as Abbott will benefit greatly from the order as brands like Phensedyl contributed about Rs 340 crore to revenue between August 2017 and July 2018, according to pharmaceutical market research firm AIOCD PharmaTrac.

Abbott, Cipla, Reckitt Benckiser, Glenmark and Intas didn’t respond to queries.

In December, the apex court had asked DTAB to recommend to the health ministry the FDCs that needed to be regulated, restricted or banned outright along with the reasons for doing so. This followed an extended legal battle between the government and drug companies over the health ministry's decision to ban nearly 350 FDCs in 2016 and 2017 deeming them “unsafe” and “irrational” for patient use.


RS 3,000-CR SALES HIT

PharmaTrac estimated the move would shave off over Rs 3,000 crore from the annual Rs 1 lakh crore revenue of India's pharmaceutical industry back then and hundreds of drug companies had approached high courts across the country against the decision.

The latest development comes even as the health ministry is considering a report submitted by the DTAB sub-committee to ban over 300 FDCs, including the 15 that were contested at court. The subcommittee had recommended even these FDCs be banned along with 328 others because there is not enough evidence to support assertions that they are safe.

A bench of RF Nariman and Indu Malhotra held that the subcommittee could not look into these 15 FDCs due to its earlier judgement, according to Archana Sahadeva, associate partner at Singh & Singh Law Firm, who was present at the proceedings."

The pre-eminence of Nariman Point or any specific business districts have waned. Offices have come up almost everywhere across the city as corporations continue to move towards more accessible and cost-efficient locations in addition to better quality of properties.

The city’s Central Business District Nariman Point’s share in the city’s total office stock has declined over the last decade to 11% as from 30%. Lately, even BKC’s share declined to 10% from 13% as other parts of the city have gradually seen more offices supply and absorption, data from Knight Frank India showed.

“Growth vectors in MMR, over the last decade, have been pointing towards north given the availability of land and affordable housing. As talent started moving northwards, companies also followed suit to enhance employee productivity and to enjoy lower cost arbitrage,” said Viral Desai, national director – office transactions, Knight Frank India.

While northern part of Mumbai is opening up more avenues for businesses, commercial complexes in central and south Mumbai also continue be occupied completely.

“Indian economy is growing and more office spaces are needed to accommodate rising business activity. Office supply in MMR has also grown nearly three times to 138 million sq ft over these 10 years keeping rentals at an affordable level,” said, Vishal Damani, joint MD, Indiabulls Real Estate.

The newer supply across MMR held lease rentals in a tight range. While office stock in Central Mumbai, Andheri-Goregaon belt, Vikhroli, Powai and Chembur has risen, the highest jump was in Peripheral Business District (PBD) of Airoli, Vashi, Ghansoli, Belapur and Thane as it now accounts for 24% office stock as against just 9% a decade ago.

“The shift has been taking place for some time now. Initially, offices started moving from south Mumbai to central part and BKC. In the next phase of this geographic transformation, companies started exploring more cost-efficient and talent supporting locations like Andheri, Goregaon, Powai and Navi Mumbai,” said Aaron Dlima, CEO, Reliable Group that has leased over five million sq ft office space in Navi Mumbai over the last few years.

According to Dlima, these locations earlier known for factories and industrial activity, initially became hubs for back-office operations and are now transforming into main office destinations.

In some of the recent high-profile shifts, Tata Consulting Engineers shifted from Vikhroli, while Maersk moved from Powai to Airoli. Pharmaceutical major Cipla also consolidated its several of its operations in Airoli. Over the last decade, fast moving consumer goods major Hindustan Unilever shifted from Churchgate in south Mumbai to western suburb Andheri, while Godrej Group has shifted from Fort to eastern suburb of Vikhroli. Financial services majors Societe Generale and Fidelity also moved from Nariman Point to Lower Parel during this period.

Nariman Point’s share in the city’s total office stock has fallen over the past decade to 11% from 30%."

Technical analysts expect indecision and bearishness to continue this week on the street and advise selling at higher levels as any upside bounce is unlikely to sustain for long. Axis Bank, RBL Bank, Lupin, Cipla, M&M, Infosys, UltraTech and Muthoot Finance are showing good momentum, according to technical analysts.


Where are we: A tough week for the market with sell-off in the first three days to hit a low of 11,394 on trade-war tensions and currency weakness. Some recovery in the latter part of the week helped erase partial losses. On weekly charts, the index has again moved back into the rising channel after sustaining above it the previous week. For the past three days, the Nifty has been forming a Bullish Hammer Candlestick, indicating buying coming in at lower levels. Another positive for the market is formation of higher lows and higher highs in the past two days.


What is in store: If the Nifty sustains above 11,600 levels, it could head towards 11,640 and then 11,760-11,800 levels. If it breaks below 11,480, expect the index to decline towards 11,370-11,340 levels. Below this, the next support is seen around 11,250-odd levels. On the Nifty options front, the maximum open interest for Puts is at strike price 11,500, followed by 11,400. In Calls, the highest open interest is seen at 11,800 strike, which is likely to act as a resistance for the market. On Friday, Put writing was seen in 11,500 and Call unwinding in immediate strikes.

India VIX measure of volatility has spiked from 12.8 a week ago to 13.89. Crossing above 14, will lead to renewed selling pressure in the market and resumption of decline.


What could investors do: Axis Bank and RBL Bank are looking strong after testing their breakout levels. In pharma, Lupin and Cipla have seen good consolidation and look poised for an up move. M&M and Muthoot Finance are showing good momentum.

17,2018-09-10,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Snapping a two-day winning streak, the BSE benchmark Sensex clocked its biggest point-wise drop since March 16 on Monday, as a fresh record low in rupee raised fresh concerns over foreign fund outflows, which hit Rs 5,600 crore in the last five sessions.

The BSE Sensex tanked 467.65 points, or 1.22 per cent to 37,922.17 with four stocks managing to close on a positive note in the 30-share index.

Axis Bank was the top index gainer as the bank said Amitabh Chaudhry of HDFC Life will join as chief executive officer from January 1.

Pharma, auto, FMCG, realty and financials stocks too helped the Nifty PSU Bank index in dragging the NSE benchmark Nifty lower.


What caused the decline?
1. Rout in rupeeThe domestic unit tanked 94 paise in today's trade to hit a fresh record low of 72. 67 against dollar. However, the domestic unit gained some ground in afternoon trade and was trading 72.38 at the time of writing this report.


2. Spike in bond yields10-year bond yield rose to its highest since late-2014 on Monday as worries of higher crude prices and weakening rupee bolstered inflation concerns, according to a Reuters report


3. Weakness in global marketsThe anxiety over the US-China trade war kept investors on the edge globally as world shares flirted with their longest run of declines since early 2016.

Another interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve later this month also has investors worried.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March, Reuters reported.


4. Firming oil pricesOil prices rose today as US drilling stalled and as investors anticipated lower supply once new US sanctions against Iran's crude exports kick in from November. 


What experts say:
Jayant Manglink, President, Religare BrokingMarkets started the week on feeble note and lost over a percent. Weak global cues combined with widening trade deficit, due to continuous fall in rupee against the dollar, dampened the sentiment. Selling pressure was witnessed across the board and almost all the sectoral indices ended lower.

The fall was evident, citing deteriorating local cues and continuous threat of trade war escalation. We feel it's a normal correction, considering the rise that we had in Nifty in recent past. Indications are in the favour of further decline ahead and we expect Nifty to find support around 11,300. Trades have no option but to align their position accordingly and avoid naked longs.


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesMarkets slid as fears of escalating US -China trade war dented the confidence. As a direct impact of rising crude oil price, widened current account deficit and strengthening dollar on account of a strong US job data, rupee succumbed to a new low and 10-year yield rose further. The poll forecast of a likely ease in inflation couldn’t uplift the sentiment as concerns of a weakening rupee and volatility in oil prices overshadowed."
18,2018-09-10,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Monday’s market mayhem wiped out Rs 1.96 lakh crore from investor wealth on Dalal Street, as market capitalisation of all the BSE-listed firms plunged to Rs 155.44 lakh crore during the session from Rs 157.40 lakh crore. 

Subdued global cues coupled with widening of trade deficit on continuous fall in the rupee against the dollar weighed on market sentiment. Selling pressure remained visible across the board as almost all the sectoral indices ended in the red.

Index-wise, the 30-share BSE Sensex dipped 467.65 points, or 1.22 per cent to 37,922.17, while the 50-share NSE Nifty closed 151 points, or 1.30 per cent down at 11,438.10.

As many as 42 stocks in the Nifty50 index closed in the red with Bajaj Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Sun Pharma and BPCL falling up to 5 per cent.

On the other hand, HCL Tech, Axis Bank, Zee, Cipla and TCS gained between 0.20 per cent and 1.60 per cent.

Trade war concerns dragged Indian rupee to a record low of 72.67 against the US currency in day trade. The local currency pared some losses to settle at 72.45 against dollar, down 71 paise against the US currency.

“The persistent weakness in the rupee is now starting to show its impact on all asset classes including the equities. The “sentiment risk” is now the major challenge for stock markets. At this time, investors need to be careful and try to get into export-oriented sectors and zero-debt companies as even Indian bond yields have sharply climbed to 4-year highs. The Indian macros have come under the sharp scrutiny of the market, and we have to see how the government and Reserve Bank of India will deal with the dual challenges of the rupee and bonds,” said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Senior VP and Head of Research (Wealth), Centrum Broking said.

Meanwhile, bond yield posted its biggest single-session jump since May 9, 2018. It settled 13 basis points higher at 8.16 per cent, its highest level since November 2014.

Sentiment also took a hit after Moody's Investors Service said sustained weakening of the rupee was “credit negative” for Indian companies, which generate revenue in rupees, but rely on the US dollar debt to fund operations.

“With Lok Sabha elections due next year, stock market could be spooked by political uncertainty. Rising crude prices, rupee depreciation are macroeconomic concerns in the near term. Over the long term, we remain optimistic on Indian equities. India is likely to grow faster than many nations. Investors can expect decent returns from equities over a long period in future. Valuations, however, leave moderate upside in the near term. Investors at this point should continue to invest in equities through SIPs,” said Atul Kumar, Head, Equity Funds, Quantum AMC said."
19,2018-09-11,Cipla,"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries spent Rs 1,615 crore on professional, legal and consultancy services in 2017-18, the same as what four of its peers – Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), Cipla, Lupin and Cadila Healthcare – spent together during the financial year. The amount was also more than the profit earned by any of these peers.Nonetheless, Sun Pharma’s Halol plant received four observations (albeit not of serious nature) three months after it received the clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that had ended a two-year import ban. Last week, FDA issued one observation on inspecting Lupin’s Tarapur plant. The company is yet to receive FDA clearance for its plants in Goa and Indore that had received warning letters from the drug regulator in November last year.Besides, last month, Cadila Healthcare’s subsidiary received observations after FDA inspected its plant in Vadodara. In April, Cipla received observations on its Pithampur plant. In March, one of the formulation units of Aurobindo Pharma had received nine FDA observations. At around the same time, DRL had got five observations after FDA inspected its active ingredient facility.Pharma companies spent more on legal and consultancy services than companies in any other industry. An analysis of legal costs of 67 companies from the BSE 100 index shows that six pharma companies together constituted a quarter of the total of Rs 3,597 crore incurred by these companies on legal expenses. Sun Pharma has been the top spending company in the country in three of the past four years.Pharma companies incur costs on hiring consultants for FDA compliance, IPR litigation and M&A – areas that have seen increased action in recent years.The total legal costs of six pharma companies show a sign of stabilising, after having peaked in 2015-16. However, continued adverse FDA observations for pharma companies imply that the costs of resolution of these issues are not coming down. The latest instance of Sun’s Halol plant shows that compliance with regulations is a continuous process and any lapse can result in observations.

A weaker rupee also augurs well for the export-oriented sector. However, a series of regulatory clampdowns have taken the wind out of the sector in recent years, leaving none of the players insulated from regulatory risk that has now become a permanent fixture for companies in the sector. Investors need to increase their risk appetite and temper down expectations of returns from the sector. The worst may be over, but with intermittent jolts from regulatory observations the recovery may still be slow and painful."

23,2018-09-13,Cipla,"We don’t know if Ramprasad Reddy’s proudest moment was the invitation by then Secretary General Kofi Annan to speak at the United Nations in November 2006 – he is one of the few generic manufacturers to do so — or if it was last Thursday, when Aurobindo Pharma announced the biggest cross-border acquisition by any Indian pharmaceuticals company. 

What we do know is that till early August, Reddy’s heart was battling his mind. His heart was in the high-risk, higher-upside Mallinckrodt opioids portfolio, a year-long pursuit intermittently punctuated by the Donald Trump administration’s shrill political rhetoric. His mind, though, wanted the dermatology and oral solids business of Sandoz, generics arm of Swiss big pharma Novartis, also in the US. A better business fit, it would complement existing operations. Even a fortnight ago, Reddy and his lawyers were deeply engaged with Mallinckrodt, boxing in all potential legal and regulatory risks with indemnities and other protection. 

Eventually, negotiations collapsed at the last lap, making it easier for Reddy to shrug off all dilemma and jump right into a far more competitive process. “Unlike those bilateral discussions, Sandoz was a timebound process led by Novartis, so timelines were not in Aurobindo’s control,” recalls an official involved in negotiations, on condition of anonymity. 

“Reddy wanted a leg in, knowing (full) well that Mallinckrodt had a lot of associated risks. But it (Aurobindo) also did not expect the Sandoz acquisition to end at a $900 million price tag, after starting at $1.5 billion.” Looking back, the preparation and loud rehearsals with family members before his UN speech to overcome stage fright and his heavy Telugu accent must have been as exhilarating as the midnight jitters just ahead of last week’s signing off. 


Others

What matters now is that Aurobindo has leapfrogged to become the second-largest generics player in the US — easily the toughest market — in terms of share of prescriptions, ahead of homegrown rival Lupin and even global giant Mylan. It is closing in on Israel’s Teva, the largest generic drug manufacturer worldwide. 

“We save on huge costs and at least five years of time getting into such business organically,” says P Sarath Chandra Reddy, Ramprasad’s son and a wholetime director at Aurobindo. “Apart from offering certain key synergies in solid orals business, it will also help us achieve the size required to reap advantages in the US market.” 

Ramprasad Reddy remained unavailable for comments. 


Dare To Dream Aurobindo may not be Infosys and Penaka Venkata Ramprasad Reddy no Narayana Murthy, but just like the technology bellwether, the pharma company too has been a rollercoaster entrepreneurial journey. 

Two postgraduate friends started it in 1986 after pooling resources by pledging the family silver and raising seed capital from kith and kin. At a personal level, Reddy’s life story is no less a chronicle of human triumph — from a humble background and vernacular education in Andhra Pradesh to political controversies in the not-so-distant past and now, global recognition. How often do you meet an entry-level purchase department clerk-turned-smalltime chemicals trader who went on to become a pharma billionaire? 

“Reddy may lack the aristocracy and panache of Cipla’s Yusuf Hamied or the scientific vision of DRL’s K Anji Reddy, but he makes it up with his strategic intent to grow,” says a fellow Hyderabadbased founder. “He’s a billionaire without the air of one. He makes up for his language deficiencies with his negotiating prowess and consistent price discipline.” This, in turn, has helped in its constant evolution. 


First, as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), or raw material, maker; then pivoting to a preferred antiretrovirals vendor to supply HIV/AIDS medicines for global agencies such as World Health Organization and Clinton Foundation; making a mark in Europe through a string of bolt-on buyouts and now, breaking out in the US, Aurobindo has always been as unobtrusive as its obsessively media-shy cofounder – always shunning the limelight, overstretched bids and even the relentless glare of the regulators. After resolving an imports alert and warning letter for two of its facilities, the company has staged a significant comeback bulking up especially in US – its largest market – with a series of drug approvals and a large pipeline that awaits clearance. 

 “Aurobindo stands out for its lowrisk strategy,” feels Surjit Pal, analyst, Prabhudas Liladhar, a brokerage firm. A combination of a well-integrated and nimble manufacturing strategy has additionally helped corner market share and sequential growth in difficult developed markets. “Lesser litigation, integration of active pharmaceuticals business, formulation operations and low level of research & development spend is what the market finds attractive in the current scenario. It has also been faster in turning around its FDA inspections and warning letters than its peers.” 

By playing to its strengths, the latest Sandoz acquisition makes it a consolidator in the US with a diverse portfolio and strong relationships with large buyers. “We see an upside from better utilisation of manufacturing capacity (especially the orals plant), addition of 300 products, rationalisation of manpower as well as integrating the business with Aurobindo’s backward integrated supply chain,” feels Vivek Agarwal of Citi. 

It’s actually a win-win for both the buyer and the seller. For Aurobindo, it gives deep access to lesser competitive generics segments such as dermatology and controlled substances in the US. Sandoz and Novartis, on the other hand, get to rationalise assets to launch more complex products in injectables, respiratory and ophthalmic, value-added speciality medicines and biosimilars. 

“We will be focused on leveraging our group’s market leading, vertically integrated and highly efficient manufacturing base to enhance the market position and medium-term profitability of the businesses,” said N Govindarajan, managing director, Aurobindo Pharma, an engineer-turned-consigliere of Reddy. 

Low cost has also always been a competitive advantage but over the years, Aurobindo has consciously steered away from relying solely on APIs. Today, 80% of its business comes from formulations. But the three world-class manufacturing facilities that Aurobindo will now inherit will further aid its attempts to derisk its high dependence on the Indian formulation plant. Again, that’s a key differentiator from local mid-cap peers such as Torrent, Mankind and Eris Lifesciences, for whom India is the place to grow. 

“Aurobindo and Intas want to become big in the US and Europe at a time when global generics players such as Mylan and Teva are in a turmoil, the Chinese companies are grappling with regulations and trade issues and local peers like Cipla and Lupin have had challenging acquisitions,” says Manisha Girotra, India chief executive, Moelis, a global investment bank. 

“So there are select global bidders left in the fray. If you want to hand over your business to a strategic, then the Indians are very credible and real buyers, paying good values.” The recent history of M&As is, therefore a great indication of how both the Indian companies — Aurobindo and Intas — aim to gain scale in the key markets. In 2016, Aurobindo unsuccessfully bid for Teva’s Actavis UK and Ireland units but were pipped by Intas, which paid close to £600 million (around Rs 5,000 crore) to win the deal. But in November of the same year, it took over a few products from Teva in France. In Mallinckrodt as well as Zentiva, Sanofi’s European generics arm, both again locked horns but were outbid by private equity. 


“These players will not stop here. Aurobindo could look to do a big buy in Europe next where it needs further scale in certain markets. Liquidity is also available to them ...They are getting financing competitive to PE aiding them to get competitive,” adds Girotra. The Sandoz transaction is the third overseas acquisition by Aurobindo in less than two years. In January 2017, it agreed to buy Portugal’s Generis Farmaceutica SA from Magnum Capital Partners for €135 million. It also acquired the European business of Canadian generic maker Apotex for €74 million earlier this year. However, achieving scale may also require continued capex and increase supply chain complexity which Aurobindo will need to manage, warn Alok Dalal and Alok Srivastava of CLSA.


Mixed Dosage The Reddys are unlikely to baulk at such challenges, having dealt with a fair share of failures and regrets. Reddy saw setback in the Chinese market in an experiment of own manufacturing facilities that had to be eventually shut down. “Ramprasad regrets the move and saw it as loss of a golden opportunity,” recalls cofounder Nityananda Reddy, whose daughter is now married to Ramprasad’s son, Sarath Chandra Reddy. His other big failing was when Aurobindo was a little late to seize opportunities in the formulations business. Reddy was also not ready with globally compliant manufacturing facilities and product portfolio by the time of the new patent regime in January 2005. 

“It took 6-7 years of rigorous preparation and investments for the company to get into the global generics business, without any revenue generation from global generics for nearly seven years,” says AJ Kamath, who was finance director of Aurobindo for nearly two decades. “The entry into global generics formulations was a major milestone for the company, which transformed its fortunes.” 

Today, around 90% of the company’s business comes from the exports, mostly from global generics sold in regulated markets. “Over the last three decades, the company has seen a drastic shift from being a predominantly bulk drugs firm to becoming a formulations company; and to global regulated markets from the domestic market,” says Kamath. 


Bitter Coating on Sweet Pills Taking timely punts has always been Ramprasad Reddy’s trademark. When Aurobindo Pharma got a 180-day market exclusivity for its generic drug Duloxetine — copycat of Eli Lilly’s Cymbalta — Reddy wanted to ship the product on time into the US market, without being too early or late for the launch. For this, he ruled out the regular exports route and preferred to hire a dedicated chartered air cargo that reached the US on time, despite certain highly anxious movements when the flight was almost caught in a storm after a transit halt at Heathrow Airport. It was his idea to get into manufacturing APIs first at then Pondicherry, bored as he was with his trading business and lured by the attractive tax incentives the Union Territory offered in the mid-1980s. 

Reddy, a Commerce postgraduate from the Venkateshwara University in Andhra Pradesh, roped in friends like Nityananda, a postgraduate in Chemistry who already had a cushy job in the pharma industry in Tirupati at Tini Pharma, an outfit of Reddy’s maternal uncle. “One of the major turning points in the entrepreneurial journey of Ramprasad Reddy was when the Videocon group approached him for a deal around 1994 and bought equity at Rs 110 a share,” says an old family friend who did not wish to be identified. 



“What amazed him more and amplified his business confidence was the enterprise valuation when Videocon sold the same Aurobindo shares at a premium of Rs 180 a share to the public in early 1995, during the firm’s local listing.” By then, Aurobindo had four manufacturing facilities – one at erstwhile Pondicherry and three in Hyderabad — with leadership in semi-synthetic penicillins (SSPs) and antibiotics, an expanded bulk drug product portfolio and production capacities. 

The Videocon deal and public offering helped him significantly improve his abilities to raise institutional capital, chase volumes and look at research and development seriously towards achieving a differentiated products portfolio. The next major turning point in the company’s journey was recorded in the early 1990s. 

Reddy went on to rigorously scout for research and development talent across the country and finally zeroed in on Dr M Sivakumaran, who, by then, had over a decade of experience at Ranbaxy and TTK. “Dr Sivakumaran, who is now the R&D backbone of Aurobindo and responsible for the world’s highest number of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) and strong pipeline of products, was hesitant to move to Hyderabad but Reddy succeeded in roping him in with a pretty attractive package and few lakh shares in those days to make him a partner,” says the friend. 

This bond within the core senior leadership at Aurobindo that has remained loyal for decades is what separates it from its deep-pocket rivals. The company has rarely imported senior talent. The strategic decision-making remains with Ramprasad Reddy but unlike many midcaps, the professional management led by Govindarajan has a free run on day-to-day management issues. 

“Unlike typical publicly-listed but proprietary concern-type companies, we are very clear in delegating responsibilities among the promoters and professional management — based on their respective domain expertise,” says Sarath Chandra Reddy, who oversees smaller operations such as real estate and contract manufacturing till date. 

“I think this delegation of responsibilities among a healthy mix of promoters and professionals has helped us to where we are today. Being the large shareholders in the company, the promoters are also benefited in the process, with growth in wealth.” When long-term associate and group chief financial officer Sudhir Singhi wanted to quit Hyderabad and stay close to his family in Mumbai, Reddy refused to accept his resignation and instead built an office for him in the financial capital of the country. 

Such unflinching loyalty equally helped when Reddy relinquished his position as chairman of Aurobindo Pharma and moved to the US in early 2012, to focus fully on the business there, handing over the reins in India to professional managers after some of the promoters were accused by the Enforcement Directorate in relation to their alleged proximity to Jaganmohan Reddy, founder of YSR Congress. Since then, the company’s global sales have tripled to $2.6 billion in FY18. Even then, Reddy kept his cards close to his chest as he homed in on his boldest career moves. Only three or four within the company had an inkling about the Sandoz deal. For now though, everyone is smiling as it helps achieve the internal target of $4 billion of top line by 2019. The intrepid risk-taker clearly knows the right dosage."

25,2018-09-14,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty staged a stellar show on Friday on across-the-board buying fuelled by healthy macroeconomic indicators. 

Domestic investors embarked on an all-round buying spree after inflation data showed the economy is in a good shape. 

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday showed inflation based on wholesale prices eased to a four-month low of 4.53 per cent in August on softening of food prices. The wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.09 per cent in July and 3.24 per cent in August last year.

Earlier this week, government data showed retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. 

The rupee, too, was on a recovery path in anticipation that the Prime Minister may announce some steps to curb its fall at an weekend review. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was trading 35 paise higher for the day at 71.93.

Positive global cues also influenced the sentiment. Asian shares rose on Friday as the US and China prepared for a new round of trade talks on the tariff row, while a decisive interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank helped support global risk appetite, Reuters reported.

Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley raised the Sensex target for September 2019 to 42,000, citing that the earnings cycle was at the cusp of turning. However, it highlighted the election outcome in 2019 is a key risk for the market.

The 30-share Sensex surged 373 points, or 0.99 per cent, to settle at 38,090, with only two stocks - Coal India (down 1.42 per cent) and Infosys (down 1.01 per cent) – ending as losers. 

The Nifty50 index jumped 145 points, or 1.28 per cent, to close at 11,515, with four stocks – HCL Tech, Coal India, Infosys and GAIL – ending in the red. Reliance Industries finished flat. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outperformed Sensex, gaining 1.62 per cent and 1.38 per cent, respectively. For the week, Sensex slipped 0.78 per cent and Nifty 0.64 per cent.

27,2018-09-18,Cipla,"Tyremaker Ceat did away with the policy of attendance recording system three months ago, allowing employees to enter and leave office at a flexible time.

The traditional manufacturing firm, a part of industrial conglomerate RPG Enterprises, has introduced work from remote location— which could be home, a café or a mall or anywhere—in an initiative to give more flexibility and create an environment in sync with the new world around.

The new flexible system, led by its young MD and RPG scion Anant Goenka, assesses employees purely on deliverables—a rare thing for an Indian company and that too a manufacturing company.

While Ceat has gone aggressive with its flexibility policies more in tune with global MNCs, an increasing number of mature Indian companies are opening up to the idea of flexibility as well as working from remote locations in a bid to attract and retain new generation employees in the workforce.

Companies like Mahindra, Tata Motors, Cipla and Godrej are creating a system that allows more flexibility and freedom to the employees.

“Indian firms are progressively getting more flexible with workplace practices, responding to the preferences of the new talent demographics,” said Prabir Jha, global chief people officer, Cipla.



“At Ceat, we go with trust and empowerment. Our office opens at 7am and shuts at 9pm. Employees can choose their time,” said Milind Apte, head human resources, Ceat, which has done away with the policy of the 8-9 hours man day and made attendance recording system defunct. “There is no minimum work hour a day. Employees are purely judged by delivery,” said Apte.

Tata Motors, the country’s leading vehicle maker, has made work-from-home applicable at all its offices where employees can avail the option for continuous two days every week. If needed, in certain cases, it can be extended in consultation with the line manager.

Meetings can be over phones or recently introduced business Skype and people can log in from anywhere. “It is found to be very helpful for new parents or to take care of someone at home when one can save a lot of time travelling,” said Gajendra Chandel, chief human resources officer, Tata Motors. “We do not have strict punch in and punch out time. 

We assess employees on the basis of deliverables,” he said, adding this has a lot of trust element. “You don’t know what the individual might be doing (working remotely).

We have found some misuses too, when the individual is called up and counselled. But overall the flexibility has been helpful,” he added.

ICICI Bank has an iWork@home policy that involves a facial recognition technology to ensure that no one can impersonate the employee and get access to applications.

The policy, which initially allowed women employees to work from home for longer periods of time, up to a year and beyond, has now been extended for all employees.

Drugmaker Cipla offers employees flexibility to walk in anytime within a two-hour window in the morning in Mumbai. This helps employees choose the eight-hour window they wish to be in office.

“This has only enabled productivity as employees get to choose the hours each day based on his/her priorities both professionally and personally,” said Jha.

FMCG major Godrej has a six-hour a day in office policy while rest of the time is flexible with an option to work from home two days a month. Adhesives maker Pidilite has flexi in and out timings.

The most recent change was to give employees the flexibility to complete their work hours on a weekly basis instead of a day count. “The bulk of our employees avail the facility,” said Rahul Sinha, president, HR, Pidilite Industries.

Technology is the biggest enabler in this transformation, where one can work remotely using smart phones, telepresence and Skype that enable connectivity anytime and from any location.

HR heads agree that a personal meeting is still not out of fashion, but advancement in technology is fast filling the gap where teams across locations and geographies can connect virtually.

“Face time is important, as without the human touch and team work, getting work could be difficult,” said Prince Augustin, executive vice president, group human capital and leadership, Mahindra & Mahindra.

However, he added: “The technology landscape could fill this gap and with teams across geographies, virtual connect has become a reality and face time therefore is more technology-enabled.” There is need for a shift in mind sets too, particularly in large Indian organisations that are used to a hierarchical operating structure, HR heads said.

At Godrej for instance, the senior management is leading the way to break the stereotypes.

“Many of our senior leaders use the work-from-home option and share their experiences on Workplace (formerly known as Facebook for Business).

 This has helped break stereotypes and has encouraged all our team members to consider the option guilt-free, without the fear of being criticised or judged,” said Sumit Mitra, head- Group HR and corporate services, Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies."

29,2018-09-18,Cipla,"Blame it on lifestyle changes or poor dietary practices, lack of Vitamin D poses a problem for many in urban areas. But when juxtaposed with Dalal Street, they are a market opportunity for others.

As many as 8 out of 10 people in Delhi suffer from Vitamin D deficiency, according to a report by Assocham (Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India).

Going by some media reports, the global market for Vitamin D may hit $2.5 billion by 2020 growing at a CAGR of 11 per cent. That's music to the ears of those which manufacture such drugs.

Notable players are Alkem Laboratories, Abbott India and Sanofi India with a sizeable share in Vitamin D3 market. 

Vitamin D3 is the recommended form of vitamin D. This is also the natural form of the vitamin that body gets from sunlight. Changing lifestyles where one spends more time indoors, poor dietary habits and rising pollution level have all contributed to the deficiency of this crucial ingredient in Indians.

Alkem Laboratories’ brand Uprise D3 is the number two in the market with a share of over 12 per cent. The company has a robust manufacturing infrastructure consisting of 21 manufacturing facilities across India and the US. It's a pan-India player with an extensive sales, marketing and distribution network with over 8,000 medical representatives, nearly 7,000 stockists and more than 40 sales depots and warehouses.

The company was listed on the NSE and the BSE in December 2015 and has a market capitalisation of Rs 24,832 crore as on September 17, 2018. Since then, share price of the company has rallied more than 50 per cent to Rs 2,100.

Brokerage firm Reliance Securities has ‘Buy’ rating on Alkem Laboratories with a target price of Rs 2,390.

Arachitol Nano (Vitamin D preparations) from Abbott India holds 6.06 per cent market share in the D3 category, says a news report. The product has shown a positive growth in FY18, according to latest annual report of the company.

Abbott India, part of Abbott’s Global Pharmaceutical business, is one of India’s fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies. It provides products across various therapeutic categories such as women’s health, gastroenterology, CNS, metabolics, general care, vitamins, vaccines and the like. The company’s products are manufactured in India and also sourced from local third-party manufacturers.

According to Hem Securities, Abbott India’s top 10 brands are leaders (at number 1 or 2 positions) in their respective segments. The company’s Thyronorm brand (for thyroid preparations) and Influvac (influenza vaccine) retain leadership position with more than 50 per cent market share. 

Abbott posted strong growth in Q1 2018-19 with topline displaying decent YoY growth of 20 per cent at Rs 845 crore while bottom line witnessed a YoY growth of 70 per cent at Rs 84 crore.

“The company’s fundamentals look quite strong with zero debt in its book. Its robust plan to launch 100 new products over five years coupled with strong sectoral outlook make the stock an attractive destination to deploy the funds at the current level. Hence, we recommend Buy on the stock with a price target of Rs 9,560 for the long term horizon,” said Hem Securities in a report.

Another product, Depura of Sanofi India takes more than 5 per cent market share in the vitamin D3 segment, a report showed. The products manufactured by the company are distributed in India and exported to 51 countries (in CY17), with Germany, Australia, the UK, Russia, Czech Republic and Italy making up as the main markets. Four products of company, including Lantus, Combiflam, Amaryl and Allegra, feature in the top 100 pharmaceutical brands of India.

For the June quarter, the company posted a 15 per cent year-on-year growth in revenue figures while profit jumped 35 per cent on a yearly basis. In the same quarter, the company’s margin ratio witnessed double-digit growth, with operating profit margin at 24.06 per cent against 19.21 per cent in the same quarter last year.

“The company is expected to benefit from increasing affordability among the fast-growing middle class population coupled with improving medical infrastructure and rising insurance penetration, better diagnosis of chronic, non-communicable diseases (like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and type-2 Diabetes) and new product launches like Combiflam ICYHOT. Also, the company’s key brands like Lantus, Allegra, Cardace are expected to retain strong market share, going forward. Hence, we recommend Buy on the stock with price target of Rs 7,480 for a long term horizon,” Hem Securities said in a report.

Calcirol by Cadila Pharma and D3 Must by Mankind Pharma command 11.49 per cent and 4.93 per cent market share, respectively. However, these companies are not listed on the BSE and the NSE as well. 

Index-wise, the Nifty Pharma outperformed the benchmark NSE Nifty by 10 percentage points during the past three months. The pharma index rallied nearly 17 per cent to 10,652.90 on September 14, from 9,112.50 on June 14, while the Nifty jumped 6.54 per cent to 11,515.20 from 10,808.10 during the same period.

Global brokerage firm CLSA said the recent rally is a result of the recent forex tailwinds, improving pricing commentary in the US, normalcy in the domestic market, minimal earnings cut in Q1 and certain complex or specialty approvals. 

“There is still scope of upside given the sector’s low correlation to electoral outcomes, underweight position in FII portfolios and potential earnings upgrade in the near term... In the medium term, sustained improvement in US dynamics will be critical to support the sector,” CLSA said. The brokerage firm favours Sun Pharma and Cipla in the pharmaceutical space."

Your US-based business continues to remain under the weather. What sort of recovery can one expect in the second half led by new products?
A few green shoots are visible at this stage. The first of course is the fact that Solosec, We are laying a lot of store by that and it is ramping up. Its acceptance rate has been fairly good. The second part is we do believe that we will have a couple of a new molecules coming up by end of this fiscal. The first is Levothyroxine and the second is Ranexa. We are also working on cost cutting initiatives. We do believe that the second half would be better than first half.


I want to understand how the currency weakness impacts you and what sort of hit or benefit would it have on export earnings for a company like yours?
In a general sense when the rupee depreciates, it is always good for exporters and from that perspective the rupee depreciation is certainly useful to us. These are pretty good tailwinds to have. For every rupee depreciation, we would expect about Rs 40 crore to the bottom line and that is obviously going to be a benefit.


How much of your current revenue is actually in dollar and how much of your total revenue is in cross currency?
About 28% is our India revenues. You could say close to about 35% to 40% have been essentially rupee denominated across APIs and there are exports from API also. So, I would say close to about 70% is foreign currency denominated.


As a company, what hedging policy do you follow? Do you follow a policy of hedging or you do not hedge rupee at all?
So there are two parts to it. There is a natural hedge against in fact some of the imports also. We do import about 20% of our total input. To that extent, the balanced will be essentially the kind of exposures that we have on the forex front. The other part is we do have a hedging policy but it is kind of opportunistic. We take a perspective about 18 months going forward, rolling forward and to that extend between 25% and 30% of our total exposures are indeed hedged.


What about the big picture? Going through the notes from Teva conference calls, I get the sense that the multiplicity of generic drugs between Lupin, Teva, Cipla and Sun portfolios is getting reduced as that was impacting pricing power. They would benefit in some products because you are vacating and you would benefit in other products because they are vacating. Is that true now?

You are right in that the price erosion is indeed the overall cause of all of this. That is certainly being contained. About a few quarters ago, the price erosion was close to about 14% on the back of a couple of things. One, the consolidation which happened in America among the channel partners has actually come to an end. 

The second part is that the GDUFA expiates a lot of approvals among the generic companies. That intensified the competition out there and led to a scenario where the manufactures also felt that they need to share certain parts of their portfolios. This happened across the entire gamut of companies operating there. 

A lot of companies decided to focus on certain molecules which had a big advantage and to that extent, all of us revisited some of parts of portfolio. The fact that some are not going to focus on certain other molecules would mean that the intensity of competition would go down. The other part which is not being mentioned is the fact that the cost of doing business in America has gone up over time. The kind of capital expenditure that is required, the kind of overheads that is needed to incur all of this has been going up and that would actually mean that the profitability of the newcomers in this industry would be impacted. 

A lot of those newcomers in recent times would be perhaps refocusing their own resources and to that extent, the intensity of competition over time in America would come down. 


Do you expect exclusivity of Ranexa and a pickup in Levothyroxine will be crucial in driving the US sales in the second half? 
Those would be very important parts of our overall strategy. None of these are going to be in the same league as a Glumetza or Fortamet but they are pretty important products. I would imagine that they would be doing about in multiples of 10 and there is a speciality strategy that has been already rolled forward. All of these are the reasons why we are optimistic about the second half.


It has been more than three months since Solosec has been launched and weekly prescriptions are still in the range of about 700 to 800. Do you still maintain that 4% market share exit but end of FY19 for Solosec in particular? 
That we do. We are very optimistic about it because the acceptance at the formulary level and amongst the prescribers certainly gives lots of reasons for optimism. It is early days yet and we expect this to be ramped up over time. There is a lot of advantages in usage of Solosec because it does away with issues around bacterial vaginosis. To that extent, it is certainly an improvement on existing prescription. There is a lot of acceptance and there is no reason why it should not ramp up to about $200 odd million over the next three years."

8,2018-10-16,Cipla,"How is the health of your portfolio after the recent selloff in equities? 

If you are planning to give your portfolio a defensive tweak in view of the multiple headwinds ahead, pharma is definitely one space to look at. Pharma is also in focus as a sharp drop in the rupee this year has turned investor focus on export-heavy businesses.

But one needs to be selective and cautious. Select names from this sector such as Merck, Valiant Organics, Albert David and Kilitch Drugs have rallied between 60 and 110 per cent so far this year.

With a 0.74 per cent dip on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the Nifty Pharma index outpaced the benchmark index which slipped more than 1 per cent during this period. That’s primarily because stocks like Sun Pharma, Ipca Labs, Aurobindo Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Biocon, Divi’s Labs, Pfizer and Abbott India gained between 5 per cent and 33 per cent on a year-to-date basis.

But stocks like Orchid Pharma, Mangalam Drugs, Avon Lifesciences, Wockhardt, Morepen Laboratories, Indoco Remedies, Ajanta Pharma, Laurus Labs and Cadila Healthcare fell between 12 per cent and 75 per cent during the same period.

Most brokerages have since become cautious on the sector ahead of September quarter earnings. There are expectations that the pharma sector will report weak operating performance for Q2 on account of sustained pricing pressure in the US and high base of US generics business, muted domestic business growth on account of high base led by GST-led channel refilling and increased raw material cost due to supply disruption from China.

“Even after the rally in the past few months, valuation multiples of some of the pharma companies under our coverage are still close to their long-term average multiples due to de-rating in the past two years. Though the risk of earnings downgrade still persists, given the near-term challenges, we see an opportunity to invest in select quality names,” brokerage Sharekhan said in a report.

“We continue to maintain our cautious view on the sector and recommend selective stock picking. During Q2 of FY18, after GST implementation, pharma companies had re-filled the channels via inventory push. Given the volatility in the US market, we prefer domestic-focused players,” IDBI Capital Markets said in a report.

The brokerage believes margins of pharma companies are likely to be under pressure, as most of them import Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and intermediates, whose prices have increased substantially due to supply constraints.

“With few major launches in the US, depreciating currency across the emerging markets, including rupee, against the dollar QoQ, we expect moderate growth in exports. Most emerging market currencies had a weak performance against the US dollar, which appreciated 4.7 per cent QoQ in Q2FY19. We expect gain from appreciated dollar to get passed on to adjust price erosion in US generics over time,” brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said.

With the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) during the first quarter of FY18, a large part of sales was reported in Q2FY18 and that base effect will ensure lower-than-expected growth in Q2FY19 for India formulation businesses. 

“With the disadvantage of a higher base in domestic sales in Q2FY18, we expect average domestic sales growth (YoY) to be more than 8-12 per cent in Q2FY19E. We expect domestic formulation market to continue to be challenging, especially for the companies which are highly dependent on acute therapy drugs. It would be more challenging for large Indian pharma companies due to large base and strong restriction on churning out of new combination drugs,” said Prabhudas Lilladher.

For stock-specific investors looking for some pharma names in their portfolio, IDBI Capital Markets has ‘buy’ rating to Cipla and Dishman Carbogen Amcis with a target price of Rs 483 and Rs 321. However, it has ‘reduce’ ratings on Merck India and Sanofi India. 

Prabhudas Lilladher has a ‘buy’ ratings on Aurobindo Pharma, Eris Lifesciences and Ipca Labs with target prices of Rs 909, Rs 849 and Rs 642, respectively, while Sharekhan prefers Biocon, Divi’s and Sun Pharma."

11,2018-10-24,Cipla,"How is the health of your portfolio after the recent selloff in the equity market? 

If you are planning to create safeguards for your portfolio by adding some defensive stocks, then you got to be very discerning; more so if it is pharma.

For, there has been strong polarisation among pharma stocks, which leaves the entire basket a complex mix of good and bad apples.

With a 0.71 per cent year-to-date (YTD) gain, the Nifty Pharma index has outpaced the benchmark NSE Nifty index, which has risen 0.17 per cent in this period.

Stocks like Merck, Valiant Organics, Albert David and Kilitch Drugs have rallied between 60 per cent and 125 per cent so far this year.

Some of the well-known names such as Sun Pharmaceutical, Ipca Labs, Aurobindo Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline Pharma, Biocon, Divi’s Labs, Pfizer, Abbott India have gained between 3 per cent and 31 per cent on a year-to-date basis.

At the same time stocks like Orchid Pharma, Mangalam Drugs, Avon Lifesciences, Morepen Laboratories, Indoco Remedies, Ajanta Pharma, Laurus Labs and Cadila Healthcare are down between 12 per cent and 70 per cent.

Brokerages turned cautious on the sector just ahead of September quarter earnings. They expect some of the pharma firms to report weak operating performance in Q2 on account of sustained pricing pressure in US market, a high base of the US generics business, muted domestic business growth on account of high base led by GST-led channel refilling and increased raw material cost due to supply disruption from China.

Even after the rally in last few months, some of the pharma stocks are trading close to their long-term average multiples due to de-rating in last two years, brokerage Sharekhan said in a report.

“Though the risk of earnings downgrade still persists, given the near-term challenges, we see an opportunity to invest in quality names,” it said.

IDBI Capital Markets has a cautious view on the sector and advises selective stocks picking. “During Q2 of FY18, post GST implementation, all companies re-filled the channels via inventory push. That remains an overhang. But given the volatility in the US market, we prefer domestic-focused players,” it said.

The brokerage said margins of pharma companies are likely to be under pressure as most of them import active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates from China, where prices have increased substantially due to supply constraints.

Post GST implementation, Indian pharma companies reported large sales growth in Q2FY18, that high base will drag growth this quarter for India formulation businesses. 

“With the disadvantage of a higher base in sales in Q2FY18, we expect average domestic sales growth (YoY) to be around 8-12 per cent in Q2. We expect domestic formulations market to continue to be challenging, especially for companies that are highly dependent on acute therapy drugs. It would be more challenging for large Indian pharma companies due to a large base and strong restrictions on churning out new combination drugs,” said Prabhudas Lilladher, a Mumbai brokerage.

“With a few major launches in the US, depreciating currencies across emerging markets, including rupee, we expect moderate growth in exports. Most emerging market currencies had a weak performance against the US dollar. USD appreciated 4.7 per cent QoQ in Q2FY19 and we expect gain from an appreciated dollar to be passed on to adjust price erosion in US generics over time,” the brokerage said.

For investors looking to add pharma names to their portfolios, IDBI Capital Markets recommends Cipla and Dishman Carbogen Amcis, on which it has buy ratings with price targets of Rs 483 and Rs 321. However, it has ‘reduce’ rating on Merck India and Sanofi India. 

Prabhudas Lilladher has ‘buy’ ratings on Aurobindo Pharma, Eris Lifesciences and Ipca Labs with price targets of Rs 909, Rs 849 and Rs 642, respectively, while Sharekhan prefers Biocon, Divis and Sun Pharma."

13,2018-10-27,Cipla,"If you are getting ready for next week trading, Jay Thakkar of Anand Rathi pitches a few ideas. The NSE Nifty is very very near its short term bottom, he told ETNow during an interview.Edited excerpts:


ETNow: What is the screen telling you, the fact that we have just barely managed to scratch the surface at the 10k mark, defended somehow after what looked like it is going to be a breach and 10,000 as well would be taken in. What is it telling you about what lies ahead of us? Looks like it is just a matter of days we are going to see a reality sub-10k?


Jay Thakkar: Yes, absolutely correct. Today, somehow the Nifty managed to hold the levels of 10,000. But then yes, I think more or less we are very very near to the short term bottom. Amid the this overall fall, which we have seen in the markets in the past two months right from 11,750 approximately till recent lows, somewhere we are completing the initial leg of the downtrend. This is just the first leg down from where the momentum indicators have really reversed from quite an overbought territory to oversold territory and that generally happens when the overall trend reverses.

So no doubt that in the medium term, the trend is reversed. For the short term, I would say we have been seeing some divergence happening in the market on most of the indicators, which clearly indicates that the index is somehow nearing the short term bottom and from these levels, I think the risk reward is definitely good on the long side. I think for this November series, it is quite likely that we will see a positive monthly close. 

On the lower side I would say 9,800-9,850 is a very crucial support, which is just 1-1.5 per cent from the current levels. But on the upside, I think that in this series itself, we might see a bounceback of almost 4-5 per cent. So if you see the risk reward, it is definitely favouring the short-term bulls from these levels.


ETNow: We wanted your sense on what is happening with Yes Bank? What is it that you are seeing on the charts?

Jay Thakkar: As you rightly said a smart recovery is seen on Yes Bank and we saw a bounce at least coming till its previous gap area of almost 270-odd levels. But then, we have again seen shorting happening in that stock, again a downtrend continuing from those levels, which clearly indicates that overall trend for Yes Bank is still negative. We have not seen that kind of a reversal which we are seeing majorly happening in most of the indices. 

In fact, the banking pack is one area wherein lately we have seen some shorts getting accumulated and for the past couple of sessions, banking was one sector which had been in fact deviating or I would say giving a positive divergence as far as the Nifty was concerned. 

But then, banking stocks have started to fall again... the pain will be seen in the banking names only. On the lower side, around 150 is a very crucial support as far as the medium term trend is concerned for Yes Bank. Till those levels are held I think the possibility of a bounceback is also likely, along with the entire market. But yes, 150 is the level to watch out for on Yes Bank.


ETNow: What are some trades for Monday morning?Jay Thakkar: As I said I am expecting that markets should bottom somewhere around these levels and not more than 1-1.5 per cent on the lower side but on the upside, we have a great bounceback possibility. Keeping that in mind, I have some long ideas. So, first would be a buy on Maruti, the reason for that is we have clearly seen a declining structure on the weekly charts. The stock has really retraced 38.2 per cent of its previous move right from 1,000 to 10,000. It has clearly shown a positive divergence on daily as well as hourly charts. 

At these levels if someone buys, at least for this entire series, I think one can see the levels of almost 7,250-7,300 on the upside, placing a stop loss at around 6,550. Maruti is definitely a positional buy. 

Second buy recommendation would be on Granules. With a positive close and the kind of recovery it saw, Granules has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily charts. With that, on the lower side now, 89 is a very crucial support on a closing basis. Till we do not see a close below 89, the possibility of this stock inching towards the levels of 102 at least in a week’s time or so is quite high. So Granules is also a buy. 

These are the two buy recommendation which I have. 

On the short side, I would say as far as the pharma names are concerned, I would say Aurobindo Pharma and Cipla are the two short ideas because Cipla has clearly broken down from a bearish head and shoulders pattern. Hence, the short term target for the same comes to 595-585. One can sell this with a stop loss of 615. Aurobindo Pharma has clearly broken down from a symmetrical triangle pattern that has been formed on the daily charts. The wave seen on the lower side has ensued and in that I think Aurobindo Pharma is likely to head towards the short term target of 689. So one can sell this with a stop loss of 745. So Auro and Cipla are shorts whereas Maruti and Granules are long."
14,2018-10-28,Cipla,"The recent guidance from the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) on complex generics is expected to provide more clarity to US-focused Indian pharmaceutical formulators in preparing and submitting abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), says a report.

This will help domestic pharma formulators with pending ANDA approvals to reduce review cycles and expedite approvals, says a weekend report by India Ratings.

The current guidance dated October 9 is specific to complex transdermal and topical products.

The agency in its mid-year FY19 pharma outlook had identified the lack of scientific and regulatory clarity about complex drugs as one of the key hurdles for approvals of complex products.

Indian pharmaceutical formulators have indicated low double-digit pricing erosion for their base portfolio at end-FY18 and were exiting highly generic commercially unviable products and pruning R&D pipeline.

The regulatory clarity will benefit formulators such as Lupin (inhalation, injectable and ophthalmic), Cadila Healthcare (inhalation and injectable), Cipla (ophthalmic, injectable and inhalation), Torrent Pharmaceuticals ( injectable, dermatology and ophthalmic), Aurobindo Pharma (ophthalmic and injectable) and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (dermatology, ophthalmic and oncology) over the near to medium term.

In this scenario, a ramp-up in the less competitive complex generic portfolio through stepping up investments is a sustainable solution, Ind-Ra noted.

According to Ind-Ra's analysis, the US transdermal market consists of 19 molecules across pain management, cardiology, gynaecology, gastro-intestinal, neurology and anti -addiction.

Among these 10 molecules there is no generic player, six molecules with one generic player and three molecules with four generic players.

Among the 10 molecules with no generic players, the patents for five molecules have expired and balance have expiries over 2019-2020 and beyond.

The transdermal molecules had a cumulative market size in the range of USD 3.5 billion-4 billion at end-2017.

Some of the large molecules in terms of market size include clonidine, estradiol, fentanyl and testosterone.

According to the analysis, the US complex topical patch market consists of four molecules across dermatology and pain management therapies.

Out of these, one molecule has two generic players (non-Indian) while the other three molecules have not been generisied.

These three molecules have patent expiring in April 2019, June 2021 and August 2027, respectively.

These molecules had a cumulative market size of around USD1.5 billion at end-2017 with lidocaine the largest molecule in terms of market size, it said.

Lupin and Dr Reddys Laboratories are the only Indian players having a presence with one molecule each in the generic transdermal space.

Indian formulators such as Cadila Healthcare, Cipla and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals have ANDAs pending approvals in the topical space while Cadila Healthcare is the only player with significant ANDA filings in the transdermal space and also has a dedicated manufacturing facility.

In FY17, Cadila Healthcare had also acquired one transdermal patch ANDA from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.

The pharmaceutical industry now also looks forward to the receipt of similar guidance on scientific, regulatory and legal issues for other complex generics as highlighted by USFDA under the Drug Competition Action Plan.

Other than transdermal, clarity is being sought by generic developers for other complex differentiated platforms such as liposomal/colloidal formulations, inhalational drug- device combinations like metered dosage inhaler, extended release injectable and ophthalmic products pending for approvals from the regulator or under development.

Indian formulators have also resorted to the acquisitions of products and technology platforms, to build niche capabilities which are at various stages of integration.

However, their ability to compete/close the gap created by large established global peers in the complex generic space will remain critical, it added."
18,2018-10-29,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Monday brought back cheers to Dalal Street!

It almost felt like an early Diwali as all key sectors, be it banks, pharma, IT and metal saw fireworks, so to say.

Market cheered RBI’s plan to buy Rs 40,000 crore worth of government bonds via open-market operations in November.

It offered relief to investors who were nervous about liquidity crunch in the market after defaults at a major infrastructure financing company.

Improved global cues, easing crude oil prices and hopes of better earnings provided further impetus to the market. Sensex settled 718 points, or 2.15 per cent, higher at 34,067, while Nifty closed at 10,250 with a gain of 221 points, or 2.20 per cent.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 2.80 per cent and 2.06 per cent, respectively, in sync with benchmark Sensex. 

Let's walk you through the key highlights of the session:


Investors made Rs 3 lakh cr in a dayMonday’s rally added over Rs 3.10 lakh crore to equity investor wealth as the collective market capitalisation of BSE listed firms shot up to Rs 1,36,42,360.50 from Rs 1,33,31,977.38. 


Who moved my SensexICICI Bank contributed the most to the Sensex rally by surging 11 per cent to Rs 349.15.

The company had reported a Rs 212.5 crore profit for the corresponding quarter last year. The stock closed with a strong gain of 12.40 per cent at Rs 77.50 on BSE. Meanwhile, in a BSE filing, the company said its board has approved the plan to raise up to Rs 5,500 crore through issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis. 


Vijaya Bank rose despite subdued Q2 earningsShares of Vijaya Bank jumped 7.02 per cent to Rs 43.45 despite having reported a 24.54 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 139.94 crore for the second quarter. The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 185.46 crore for the corresponding quarter last year. 


IndusInd Bank at 52-week lowThe stock plunged 4.78 per cent to Rs 1,376, its 52-week low on BSE and stock broke below the support at Rs 1,420, which is the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement level of the uptrend from February 29, 2016 low. This suggests the stock may fall up to the next support at Rs 1,274.15, which is the 61.8 per cent retracement level.


Sectors that made merryAmong the sectoral indices on BSE, the healthcare index surged 4.21 per cent, leading its peers. Realty, capital goods, bank, industrials and energy indices jumped over 3 per cent on BSE. 


Spurt in open interestCESC, with a change of 146.66 per cent, witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on NSE, followed by Ambuja Cements (62.33 per cent), Divi's Laboratories (57 per cent), Tata Power (40.77 per cent) and ICICI Bank (35.35 per cent).

On the contrary, 206 stocks, such as Vakrangee, Nirav Commercials, Indokem and Mansi Finance (Chennai), hit lower circuits on BSE.


82 stocks enter oversold zoneOverall, 82 stocks entered oversold zone on BSE during the session, as per the momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI. They included Kwality, Infibeam Avenues, Dilip Buildcon, Bombay Dyeing and Persistent Systems. On the other hand, 24 stocks, including Prakash Steelage, Mishtann Foods, Vani Commercials, Advance Lifestyles and Grandeur Products, entered the overbought zone on BSE.


MACD bullish on 181 stocksMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence (MACD) showed State Bank of India, Tata Motors, Edelweiss Financial Services, Tata Steel, Lupin and Canara Bank among the 181 stocks with bullish crossovers on BSE.

TeamLease Services, Gallantt Ispat and Delta Magnets featured among stocks that traded below their 200-DMA today. 


Technical outlookNifty50 made a smart rebound to settle above 10,250 mark today, forming a long bullish candle on the daily chart. The index needs to take out 10,290 level to instil confidence in the market. There is a possibility that the index can form an ‘Expanded Flat’ structure, in which case the pullback can stretch higher, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan. 

Alternatively, Nifty can take form of a Wedge pattern. “In that case the market can continue to be volatile with overall downward bias. From short-to-medium term perspective, the weight of evidence is still in favour of the bears with the possibility for Nifty to tumble back to 10,000-9,952,” the expert said. 


Global sentiment improvedAfter recent drubbings, global stocks improved on Monday as reports of positive earnings and Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign rating unchanged boosted sentiment. European shares opened in positive territory on Monday in a tentative rebound from a sell-off, Reuters reported. UK's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and French CAC 40 climbed up to 1 per cent. 


Crude oil easedGlobal crude prices eased today, bogged down by the rise in the dollar and concerns of slowing demand owing to weak economic growth. However, the prospects of a tight supply looms after US sanctions on Iran crude exports kicks in. The market is expecting an increased supply from Saudi Arabia as it has promised to keep the oil market adequately supplied. Benchmark Brent Crude and WTI Crude fell nearly half-a-percent. 


Rupee closed almost flatThe domestic currency settled 2 paise higher at 73.44 for the day. After opening 17 paise higher at 73.30 against the US dollar, the domestic unit turned flat as the greenback hovered near 10-week peak."

owned ones, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, tells ET Now. Also, Choksey remains confident on Cipla, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finserv as well as HDFC Life and would like to add these in a corrective downside.  Edited excerpts: 



Would you buy ICICI Bank and Axis Bank?
A few things have gone favourably in case of ICICI Bank. They are sitting on liquidity. They have got a shot in arm by buying the assets of NBFCs which is helping them to create a lending portfolio and at the same time, help in deployment of funds and bring clarity about the earnings. 

The third important aspect is that NCLT-led proceedings are helping most of the banks at this point of time. Given the scenario in which NCLT auctions are happening, a lesser haircut would working very positively for banks in general and some of the banks in particular. 

From all those perspectives and given the kind of valuation at which ICICI is quoting currently, one feels confident about the protection on the downside, as a result of which there could be a buy opportunity. However, the market is not very certain at this point of time

There are strong headwinds. Global markets are definitely bothering us because funds are being withdrawn from the system currently, particularly by those ETFs operating out of the country. As far as the market upset is concerned, that is where one will have to be a little bit more careful in adding stocks into the portfolio. Do not go aggressive, go gradual in your buying approach at this point of time.


Would you recommend buying anything at the current levels?
We have been selective about looking at the area and we found insurance is one area where we felt confident. At the same time, it is the life insurance business which is showing a higher traction. You are finding higher amount of growth coming into the new business premium collection and as a result, these companies are showing the CAGR possibilities of around 20% plus in their businesses. 

Given that kind of situation, the insurance business remains a favourable pick at this point of time. HDFC Life with the current embedded value to EBITDA and Bajaj Finserv with the insurance twins in their portfolio are also attractively positioned, given the growth and valuations. I would think that this is an opportunity to buy into some of the quality stocks in insurance basket, also some NBFC companies which have been affected because of the sentiment in the market.

But their books are really qualitative and we like companies like Bajaj Finance in this particular space and we like to hold this company. 

Selectively, we also find some of the auto companies demand merit. Both Maruti and Bajaj Auto are looking interesting. If there is a soft Brexit and if China starts helping Tata Motors, it could be seen as attractively positioned. Ashok Leyland has a good order book. BS-VI regulations are coming into play from next financial year. This is where companies like Ashok Leyland should be favourably looked at. So, yes, we have been selectively looking at the companies. I mentioned some of the names. We find they are attractive enough to consider them into the portfolio.


What is your view on OMCs?
Any fall in crude oil prices is definitely a benefit for OMCs and the kind of cut that they have been asked for would to a greater extent get neutralised with the fall in the oil prices. I have not got the exact calculation right now with me but I believe if we have a $10 fall, then you can easily absorb the excise cut that the government had asked for. 

In this kind of situation when the government start dictating to the oil marketing companies which are public listed companies, it is not in keeping with good corporate governance spirit and is bad for retail shareholders. So, I am a bit unhappy about it. 

I do not think that in a sector where the government intervention is regular, a ) company would demand or command higher amount of valuations. The oil marketing companies are going to be victim of this kind of situation. We have been keeping our views reserved on this subject and we have been saying that OMCs are a safe bet to avoid and that is where we are validated today. 

A better focus should be with likes of Reliance where you have larger clarity because of their ability to export their petroleum and refining products. That is where Reliance could be a better choice rather than the state OMCs.


Give me a flavour of your top three holdings.
Currently, we are invested in some of the pharma companies. The portfolio carries weight in the Cipla kind of companies, We are confident that this company would have relatively better time in the coming six months where some of the new products will get launched. You will have a better visibility of revenue coming in from their side. This is one company we are most confident about. 

The other company where we are confident now is Bajaj Auto after price correction. We believe that the company is playing its strategy right. They are systematically using their balance sheet with Rs 15,000 crore cash in the portfolio to command this particular market share. 

This company is positioning itself very well with exports and the three-wheeler, four-wheeler portfolio that they have. In the next 12 months, they would have the electric vehicles in the form of three-wheelers, four-wheelers and two-wheelers. The stock is appearing really interesting from investment perspective. 

Bajaj Finserv which I mentioned earlier, is another favourite. We continue to like the insurance businesses and that is why we put higher weight on Bajaj Finserv and HDFC Life. 

These are the few stocks which we hold in the portfolio and we would like to add in the corrective downside if the market gives further opportunity."
21,2018-10-31,Cipla,"Among top tier companies, we are bullish on TCS and Tech Mahindra. Midcap IT has largely disappointed except NIIT 
  
  
  Tech, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

Cipla, Dabur and Just Dial-- which one do you like?
The pharma and FMCG universe earnings will be closely monitored and watched out. Cipla might deliver both in terms of its core business as well as the management commentary, specifically surrounding its inhaler business.

In case of Dabur, there should be a reasonable amount of volume growth. What you witnessed in Q1 is obviously not going to get replicated but mention has to be made of the naturals portfolio which a lot of these companies are embarking upon. The direct distribution reach cuts down the wholesale dependence and a whole host of cost optimisation programmes in light of input cost inflation. It is going to be very interesting but we are expecting a reasonable amount of volume growth to play out for Dabur coupled with discretionary spending patterns and management commentary, makes the situation highly skewed towards Cipla and Dabur. 


Cognizant has narrowed its guidance in the commentary, saying banking and financial services growth is going to be lower than expected in a very weak quarter. What inference are you drawing from their statements?
The guidance from the Cognizant specifically on the BFSI vertical might act as a dampener for the IT index as a whole but we have to look at what the management commentary for our players have stated. So, TCS and Infosys where BFSI accounts for 31-32 odd per cent, green shoots are very evident. 

In fact, Infosys’ deal wins from the European banking clients is a very positive sign. TCS’ commentary surrounding the entire universe including BFSI, retail, manufacturing also are giving very encouraging trends. 

The kind of investments that these companies have done in the digital sphere and the kind of TCVs they are winning is going to be margin accretive. At the same time, the employee pyramid structure both in terms of utilisations moving higher and a control on attrition is going to have a huge effect on earnings improving gradually. We are entering into a weak phase. There are lots of furloughs, working holidays in Q3 and lots of discretionary demand patterns have to be decided by a lot of these sectors in Q4. 

The management commentaries are setting these companies on a strong footing. We continue to like top tier companies like Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra. Midcap IT has largely disappointed except NIIT Tech where the commentary was very positive.


What is the outlook for IT and your top two high conviction ideas within the IT pack?
Top tier names probably look interesting on further declines. They too decline from the current level because the commentaries have been very supportive. Having said that, Tech Mahindra’s numbers on the EBIT and EBIT front were very encouraging. They had $550- million deal wins. 

Infosys and TCS reported very strong deal wins. The kind of digital investments that these companies have made are fructifying in terms of TCVs and that will play out in terms of strong earnings. Within the top tier names, Tech Mahindra and TCS remain our picks. Within the midcap IT universe, NIIT Tech is something that I remain positive about because of $160-million order wins with quarter-on-quarter dollar revenue growth of 7.6%. That is stellar and both insurance and travel and transport verticals are doing exceedingly well for them. 

I am being selective within the IT space, but in my opinion, earnings should improve gradually over the next one to two years and digital is going to be a big base for them."

5,2018-11-19,Cipla,"We have revised our price target for Bharti Airtel upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The telecom sector is in trouble but the Bharti stock is up 52% in the last one year. What is your view?Telecom stocks particularly Bharti has really shot up. There are two or three factors behind this entire rerating and up move. One is that definitely there is a possibility of the government giving some kind of a moratorium to the telecom companies on the payment of the Rs 28,000 odd crore AGR dues that they have to pay to DoT. 

Secondly, sanity returns as we are hearing the news that both Vodafone and Bharti would consider a price hike. We do not yet know the quantum but when you see a price hike after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it. 

Most importantly, for a company like Bharti, there is an under-ownership both at the retail and institutional level because of the issues that they were grappling with. There could be a sense of urgency as far as some of the institutional investors are concerned to own stocks like Bharti. 

So, a combination of these factors are playing out. We too have revised our price target upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti.


What is happening in Glenmark?We have seen that people have turned positive selectively in the pharma stocks, either because of some revival in the US business or the fact that even the domestic market for some of these companies is huge and after the price controls, we have seen some kind of a stabilisation. We have seen some pharma companies including Sun Pharma, Divi’s Lab and Aurobindo Pharma all going up. 


When you see a price hike in telecom sector after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it.-Hemang Jani
As far as Glenmark Pharma is concerned, the stock has gone up in the last couple of days but our view has been that because of the kind of debt that they are sitting on and the fact that whatever guidance the company had earlier given in terms of growth, the actual performances have been far lower. Recently we have booked out of Glenmark Pharma so we would be more comfortable buying into a Divi’s Lab or a Cipla or a Biocon.


What are you reading into the aviation data? Finally, a positive tick has come in for October as domestic passenger traffic has grown by roughly about 4%. Would you still avoid aviation or could one buy into these stocks?When we look at the aviation sector what has really surprised me is that despite the fact that there are only two or three meaningful players, the growth has come off. Overall, because of Jet moving out of the system and the fact that the market share has gone to Indigo and maybe SpiceJet and Go. We are not able to see any meaningful performances either from Indigo or SpiceJet, even when crude prices are at a more reasonable level. 

Also, post Jet, the prices had really shot up. Insane pricing was prevailing both for the domestic as well as international market. Even when the best of the situation is there in the pricing and crude oil prices, if these companies are not able to report any worthwhile performances, then you know what is the point of trying to give them any sort of a valuation or why would one really want to go for those companies? My sense is because of certain season coming in, you might see good data points etc. but operationally none of these companies have been able to demonstrate the ability to grow EBITDA on a sustainable basis. That keeps us away from the airline space for a while.


All insurance stocks are going higher but nobody is able to tell me why at a time when the private insurance or growth numbers have declined from 20 % to 7-8%, these stocks are rising and how! SBI Life is 76% higher in last one year, ICICI Lombard 50% higher in last one year and ICICI Life , 40% higher in the last eight months?There is a preference for the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) where one can really look at a structural growth story. In terms of the growth rates having come down, I agree with you but given the fact that we have gone through so much of pain for some of the banks and particularly PSU banks and NBFCs, the investors have preferred companies where there is a non-funding exposure. 

Of course, when you look at the insurance sector per se -- be it life or general insurance space -- there is definitely a case for a significant growth from here on and typically the business model of insurance is such that initially for about five years, companies do not make profit, but after that, there is a significant ROE that one can really expect. 

Most of the companies have gone through that curve plus a lot of M&A 2 has happened. This sector overall looks quite promising. We as a house have a preference for an HDFC Life and Bajaj Finserv, because these are the two companies where we are seeing much higher visibility and much better pedigree of promoters etc. We would continue to be positive on those names."

11,2018-11-20,Cipla,"SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give at least a 30% upside from present prices, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On Aviation StocksThere has been a relative slowdown of the economy but a lot of it is getting addressed. The cost of money is definitely headed lower which means ease in travel and very lucrative rates maybe a thing of the past. Rates may start to head up. We have a buy on both the stocks on declines. There is regular bouts of profit booking which comes when IndiGo was Rs 1m750 and SpiceJet was Rs 145 . But again, these are the two listed companies. Personally, I prefer to travel by Vistara.

But on declines, this is a very consumer centric industry where 2020 should bode extremely well, given that we are very optimistic on the return of the consumer, the economy doing well and aviation as a conduit for that. 


On Telecom
Our clients have been laughing their way to the bank. We have been long on Bharti and Reliance as a disclosure and we are riding it. We think there is going to be a short term bout of profit booking which may last for two-three days but this is one sector which is going to bely most expectations. Most of the underpinnings are over. ARPUs are going to rise and we think there could be a fair package for both Vodafone and Bharti from the government.

We will work on that but we definitely think the government is going to give some relief. On the consumption side, you can see that we have been saying that ARPUs may have bottomed out and we thought that data is definitely going to get more expensive. A disclosure, Bharti, Reliance are two of our top picks. They continue to be in our portfolio and this week has been exceptionally strong for all investors who have held those shares on our account.

We are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months.-Sanjiv Bhasin


On PSU Banks
The weaker or the most hated sectors -- telecom and PSU banks are bouncing back. The Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel is a path breaking decision and the SBI chairman, smaller banks have said that write backs will be a part of the course as most of the provisioning is done. So, I am extremely positive on PSU banks. There is a Rs 70,000 crore of recapitalisation, which means almost 5.5 lakh crore of book will grow in the next three years.

We think you cannot go wrong given that yields are softening. They are awash with cash and they are going to definitely start the lending cycle on the retail side. So SBI continues to be our top pick. Along with that, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give you at least a 30% upside from present prices. 2020 may actually see PSU banks lead from the front


On Divestment 
The divestment candidates like Concor, BPCL & SCI have moved up very smartly.We think this is going to be a path breaking reform by the government. Strategic selloff last happened in 1999 and after that there has been a total hiatus. The government has decided that they have no business to be in business and that is a very positive move.

BPCL, Concor and SCI should set the cat amongst the pigeons. We are extremely positive. I think the valuations they will get will also be fairly impressive, given that all three businesses are monopolies. We have to see in the next three months, how fast the divestment takes place. The finance minister has already indicated that they should be done with it before March and it should see re-rating of the entire PSU basket. 

The government has the intension to bring down their holding to 26% in a lot of other companies like IOC and BHEL. These are all very good entry points because the unlocking of value will be huge as and when it takes place.


On Pharma Stocks
Pharma has been a very big underperformer. This is just about time where smart money is seeing rotation. By the way, pharma numbers, particularly the likes of Glenmark were very smart looking and now people have realised that pharma has consolidated enough and the worries of the FDA issues are now going to be on the backburner. Plus, generic pricing in the US may be back and they are spreading in geographies across the world. The local businesses for all of them have looked up so we are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months. 2020 could see pharma hugely outperform as a sector.


On Trends in Consumption SpaceThere are three parts. Firstly, these stocks have been the prime of most of the mutual fund portfolios. Nestle, Lever, Colgate and Asian Paints have taken the cake, even though numbers were not that sparkling. But they have been very expensive stocks and have been getting more expensive. For us, the game changer is these two three events which the government has done -- corporate tax cut, strategic disinvestment. The pass through effect of money where the mistrust is now getting allayed and you should see much easier pass through of money from banks as PSU banks start to lend very actively on all three -- discretionary, staples and durables. 

The broader basket will definitely outperform. We are not making a case for Nestle or Lever at these prices. We think in fact if the Nifty sustains over 12,000 and if we hit new highs which is just round the corner, then the broader market consumption should do extremely well. That means discretionaries like auto and select other FMCG stocks could be outperformers in 2020."

Among the sectoral indices on BSE, the BSE Telecom index was down 2 per cent. It was followed by Metal (down 0.58 per cent), Realty (down 0.48 per cent), Consumer Durables (down 0.29 per cent), Oil & Gas (down 0.28 per cent) and Power (down 0.20 per cent).

On the other hand, Capital Goods, IT and TECH on the exchange were up between 0.15 per cent and 0.70 per cent.

Data available with NSE suggested that Net-net, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were buyers in the capital market to the tune of Rs 566.52 crore on Wednesday. DIIs were also net buyers to the tune of Rs 183.41 crore, data suggests.

Rajesh Palviya, head-technical and derivatives at Axis Securities said, “The chart pattern suggests that if Nifty crosses and sustains above 12,010 levels it would witness buying which would lead the index towards 12,040-12,100 levels. However, if index breaks below 11,980 levels it would witness selling which would take the index towards 11,950-11,930.” 

Crude oil prices surged more than 2 per cent on Wednesday after a better-than-expected US crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with OPEC to keep the global oil market balanced.

The US markets ended lower on Wednesday amid reports that so-called phase one trade deal between China and the US may not be completed by the end of 2019. Other Asian peers were also trading in the red as a fresh row between Washington and Beijing over US bills on Hong Kong could complicate their trade negotiation and delay phase one deal that investors had initially hoped to be inked by now.

The Dow Jones index declined 112.93 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 27,821.09. The S&P500 index inched lower by 11.72 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 3108.46. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 43.93 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 8,526."

18,2018-11-27,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: The domestic drug industry and trade have agreed to the government’s proposal to cap trade margins for all medicines outside price control at 30%, a move that will reduce the prices of nearly 80% of formulations.

A consensus to this effect was reached at a meeting held on Friday between the drug pricing regulator, pharma lobby groups and industry associations, said people present at the meeting. The 30% cap on trade margins was preferred over other proposals such as imposing a flat 100% trade margin on all medicines, including those within price control.

“We are Ok with the rationalisation of trade margins. Whatever has been tried out with cancer drugs — fixing trade margins at 30% — we are fine with it. If it has to be extended to other products, it should be done in a phased manner,” said Deepnath Roy Chowdhury, president, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA).

Two people aware of the matter said all Indian and multinational pharma lobby groups had agreed to the 30% cap. “The margin is equivalent to 43% mark-up for the price to stockists,” said one of them.
The move is likely to hit big pharma companies with generic divisions, such as Sun Pharma, Cipla and Lupin, as they will have to reduce the maximum retail price (MRP).

Since the margins of stockists and retailers will be significantly squeezed, the lobby groups for these segments may ask manufacturers to compensate them for the loss. In 2013, when many non-scheduled drugs were brought under price control, stockists and retailers had forced manufacturers to continue to pay them a minimum 30% margin against the stipulated 24% for price-controlled drugs.


10.6k Non-Scheduled Drugs
The proposed margin cap will have an impact on a wide range of pharmaceuticals, ranging from vitamin D supplements to antibiotics. Non-scheduled drugs, or formulations outside price control, account for Rs 10,000 crore of sales in the Rs 1-lakh-crore Indian drug market.

Mankind Pharma chairman RC Juneja described the proposal to restrict trade margins at 30% as “pro-consumer”, and said the move had the backing of the industry.

“The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, IDMA and the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India were supportive and willing to follow the cancer drugs model. There were a couple of reservations. The All India Chemists and Druggists Association sought higher margins of 12.5% (for stockists) and 25% (for retailers),” said another person present at the meeting on Friday.

Some analysts are, however, not impressed. Phillip Capital analyst Surya Patra said medicines not under price control already have a 30% cap on trade margin (20% for retailers and 10% for wholesalers), and therefore there will not be any significant reduction in prices.

Trade margin is the difference between the price at which manufacturers/importers sell to stockists and the price charged to consumers. Currently, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes prices of scheduled drugs (medicines under price control). The prices of non-scheduled drugs can be raised by up to 10% a year. For nonscheduled drugs, the industry norm has been to give 10% margin to stockists and 20% to retailers. However, there have been allegations that actual margins are far higher.

By making trade margins explicit, there will be less scope for exploitation by large institutions, said one of the persons cited above. “Margins will go down for trade, making drugs cheaper,” he said.

According to data available with the health ministry, 70% of India’s total healthcare spending goes towards medicines. Data available with the department of pharmaceuticals shows that there are 10,600 non-scheduled drugs. Some industry experts present at the Friday meeting also expressed concern over distribution and availability of generic-generic drugs and traded business (commodity business model). They said these drugs — supplied to villages and small towns — have a ‘no-return policy’, where traders cannot return expired or damaged products to stockists or manufacturers.


‘NO EXCLUSIONS’
A proposal to exempt lower-priced medicines — that cost Rs 2-5 per unit — from the margin cap was also discussed. But this was opposed by consumer activists.

“We support the capping of trade margins across all non-scheduled medicines. Drugs priced less than Rs 5 per unit should not be excluded from this cap. A large population suffers from chronic diseases. Many of the medicines for managing these conditions could fall in this category. Ensuring affordable access is crucial where patients need medicines continuously,” said Malini Aisola, co-convenor of All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a grouping of several non-governmental organisations."

28,2018-11-28,Cipla,"We are allocating 30-40% in trend/momentum/higher valuation stocks; 20-25% odd on contra bets and about 25-30% in historically good performing stocks facing growth pressures, says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The massive move in ICICI Bank following the increase in MSCI weightage is now finally over, but the stock is up 40% this year. How much further can it go up in the near term?One way is to look at some other stocks from some other sectors. FMCG is the top of the mind. If we look at the performance of the stocks from those sectors, beginning 2019, there were lots of discussion on how the FMCG sector has had 3-4 years of outperformance and that 2019 will probably not be the year for FMCG. But today, at the end of the year, we see 2019 again was the year of FMCGs along with some others. 

About 12-14 months ago, ICICI Bank was at a stage wherein all the negative news had been built into its price and valuations, its financial performance. The stock price by then underperformed for almost two and a half years, based on various developments. It has come out from there, so that is one part. 

The other part is, today we are in a market where over the last one-and-a-half-year, corporate governance issues have been coming more and more in focus. As a result, for any investor -- be it global or domestic -- who is cautious about these issues, the investible universe is continuing to shrink.


Your life should be easy if the universe of investing is reducing! All you need to do is bother about 15 stocks. It has never been great for fund managers this year. Where would you go if you want to get out of those 15 stocks?Let me also now throw in my spanner. Over the last two months, Nifty rose 10% but none of the traditionally performing stocks have contributed to business.


Reliance has added.Reliance is an exception.


HDFC Bank has added. ICICI Bank has added.Let me give you some numbers.Some of the stock names that I am taking are with the disclosure and are not investment recommendations. Sun Pharma and Cipla have roughly moved 20% in the last two months. Reliance has been one outperformer. Auto stocks rose 30%. Tata Motors is one of the underdogs. Within banking, we have completely different set of stocks. YES Bank, ICICI and SBI are historical laggards. So, life is not that easy. Last two months have been difficult but over the medium term, it could probably come back to being easy.


What do you do at Rs 500 plus levels on ICICI Bank?I am still positive. We have not bought recently but we have been holding it in some of our clients portfolios.


You are not taking profits anywhere?Not right now.


It does not matter whether it is momentum or liquidity, if prices are going higher, NAVs will go higher. How do you invest in this market when growth is bad and the economy is not recovering, flows are strong and markets are at an all-time high? If you take a view on the economy, you cannot be bullish but if you take a view on the flows, you cannot be bearish!That is a very big dilemma that we face as money managers. I am sure everybody else faces it including retail investors. Sometimes you have to take the trend as an indicator. The market is telling that at the end of the day, there is one way of looking at the market and that price is God. If you take that as a hypothesis and try to analyse the July, August, September data (I have not got October data), the government expenditure has gone up. July was roughly 25% up over last year July; August was 30% up and September 35% -- both capex and opex. That probably is indicating something. 


On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence. It is difficult to justify. That makes it difficult to make money in the market.-Kunj Bansal
If the government has continued a similar expenditure in October and November, it is a matter of time that the secondary effect -- the cyclical effect of that money flow will come into the economy and things will start easing out. So that is one way to look at it. 

The second way is smart money is always ahead. The market moves at least six months ahead of what developments we are able to see as analysts or fund managers or when actual numbers come. As an investment strategy, what I am doing or what we are doing is nothing particular; but very broadly speaking, 30-40% are plays in trend/momentum/higher valuations; 20-25% odd are contra bets, say into auto and auto ancillaries. About 25-30% we are trying to play in historically good performing stocks which have faced growth pressures in the last five-six quarters because of the environment but as a result valuations are relatively cheaper. On an absolute basis you have to take a medium to long-term call.


TVS and Hero MotoCorp and Eicher in last two years would have given terrible returns. It is 36% lower for TVS Motor and 24% lower for Eicher.Let me throw in some additional numbers. Coincidentally, it was not in auto but related to it -- auto ancillaries, more specifically tyres. A similar divergence has been there if we look at five-year numbers. On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence to add to your OEM manufacturers numbers. It is difficult to justify. That makes investing very difficult and makes it difficult to make money in the market. 

Having said that, obviously some of the factors which have worked and what works for Bajaj Auto is export. Also the fact that management was very clear that at the expense of margin, at the expense of doing some discounting sales, they would focus on top line, on volumes. I do not know about the exact market share they have gained but very clearly, it worked in their favour.


Should one subscribe to the SBI Card IPO?I have not looked at the numbers in detail. Let us look at the two other IPOs. CSB Bank IPO closed recently and it was 87 times subscribed.


For a Rs 400-crore, they got Rs 4,000 crore.Where is the risk averse mindset and where is the lack of liquidity? We are going to have the Ujjivan Small Finance IPO. I am not sure if that will attract a similar kind of subscription, interest or over subscription. The reason being that today anybody -- whether a consumer who is buying goods or services in the market or an investor -- is telling me give me a good deal and my money is here. Quality should be there and value should be there. Price offering, valuations should be there. Now, that was not exactly the case with CSB Bank whose financials are not as great, but the brand name of the promoters, partly the valuation got it that kind of subscription. 

Coming to the SBI Card IPO, I still have to look at the numbers in detail but if the financial numbers are reasonably good and valuation offered is cheaper, the market is desperate for opportunities to invest. So, we should see that kind of investment.


What do you do with YES Bank? They are all set for a mega fund raising of about $1.2 billion.Something should come out now. It is high time. Because we have had the names of the sundry Tom, Dick and Harry but nothing has come till now, which is unfortunate. It should not become a story of crying wolf too many times because then the market will really be disappointed. Market has given YES Bank a benefit of doubt and has brought the share up from Rs 25-30 to almost Rs 70 today. Without any concrete development, the stock will be brought down equally fast. So let us see. 

But if we have some concrete names, some actual action on money coming in, around the current levels, YES Bank will have its floor price. From here to go up, we will continue to need developments and announcements in terms of the next one, two, three, four quarters’ financial numbers, some improvement in business, some reduction in divergence with RBI’s audit, NPA control and all those things. But the basic requirement is that capital should come in."

7,2018-12-05,Cipla,"Some on Dalal Street got a whiff of corporate governance concerns in Sun Pharmaceutical at least three weeks ago before the issue was reported in the media. Select extracts of the whistleblower’s letter, which was supposedly sent to the capital market regulator earlier, were doing the rounds on Whatsapp groups comprising foreign fund managers in first week of November, said two people privy to the development. ET reviewed the posts on one such Whatsapp groups comprising officials of offshore funds.

Various foreign investors had built bearish bets on Sun Pharma in November on expectations that the stock would drop on these allegations. Open interest or outstanding positions in Sun Pharma futures surged 30 per cent in November compared from October. Volumes in Sun shares went up 18 per cent during the month. The stock has corrected 23 per cent since November even as its peers including Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Cipla managed register gains.

A set of investors are learnt to have trimmed their exposure to the stock in cash market as well by booking profits ahead of the event, said a person cited above. After initial weakness, the selling precipitated last week after media reports suggested capital market regulator Sebi could reopen one of the insider trading cases against Sun Pharma that was settled through consent mechanism two years ago. Sebi is yet to comment on the matter.

“Our clients were asking around mid-November if Sun Pharma was facing any corporate governance issues. We were unable to verify the authenticity of the information being circulated since the source was anonymous,” said a person cited above. “Some of our clients wanted to go short on the stock essentially to hedge their cash market exposure.”

Sun Pharma is popular among institutional investors. Nearly 700 foreign investors and 49 domestic mutual fund schemes own the stock.

The head of the trading desk at a domestic brokerage said they had received several queries from the investors asking the reason behind weakness in the stock during November. “Our research team was initially of the opinion that fall in the stock was on account of weak earnings. We were not aware of the messages floating around the company until November 20.”

Sun Pharma had reported a loss of Rs 219 crore for the quarter ended September as the company made one-time provisions for a possible settlement in an antitrust case.

The leak of the letter highlights the limitations in the whistleblower law. While any confidential documents leaked by a whistleblower is protected under the law, it could be construed as insider trading if a set of people have early access to it.

“Parts of the report which pertain to loans doled out by Sun Pharma to third parties, the insider trading case that was settled and some of the conflict of interest issues raised were circulating in the groups of several FPIs,” said the second person cited above. “We advised our clients not to undertake any trading action based on the information since it is in violation of securities law.”"

The year so far has registered 14 deals in the billion-dollar category and 46 deals estimated and valued at/over USD 100 million each, together capturing 95 per cent of the total M&A deal values.

Sector-wise, telecom, e-commerce, manufacturing, energy, agriculture, banking, IT and pharma led the deal activity, capturing 93 per cent of the total deal values, the report added.

Referring to the decline in November deal tally Grant Thornton India LLP Director Pankaj Chopda said: ""The writing is on the wall that year 2018 will be record-breaking both in terms of deal value and deal volumes, but the closing may not be so grand.""

Chopda further noted that even though national elections and current global outlook will have their temporary impact, the underlying drivers for M&A transactions will be the barrier breakers and carriers of strong deal trends going forward."

15,2018-12-10,Cipla,"MUMBAI: The share of women in corporate India’s headcount is stuck at an average 20% for the past five years, an indication that the gender diversity drives some of the top companies may have not yet delivered the desired results.

A survey of Indian and multinational companies by gender consulting firm ProEves also shows that at the top levels in India, the share of women was just 12%.

The survey findings are based on inputs from 50 leading companies across sectors with offices in India, including Walt Disney, Viacom18, InMobi, Novartis, Mondelez, Flipkart, Whirlpool, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Philips. At junior levels, women account for 22% of the total employees. The share reduces to 17% at middle management, 14% at senior management and tapers further to 12% at the top level.

Compared with the US, participation of women in India is half across all employee groups. But industry expects this to change in the coming years.

“The policies (such as enhanced Maternity Benefits Act) or drives by companies to support women returning after a career break are recent in nature and we are yet to feel the good effects,” said Naina Lal Kidwai, chairman of the India Advisory Board of Advent International Private Equity. “Policies to have some impact will take some time,” she said.



Prabir Jha, head of HR at Cipla, said a larger issue was the drop out of women from the workforce due to marriage, spouse relocation, maternity and other societal commitments. “While many companies have ushered in several progressive HR policies and some legal enactments too have been provided, managers are still struggling managing their workforce planning on account of these realities,” he said.

There is an even lower representation of women in key talent programmes compared with that in the workforce, which explains why there are fewer female executives in management positions.

Sareena Singh, global head of controls assurance at RBS India, said: “Companies are fostering the right culture that complements the policies and practices … But things also should be self-driven as much as driven through ecosystems around the person itself.”

According to the ProEves Gender Diversity Survey and ROI (return on investment) on Maternity and Childcare Practices 2018, in 70% of companies fewer than 20% women participate in key talent programmes such as initiatives for high potential, promotion, leadership development and mentoring.

Women attrition is nearly 50% more than overall India attrition of 11.5%. Among women who leave their jobs, around one-third is maternity attrition.

“There still is a strong maternity bias against women,” said Divya Agarwal, cofounder of ProEves. “Maternity continues to be a key reason for woman attrition even though companies are taking cognisance of this,” she said.

Falguni Nayar, founder of beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa, said: “I don’t think there is any bias. I have 40% women here and I can see many young mothers who are extremely committed to work.”

Jha of Cipla said women attrition was often a societal conditioning than an organisational blame. For arange of family issues, women at various stages start dropping out of the workforce, he said.

In March last year, Parliament approved a Bill granting women working in the organised sector paid maternity leave of 26 weeks, up from 12 weeks.

A poll conducted by social media platform LocalCircles in May showed that startups and small businesses were reluctant to hire women after the landmark Bill. The poll, which received 2,987 votes and asked businesses how their company’s hiring has been on gender basis in the last one year, showed that 57% either hired only or mostly male employees.

Several organisations are looking at ingenious ways to stop losing talent resulting from career breaks. These include flexible work arrangements like work from home to returning mothers, providing clarity on role on return, tracking each maternity case and ensuring connect with manager or mentor."

21,2018-12-17,Cipla,"Top executives of India’s $37-billion pharmaceutical industry have a new destination on their frequent travel plan – Kanpur. The director-general of the intelligence wing for goods and services tax (GST) in Kanpur has issued summons to drug makers, asking for voluminous data related to supplies for the past year. The companies are being prodded to reverse claims of input tax credit in respect of free samples supplied as part of their promotion efforts.

The executives have to frequent the city to record statements or make submissions before authorities.

GST, the one-nation, one-tax measure that led to the collapse of geographic boundaries within the country for businesses, has also opened up newer horizons – quite literally so – in terms of tax disputes.

Tax authorities are holding manufacturers responsible for loss of revenue at any level. The tax head of a leading pharma company, who did not wish to be identified, said most drug manufacturers have been affected. “It must have been decided to open up investigations in Kanpur, so most cases are here,” he said.




The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) based in Mumbai approached the government with a representation earlier this month. IPA is a representative body of top researchbased drug companies including Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Cipla and Lupin.

“The law is clear. The government has clarified the provision of law through FAQ. All doubts are removed. In spite of such clarity, when inspectors summon industry and start harassing them, the government ends up inviting the wrath and frustration of the industry. It is a pity the government is unable to claim credit for its reforms,” said DG Shah, secretary-general, IPA.

The current investigation pertains to the popular practice of freebies offered by drug companies. Free samples, buy one and get one free and additional quantities for the same price are the fulcrum of marketing for key sectors such as pharma, FMCG, food chains and retailers. Under the GST law, a company is liable to reverse input tax credit on free samples.

The GST Law Review Committee had said in a report the total consideration paid for such goods should be chargeable to GST and input tax credit should not be denied in such cases, but the issue is yet to be taken up by the GST Council, the apex decision-making body for the tax regime that subsumed central and state indirect taxes.

The Council is scheduled to meet on December 22, but it is not clear whether this issue will figure in the deliberations. The IPA has sought government intervention to halt the ongoing investigation till the issue is taken up and clarified.

“The issue of discounts or incentives offered under various trade schemes is relevant for various sectors, including FMCG and consumer durables, in addition to the pharma industry,” said Sumit Lunker, partner, indirect tax, PwC.

“We understand the issue is being examined by CBIC (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs) and a detailed circular/clarification may be issued in consultation with the GST Council. It might be better to keep these investigations on hold in the interim.”"
22,2018-12-18,Cipla,"The change of language to paid-up equity capital from paid-up capital tilted the scales against Kotak Bank, said Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC. He told ETNow that the recent spate of farm loan waivers will only spark a competitive race. 


Edited excerpts:


Tata Motors was the top winner in the market. Yes, it is still down nearly 60 per cent in all of 2018 and perhaps the biggest disappointing story the D-Street has had in the last decade. They are tying up with BCG, they are looking at a turnaround plan of as large as $3.2 billion. Could this really make the market want to give Tata Motors a second chance?

You are right, Tata Motors is down about 60 per cent and makes it a very inexpensive stock. At current levels on one hand, you have operational issues with demand slowing down. They have to cut costs, they are going to cut about 2.5 billion pounds worth of costs. On the other hand, you have a slightly more unknown issue which is because of Brexit. Given the nature of Brexit, what will they do to their suppliers who are in various parts of EU? 

Now if there is no clear negotiation and Brexit timetable is met, then a lot of their costs with the suppliers spread across the EU is likely to go up significantly. And you cannot relocate plants or find new suppliers to sort out order that easily. So demand and cost uncertainty will continue to weigh on the stock. Even though the stock is down about 60 per cent odd, we will still stay away for some time. 


How should one read into the Kotak Mahindra episode, there was a media report that Berkshire Hathaway is talking to them and the stock went up, then they went to court against RBI and the court said look nothing doing, you are going to follow RBI as your regulator, do not come crying to us. Despite that communication, which came from the court, the stock has not really cracked back to original levels. What are markets betting on, what is the thought according to you?

Well, we think of Kotak actually. If there is any weakness, you should use it to buy. Second, as far as the RBI is concerned, they said paid up capital, they changed the language and said paid up equity capital. Now changing is like changing the rules of the game midway. From a legal perspective, Kotak has a very strong case. 

Come January 17, when they meet again this is likely to be a topic which will probably, hopefully buy them some more time. Even post the dilution, the valuation looks even more attractive. 

It is a different question that what will they do with the extra capital because then they would not need capital for the next few years to come. But the valuation itself becomes far more attractive post the capital raising of the Rs 23,000 crore odd. The court will likely see merit in Kotak’s current stance. 



 NTPC and Power Grid held out very well after the draft tariff regulations came about for 2020-24. Is this a space you would be willing to look at?

The regulations largely leave the situation unchanged. Capital structure of 30:70, equity debt is largely the same, ROA 15.5 per cent and the only thing that they have kind of played around with is the plant load factors adjusting it for maintenance. This means largely it is not going to make much of an impact to their earnings and cash flows. Cash flows will probably get a little bit tougher because of the new coal arrangements that they have. From that perspective, Power Grid and NTPC stocks though inexpensive are unlikely to rerate much upwards. 



The current loss of incumbent governments has been largely because of rural distress and I guess everyone has recognised that. Farm loan waiver has been a tool which has been used by various political parties in order to attract rural votes and I get a sense that in the run-up to the general election, this will only amplify and multiply.

You are absolutely right about that and if you look back at whether it is Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat elections last year, there were farm loan waivers and now that Madhya Pradesh has announced, you will get into a competitive kind of a bidding where just about this is going to be a poll strategy. 

And like you rightly pointed out it is going to be borne by the states rather than by the banks and again as you pointed out now, we are already seeing infrastructure slowing down, 20,000 kilometres worth of road projects were announced for 2019, of which only about 900 kms has actually been executed. 

While the order book will look strong, the execution is what drives earnings and that is not going to be seen at least in the run-up to the elections. So from that perspective yes, infrastructure and road companies do not have an earnings per se. We are likely to stay away from them. 



Where is your leaning when it comes to pharmaceuticals and what are the names you are completely avoiding right now?

In pharmaceuticals, we are still like export names, still about 60-70 per cent goes to the US and also kind of being a staple kind of a product and demand is unlikely to come down whether the US economy does well or bad. So earnings are intact. If anything, there will be an acceleration of earnings because last year's FDA problems are not going to be there next year. We like Dr Reddy’s in spite of the uncertainty of its new product launch. We still like Cadila and Cipla at these levels because the earnings growth for the next year is accelerating.



Why do you like Cadila?

Cadila has both -- a good export component as well their domestic bit are also improving. And earnings, for all these companies you are likely to see an earnings acceleration next year.


You are not worried about what they are trying to do with Zydus. Zydus has gone and acquired a big brand and Cadila in a sense is ringfencing them, some would argue that big brother is actually subsidising the small brother to acquire this big acquisition.

Yes, indeed. That is a concern. It is a big concern and I think there will be some kind of a restructuring post that because they are unlikely to keep a consumer company and a pharma company under this -- so that will happen. But despite that I think we still have a good -- because the valuations are not demanding at all."

Ongoing challenges: Cipla is facing multiple issues: (1) Supply constraints due to capacity rebalancing have cut quarterly sales by Rs about 100 crore; (2) Iran and Yemen sales are expected to decline from US$ 70-80mn in FY18 to US$ 30-40mn for FY19E due to geopolitical concerns; and (3) The South Africa tender biz (40 per cent of SA sales) could face double-digit price erosion. We expect these issues to normalize in FY20/21.


Guidance: Resolving supply constraints, acceleration in the US business and traction gained in India and SA branded businesses will drive revenue growth at 10 per cent plus over FY20-21E. Cost rationalization, a ramp-up in the US, and rebalancing within segments will help maintain EBITDA margin at 18-20 per cent.


Focus on DTM: Quarterly US sales to reach US$ 120-130mn by FY19-end. The DTM is growing at double digits and should cross US$ 180-200mn in sales this year. B2B revenue slumped from US$ 150mn (FY18) to US$ about 70mn now, having largely bottomed-out. The low-margin Invagen business is likely to remain flat. Lucrative launches over FY20-21 include gProventil, Tramadol, and potentially gAdvair.


Growing branded businesses: Domestic growth (12-14 per cent) will be led by in-licensed products and chronic therapies, with the acute portfolio remaining steady. South Africa’s private business is growing at 14 per cent, 2-3x the market rate. The Mirren acquisition is a high-margin OTC business, growing at strong double-digits."

6,2019-01-09,Cipla,"Risk return metrics currently is not very favourable for Indian generic pharma companies even if the EPS base is
  
  
  low, Surajit Pal, AVP, analyst-pharma, Prabhudas Lilladher, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Do you expect the US generic market to drastically improve on an absolute terms from hereafter?
Drastic improvement? The answer is no. Over last three, three and a half years, prices have fallen 10-12%. That could stabilise at around 8-10%. But there is no change in terms of increase in number of buyers.

That means the demand or number of buyers remains the same. So, further consolidation may not happen. As a result, you cannot expect any drastic improvement in the market. Ratherm the Teva guy also said a similar thing in 2016 which contradicted by McKesson at that point of time.

If Teva is right then why is it withdrawing so many products from the market? So, even if those percentages came down, remember there are many companies sitting with much bigger capacities. For example, Ipca got approval and they have a huge capacity. They will enter the market with much more price correction because currently their revenue is zero. So is the case with Stride. It has so many products in older molecules. Even if Teva Sandoz comes out of many products, there is no dearth of companies who can keep on supplying. 

So do not expect any drastic improvement. 


What is you view on how a lot of big companies are focussing on cost cutting initiatives which will pave the way for 2019? Do you think the benefits of cost cutting will come through in the margin soon enough?
It is tough to say. We have an example in the last three four years. Sun Pharma is one example or currently what we are seeing in Cipla and Dr Reddy’s. There is a lot of cost cutting but that does not lead to increase in margin. 

Even if I see that, when tough times started for Indian guys, for all the Indian generic companies, the average margins used to be 25% at 2014-end or 2015. 

 The basic difference came from US market. The overall margin for these big guys has come down from 25-30% (for Sun Pharma 40% plus). Currently, everybody is talking about below 20% margins. Most the guys are very happy settling around 15-18%, 16%. Some of the guys in many quarters have given 12-13%, 14% if you remove the other operating income. 

So basically, this is the scenario. So yes, the slide could be restricted to a certain extent but do not expect that will lead to an increase in margin, at least in the near term .


Do you think the pharma sector earnings are coming off a low base and we will see a big improvement in their earnings and will that really drive stock prices higher as well?
There are two issues before one can expect margin to improve. Definitely the base is lower, there is no doubt on it. Does it mean that will it go up on that lower base? No, because the market scenario has been changed, as has the macroeconomic scenario.

This means to continue at 10% plus, a company has to invest in R&D. It will be spending so much of money to launch the products that for 18-24 months, you cannot expect any profit. You can definitely do all those things on your excel sheet, assuming success but success is not that easily available because had that been a case, then Teva, Mylon those who are at least five years ahead of us in terms of generic business, would not have bene foreseeing little revenue from the specialty product, which is basically an improvement on existing generics.

So it is a matter of debate how many of the typical Indian companies which are getting into that business will be successful. Between 2002 and 2015, only three specialty products succeeded and all three belong to Ranbaxy. The other guys who launched those products did not get much success. So, it is a totally new water altogether. We have to wait to see how is has come out for them because they spent a lot of money assuming that they will come off very good and I am giving them the assumption that there is too much of risk. So risk return metrics currently is not very favourable for Indian companies even if the EPS base is low."

13,2019-01-21,Cipla,"Sun Pharma has lost one-fourth of its value in the past two months in the wake of allegations of corporate governance violation made in the two complaints raised by a whistleblower. While many investors have burnt their fingers remaining invested in Sun Pharma till now, some would still be tempted to buy it at current levels. It would be better to wait and watch before clarity emerges. Here are the five things to consider before one invests in Sun Pharma:


PREMIUM VALUATIONS
Despite the steady correction, the Sun Pharma stock is still the highest valued among the top five Indian pharma companies. Its stock is valued at 3.4 times its consolidated revenues – while its peer Aurobindo Pharma is at 2.6 times, Lupin at 2.5, Cipla at 2.7 and Dr Reddy’s and Cadila Healthcare at 3 times each. It's trading at 35 times its earnings versus the price-to-earnings multiple of 26.7 of ET Pharma Index. This indicates there is still room for valuations to correct from the current levels.


ALLEGATIONS ARE SERIOUS
The allegations by the whistle blower are serious in nature - right from loans advanced to the related party largest distributor to the distributor having sales transactions of thousands of crores with a realty company owned by one of the promoters. Even before any formal regulatory verdict, the allegations have already cast aspersions on the way the pharma industry’s largest player is being run. If proved, they will have negative repercussions for the management, stakeholders and investors.


PROBLEM COULD BE BIGGERTHAN WHAT MEETS THE EYE
While the Street has sharply reacted on the basis of the little information about the contents of the two complaints, the regulator is yet to break its silence on the company. Sebi is yet to affirm or deny the violation of corporate governance making it difficult to presume how Sebi would act on the allegations. There could be more to the corporate governance violations than what is in the public. The management, on its part, was not able to assuage the concerns of the investor community in its call last month in the aftermath of the first whistle blower complaint.


BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS STILL STRONG
Sun Pharma is India’s largest pharma company with a 8.3 per cent share of the Rs 1,26,000 crore domestic market. It is the fifth largest generic company in the US and earns over a third of its Rs 27,000+ crore revenues from the US. For the company that had a track record of meeting investor’s expectations, the performance in the past couple of years has been disappointing on account of business headwinds and USFDA clamp downs. Its growth outlook still remains promising – thanks to its fo cus on specialty drugs and strategic acquisitions across geographies. The promoters’ stake in the company, at 54 per cent stake, has remained unchanged since the past four years.

Incidentally, Japanese drug major Daiichi Sankyo had sold its entire stake of 8.9 per cent in Sun Pharma in April 2015 – a year after the latter acquired Ranbaxy Labs.


STAKES INVOLVED ARE HIGH
Sun Pharma is the world’s fourth largest specialty generic pharma company. Its global presence is supported through its 42 manufacturing facilities across six continents. The company’s founder Dilip Shanghvi is the sixth richest Indian on the Bloomberg Billionaire list and is the member on the board of the RBI. Sun Pharma has a high institutional shareholding of 17.1 per cent of FIIs and 16.5 per cent of DIIs.


Given the high stakes involved, the management would be keen to bring the company’s reputation and management’s credibility back on track.

In the last month’s call with the investors, the management had indicated its amenability to make changes to better adhere to corporate governance standards."

17,2019-01-25,Cipla,"The Economic Times Family Business Awards, now in their second year, have established a benchmark in recognising outstanding performance and not just in terms of financial growth. They also reflect how well business families have managed themselves and their internal relationships, their companies, boards, CEOs and senior management.

Shekhar Bajaj, chairman and MD of Bajaj Electricals, said leadership holds the key.

“Very few (family business) groups continue after the third generation,” he said. “Ours is the fourth generation that is continuing and that is owed to leadership. The most important thing that I feel is that a leader should lead by example and that’s what has been one of the factors that has kept us together.”

The Bajaj Group won the mega companies award.

After retiring from an active role, Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala said the board asked him to clearly define roles and split responsibilities between himself and the managing director.

“Now, 24x7 my mind is on (the business) but my hands are off,” said the winner of the business governance award.

“I have periodic review meetings and identify a strategy for the short term of twothree years. Every two years we also do a study on the culture of the organisation and make sure the culture is maintained.” The lack of a governance structure and cohesion can spell doom, said Arun Bharat Ram, chairman of SRF, which won the large companies award.

“I had told them (his two sons) that they have to prove themselves capable of running the company or else, even if I retire, I will hire an MD,” he said. “And the board played an active role in deciding if they were ready. Both my sons are now running the company.”

Vinati Saraf, MD and CEO of Vinati Organics, said the role of women needed to be recognised.

“It’s actually high time that we in family businesses started realising that women can add equal value as male members do,” said the winner of the outstanding woman entrepreneur award. “Women need to be confident of their abilities. They need to be proud of their strengths and men need to support that and I'm lucky I have had that support from my father and my husband and also I have never felt different because I'm a woman as the employees have never differentiated on that basis That has maybe helped.”

Rafique Abdul Malik, chairman of Metro Shoes, echoed this point.

“I have had a great team of professionals that has assisted me but I'm so proud and happy that my daughters have joined the business and they bring in the same passion and fondness for the business that I have,” he said. “It's so enlightening because you can see your legacy growing and I think if family businesses work, they are brilliant. My daughters also bring in a totally different perspective.”

Metro Shoes won the emerging companies award.

HCL founder Shiv Nadar, who was declared philanthropist of the year, said it was his mother who inspired him.

“My mother said, ‘Your planning is excellent but you should set aside something which is for others.’ That is the first time I started looking at philanthropy,” he said.

Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied, who won the lifetime achievement award, also said that giving back to society was a key element.

“Success doesn’t make a company, an individual or a family great. What matters is the social contribution.”

Listed businesses need to keep in mind their responsibility to employees and shareholders, said SRF’s Ram.

“For many listed family businesses, we have to be responsible to all shareholders as well as people working in the company,” he said. “We have to be cognisant of the fact that we are “trustees” of not just the family but all stakeholders.”

Chairman and MD of Allcargo Logistics Shashi Kiran Shetty, who won global visionary award, has a clear principle that informs his decisions.

“I have always paid attention to good governance and to have checks and balances in the organisation and always had the foresight to think about having the right management and create shareholder value,” he said."

23,2019-01-30,Cipla,"Mumbai: Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma said it has launched in India valsartan-sacubitril, a drug used for heart ailment, under its brand name Valsac. In doing so, the homegrown drug maker has set the stage for a patent challenge from Swiss drug maker Novartis, which is rapidly building on Vymada, its patented brand in India.

The drug is used to cut the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with congestive heart failure and works by relaxing blood vessels. Novartis sells the same brand as Entresto in the US and other major markets.

Natco Pharma said in a release the tablets will be priced affordably in 50 mg and 100 mg strengths at an MRP of Rs 45 and Rs 55 per tablet. According to Pharma Sahi Daam App of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, the price of a pack size of 14 tablets of Vymada (24/26 mg) is Rs 977.50. Lupin and Cipla are the other two drug makers selling the product at the same price.

According to data from AIOCD PharmaTrac, an agency that closely tracks pharmaceutical sales, Vymada had sales of Rs 68.3 crore for December 2018 on the moving annual turnover (MAT).


As a class, valsartan-sacubitril combination is valued at Rs 124 crore on MAT basis together with sales of Cidmus branded by Lupin at Rs 38 crore and Azmarda of Cipla at Rs 22 crore. According to patent experts, Novartis will most likely file a patent challenge case against Natco’s launch. The earliest patent expiration of valsartan-sacubitril is expected to be in 2023.

“Novartis is aware that Natco has announced launch of a generic version of valsartan-sacubitril and is currently evaluating its options,” a spokesperson for Novartis told ET.

Sources said the launch by Natco dares Novartis given that most large Indian drug makers have shed their aggressive positions and are aligned with global drug makers. They are teaming up to jointly to sell top brands in India. Also, a legal challenge appears more likely as Entresto is identified by Novartis as one of its potential blockbusters. The drug had grossed global sales of around $500 million in 2017 and analysts expect it may be close to doubling that number in 2018 and may peak at $2.2 billion by 2022.

Notably, Novartis and Natco (alongside Cipla) were engaged in a fierce and longdrawn patent battle over anti-cancer drug Glivec."

The figure came short of Rs 365 crore profit as estimated by analysts in an ET Now poll. 

The company had reported Rs 400.51 crore profit in the year-ago quarter. 


Here are some key third quarter earnings takeaways of the drugmaker: 


Sales rise, but... : Sales for the quarter rose to Rs 3,906.20 from Rs 3,834.49 crore in the year-ago quarter. But it fell short of ET Now poll estimate of Rs 4,150 crore.


Pharma gains clout: The pharma segment accounted for Rs 3,970.79 crore towards the revenue pie, up from Rs 3,885.75 crore a year ago. 


CEO's take: ""This quarter, our US business has delivered strongly as a result of scale-up of new launches. We are tracking well on our guidance on limited competition launches and ANDA approvals. Overall, challenges in this quarter were along expected lines and we remain optimistic as we enter FY20. Our plan to drive YoY growth from the coming quarters in on track. Our key focus markets remain growth anchors, we have built further on our existing specialty pipeline,"" said MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra.

8,2019-02-06,Cipla,"Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended their rally into the fifth straight session on Wednesday, led by buying in metal and auto stocks amid brisk buying by domestic and foreign institutional investors.

The 30-share Sensex closed 358 points, or 0.98 per cent, higher at 36,975, while 50-share Nifty settled 128 points, or 1.17 per cent, up at 11,062.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said the market rallied 1 per cent led by broadbased buying across sectors, and Nifty breached its narrow trading band of 10,650-10,950 on expectation of a shift in RBI’s policy stance and strong FII inflows.

“Additionally, a drop in bond yield and marginal strength in rupee adding strength to this expectation,” he said.


Let’s take a look at the highlights of Wednesday's session: 

Midcaps underperformedThe BSE Midcap index settled 0.12 per cent down at 14,425 with Reliance Infrastructure falling 32 per cent, followed by Tata Chemicals (down 8.18 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 6.80 per cent).

Infosys hits record highShares of country’s second largest software services exporter Infosys gained as much as 1.6 per cent to a record high of Rs 766.

The stock broke above its resistance at Rs 759.8, the 50 per cent Fibonacci projection level of the uptrend from August 22, 2017 low to October 1, 2018 high, according to Reuters.

Zee Entertainment ralliesShares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises rose 6.20 per cent to Rs 387. Promoters of Zeel, the flagship firm of troubled Essel group, said they are open to selling over 50 per cent of their holdings in the firm as a part of asset monetisation to repay debt, and are in talks with more than two investors.

“Tepid growth is expected with no major boost in the US nor India formulations. Expect US revenues to be $115 million with launches of 3-4 limited competition drugs in 12 months.

3,2019-02-06,Cipla,"At least for next two, three quarters, sugar industry may do exceedingly well. But if you are a new entrant, wait for dips, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities Pvt Ltd, tells ET Now.


Edited excerpts:

What is your own understanding of the Jubilant FoodWorks saga? 
  
  
  
It was a move in bad intent and shows very scant respect for minority shareholders from the Jubilant promoters. It is not a step in the right direction and will certainly impact valuations as well as investor conviction in the stock, at a time when both Jubilant FoodWorks and Jubilant Lifesciences are both doing exceedingly well. Both these companies have come out with a good set of numbers. Markets are rewarding them for their exceptional performance and then this move from the promoters! It is hardly going to make any difference in terms of the payout but in terms of the PE multiple, it has a larger effect. It is good that the promoters have withdrawn it but by and large it is a bad move, not well thought out, Hopefully, the promoters have learnt something out of this particular controversy which they have created. 


Are you tracking Cipla or Lupin closely?
Not closely. Given the pharmaceutical industry scenario, we have been generally very underweight in the entire pharma pack be it Lupin, Sun Pharma or Cipla, Dr Reddy’s or any of the other Indian pharma companies. There is a high degree of commoditisation within the sector. It is not just US generics where there is intense price competition, but elsewhere also -- in domestic market and in Europe and other emerging markets -- there is intense competition and pressure on pricing. Companies are unable to pass on cost increases. Overall return on investment has significantly reduced for the industry as a whole so from that point of view it does not appeal to us as an investor in most of the pharma companies. 

Also, one more aspect to consider is a high degree of volatility in their earnings and no doubt pharma companies are trying to go up the specialised drug route but that is a long arduous journey fraught with a lot of risk and R&D expense at their end. The full picture does not seem to be that interesting or appealing from a short, medium or long-term point of view. There could be a few exceptions like Biocon which are IP-based businesses or contract manufacturing companies like Jubilant Life or even Divi’s Laboratories, Dishman Carbogen and Suven Life Sciences, but by and large, the large pharma companies focussing on US generic market need to be avoided. 


Do you see merit in the sugar or related stories? The results of Praj, Balrampur Chini seem to be indicating that the ethanol story has just about begun and it is here it stay.
There is a cyclical upswing in the sugar industry and you cannot deny that and that is reflected in the performance and the stock prices of sugar companies. But end of the day, it is driven by government policies and you may not have the same government a few months from now. 

Oil prices may further drip lower to the $40 barrel and that may change the resolve or the strategy behind ethanol blending. We have seen this stop-start as far as ethanol blending is concerned and no doubt this time the efforts have been the best ever from the government, the kind of price increases that the sugar industry have been given and other incentives to set up ethanol plants have been unprecedented. 

But since it is a cyclical business, once the base effect catches up and prices cool off and it is only the volume growth which comes to play. At that time, the results of these companies flattening out but that is still some distance away. In the interim, at least for the next two, three quarters or so, sugar industry may do exceedingly well and companies such as Praj which provide capital equipment to the industry also should do exceedingly well because of higher orders and higher margins and better operating leverages. If you are invested in sugar industry, it is best to remain invested and ride the bull market taking place over there. From a fresh investment perspective, it is better to just wait for a correction."

12,2019-02-07,Cipla,"HDFC Securities has a buy call on Cipla with a target price of Rs 605.

The current market price of Cipla is Rs 533.5.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Cipla price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage: Cipla’s reported an in-line quarter with revenue at Rs 4,010 crore, up 2 per cent YoY/ flat QoQ. EBITDA stood at Rs 710 crore with margin at 17.7 per cent, down 326bps YoY due to continued API cost inflation and falling prices in the tender business. PAT at Rs 330 crore was down 17/12 per cent YoY/QoQ (in-line). 

With a nearly 9 per cent QoQ jump in US revenues (US$ 118mn), Cipla will most likely overshoot its guidance of US$ 125mn US revenues in 4Q. The company has consistently launched niche products over the last few quarters, which has finally started reflecting in its US topline. 

As we had mentioned in our Dec-18 update, the ongoing issues related to supply constraints, geopolitical troubles in Yemen/ Iran and high inflation in API costs are temporary and have already been priced-in as the stock corrected nearly 22 per cent from Rs 670 in Sep-18.

Going ahead, resolution of these issues in 1-2 quarters along with further scale up in the US on the back of niche launches like gProventil and Tramadol will drive 14/33 per cent rev/earnings CAGR (FY19-21E). 

The stock is trading at 24.6/18.3x FY20/21E EPS, about a 15 per cent discount to its historical average. Maintain BUY with a target price of Rs 605 (22x Dec-20E EPS)."

9,2019-02-07,Cipla,"Mumbai: India’s leading drug makers Lupin and Cipla both reported slowing growth and fall in profit but a better performance in the US market may increase the appeal of Cipla among investors, analysts said.

Overall marginal growth at Cipla masked an 18 per cent expansion rate in the US, something that the Street cheered. Although a late entrant, Cipla has been steadily working on making its presence felt in the US generics market – posting the second quarter of sequential growth in sales. The US now contributes a fifth of the company’s consolidated revenues (on a nine-month basis). Limited competition products and an increasing pipeline of specialty treatments are the levers through which Cipla intends to increase its footprint in the US.

The domestic business grew 6 per cent, showing the impact of a high base effect. Cipla has nevertheless been outperforming the industry, aided by its chronic drug portfolio and the management has targeted double-digit growth in the current quarter.

Analysts are largely bullish on Cipla, while many are bearish on Lupin. More than half the 44 analysts tracking Cipla are bullish on the stock, setting a target price that is 7 per cent higher.



Cipla reported a 17 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 332.5 crore while Lupin reported a net loss of Rs 152 crore, owing to provisions for litigation. Lupin’s revenue climbed 22 per cent to Rs 3,092 crore, while Cipla’s sales expanded marginally to Rs 3,906 crore.

Both companies still sounded optimistic.

“We are now starting to see growth in the US. The growth momentum in the US will continue into the next quarter as we are on track with important launches,” said Nilesh Gupta, MD Lupin. It made a provision of €42.8 million (Rs 342 crore) for a fine upheld in Lupin's appeal against the European Commission’s 2014 decision in the Perindopril drug litigation.

After a poor show in the first half of the fiscal, Lupin’s third quarter was sequentially better. Excluding the one-off provision, the operating margin improved from the immediately preceding quarter. The US business too posted sales growth of 13 per cent — on the back of product launches and stabilisation of price erosion.

The price fall in the coming quarters is expected to be in single digits, unlike double digits in the previous quarters. There are several product launches in the near term, signalling that the improvement may continue. Growth and cost cuts are leading the management to believe that the EBITDA margin can be maintained at 18-20 per cent in the coming quarters.



US Show a Plus for Cipla

Lupin has seen changes at the top of late. Vice-chairman Kamal Sharma moved into a non-executive role last September and CFO Ramesh Swaminathan resigned in December.

Regulatory action, litigation concerns and headwinds in the US business could limit the upside potential at Lupin. USFDA warning for some of its key manufacturing sites is the major overhang on Lupin’s prospects. It is no surprise that about half of the 42 analysts tracking the Lupin stock have a sell recommendation on it with a target price that is 1.7 per cent lower. The stock is valued at 2.3 times its trailing four-quarter revenues."

17,2019-02-14,Cipla,"DHFL is in a very precarious situation I do not think there is any room right now for equity holders over there if 
  
  
  bond holders are not feeling safe, Mukul Kochhar, Head of Institutional Sales, Investec Capital Services, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:

What would Teva’s guidance cut mean for Indian generics? Should pharma be an avoid for now?
It is very stock specific. It is very molecule dependent and this is dependent upon the nature of your portfolio. At the end of the day, the most important thing is valuation. Most of these companies are still trading north of 20 times one year forward. So valuation is not that comfortable yet. 

If you look at some of the portfolios, for example, Dr Reddy’s, most of the forward EPS numbers which people are anchoring on, are supported by two or three blockbuster drugs in the pipeline. If these drugs do not deliver as expected, you will see them downgraded. 

Dr Reddy’s is one stock which is especially exposed to incremental competition in new drugs. But we are fairly comfortable with Aurobindo Pharma, which has a very well diversified portfolio and whose forward earnings are not dependent on two or three molecules. We are comfortable with Cipla as well. Based on valuation, we are willing to get into Sun Pharma as well. It is an excellent franchise but they are spending a lot on innovation which may pressure near term returns, but honestly it is a stock that you can get in. It remains very stock-specific and despite correcting substantially, pharma is not a blanket buy yet. 


How have you assessed the quarterly earnings that we have seen so far? Is the pain likely to be a bit more prolonged when it comes to autos or is there a specific basket that you like within the space?
At the end of the day, it is all about valuations for all stocks. In the auto space as well, valuations had expanded for some of the names and this was on top margin expansion which came on weak commodities. Now the margin is correcting. One big trend that you saw in the quarter was where there is limited pricing power in the near term. As expenses go up, margins correct and when margins correct, you see earnings downside to forward estimates. If valuations are pricey, the stocks will correct, as it happened with Eicher Motors, Maruti. 

But Bajaj Auto survived the carnage because the numbers were already okay, valuation was fairly comfortable and so once again, it was a little bit stock-specific. One thing I would probably mention on trends is discretionary versus staples. There is a significant difference in performances of discretionary versus staples. Staples are very well supported by rural spending. So, contrary to noise out there that rural is very weak, the commentary from companies and consumption performance is really strong and it is underpinned by a strong rural demand. 

Honestly, consumption is okay but in discretionary consumption basket, especially auto stock specific performance based on valuation, you have to be a little nuanced out here. What I mean to say is that it is not essentially a blanket consumption play in autos. It is quite stock specific. 


Coming to YES Bank, two big uncertainties now behind us. Would you say that YES Bank is an investment case now or would you still stick it out with ICICI Bank and Axis?
YES Bank certainly has a place in some client’s portfolio. You have to remember different clients have different risk appetite, different investment strategies. What the divergence report definitely answers is whether or not the problems are getting reported right away in the current book. It does not mean that there is no risk on the book because banks essentially are in the business of capital allocation. Risk reward is a big part of their play. 

There could be problems lurking somewhere but what it gives certainly is a stamp of approval that the auditing is up to mark. If there were hidden problems, there are none there. And honestly, through the auditing process of RBI, YES Bank has not performed as poorly as perception dictates. Credit cost has been very contained, problems have been relatively okay. However, given the volatility in the stock, I am not sure how many institutional investors can take it given that they are answerable to their boards, to the unit holders, etc. 

But if you ask me, personally if somebody can overlook the volatility, the risk-reward here is quite favourable. It is 1.2 times price to book. RBI has given it a stamp of approval. Some of the management issues, questions have been answered although we still need to see how the relationship between the new CEO and the erstwhile promoter plays out and one or two years will probably show how that relationship works in the longer run. But the stock risk reward at 1.2 times price to book is fairly okay. 

YES Bank has built a decent retail franchise over the years. It is a reasonably high ROE bank. The current book is okay. It is not running off. CASA franchise was built okay. Remember it is a bank, not an NBFC. The bank has some residual franchise. I am okay with it as long as investors understand that it is a volatile, news-flow driven stock, although lot of the bad news flow seems to be behind. However, what will be questioned is some of their exposure to DHFL Group which one should be open about. There are others involved in that segment as well. So, some of these questions will linger but at 1.2 times price to book, the risk reward at least seems favourable.


What is your view on DHFL and the problem it could create for other NBFCs, banks and mutual funds? Is the water still very muddy?
DHFL is in an interesting situation right now. One must remember about finance companies and this is true for banks as well. At the end of the day, nobody knows the true nature of the book. So, trust in management is exceptionally important for the capital markets and I would say capital market participants include the mutual funds, debt mutual funds, bond holders -- pretty much everybody who is involved in the ecosystem. 

Out here, the resignation of the CEO does not help. It does not give a good signal to the market of the nature of the book and if people lose confidence, you can get flows out of the company in terms of liquidity etc which can actually exacerbate the problem even if none is there. 

DHFL is in a very precarious situation I do not think there is any room right now for equity holders over there if bond holders are not feeling safe. I am not even sure how to value that right now. The only thing I can mention is that in an election year, the government cannot afford a disaster of this magnitude. There will be support at some level or the other for getting this company going, but for equity holders, there is some amount of value and you should get in. But for equity holders, it is an avoid."

22,2019-02-21,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: The pharma sector took a breather in December quarter, after steep downgrades all through the first half of FY19. While headwinds still persist, analysts say the industry seems to be looking up.

If that’s true, select pharma stocks can be good buying opportunity for investors at prevailing valuations. 

The domestic pharma industry can be divided into three categories. The first would be the drug makers focused mainly on exports such as Sun Pharma (70 per cent revenue from exports), Dr Reddy’s Labs (75 per cent), Cadila Healthcare (70 per cent), Lupin (70 per cent) and Wockhardt (62-65 per cent).

Players in the second category generate a good proportion of their revenues from the domestic market. They include companies like Cipla (over 40 per cent of revenue from domestic market), Ajanta Pharma (around 35 per cent) and Alkem Labs (nearly 70 per cent).

And the third category includes pharma MNCs such as GSK Pharma, Pfizer and AstraZeneca.


Exporters show signs of revival
Having been battered on Dalal Street for quite a long time now, this segment is finally showing hope. December earnings marked first quarterly beat on US revenues for domestic drug exporters in nearly three years. 

Analysts say the sector could stage a recovery from a low base, as product price erosion appears to have bottomed out and US volumes have started picking up.

All through the depressed phase, several drug makers have sold non-core businesses, rationalised R expenditure &D and changed CXOs to ensure better performance.

Kotak Securities said US generic revenues should recover sharply over FY2020-21 on the back of new launches, even though there is uncertainty over launch timelines. “We have seen the first signs of revival in US generic revenues in case of a few companies in Q2FY19, and this continued into Q3 of FY19,” it said.

Various estimates peg the growth in global pharma spend at 3-6 per cent over 2018-22. The US remains the key market with over 40 per cent of total spending. While $212 billion worth of drugs set to see patent expiry in 2019-2024, major expiries have been pushed beyond 2022, say analysts. Meanwhile, entry of Chinese players has intensified competition.

Yet, analysts say most of these concerns are already in the price at prevailing market valuations.

Independent investment advisor Vivek Mavani says while he is unsure about Dr Reddy’s, for drug makers like Sun Pharma, Cadila and Wockhardt, Lupin the worst seems to be over in terms of price performance. Now, the bottoming out process is on, he said.

“Prices are likely to stabilise, as the industry adjusts to different trade channels. Most companies anticipate price erosion to wilt from mid-to-high single digits into the low single digits. However, increased competition on faster approvals led by GDUFA is likely to remain an overhang,” Elara Capital said.


Domestic market strong, MNCs to see recovery
For companies with significant domestic market exposure, earnings continue to grow in double digits.

“Alkem is still attractive at about Rs 1,800-1,900. Ajanta Pharma has corrected significantly to Rs 1,000 level. Cipla, of course, is a long-term slow compounder and would still do well,” Mavani said.

In case of the pharma MNC pack, which analysts say has been in slumber for 15 years, investments made over the past few years are beginning to pay off in terms of earnings growth.

“Probably, it is below-the-radar. Most people missed the trend. But MNC stocks such as AstraZeneca have actually been among the best performers. They will continue to do well on back of robust earnings growth, as heavy investments made in past few years begin to pay off,” Mavani said.

In December quarter, export-driven names logged higher realisations on rupee depreciation, while MNC players reported better sequential margins.

“Domestic-focused companies should structurally outperform, led by recovery in Indian pharma market, a relatively benign operating environment and continued volume expansion. Export-focused players will benefit from currency tailwinds in the near term,"" said Antique Stock Broking.

The brokerage has recommended Dr Reddy's, Natco Pharma and Cipla, which are domestic-focused stories with expanding US presence.


FY19/20 earnings estimates stabilise
Dr Reddy’s, Biocon, Torrent and Ipca Labs saw upgrades in earnings estimates for FY19 and FY20 following solid December quarter numbers, while Lupin, Cipla, Cadila and Glenmark Pharma saw a downward revision in earnings estimates for FY19-20.

Overall, the FY19/20 earnings estimate for the NSE Pharma index remained stable post December quarter earnings, compared with sharp cuts witnessed in H1FY19, CLSA noted in a report.

Pharma stocks are generally considered defensive bets in times of uncertainty in the domestic economy, as the market is somewhat immune to weakness in economic fundamentals and most players derive a major chunk of their revenues outside of India. Yet regulatory issues have hurt the sector hard over the past few quarters.

The Nifty Pharma index is down 20 per cent in last two years and 25 per cent in last three years. For the ongoing financial year, it is down 11 per cent against a one per cent rise in Nifty50.

CLSA said it likes Sun Pharma on improving fundamentals and differentiated product pipeline for the US, and prefers Torrent Pharma for its India positioning.

Elara Capital also likes Torrent Pharma. Besides, it prefers Aurobindo Pharma due to the turnaround in its EU business and strong fresh cash flow generation over FY18-20, given limited capex requirements.

IPCA Labs is another stock Elara is bullish on. The brokerage feels the company’s strong API capabilities and diversified model would provide it with major competitive advantage in the current environment."

2,2019-03-06,Cipla,"The government needs to have a compulsive licensing system for essential drugs and look at locally manufacturing non-patented medicines, Cipla chairman Y K Hamied said Wednesday.

""For healthcare what India requires is a pragmatic compulsive licensing system. My own reading is what the government should do is to formalise what are the drugs that are priority for India, which we Indians can't do (produce). A big example is a drug for TB (Bedaquiline),"" he said.

""If India requires something, the government should ask such foreign companies give us your products and we are willing to pay you a royalty...Those drugs which are essential to India, the government should step in and ask for a voluntary license and give a royalty."" he added.

The industry doyen pointed out that 70 percent of the major drugs are in-licensed and it is what India should look to do.

""It is what India should ask, in-license and pay royalty. Science has to be rewarded not denied particularly in a country like ours with 1.35 billion people, you cannot afford a monopoly. I have never been against patents, I have been against monopoly,"" he said.

He added that many drugs which are not covered under patent should be made in India which is not happening at present, citing example of Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Vitamin D, Vitamin C.

""What are the incentives the government wants to give because I can't compete in pricing with China. So my whole idea on this system of older drugs not made in India is that the government must have a very pragmatic policy that even if China is cheaper we should still make in India. We have to be self reliant and self sufficient,"" he said.

The Octogenarian launched the inspirational science programme with the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in India and donated Rs 8.7 crore for the same.

His inspirational chemistry programme in association with RSC which was launched in 2014, where we had donated Rs 8 crore, has helped deliver more than 1,000 training workshops to over 23,000 teachers between 2014 and the end of 2018, with more than 9,000 schools across the 26 states.

14,2019-03-28,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Online drugs retailer PharmEasy and pharmaceutical distribution company Ascent Health and Wellness have begun exploring a potential merger of the two Mumbai-based private capital-backed companies, in what could turn out to be the largest consolidation in the space.

The boards of both companies, which count a number of marque private equity and venture capital investors such as Everstone Capital, Kedar Mankekar, Eight Roads Ventures and Orios Venture Partners among their ranks, are believed to have given them in-principle approval for the all-stock transaction to go through, according to three sources aware of the developments.

“The stakeholders of both companies have given the green signal for the merger about three weeks to a month back and the boards are also likely to give approvals soon,” said one of the sources on the condition of anonymity.

A potential merger between the two companies could likely see the newly-formed entity emerge as the largest player in the online pharmaceutical space, while also controlling its distribution and supply chain channels, critical for them to grow. For the country’s online drug retailers, gaining control over distribution and supply chain is critical. Almost all of them, such as MedLife and Netmeds, have invested in pharmaceutical distributors, but have thus far kept the investments at arm’s length.

Separately, Naspers, the South African media, internet and technology investor and a backer of some of India’s largest consumer internet ventures, including Flipkart and Swiggy, had also held discussions over investing in the new entity formed through the merger.

Sources told ET that Naspers could invest $100-150 million, at a valuation of $400-500 million. When contacted by ET, a Naspers spokesperson said that the company did not comment on rumours or speculations.



Earlier this week, Mint had reported that SoftBank, the world’s largest technology investor, had also held discussions to invest in PharmEasy. There are also existing links between the two ventures. Ascent owns a substantial chunk of PharmEasy, estimated at about 25%.

A merger between the two is also likely to see Everstone Capital, the mid-market private equity firm, emerge as the largest institutional stakeholder of the merged entity, with 35-38% ownership. Emails sent to PharmEasy, Ascent Health and Wellness and Everstone Capital did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.

The PE firm, founded by Sameer Sain and Atul Kapoor, had invested a little over Rs 400 crore, alongside Mankekar, one of India’s richest private investors, for a 65.9% stake in the company. 

Ascent, which caters to more than 25,000 retailers across the country, also works with a number of the top pharmaceutical companies, such as Zydus, Cadila, Cipla and Sun Pharmaceuticals, along with notable hospital chains, including Mumbai‘s Nanavati Hospital and Manipal Hospitals. 

The company provides the pharma majors with all channels of distribution, including retail and institutional, while separately managing the pharmaceutical supplies, and acting as a vendor for the hospital chains. 

Ascent has also been aggressive on the buyout stakes over the last 18 months. The company, founded by IIM Ahmedabad alum Siddharth Shah, Carnegie Mellon graduate Hardik Dedhia and Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies alum Harsh Parekh, has made acquisitions in the distribution space, spread across Bengaluru, National Capital Region, Chennai and Ahmedabad. 

PharmEasy, which raised $50 million in its Series C round last September, was reported to have earned revenue of Rs 116 crore in financial year 2017-18, up from Rs 33 crore in the previous fiscal. Loss, however, widened to Rs 97 crore in FY 18, compared to Rs 48 crore in the year-ago fiscal. 

Ascent Health reported total revenue of Rs 619.65 crore for financial year ended March 31, 2018, up from Rs 279.76 crore in the previous fiscal. Loss for the period widened to Rs 24.80 crore, up from Rs 3.88 crore in fiscal 2017, according to business signals provider paper.vc."

• Edelweiss has maintained its buy recommendation on SRF with a target price of ₹2,315 as pick up in specialty chemical business was a strong earnings kicker for the company. In the long run, the company’s leadership in refrigerant gas and significant capital expenditure in specialty chemicals will drive return ratios and other segments like technical textiles and packaging film to continue to generate strong cash flows, said the brokerage. 

• Emkay has initiated coverage on Capacite Infraprojects with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹288 citing strong growth path with attractive valuation. Besides government reforms such as real estate regulatory authority, the company is well-positioned to gain traction driven by impressive execution track with stable margins, lean balance sheet with healthy return ratios, strong management pedigree and asset-light business model said the brokerage. 

• Elara Capital has maintained its buy rating on TCS with a target price of ₹2,400 as the 19.8% PE premium assigned for TCS based on consensus estimates is inadequate. The brokerage expects the margin gap to widen further over FY20 as it expect TCS to improve operating profit margin by 180 bps year-onyear to 28.8%, even as Infosys sees operating profit margin erode by 100 bps year-on-year to 24.2%, said the brokerage. 

• Axis Securities has initiated coverage on Chalet Hotels with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹410. Chalet stems from its unique positioning and efficient asset management strategy such as the industry is coming out of a 10-year lull and we find it prudent to back asset owners in an upcycle – superior operating profit case in point, said the brokerage. 

• Edelweiss has maintained its buy rating on DLF with a target price of ₹237. DLF has successfully completed a qualified institutional placement of ₹3,170 crore involving an issuance of 173 mn shares at ₹183.4 apiece. This paves the way for the balance fund infusion of ₹2,250 crore by promoters as well as conversion of debentures/warrants worth the entire ₹11,250 crore into equity shares, said the brokerage.

3,2019-04-05,Cipla,"Mumbai: Nifty 50 companies may report a spike in March quarter net profit — the highest in two years. However, the aggregate topline growth of the Nifty 50 companies for the period is expected to be in single digits for the first time in at least nine quarters following a sluggish demand scenario.Net profit is seen rising faster on account of a lower base and exceptional costs in the case of some companies in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, the sample’s revenue is expected to grow 7.6 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of FY19. This compares with a robust 22.1 per cent growth in the December 2018 quarter and 15.1 per cent increase in the March 2018 quarter. Net profit is likely to grow by 32.2 per cent, the sharpest jump since the March 2017 quarter when it grew 44.8 per cent. In the preceding quarter, aggregate profit had fallen significantly by 24.6 per cent due to the sharp loss reported by Tata Motors, which took a $4 billion write down on account of its Jaguar Land Rover unit.

‘Pick-up in Growth Expected’

“Revenue growth on a year-on year basis may be slow compared to the previous three quarters as the base prices of most commodities had grown in Q4 of last year,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.

The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by a sharp 181 per cent largely driven by Coal India. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported higher employee benefit expenses due to revised pay for executives. This had reduced operating profit, thereby creating a low base.

Higher operating profit will likely expand the sample’s aggregate operating margin to 18.9 per cent for the March quarter from 7.2 per cent a year ago.

While the demand scenario looks dull, growth is expected to resume gradually in the coming quarters following the general election that will be held between April 11 and May 19 with counting on May 23.

“Liquidity squeeze is now slowly easing and hence the growth momentum could gradually pick up,” Jasani said. “Monsoon predictions (including that of El Nino developing) will be closely tracked. US-China trade negotiations and the general global growth slowdown fear could impact sectors and companies focussed on global trade.”

Sector Performance

Automobiles

Record high inventory at dealers and moderation in demand are likely to dent earnings growth. Tata Motors is likely to remain affected due to pressure on volumes at JLR.

Banks

Barring bad loan news related to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), the pace of slippages or identification of new nonperforming assets is expected to slow down further in the March quarter. Top private banks with greater exposure to corporate lending such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are expected to report better numbers. Net interest margins are likely to be under pressure given the liquidity crunch.

Capital Goods

Orders from state governments and public sector enterprises will support order inflow growth. Larsen & Toubro is expected to meet order inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent for FY19 following orders from heavy civil infrastructure and water and effluent treatment.

Cement

In the March quarter, all-India average cement prices rose 4 per cent to Rs 334 per 50 kg bag. The southern and eastern regions have shown an improvement in prices. Large companies such as ACC, Ambuja Cements, UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to report volume growth of 15-20 per cent year-on-year and revenue expansion of 15-17 per cent. Given benign raw material prices, net profit is likely to grow at a faster 20-35 per cent.

Consumer

March quarter results are likely to be impacted by moderation in demand amidst increased competitive intensity. Advertising expenditure may increase but will be offset by lower raw material prices. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post a resilient performance. Higher product prices may support ITC’s profitability.

Information Technology

Seasonal weakness amid unfavourable currency movements are likely to affect the performance of IT companies. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies are expected to report 1.5-2.5 per cent growth in dollar-denominated revenues. An indication from company managements on budget spending by clients will be crucial in determining demand trend for FY20.

Metals

A weaker rupee provided comfort to most domestic commodity companies as it made them more competitive. Realisations will also be higher as prices are in dollars. After a fall in the latter part of 2018, commodity prices, including those of steel, aluminium and copper, either stabilised or bounced back. The domestic steel companies raised prices thrice in the March quarter, leading to a 7-8 per cent price increase. This will support profit growth.

Pharmaceuticals

In the March quarter, pharmaceutical companies are likely to continue the improvement in performance seen in the preceding quarter. The receding headwinds in the US generics market are likely to support the performance of companies. Sun, Aurobindo and Cipla are expected to register better performance while Lupin is likely to underperform."

Nifty50 failed to surpass the 11,680 mark and gradually fell towards the 11,57 0 level in the latter part of Wednesday’s session. It formed an Inside Bar, or a Harami pattern, on the daily scale which indicated a tug of war between the bulls and the bears to make or break the 11,550 level.

The index has been consolidating between 11,550 and 11,750 levels for last nine sessions. Now if it fails to hold above 11,550, a short-term profit booking decline could take it towards the immediate support in the 11,520-11,500 zone, while key hurdles are placed at 11,666 and 11,680 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was placed at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 level. There was Call writing at 12,000 followed by 11,800 levels while Put unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. The option band signified a lower trading range between 11,500 and 11,760 levels.

India VIX moved up sharply by 4.19 per cent to 21.13 level. A sudden spike in VIX indicates limited upside with volatile swing in the market.

Bank Nifty is facing a hurdle near the 30,200 level from past few sessions and slipped towards 29,750 level. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale amid supply pressure at higher levels. Now it has to cross and hold above 30,250 level to witness a upward move towards 30,500, while on the downside, a major support is seen at 29,700 level and below that it could open up fresh downsides towards 29,500 and 29,250 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.76 per cent at 11,653 level. Long buildup was seen in Godfrey Phillip, Tata Motors, Cipla and Wipro while shorts were seen in HDFC Bank, Shriram Transport, Hindalco and Torrent Power.

17,2019-04-13,Cipla,"It's a question of three Es -- economy, earnings and elections, not necessarily in the same order.

The heat is showing on Indian stocks as the market posted first weekly fall in eight. This followed the IMF lowering India’s growth estimate for 2018-19 and the next two years as well. 

Though corporate earnings for the March quarter kicked off on a strong note on Friday, thanks to TCS and Infosys, investors are wondering what lies ahead.

General elections, which got under way on Thursday and run till May 19, is adding to this level of uncertainties though a win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is largely being priced in.

Despite all these unknowns, some buying over the last two days of the week kept the downside in the market to a minimum. 

The BSE Sensex slipped 95 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 38,767 on April 12, from 38,862 on April 5. Likewise, the NSE Nifty came off 23 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 11,643 during the same period.

The next week will be a truncated one as the market is shut on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday, respectively. 

Among key data points, WPI inflation for March is slated for Monday. On the global front, Chinese GDP and industrial production data due on Wednesday, along with Opec Meeting, will inject a sense of caution.

Below is a list of top stocks and sectors that made news through the whole week.


Stocks that rallied up to 30%
As many as nine stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 10 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Rain Industries (up 30.85 per cent), PC Jeweller (28.68 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (22.92 per cent), Shankara Building Products (16.66 per cent) and Jai Corp (15.20 per cent). 


Pain for 3 scrips Just three stocks such as Century Plyboards (down 11.53 per cent), PNB Housing Finance (down 11.86 per cent) and Reliance Communications (down 22 per cent) on the BSE500 plunged in double digits. 


IPO update
The initial public offering (IPO) of wires and cables manufacturer Polycab India, which was open for subscription from April 5-9, got subscribed over 51.96 times during the week. The Rs 1,345-crore IPO received bids for over 91 crore shares against the total issue size of more than 1.76 crore. 


Lacklustre debut
Shares of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited made a flat market debut on Thursday, listing at its issue price of Rs 19 on BSE and NSE both. The scrip settled 3.94 per cent up at Rs 19.80 on the NSE.


Q4 off to good start
IT majors TCS and Infosys beat Street expectations on Friday with some solid March quarterly numbers. The results came in after market closing. 

While TCS earnings grew 17.7 per cent in January-March from a year earlier, Infosys posted a 10.5 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,078 crore. TCS stock settled 0.26 per cent down at Rs 2,013.75 ahead of earnings whereas Infosys gained 0.63 per cent to Rs 747.85. 

“With robust TCV (total contract value) signings and improving business visibility, we believe that Infosys would gradually catch up in revenue growth with TCS in FY2020E and in turn would narrow the valuation gap with TCS, going forward. Thus, we maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs 840,” said brokerage firm Sharekhan.


Stocks @fresh all-time high
As many as 13 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs. The list includes stocks such as ICICI Lombard Life Insurance, Gillette India, Bajaj Finserv, PVR, SKF India, Pidilite, Honeywell Automation, Info Edge (India) and Infosys.


Sectoral scene
Sector-wise, BSE Auto as well as FMCG, Healthcare and Power indices rallied more than 1 per cent. However, BSE Telecom, Metal, Teck, IT and Consumer Durables weakened up to 2.84 per cent. 


Top Nifty gainers/losers
Wipro: With a rally of 8.13 per cent during the week, Wipro was the top gainer in the Nifty pack. Tata Motors (up 5.26 per cent), Bajaj Auto (up 5.12 per cent), Cipla (up 4.28 per cent) and ITC (up 3.80 per cent) brought up the rest of the list. 

Wipro is scheduled to announce its results on April 16. It's set to announce its largest buyback of Rs 12,000 crore ($1.7 billion) on the same day following Sebi's nod to the proposal. 

On the other hand, Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 8 per cent), Asian Paints (down 5.01 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 4.12 per cent) lost the game in the 50-share Nifty pack.

Asian Paints scrip fell after a fire at its paint manufacturing facility in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The manufacturing operations have been affected since. 


DHFL skids
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) came down by over 3 per cent to Rs 167.10 on Friday after rating agency Brickwork Ratings India downgraded its secured NCDs and subordinated debt instruments. An ETNow report suggested that US-based large private equity (PE) player Lone Star Funds is eyeing a stake in the company. 


But SpicJet takes off
Shares of SpiceJet rallied over 10 per cent after the airline announced induction of new aircraft into its fleet. According to a BSE filing, the company will induct 16 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft on dry lease in the next 10 days after regulatory approvals. 


Takeover buzz lifts Ruchi Soya
Shares of Ruchi Soya Industries climbed over 12 per cent to Rs 7.30 on April 12, from Rs 6.50 on April 5. An ET report suggested that Patanjali Ayurved’s proposed acquisition of Ruchi Soya has reached the final stages with the committee of creditors (CoC) scheduled to meet next Tuesday to clear the deal."

28,2019-04-24,Cipla,"In an interview with ETNOW, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, explains he is willing to go 
  
  contrarian on auto and pharma. Edited excerpts: 

Crude has already risen a good 50% from its lows and is at a six-month high. Do you think the market is willing to ignore it?
We made too much about everything and when crude hit $50 also, the markets were doing nothing. Crude is an impetus of growth and rightly so. It tells you that the growth engine globally is up and about. For India, that 2000-2500 would be the max. I think crude is nearing a top, rather than going higher. We are extremely confident that crude from the second half of May would start showing a downward trajectory and $60-65. 

On the other hand, whenever crude has risen like this, it has been a buying opportunity and a lot of the crude derivatives -- whether it is the OMCs, the paint companies or cement. For the first time, I can say with confidence that UltraTech has set the cat amongst the pigeons. You cannot have better numbers at a time when everyone was bearish on construction and housing. There was 16% growth in volumes, 21% EBITDA margin and it is telling you now that 104 million tonnes of capacities working to the hilt. This is just the starting and we are relatively bullish. 

We reiterate Nifty will reach 12,000-12,200 before the election results are out and first half of May could be relatively bullish given that earnings are surprising on the upside. 


Are there enough triggers to take Sun TV higher in the longer run?
Yes, you should be replacing Zee with Sun in the aftermath of elections. If Reliance is at new highs, it is more because of data and Jio and this election has been fought on the maximum amount of data consumption. Same is the case with media. 

Sun will be an inordinate beneficiary in this quarter. They have garnered more market share, they have got into more languages. We are of the view that Zee continues to if and but on a lot of proposals where they want to sell their stake, we would rather be with Sun where the ARPUs and ad revenues are going to be on the upside. So yes, definitely Sun and with a longer term view you could even scale targets closer to Rs 850 this year. 


What is happening in auto? Maruti numbers will be out tomorrow. This sector has been lagging a bit. Would you pick out only top quality leaders?
There are two things. One, we know that auto sales have been on a lower wicket due to reasons like insurance, BS-IV and some of the NBFC problem. On the other hand, globally if autos are going to be weak, then why should crude be at $75? The biggest consumer of crude is autos. We are of the view that be contrarian in autos. Once you are through with the election, closer to the monsoon, one should start to see a lot of uptick. 

There will be a lot of pre-BS-IV regulation change buying and we have seen a lot of impetus in some of the commercial vehicle side where Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland have seen a lot of dispatch numbers strengthening. The price is in your favour but the earnings may take a couple of quarters and we are relatively sanguine and bullish on bottom up on Tata Motors, TVS, Bajaj Auto and a whole host of other stocks, where the price is in the opportunity on a business which has made huge wealth over the last five years.


How are you are looking at pharma? Do you see value in select names within the midcap space?
We have been slightly contrarian and now are being rightly rewarded because there was enough value in Dr Reddy’s, Sun, Lupin, Aurobindo and Cipla -- the whole basket. We recommend investors to buy some good mutual funds which have a good pharma fund. You could be richly rewarded because we think the worst of FDA and some of the generic pricing maybe behind us. Numbers from the likes of Lupin, Dr Reddy, Dr Reddy are already at a new high. As a disclosure, that has been one of our top picks. We think Rs 3,200 is on the cards.

Pharma will take the place of IT due to rupee weakness and comforting valuations. The earnings are going to be the next catalyst particularly for the largecap pharma stocks. So pharma as a whole or as a mutual fund would be richly rewarding in the next one year. 


Where do you find leadership from here? Is it going to be restricted to Reliance Industries and some of the corporate banks or do you see a churn and auto stocks will participate?
It will be four sectors – autos, metals, consumption and construction. There was a very weak undertone on cement and UltraTech was at Rs 3,700. That is when I gave a call for Rs 4,700 by year end. Now I will have to revise the numbers upward of Rs 5,000. You cannot but ignore two things. Signal the GDP or growth in a country that is cement sales and CV sales. We have already seen the cement numbers. The CV sales is just a matter of time. 

I would be definitely very optimistic on industrials which include cement, steel, the whole gamut of housing and stocks like HDFC. They can be at new highs very soon. Also, whole mortgage companies/building materials should do extremely well. So autos, construction, cement, consumption these are four themes which we are very-very bullish.


What are you hoping to hear from Yes Bank when it delivers its numbers? It will be the first quarterly performance under the leadership of Ravneet Gill.
Now it is back to earnings for the whole year. After leadership change and other issues, you got the fear to buy the stock at Rs 170. Even on your show, we have said Rs 280 would be a good level to take profits. Now, there is talk of NBFC lineage on the book and some of the RBI observations on commercial real estate.

The management should be prudent because they have been through a lot. If you are not looking for this quarter and the next, the next few quarters could be much more powerful on the earnings front for some of the corporate banks. 

Earnings will be reasonably okay, given that they already did a lot of provisioning on the IL&FS book for the last two quarters. So yes, we will take it with a pinch of salt given that their NIMs may actually pleasantly surprise on the upside and some of the treasury income may actually be offsetting the weakness in asset quality. I would say right now it is in the middle of the range. If it gets closer to Rs 220, it becomes a longer term buy and if it crosses Rs 270, then that is the time to book profit."
27,2019-04-24,Cipla,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s largest institutional investor, raised bets on banking as well as select auto, gas, retail and midcap IT stocks during March quarter, which saw domestic equity benchmark Sensex jump 7.22 per cent to 38,672 as of March 29 from 36,068 on December 31, 2018.

At the same time, LIC did some major portfolio overhaul, offloading shares of several telecom, metals, power generation, pharma, hotels, chemicals and cement companies.

The banking sector emerged a tempting bet during the quarter on hopes of earnings recovery and likely bottoming out of NPA provisioning. The insurance behemoth seems to have lapped up a number of banking stocks – both largecap and midcap. Shareholding data of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank and IDBI Bank all showed a spike in LIC holding.

LIC also upped stake in Indian Overseas Bank and Syndicate Bank, but offloaded shares in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI. 

During the quarter, LIC completed the acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in IDBI Bank. RBI in March categorised IDBI Bank as a private lender for regulatory purposes with effect from January 21, 2019. LIC held 44.31 per cent stake in the bank as of December 31.

Elara Capital in a report said there has been a structural shift in the private banking space in the past few quarters, wherein private lenders steadily raised their term deposit (TD) rates.

“This is because private banks’ credit growth is outperforming CASA deposit growth. We expect credit growth of 20 per cent YoY for Q4FY19E against CASA deposit growth of 12 per cent YoY for private banks,” the brokerage said

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of March quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. 

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in select auto firms like Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Motors and M&M. LIC was not among key shareholders in Hindustan Motors as of December 31, 2018.

At the same time, it offloaded some stakes in the beaten-down Tata Motors. LIC held 5.10 per cent stake in the auto major as of March 2019 against 5.17 per cent at the end of December quarter.

Tata Motors earlier this month reported a 5 per cent decline in March sales globally, including that of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) vehicles, at 1,45,459 units. It had sold 1,53,156 units in March 2018.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 22 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 40 companies in March quarter, but reduced it in nearly 60 others.

India’s leading gas players Gail and Indraprastha Gas saw a lot of interest from the domestic institutional investor. 

LIC also picked up over 1 per cent stake in Linde India, NIIT Technologies, UPL and Spencer's Retail during the quarter. It was not among the key shareholders in these companies at December end.



In the pharma space, LIC sold shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, GSK Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Lupin and Sanofi India, but bought additional shares in Cipla and Piramal Enterprises.

Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala recently said that the price erosion in the pharma sector is behind us. “Indian pharma market will tend to grow faster than it has grown. Pharma is not a market where demand can go down. You must know that 40-45 per cent of all medicines used in the US is made in India. I think it is a sunrise industry, it is not a sunset industry, it can never be a sunset industry,” he said.

Crisil, Tata Coffee, Bombay Dyeing, Indo Rama, Adani Ports, ONGC, OFSS, Rajesh Exports, Tata Chemicals, Exide Industries, Century Textiles, UltraTech Cement and Gillette India were among the other stocks in which LIC increased stake during the quarter.

However, it reduced stake in cement players ACC, Ambuja Cement, Heidelberg Cement, Jaiprakash Associates and India Cement and several hotel stocks including EIH, Hotel Leela Ventures, India Tourism Development Corporation and The Indian Hotels.

In the telecom space, LIC brought down its stake in Bharti Airtel to 3.72 per cent from 3.73 per cent in MTNL from 19.02 per cent to 18.49 per cent and in Reliance Communications from 5.97 per cent to 5.94 per cent."

3,2019-05-04,Cipla,"An illustrated, coffee-table edition of the Bhagavad Gita sits open atop a wooden stand in the office of Cipla managing director Umang Vohra, at the company’s plush headquarters in Mumbai’s Lower Parel. The cover has an illustration of the famous dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna in a chariot. It captures the setting of the hugely influential scripture, a treatise on dilemmas, decision-making and duty. It’s kept open so that the office’s occupant or visitors can easily browse through it. It’s perhaps an apt item to adorn an office that has seen some difficult decision-making in recent years. 

Cipla has a familiar problem large corporations everywhere are susceptible to — plateauing performance and the need to ensure that the disruptive forces ahead don’t pull the rug from under its feet. At the pharma giant, there’s the additional complication that the challenge needs to be tackled even as a generational shift is underway at the company. 

YK Hamied, Indian pharma’s elder statesman and the man who built Cipla into a global generics giant over 52 years ago, stepped down as MD in 2013. His niece Samina Vaziralli is now the promoter group member holding the highest executive office, as vicechairperson, and runs the company along with managing director Vohra. 




Vaziralli took over the job in 2016, the same year Vohra was elevated as MD. The years following Hamied’s departure saw a slew of exits from top management ranks. As they settle into their roles amidst a sense of management overhaul, Vaziralli and Vohra must steer Cipla into a trajectory of steady growth, while ring-fencing it from future shocks. And their principal prescription for the company — greater focus on North America, a market the company had deliberately stayed away from — is fraught with risk. 

For Vohra, the move from a top role with Dr Reddy’s Labs in the US to Mumbai as Cipla CFO was in parts driven by a desire to be closer to his ageing parents. With revenues hovering around $2 billion and a market cap of Rs 45,000 crore, Cipla’s profit and loss statement is a daunting responsibility to shoulder. His arrival at the company in 2015, in hindsight, was perfectly timed. 


Others

At a time of transition and leadership search, he swiftly moved up the top ranks, becoming COO and CEO in quick succession. The company promoters — the Hamied brothers, YK Hamied and MK Hamied, who control 36% of the company’s equity — had made some difficult choices of their own two decades back. They decided to stay away from the US generics business — a $104 billion market today — and focus on other geographies. 

The generics business involves reverse-engineering blockbuster drugs that are going offpatent. Now there is an opportunity to change course, and they have placed their trust in Vohra. The question is, can the 84-year-old company, with a strong legacy of affordable generics around the world, accelerate in a new direction even as the ship is just about steadying? 

It’s a manoeuvre that could make or break the ship. 





The Hamieds of Cipla The league table of Indian pharma companies is led by Sun Pharma, which currently enjoys a market cap a shade above Rs 1 trillion. Then come Dr Reddy’s, Aurobindo Pharma and Cipla, all of which are neck and neck in a band of Rs 45,000-48,500 crore.

Cipla’s consolidated quarterly revenues have remained somewhat stable, fluctuating in the Rs 3,400-4,000 crore range for the last 11 quarters. Cipla’s annual dollar revenues have floated around the $2 billion mark, depending on the dollarrupee exchange rate. 

India has remained central to its strategy, even as India’s share of revenues has fallen marginally from 42% in 2015 to 39% in 2018, while the share of the US market has inched close to 20%. Bulk of the business of Indian pharma companies such as Cipla come from selling generics — chemical copies of proprietary drugs — at home and around the world. 


Others

Prior to 2005, when India signed the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement, Indian pharma companies could sell generic versions of drugs with US patents in other markets. Now they sell off-patent drugs in the US and elsewhere. 

US patents are typically granted for a period of 20 years, to incentivise discovery. But historical patterns have been such that molecule discoveries are now rare and most of the world’s blockbuster drugs, discovered and invented in the period between the 1970s and the 1990s, have now exhausted their patent protection. 

Major drugs still under patent protection are not more than about a dozen. Cipla chairman YK Hamied, 82, played a major role in blazing the trail for Indian pharma, waging bruising legal battles with global pharma majors for the right to market generic drugs in parts of the world that could have never afforded the proprietary versions. Therefore, depending on who’s doing the talking, he has been variously described as “Robin Hood” and “outspoken buccaneer”. He was once feared for his ability to hurt global pharma majors by bringing down drug prices. 

For example, in 2001, Hamied stunned the pharma world by providing a cocktail of three drugs — stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine — used to treat HIV, at $350 for a year’s supply. It was one-thirtieth of the pricing that pharma majors were charging for the three drugs at the time. Everyone was forced to drop prices. 

Going further back, he was instrumental in getting the restrictive British-era patent laws changed in India in 1972, opening doors for the growth of Indian pharmaceutical industry. Hamied’s approach to business was likely influenced by his parents’ approach to life itself. His father KA Hamied was a Gandhian entrepreneur who wanted to manufacture drugs for India, and his mother Luba Derczanska, a Polish Jew, had strong socialist leanings. 


Others

Cipla was founded in 1935 and YK was born a year later. Hamied senior and Luba had met during a boat ride near Berlin as students. They married later, and had to flee Berlin when the Nazis took over. Luba’s parents were killed in the Holocaust. 

Umang Vohra recalls a conversation with YK Hamied while taking over as CEO, during which he was given carte blanche to run the company, as long as he thought long term and remembered that Cipla was created to solve problems for patients. 

Soon after, Vohra sought out MK Hamied, 79, YK’s younger brother who is also on the board and has been in the management along with YK right through. Vohra asked MK Hamied what he felt about missing the US generics bus. 

Wasn’t it the biggest mistake that Cipla ever made? The younger Hamied had replied that there could be no comparison between missing the US opportunity and going into Africa to save lives and that he was glad that Cipla made that choice. But now it was up to Vohra to turn Cipla into a global player with footprints across the world. 

Today, Vohra does not interact with the Hamied brothers on a day-to-day basis. In fact the duo, now in non-executive positions, operate from the old Cipla office near the Mumbai Central railway station, while Vohra works out of the plush new Cipla House in Parel. 

Keeping him company at the top echelons of the firm in the new office is Samina Vaziralli, 42, executive vice-chairperson of Cipla and MK Hamied’s daughter. A former banker with Goldman Sachs in London and New York, Vaziralli is a big part of the transition underway at Cipla, representing promoter oversight. She had taken a break in her career and moved back to Mumbai. 

Joining the company in 2012, Vaziralli worked in various roles, including head of strategy for the firm. Now Vaziralli and Vohra must do the delicate promotermanagement tango while running the company, giving some taking some, defining turfs and boundaries and developing enduring partnership. far, it is going well, they say. 



Vohra knew Vaziralli before joining Cipla, and says she’s an interesting person to work with and has hardly any airs about promoter or an inheritor of a legacy. She is someone, says, “who would still jump into a kaali-peeli taxi”. How’s her professional partnership with Vohra? She says: “I make Umang feel like an owner and he makes me feel accountable, like management.” 

Vaziralli’s younger brother Kamil had joined Cipla, too, was being groomed for top management roles but instead to become a venture capitalist in London. When Vohra took over as CEO and MD in 2016, Vaziralli was elevated as executive vice-chairperson. Vohra has full operational control and Vaziralli has her say when it comes to acquisitions, capital allocations and manpower. 




Baby Steps to a Global Dream It’s been clear for a while now that for Cipla to achieve significant growth, it will need to crack more, sizeable overseas markets. That’s how it embarked on a path of inorganic growth and expansion in the world’s largest generics market — the US. 

Cipla did its first ever acquisition in 2013 under Vaziralli and former CEO Subhanu Saxena when it bought its front-end partner in South Africa, Cipla Medpro. It acquired two generics players in the US in 2015 that gave it a foothold in that market. It has continued to buy out businesses and ink partnership deals with boutique development companies for specific products that it will fund and market when they are ready. 

Vohra’s tenure has seen quite a few policy turnarounds, and top management churn. The company has withdrawn from some 40 markets, deciding to focus on the North American geography among developed markets as well as Brazil, China and South Africa among emerging markets. It has exited from a few subsidiaries and sold stake in other areas across the world, from Croatia to South Africa. 

Cipla also opted out of the push towards biosimilars, deciding it was not its game for now. It even withdrew from a direct-tomarket approach in Europe. Vohra told ET Magazine that he saw no point in playing in smaller markets, or the European market where it had strong competition in its own areas of strength (respiratory, oncology and immunology) from players like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and AstraZeneca. Vaziralli explains Cipla’s strategy in the US foray, and says she wants to have three engines of growth in the American market. 

“I do not want to have a Kodak moment a few years down the line and say that generics are not so hot any more,” she says. So while Cipla is playing the generics game and aiming to file Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for complex generic drugs every quarter, it is also keeping an eye on new molecules or working on repurposing older molecules in advanced stages of development. When Cipla let go of the US generics business in the past, it also escaped the scrutiny of the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) that started a few years back and singed India’s generics pharma industry. 

The high dependence on Indian revenues has worked as a hedge for Cipla, protecting it while the rest of the Indian pharma majors faced trouble. But all that is changing, and Cipla and its investors will henceforth have to take on the risk of US regulatory action affecting its revenues. In April, Cipla’s US subsidiary InvaGen recalled an injection used to treat low testosterone from the US markets. It had been manufactured in Cipla’s Goa plant. 

In March, Cipla’s Kurkumbh plant in Pune got 18 observations after an FDA audit. The company has now replied to those. Of the 18 observations, 10 are for a diabetes drug that goes off-patent in 2025. It also raises the biggest question about Cipla’s US push. When Indian pharma companies, with high US revenue dependency, have suffered, running into stringent FDA norms, why is Cipla making a risky bet? The obvious answer is that it is too huge a market for a big generics player to ignore. But that doesn’t dilute regulatory risk in the least bit.


Optimal Strategy So has Cipla managed to set the stage for rapid growth, or has the chopping and changing been going on for too long and in too many areas? 

“Once you dismantle the existing system, it does not auger well for the company. When the management changed, the culture suddenly changed, which has led to stunted growth,” says Shakti Chakraborty, founder of Ergos Life Sciences, and former India head of Lupin, a Cipla competitor. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, in its preview of Cipla’s upcoming earnings (third week of May), has said that it expects “modest sales growth from the company’s US business”, but added that it is looking forward to an update on the traction in complex generics launches in US. 

The India market story, however, has been good for Cipla, and provides a good foundation to base the global journey on. “There is obviously a strategic shift in the company. Cipla was earlier highly focused on domestic market but now they are moving. Vohra and Vaziralli have carved out niche roles between themselves — she looks after overall strategy and he looks after operations. So Vohra has done a good job in this transition,” says Ranjit Shahani, former vice-chairman of Swiss drug maker Novartis. 

According to figures from All India Organisation Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), Cipla’s domestic a 9% growth last year, while its peers like reported a 7% growth in domestic business. Jefferies in its February analyst report noted domestic growth accelerated to the highest level 18 months. Cipla has invested back into the India market, especially to expand the reach for its inhalers, the usage of which suffers from social stigma. 

The company got actor Priyanka Chopra as brand ambassador to promote the use of inhalers for asthma. months after Vohra took up his assignment with Cipla, he learnt that his father, a former navy man, was afflicted with cancer. At that point, his move back to India had started to look like a very good decision, in more ways than one. The family fought the disease for a year and Vohra senior is now in remission. 

“I was glad I came, because I would not have been at peace, knowing he was going through this while I was somewhere else.” 

As things stabilise at home, the battle he needs to win abroad will be on high burn."
2,2019-05-04,Cipla,"Cipla MD Umang Vohra moved to India from Dr Reddy’s in the US to run the former’s finance function in 2015. Within a year he was named CEO and MD. In an interview with 
Suman Layak, Vohra explains his strategy of taking Cipla products to global markets. Edited excerpts: 


What attracted you to Cipla in the first place? I always thought Cipla had an unfinished agenda. It is an 84-year-old company — all of us have taken medicines made by Cipla while growing up. Many companies would buy from Cipla and then market the drugs outside India. Cipla had great capabilities and I never understood why it wasn’t more bullish on global markets. Also, within the pharma sector in India this was the only company that has tried to be professionally run. 


While you are trying to make Cipla global, you have also exited many markets. 
How do you explain this strategy? We said we cannot find growth in small markets. We said we will go to the US, the biggest market, and also we said we will do China and Brazil. We never understood Russia. Turkey was volatile. So you see BRICS — Brazil, China India and South Africa — was covered. We decided, everything cannot be done. We must pull out of 40 markets — emerging markets in some cases, and some in Africa. In Europe we were trying to compete as a respiratory company, and there was GSK. It dawned on us that we do not have the strength and capability — so we went for more B2B from direct-to-market in Europe. 




What is your US strategy? When we started looking at the US market, we started thinking what is going off-patent in the US — oncology medicines, inhalers and immunology drugs. Now all of these are things that Cipla has done in India. So these are the areas we are selecting. These are products that are difficult to do. You also do not have as many competitors. We have a large R&D set-up in Vikhroli. What we had done for India and emerging markets, and were about to do for Europe, now we are doing for the US."
1,2019-05-04,Cipla,"As executive vice-chairperson of Cipla, Samina Vaziralli represents the third generation from the promoter’s family involved in its management. Her grandfather founded Cipla and today Vaziralli is happy to play a strategic role in the company. In an interview with Suman Layak, she discusses her role and the path ahead for Cipla. Edited excerpts: 


How are the executive powers divided between you and MD Umang Vohra? 
When Umang joined, we sat across the table to decide on our responsibilities — what would be his and what would be mine. When you bring in professionals, you have to empower them. For some decisions, I have a casting vote — long-term strategy of the company, large M&A, big strategic relationships, capital resource allocation, compliance and talent. Umang, on the other hand, has complete and 100% ownership of the P&L (profit and loss statement). 


Why did you not take up the CEO role? 
It was discussed on the board, and the organisation felt that the person who is best equipped to run Cipla should run Cipla. And I honestly believed that the promoter was not equipped to run it. I had not been in the business and pharma is not something where I had enough experience. So I thought a professional with the right values and right skills should join the organisation. Also, if we put Cipla first the right decisions would just flow from there. 




How is the much-discussed US entry panning out for Cipla? 
We are building for the future. Today 40% of our revenues come from India. Now this is about building the US market. It was at 20% of our topline but we see faster and significant growth. This will happen in two areas — one is core generics, our Engine 1. The other is to build Engine 2 for Cipla. I do not want to have a Kodak moment several years later when we say that generics are no longer as hot as they used to be. 


So what is Cipla’s next line? 
We believed that building a speciality business in the US could set us up very well — dealing in old molecules repurposed to meet unmet needs. We are looking at three areas — respiratory, central nervous system and pain management."

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. is scouting for a partner in China to help it win a larger piece of the world’s second-largest drug market, where the government is on a mission to drive down healthcare costs.

With recovery underway in its U.S. business, Sun Pharma’s billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi is homing in on China and believes market watchers are underestimating the potential there for India’s largest drugmaker.

“There is a big opportunity for us,” Shanghvi said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait in Mumbai on Thursday. “That would create a significant new revenue stream, which is not factored in our valuation when analysts look at it.”

China has rolled out an ambitious multi-city bulk procurement program that’s driving down prices and providing an opening for Indian manufacturers like Sun Pharma to compete. It’s importing more drugs, reimbursing more and speeding up approvals of new medicines to ensure they reach patients faster.

The policy push comes as many generic drugmakers are still reeling from a brutal price war in the world’s biggest drug market, the U.S. While Sun Pharma’s Indian rivals, like Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. and Cipla Ltd., are already expanding in the Asian nation, Shanghvi has mostly kept mum about his plans there.


Scaling Up
India’s top drugmaker will start scaling up its China business in six to nine months, according to Shanghvi. The unit will contribute “some percentage” to Sun’s $4 billion of overall sales within three years from almost nothing right now, he added.

The $160 billion Chinese drug market “is now a focus for Indian generics” as U.S.-approved drugs are cleared faster, Jefferies analyst Piyush Nahar wrote in a Feb. 27 note.

“While the reforms make China an attractive market, ramp-up and profitability will have significant challenges,” Nahar wrote. “Unlike U.S., distribution is important in China and will need a local partner and higher spend.”

Analysts are split on the prospects of Sun Pharma’s stock, which has lagged the rise in the S&P BSE Sensex this year. In the last four years, it has plummeted nearly 52 percent compared to the Sensex’s 42 percent climb.

Sun Pharma’s large portfolio of U.S.-approved products should help the drugmaker ramp up its China business with little investment, Shanghvi said.

“We see enormous interest in China for products that we have global rights for,” Shanghvi said, adding that the company “would be comfortable making significant financial commitments,” in the Asian nation longer term."

9,2019-05-14,Cipla,"Insurance companies, life insurance particularly, would be a better play along with some of the NBFCs and corporate banks which are retail focussed, said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

What is causing this market mayhem?
You have seen as many numbers of elections and the outcomes as I have seen and probably all of us are of the view that whatever we like, if it happens, then probably we give thumbs up. In this kind of a situation, the market has always been clearly giving a verdict in favour of the current government and they want to see the current government coming back to power and continue with the policy regime that they have already established and accelerate the growth. That is what the industry wants. 

Given this kind of a situation, if the current NDA government comes into power, then it would probably be fairly well played in the market. To a certain extent, it might also get discounted and the focus would shift to the other major issues like trade war etc. In my opinion, we will have to wait and see till 23rd May, but do not get panicked into any situation.


Would you buy D-Mart? We have stopped talking about it. Has all that 2018 euphoria for D-Mart or Avenue Supermart in this case died?
My view has not changed since the company existed. It is a good company to own but at the same time, the valuation is not something which is attracting me. I continue to hold the view that valuations are still expensive. The reasons for expensive valuation could be any but at the same time, if you do not get enough amount of return investment, you still do not own a good company. You may probably experience the stores but you may not want to buy when it is expensively traded. I continue to hold that particular view even today.


Where would you find value even if we were to fall further from here? What would you buy at these levels or little lower from here?
I have been observing a few trends in recent times and probably they are quite interesting. On one side, consumer spending is coming down. On the other side, consumer spending in the financial product is increasing. The customer is the same but he is putting his one hand in the pocket and putting money into financial products. 

The new business premium for the life insurance segment which has started going up. In fact, in April, the amount of new business premium that the companies have collected have moved up smartly. In some cases, these have grown 50% growth on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, the situation where you are seeing the SIP portfolios in the mutual funds are increasing. You are seeing a similar situation with some of the health insurance related products, driven by the Modi Care Scheme, etc. They are happening. 

The consumer is putting more money into financial products. He is putting less money into consumption products and as a result, we are seeing some amount of slowdown/fall in consumption products. One of the themes which I have identified here is that the higher cost of interest is putting off the consumer and that is where the economy will have to do significantly differently if they have to increase the consumption. The cost of interest will have to come down. My take would be that the insurance companies, life insurance particularly, would be a better play along with some of the NBFCs and corporate banks which are basically retail focussed and which are taking care of the larger amount of wallet share of the consumer. 


Anything which his really been beaten down and where you think more than fundamentals, technical factors are at play? Compulsive buying is having an impact on the stock. Are you ready to buy anything completely against consensus? 
Yes absolutely and I am looking ahead with one or two years in front of me for the businesses that we have selected for investment in the falling market. We continue to like stories in Ashok Leyland where we believe that the traction is going to be on a higher side. BS VI replacement demand will be coming in due to scrappage policy. At the same time, a larger amount of value addition will get created, which is exciting us. 

We continue to find favour with companies like Bajaj Auto where the focus remains equally into the export markets and the new generation of vehicles. The company looks good within the auto space. We continue to like and put more money into the insurance businesses and we are getting the validation through the new business premium collection which has increased.

It is increasing now. So the likes of HDFC Life, Bajaj Allianz Life or even for that matter SBI Life are some of the companies where we feel ourselves more comfortable investing money into. Companies like Cipla in pharmaceuticals particularly is working with renewed strategies.."

13,2019-05-19,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: The US-China trade talks, Lok Sabha elections and India Inc March quarter earnings dominated the equity market proceedings during the week gone by.

Enduring bouts of volatility, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty settled with gains of over 1 per cent on a weekly basis. 

The coming week is expected to see the continuation of volatility in the light of exit polls and election outcomes. Moreover, global sentiment and corporate earnings, too, are expected to influence market mood.


Let's take a look at factors that will steer Dalal Street in the week ahead:

Exit polls, election outcomesUndoubtedly these are the most important triggers that will influence the market this week. The election vibes have been shaking Dalal Street of late. Exit polls will begin to pour in from Sunday evening, after the end of the seventh and final phase of general elections. The results are due on Thursday. 

All eyes would be glued not to ‘stock quotes’, but to ‘vote quotes’ in the coming week. A favourable result for the incumbent NDA government is expected to push Nifty towards the 11,800 level in the short-term. 

“However, a negative surprise would cause a one-time knee-jerk reaction and market can tank up to the 10,500-10,000 zone,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities and StockNote.

Even though the market is expected to stabilise after some time irrespective of who wins, a subtle, long-term impact of the results cannot be ruled out. 

""Election is an event that is able to produce long-term trends in the market. It is a factor that sets the tone for wealth creation and usually produces the trends that last for years. Due to its significance for the economy and policies, the result and its impact on the stock market affects investors across the globe,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research. 


Global cuesGlobal sentiment will remain an important factor for the market, especially at a time when the US-China trade tussle drags on. US corporate earnings, Japan's first quarter GDP numbers and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are among the important factors that will catch the attention of markets across the globe.

""India has mirrored global markets since the beginning of May and it will continue to do so. Post the election results next week, the market will continue to chart its course of action reflecting the global movement,"" Jimeet Modi said.


March quarter earningsSome sectoral majors are set to announce their March quarter numbers in the coming week, which will influence the market sentiment. Among those companies are BPCL, HPCL and Tata Motors that will announce their earnings on Monday. Tech Mahindra will release its numbers on Tuesday while Bank of Baroda, Cipla and IndusInd Bank will post their quarterly financial scores on Wednesday.


Movement of crude oil and rupee As per Reuters, oil prices edged lower on Friday due to demand fears amid a standoff in Sino-US trade talks, but both benchmarks ended the week higher on rising concerns over supply disruptions in Middle East shipments due to US-Iran political tensions. A resolution to the US-Iran tensions looks remote, so there is a possibility that oil prices may rise further amid curtailed supply. This, in turn, will put pressure on the Indian currency, making investors nervous. 


Technical outlookNifty50 formed a solid bullish candle on the daily chart on Friday, breaking out of a double Inside Bar pattern. Technically, the index has the potential to move towards 11,480-11,570 zone, but the wave structure suggests the minor pullback rally might be over.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said that Friday’s strong bullish candle and Hammer pattern on the weekly charts suggest strength and the index should target 11,480-11,570 range under ‘normal’ conditions."

23,2019-05-23,Cipla,"While the BSE Healthcare Index is marginally up in tandem with the broader benchmark indices, the Loksabha Election results are unlikely to change the fortune of pharma stocks. The sector has its own battles to fight – which are more regulatory, global and endemic in nature. Resolution of FDA clamp downs, working through the price collusion litigation in the US and growing business amidst headwinds are among the challenges that pharma companies must overcome. The outcome of the Indian elections – possible continuity of the government at the centre – will hardly have impact on the pharma stocks. 

Little wonder that most of the individual stocks are trading flat or even negative. Sun Pharma, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s Labs (DRL) and Apollo Hospitals are trading almost flat. The fourth quarter performance of the companies is a bigger trigger than the results of the elections. The stocks of Lupin, DRL and Cipla have already reacted to their companies’ fourth quarter performance. 

Consider this: DRL was among the few stocks to have dropped significantly on a day when the Indian bourses posted their largest single-day gains on back of exit polls predicting a BJP-led government at the Centre. The stock closed 6% lower on Monday due to subdued fourth quarter performance.

Sun Pharma, the largest player in the pharma pack, is set to announce its fourth quarter results next week – that will be the key trigger for the stock.

Nevertheless, the continuing of BJP-led government shall provide a reinforcement to the healthcare initiatives rolled out by the Modi government. In the event of a massive mandate, the Modi government’s ambitious healthcare plan - Ayushman Bharat - is likely to be rolled out more decisively and expenditure towards building healthcare infrastructure is expected to be undertaken."

29,2019-05-28,Cipla,"Some of the PSUs could possibly be a money spinner and could produce higher amount of growth for the investor and the shareholders, said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers, in an interview with ETNOW. PSUs likely to see higher amount of order book are BHEL, BEL and even Engineers India could see higher service contracts. Edited excerpts:

When NDA-1 got a clear mandate in 2014, PSU stocks got rerated. Similarly, under NDA-2, again PSU banks and enterprises are getting rerated. In the last five years, NDA-1 probably created a fabric for growth which requires to be carried out on the infrastructure side. Largely, the projects were announced for about close to $1.5 trillion and those projects were probably put on the paper and the implementation process started in some corners. 

Now the NDA-2 probably would accelerate these projects and that is where you can argue for some of the PSU companies getting a larger amount of execution though they may have got orders in the last two years because the government has a committed agenda here, They have the agenda pertaining to roads and linkages of various network on the transportation side and housing as well. All this put together, would have higher amount of demand generated for the services on the engineering side, construction side and also the commodity side.

From this perspective, some of the PSU companies which got completely derated, now have the prospect of getting rerated. A consistency of the management would probably allow them to perform for at least the next few years. Some of the PSUs could possibly be a money spinner and could produce higher amount of growth for the investor and the shareholders.


Would you buy Tata Motors at this point?They are saying that things are going to get back on track but the numbers are not holding up?I would say the Tata Motors strategy to turnaround the company has been fairly successful. In the Phase 1 of the turnaround, they probably beat their best in creating the sound in infrastructure and the distribution points pertaining to the commercial vehicles and they are successful with that. The results are already being seen. The commercial vehicle demand is also improving. 

On the other side on passenger vehicle side also, the turnaround is basically well crafted and now they are undergoing the turnaround strategy for JLR both in Europe as well as in China. Corrective steps are being taken. They have been arresting the rise in cost. Whether they would be immediately successful, on that a lot would depend on how exactly the commercial vehicle market in the domestic space start giving the orders to them. 

Already, companies like Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors are having a fairly decent visibility about I think the commercial vehicle related issues because of a) the scrappage policy of vehicle, b) the BS VI implementation which is leading to higher demand generation and to a higher value. From that perspective, the commercial vehicles definitely look a very convincing story. Every six months down the line, we will see the fraction as well as the numbers coming in.

JLR is a pain point and sooner they correct, the better it would be for Tata Motors. Tthat is where one will have to keep an eye on but certainly it becomes a buy opportunity. The downside in the stock is limited particularly in the last quarter, having completed the impairment programme on the JLR front. The downside is limited in the stock and I would think that it would be an opportunity to buy may be another three to four months of holding but thereafter, the stock should be rewarding the investors.


Nomura has upgraded OMCs. They see margin comfort coming in with the government’s decisive mandate and with crude cool off coming in. Do you see any case for investment in OMCs at all?All other fundamentals are on one side but the more important part is that continuously the CPSEs ETF has been accumulating the stocks from the market and that is where you are constantly seeing demand getting generated in the stock price which is getting reflected because of that demand. 

From a perspective of looking at the investment into OMCs, it is still a commodity play. I do not think that it is going up from the commodity play. They are doing their best as far as the policy regime is concerned. In the last five years, OMCs have come out of the government subsidy related issues and they are relatively better off compared to what they were in the previous decade or so. From that perspective, they are certainly better but my confidence level remains very high again.

I am mentioning without any bias about Reliance that the company has a strong ability because of the higher amount of export in the refining segment due feedstock changing. They will have the prospect of better margins and at the same time going forward, they should be having the refinery expansion coming in. All of these arguments are very favourably placed for Reliance vis-à-vis other companies. I am more confident about Reliance. Among OMCs, HPCL, ONGC are getting integrated and consolidation would probably drive some of the companies higher.


Your views on pharmaceuticals. Sun Pharma could possibly give some positive indication on a few fronts. The numbers are likely to be more driven by the domestic market improvement in the business, more driven by higher amount of value-added products which have been launched into the global markets, particularly in the US. 
Those numbers should have carry a good amount of influence in this particular quarter but more important than that, is the overhang of certain issues on Sun Pharma. A separate corporate governance structure and a system to prevent a repeat of events in the past is one clarity which the market could be asking for. 

At the same time clarity on the new strategy pertaining to reaching out to China and working on search instead of research, the new mantra for Dilip Shanghvi, is needed. We have to see how he is going to put up this strategy into practice.

Both Cipla and Sun Pharma are probably available at a valuation which is probably quite attractive and may be going forward, if the corrective strategy plays its role, you should be seeing a decent set of appreciation coming out from these companies long-term stories. But yes, I think it appears to be promising at this juncture.


Any other pocket within PSUs that you think is investment-worthy?Companies which are playing a role in the capital goods segments, companies like BHEL suggest that the higher amount of growth is basically there for the company. That is one area where you will find the direction call. The companies are likely to see higher amount of order book coming into them and BHEL would be one of them, BEL could be another. 

There may be few more -- Engineers India etc. -- where the higher amount of fraction can be seen from the new service contracts that we have been signing up so all of this put together could possibly mean that the better times ahead for this company. $1.5 trillion worth of projects are under execution and that could possibly mean higher amount of order books for many of these PSUs and that is where you could argue they are likely to get the biggest advantage out of the current situation. 

In earlier years, they have had the capacity but they could not deliver it. Now the time for delivery would be there. So let us keep our fingers crossed as to how soon and how fast they accelerate. But the fact remains that the direction should be positive for these companies to go to."

When it comes to the larger auto story, M&M has a huge focus on tractors and farm equipment but do you see the potential? Post all the event risks being out of the way, do you feel there is any merit in relooking at some of these names?Absolutely. Discretionary consumption, that is auto story on the consumer side is a fairly strong story. The affordable or consumer segment that can afford large appliances is actually growing double digit. So the consumer segment itself is growing and if you add penetration to that, long-term it is the very segment or demographic to play into. If you look at the last four to five years, the auto sector has been buffeted by major external events. 

It started with demonetisation, then you got into BS-IV implementation, along with compulsory insurance that has to be sold with vehicles. All that increased the cost. Now you are getting into BS-VI. Added to all that was the disruption in the NBFC space and the cyclicality introduced by ride sharing. The last four years have been fairly unusual for the auto space and it has taken a toll on numbers in the last year. Expect this to recover because the demographic itself is very attractive and I would actually use the corrections to pick up stocks with good valuation today rather than shy away thinking it is a longer term problem.


What is your view on some of the pharma numbers? The sector, seems to be completely out of favour right now but we have had some key numbers from Sun, Aurobindo come out. What is your view on the sector going forward right now?We have been fairly cautious on the pharma sector for some time now and the reason is that we see there is a structural change in the sector, actually with FDA becoming more active and giving more approvals. But there is always puts and takes and we do have Cipla and Aurobindo Pharma as buys. One of the companies that reported yesterday was Aurobindo which had fairly good numbers. Sun which is bellwether stock in the space is trying to transition a slightly different story from the rest. It is trying to transition to a speciality pharma company and there has been an accompanying cost with that. Payoffs are huge, but we are cautioning investors that the speciality and marketing expenses in the US makes the story slightly more risky. It is a little bit stock specific but overall cautious on the sector. 


Does it make sense to give step motherly treatment to some of the real estate stocks?My thinking across for real estate has evolved from my looking at the sector in the US right before the GST. My perceptions are coloured and I have thought of the sector as being uninvestable and part of the reason is that this sector goes to hypercycles. 

When the cycle is good, an immense amount of capital comes in and that itself sets up the base for the next collapse. The collapse is huge because everybody has built at the same time and prices come down and capital does not give good returns. So the sector per se, for public market investors, is a very difficult space to make money. Having said that, I agree with what you started by saying that an asset light model is the one that differentiates.

It is not just for India. Even if you look at the US, the companies that do best are the asset light companies that just take on land for the purpose of building one project and after completing it, sell it off quickly. They then move on, acquiring the next piece of land. The companies that land bank are typically not good investment. 


Given the fundamental picture, would you be buying into the story?Infrastructure is generally going to be a strong play. Cement is definitely a part of that story and capacity utilisation is getting better. More than that, the infrastructure space is not just about cement. IBC is a transformational law that will improve capital allocation across the space, helping most infrastructure related segments because projects themselves will be put up when they are generating required returns which in most of the existing projects will get better pricing power and should improve the return on capital.

We like L&T in infrastructure space, we like some cement stocks and metals stocks should also do well. We like that space because of these reasons. There are structural improvements in the space which should help."
30,2019-05-29,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Pharma shares were higher in Wednesday's morning session with their sectoral index trading higher.

33,2019-05-30,Cipla,"As Dalal Street continues to speculate over a potential earnings revival time for India Inc, some 125 out of over 1,200 firms listed on NSE have doubled March quarter profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. 

Among the top grossers, textile player Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing posted 114 times or over 11,345 per cent YoY increase in profit for the quarter, while Kanoria Chemicals, Yuken India, Hathway Cable & Datacom, Linde India, EID Parry, TVS Electronics, Alfred Herbert, Bhagyanagar Properties and Shriram City Union Finance reported profit growth in the range of 10-55 times, or 1,000 to 5,250 per cent.

Except for Hathway Cable (down 9 per cent), Linde India (down 16 per cent) and TVS Electronics (down 95 per cent), net sales of these firms have increased from 8 per cent to 1,472 per cent during the quarter.

Is it worth looking at stocks of some of these companies to invest?

""Sustainability of profit growth should be the key determinant; make sure these are not one-off surprises,"" says Siddharth Sedani, Vice-President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

“Many companies would have reported strong numbers in Q4. Some of them delivered exceptional gains in terms of profitability. However, investors should look at the sustainability of those earnings and see how these numbers were in the past four to five quarters. One can consider companies with good management and promising earnings. However, global factors will continue to impact Indian markets,” he said.

India Inc’s March quarter earnings season has entered the last leg, with 48 companies from the Nifty pack and 28 from the Sensex pack having already declared their numbers till May 29. 

In the 50-share Nifty, as many as 33 companies have posted an increase in bottom lines, while 15 have reported a drop in profit.

Among others, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Globus Spirits, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TV18 Broadcast, Aro Granite Industries, Kirloskar Industries, Asian Hotels, Hatsun Agro and The Jammu & Kashmir Bank and Kakatiya Cement posted 500-965 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of TV18 Broadcast, Kirloskar and Kakatiya Cement increased over 50 per cent YoY for the quarter. 

Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on J&K Bank post Q4 results with a price target of Rs 80. “At 0.6 times on March 2021 adjusted book value (ABV), the valuation is reasonable given healthy loan growth and margins outlook, robust liability franchise, controlled asset quality and waning capital concerns,” the brokerage said.

Among Nifty companies, Ultratech Cement and Cipla posted 131 per cent and 106 per cent year-on-year rise in profit on a 17.38 per cent and 22.17 per cent YoY sales growth, respectively.

Dr Reddy’s reported 67 per cent YoY profit growth. It was followed by Grasim Industries (up 59 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 57 per cent), NTPC (up 48.70 per cent), Adani Ports (up 38.69 per cent) and Wipro (up 37.74 per cent). 

Reliance Securities has upgraded UltraTech to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ post Q4 results. Centrum Broking maintained ‘buy’ rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 640. 

Axis Bank and SBI posted net profits of Rs 1,505 crore and Rs 838 crore, respectively, for the quarter against net losses of Rs 2,188.70 crore and Rs 7,718.20 crore, respectively, in the same period last year. 

Yes Bank posted Rs 1,506.60 crore loss for Q4FY19 against net profit of Rs 1,179.40 crore posted for the same period last year. 

Among others, Tata Steel, UPL, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, JSW Steel and Tata Motors reported 77 per cent, 72 per cent, 62 per cent, 53 per cent, 49 per cent and 47 per cent YoY drop in profit for the quarter.



While commenting on the ongoing earnings season, Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interaction with ET Now said that only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. 

“The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60 per cent of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space,” he said.

DCM Shriram, Orient Cement, Godrej Agrovet, Nectar Lifesciences, Usha Martin, Sagar Cement, Insecticides (India), Brigade Enterprises, Godrej Properties, Bharat Forge, Procter & Gamble Health, Bluestar, Phoenix Mills, Butterfly Gandhimathi, Marico, Indiabulls Ventures and Orient Paper were among other companies on the NSE that reported over 100 per cent YoY profit growth for March quarter."

1,2019-06-04,Cipla,"ET Intelligence Group: Recovering from regulatory turbulence in the most profitable global market, top Indian pharma companies have zeroed in on cost rationalisation, better compliance standards and a more nimble response to competition while hoping the Chinese market could provide the salve going ahead.

A review of the FY19 performance of leading Indian pharma companies point to four dominant themes that hold the future for the industry.


Cost: Rationalisation of cost during difficult times seems to be the most important mantra for Indian pharma companies that compete on low-cost generics. Spending high on R&D related to generic drugs has not been paying off — prompting companies to go back to their planning boards to make R&D more productive. Besides, legal costs as well as expenditure on drug marketing have surged in recent years. As Sun Pharma founder Dilip Shanghvi said in the fourth-quarter earnings call, strengthening core operations and managing overall cost structure is necessary to ensure competitiveness in the market.


Compliance: With most pharma companies facing compliance issues with the US drug regulator, the topic is bound to be on top of their list of priorities. Right from observations, warning letters to import alerts – companies in India have faced varying degrees of reproach from the USFDA. Besides the loss of business and expenses incurred on remedial action, companies also suffer value erosion on the bourses amid uncertainty about the course correction. In the latest earnings call, Nilesh Gupta, managing director of Lupin, listed regulatory compliance as the first priority in FY20. Four Lupin units are facing regulatory clamps.


Competition: Competition in the US has worsened in the traditional generic business segment and is no longer as remunerative. Faster pace of drug approvals has accentuated it. To counter it, Indian companies are moving towards difficultto-manufacture differentiated drugs like complex generics, specialty drugs and biosimilars – a shift that requires change in expertise, additional investment and management bandwidth. The growth prospects of companies will depend on the selection of the right strategy at this juncture.


China: The gradual opening of the Chinese market for Indian generics seems to be a timely opportunity for pharma companies. The Chinese market prospects were discussed in the fourth quarter earning calls of Dr Reddy’s Labs (DRL) and Cipla. Indian companies are trying to find a sweet spot to export drugs to China amidst the fast-developing trade war between China and the US. Cipla’s management talked of accelerating its entry in China - which it considers a growth market. The company is in the process of setting up a facility there for respiratory products. Beginning with respiratory and oncology products, Cipla intends to increase its product pipeline and portfolio in the market.

DRL has identified 70 products from its US portfolio that meet Chinese regulatory requirements. It has been in China for two decades and with the changes in the country’s regulations, it is considering China as a major opportunity. DRL is going to build a new plant very close to the current plant in China."

Cyient: The IT firm announced a corporate venture investment in Cylus, an Israel-based cybersecurity solutions provider for the rail industry. The company did not disclose the amount it invested in Cylus.


Schneider Electric Infrastructure: The competition commission has asked parent Schneider, which acquired electrical and automation business of L&T for Rs 14,000 crore, to reserve a part of the latter's installed capacity to offer white labelling services to third party companies.


Corporation Bank: One of the consortium of lenders to fugitive Nirav Modi’s firms Firestar Diamond International and Firestar International has approached the dedicated bankruptcy court with insolvency resolution petitions for the default of ₹38.65 crore and ₹41.31 crore respectively. 


State Bank of India (SBI): The bank said it has been closely monitoring its exposures to the NBFC sector for the past many months and is taking appropriate measures to safeguard its interest.


IOC, HPCL: Oil refiners Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) Thursday said they will contest tax authorities demand for over Rs 4,000 crore in excise duty on ethanol used for doping petrol, saying the sugarcane extract for mixing in fuel is exempt from tax.


BOARD MEETINGS
 

ANALYST CALLS• Anand Rathi has retained its buy recommendation on Heidelberg Cement with a higher target of ₹263. Aided by strong price environment and concentrated efforts towards cost optimisation, company reported strong performance. Its shorter lead distances, an increasing share of premium cement volumes and higher utilisation will continue to aid the company to good performance, said the brokerage. 

• JM Financial has maintained its buy rating on Asian Paints with a target price of ₹1,475 as they continue to see Asian Paints as a compelling long-term investment theme that quite justifies the premium that it commands. While the business did witness headwinds on input-costs during the year plus increase in costs-base on account of the commissioning of two large greenfield facilities, it still managed to sustain its ROCE and ROE in FY19 at 21.3% and 24.1% vs 21.6% and 24.6% in FY18, said the brokerage.

• Geojit Financials has maintained its accumulate rating on KNR Constructions with a target price of ₹324 citing pick up in execution as projects are getting financial closure and appointed date. Healthy balance sheet, strong execution capability with better operational margin to support valuation, said the brokerage. 

 • Narnolia Financial has maintained its neutral stance on Cipla with a target price of ₹565 citing strong US growth partly offset by weak tender business. Going forward, as the company is progressing well in its initiative to build a strong specialty pipeline; clinical trials for such specialty products will add to the costs and would put pressures in the margins, said the brokerage. 

• Karvy Stock Broking has recommended to sell Havells India shares with a target price of ₹800 citing growth across segments offset by lower margins. Havells to trade at premium valuations due to its strong brand, highly penetrated distribution channel, efficient working capital management and cash flow generation, said the brokerage.

8,2019-06-11,Cipla,"Better to focus on sectors and companies with decent performances and less corporate governance issues, said Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

First on our radar is going to be DHFL. After the part payment over the weekend, the stock already went up by about 7% yesterday, but now they have paid off another Rs 45 crore and they have completed the stake sale in Aadhaar Housing. Is that a big relief and has a big overhang lifted off from the stock?
Given the carnage in certain NBFC names, now that there is a bit of a relief and DHFL has been able to clear off certain amount of dues, it may give them a bit of a pullback but the larger issue in terms of the comfort that a lot of investors may not have towards the entire bunch of stocks is something that would keep them away from investing, just because they have fallen and retail investors in particular, tend to look out for the companies where there is a larger correction.

But given the overhang of uncertainty about how this is going to pan out, the questions on at what price the deal will take place etc would remain. There may be a little bit of a pullback here and there, but in the overall context, we would stay away from companies where there are issues of corporate governance and ALM mismatch. We would definitely not venture into buying any of these companies. 


Do you feel that markets at this point are moving apart? Are markets moving past NBFC concerns or do they continue to be very vulnerable to any news?
It is a broad trend in the market that there are certain pockets where there are issues over liquidity, pledged shares, deal taking longer to fructify etc. These are the ones which are not participating. They are going down whereas a large part of the Nifty, about 35 odd companies out of 50 are pretty much okay. We are at all-time high level. Even if you look at the larger universe of BSE 200, the quarterly performances of 35-36 odd companies show there is an upgrade both in the OPM and earnings picture. 

The takeaway from this entire movement is that there are a few companies and sectors where there is a performance. They are making new highs and it makes more sense to stay with those companies, rather than trying to buy some of these companies where there is an issue and where there is a sharp correction. 

That is something that will continue for a while. Let us stay focussed on the sectors and companies where you are seeing a decent performance with less corporate governance issues.


What do you make of the buying in Britannia yesterday and could one wait it out for lower levels or would you think that all the bad news is now in the price and this is the best that you could get around the Rs 3,000 levels?
What is really happening is that for some of the consumer companies, they have actually not performed for a while because there was a bit of slowdown because of the rural issues etc but what is really playing to their advantage is the fact that the raw material prices, particularly the oil and certain other categories of items, we have seen some kind of a correction. That would lead to a bit of an improvement in the operating profit margin for some of these companies. 

So, there is both a possibility of revival in the rural space over a period of time because of the policy initiatives and the improvement in the margins leading to some kind of buying interest. We have been quite positive on Britannia, Dabur, HUL, Marico and though consumption as a space is showing a bit of weakness, I do not think there is a case for a structural slowdown there. We continue to be buyers in these names from an investment perspective. 


What about tech? Have you been taking a look at the strength that we have been seeing there, especially in TCS? 
Tech has been a performer over the last few months and despite the weakness that we are seeing in the dollar over the last two or three weeks, we have seen that most of the companies, particularly TCS and to some extent Infosys, are doing pretty well. In terms of result expectations, because Infosys disappointed last quarter, there is a feeling that there might be a little bit of range-bound movement there but the overall growth picture for TCS continues to look good and particularly in the digital part, a decent amount of momentum can be expected. Definitely for investors, who are looking for a 12-15% kind of a return with low risk, both TCS and Infosys present a great opportunity. 


How are you approaching pharma because it does not seem to be finding favour in this decline? Do you see a buying opportunity there?
It has been a laggard for a while and most of the companies are not delivering good performance. Sun, Lupin, Cadila, for almost four to five years, have been grappling to resolve their USFDA related issues. Despite the pricing pressure not being there in the US, you do not see any performances come through. It makes more sense to stay away from the sector. If one has to really buy, then may be a Cipla could be a good bet but in the current scenario, I would not venture out to buy aggressively into pharma names."

2,2019-07-04,Cipla,"Net profits of Nifty 50 companies could climb 29 per cent on-year in the June quarter on expectations that some of the banks, which had shown significant asset stress a year ago, would perform better. Revenue will likely expand 7.4 per cent and log single-digit growth for the first time in nine quarters, reflecting higher base effect and slowing demand.

Banks, construction and cement companies, and capital-goods makers are likely to do better, given the higher rate of loan recoveries, increased capacity utilisation at plants, and rising prices. Automobile, consumer goods, metal and telecom companies are expected to report subdued earnings.

“The first-quarter corporate results will have the large base of Q1FY19 as an impediment. High-frequency data in India for Q1FY20 have been largely weak, although some respite was seen in steel and power generation in the first two months of the fiscal,” said Deepak Jasani, research head, HDFC Securities.

“The consumer space has also been facing a slowdown, compounded by tightness in the credit markets,” said Jasani of HDFC Securities.

Operating margin is expected to contract by 100 basis points (one percentage point) to 20.9 per cent in the June quarter. But it will still be better than the 18 per cent operating margin of the March 2019 quarter.

Growth momentum for the rest of FY20 hinges on the pace of demand recovery in various pockets of the economy — rural and urban consumption, and industry.

“The economy continues to suffer from slowdown across sectors and tight liquidity. All eyes are now on the budget and the extent to which these concerns will be addressed,” said Jasani.



SECTOR EXPECTATIONS

AUTOMOBILES
Earnings at auto companies will be under pressure for the second consecutive quarter owing to a sharp contraction in volume growth and lower capacity utilisation. Volume growth of passenger cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles dropped 10-22 per cent during the quarter following rising channel inventory. India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki’s volumes fell 19 per cent in the quarter, while Hero MotoCorp’s volumes dropped 12 per cent.


BANKING
The declining rate of fresh nonperforming loans at several banks is a major positive for the sector that has been battling poor asset quality for the past several quarters. State Bank of India, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank should report profit recoveries. Retail-oriented lenders, such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, may report a further slowdown in credit offtake, in lockstep with slowing consumer demand.


CAPITAL GOODS
Capital expenditure by state governments and the public sector is likely to support the performance of capital goods companies. In addition, order inflows during general elections have been better than Street estimates.


CEMENT
The effect of rising cement prices was not fully visible in the previous quarter. In the June quarter, large cement companies are expected to benefit from the spillover effect of higher prices. Also, cement production in May rose 2-3 per cent on-year. Revenues of UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to rise by 10-15 per cent and net profit by 5-7 per cent.


FMCGThe June quarter results are likely to be affected by a slowdown in demand due to weak macroeconomic conditions amid water scarcity in rural India. FMCG companies are likely to post single-digit volume growth. Advertising spend may remain high as companies continue to invest in brands. The key factor to watch would be management commentaries on consumer demand in an environment of erratic rainfall and a broader economic slowdown.


IT
While the June quarter has traditionally been a good quarter for Indian IT companies, unfavourable currency movements and slower project ramp-ups in some cases may affect top line growth. TCS and Infosys are expected to report 2-2.5 per cent sequential growth in dollar-denominated revenues. Operating margins are likely to be under pressure.


METALS
Lower metal prices and slowdown in the local auto industry will likely affect earnings at metal companies, although a relatively weaker rupee may partially help offset the impact. Prices of steel, aluminium and zinc have fallen by up to 25 per cent from their peaks of last year, which should hit profitability.


PHARMA
Pharma companies are likely to continue their improved performance seen in the preceding quarter. While there are no major positives, price erosion in the US market has peaked, aiding their performance in the key market. Cost rationalisation on the R&D front is likely to continue. Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma and Cipla are expected to register improved performances.


TELECOM
A gradual decline in pressure on billing rates is the big takeaway for listed telecom companies. This may lead to a modest increase in revenue, but profitability may not improve much due to the intense competition."

5,2019-07-09,Cipla,"New Delhi: Online pharmacy venture PharmEasy is close to wrapping up a $100-120 million equity financing round, led by a host of new investors including CDPQ, the second-largest Canadian pension fund, and LGT, the private banking and asset management group controlled by the Liechtenstein princely family.

The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the month, will value the five-year old company at $500-600 million, according to multiple sources aware of the development. Other new investors entering the investor cap table include venture capital firm Aspada and a Korean investment firm.

The round, once it closes, will be one of the largest in the country’s online pharma space, a sector that continues to face a combination of lack of regulatory clarity and conflicting court orders, but has also seen all the major players in the segment either scoop up or go to market for raising substantial capital.

PharmEasy and LGT declined to comment. CDPQ has also declined to comment on the PharmEasy deal.

As per the terms of the deal, the investment will be made in 91streets Media Technologies, the parent company of PharmEasy, and comes a little more than three months after the online drugs retailer started the merger process with pharmaceutical distribution company Ascent Health and Wellness.

ET reported the news of the merger in its March 28 edition. Prior to merger, the promoters of Ascent Health and Wellness held a substantial chunk in PharmEasy.

Once the merger is through, 91street Media will emerge as the holding company of both PharmEasy and Ascent Health and Wellness, which allows it to not only control front-facing online pharma sales and logistics, but also its critical distribution and supply chain channels.

Ascent, which caters to more than 25,000 retailers across the country, also works with a number of the top pharmaceutical companies, such as Zydus Cadila, Cipla and Sun Pharmaceuticals, along with notable hospital chains including Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital and Manipal Hospitals.

The company provides the pharma majors with all channels of distribution, including retail and institutional, while separately managing the pharmaceutical supplies, and acting as a vendor for the hospital chains.

For the country’s online drug retailers, gaining control over distribution and supply chain is critical. Almost all of them have invested in pharmaceutical distributors, but have thus far kept the investments at arm’s length.

Additionally, talks with Soft-Bank — first reported by business daily Mint — are continuing, the sources cited above added.

The latest round of funding comes about 10 months after the Mumbai-based PharmEasy scored $50 million in fresh capital in a round led by Eight Roads Ventures, the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International; F Prime Capital, the US-based sister fund of Eight Roads Ventures; Nandan Nilekani-backed investment firm Fundamentum and San Francisco-based hedge Fund Think Advisors. It had valued the firm at $150 million at the time.

CDPQ - Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec - which manages assets of more than $309.5 billion, has largely focused on betting on core sectors such as automobiles, infrastructure, real estate, stressed assets and renewable energy. It is, however, an investor in Fundamentum.

Separately, LGT, which has been reported to have assets under management of about $207.5 billion, recently took over WGC Wealth, the erstwhile wealth management arm of the debt-laden DHFL group, renaming it Validus Wealth."

12,2019-07-16,Cipla,"MUMBAI: Drugmaker Cipla’s European unit has formed a joint venture with Shanghai-based Jiangsu Acebright to manufacture respiratory products in China, marking the Indian company’s second attempt at entering the Chinese market.

Cipla EU will hold majority stake in the JV which will have a combined investment of $30 million, Cipla said in a filing to the stock exchanges on Tuesday.

The announcement, which came during market hours, sent Cipla’s shares up by 1% during trade. The scrip closed 0.5% higher on the BSE at Rs 553.

“We are pleased to strengthen our relationship with Cipla through this joint venture and strongly believe the joint venture will bring more products to Chinese patients in the respiratory segment,” said Shengping Xu, chairman of Acebright Group, in a statement.

Jiangsu Acebright Pharmaceuticals is a subsidiary of Shanghai-based Acebright Pharmaceuticals Group that manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients for anti-viral, oncology products and vitamin ingredients.

In 2014, Cipla’s then subsidiary Mediate had sold its 48% stake in its joint venture with Jiangsu Acebright to the latter for Rs 115 crore.

In an interview with ET earlier this year, Cipla’s CEO Umang Vohra had said the company planned to pull back from noncore regions and focus on markets like the US, China, Brazil and South Africa.

“While our core home markets remain our current growth anchors, we see China as a crucial part of our future roadmap. In May, we inaugurated our office in Shanghai. We have a longstanding relationship with Acebright, and this partnership to build a manufacturing facility in China is a significant step for us”, said Vohra."

22,2019-07-25,Cipla,"MUMBAI: There is some good news around the corner for the over 72 million diabetics in India, as cheaper versions of a blockbuster drug are expected to hit the market soon. With one of the relatively newer but important anti-diabetic drugs, Vildagliptin manufactured by Novartis, losing patent protection in December, dozens of companies are readying plans to launch the generic version to get a slice of the action in the growing Rs 13,000-crore diabetes therapy. 

The cost of therapy will reduce by over 50%, making it easier for millions of diabetics to access the drug. Gliptins, a relatively new class of oral diabetes drugs, have emerged as a highly popular therapy and are considered the future of treatment. The three gliptins in the market - Sitagliptin, Vildagliptin and saxagliptin- are priced at around Rs 45 for a day's therapy, taking the cost of treatment to Rs 16,500 per year. 

 Industry watchers say most companies, including Zydus Cadila, Glenmark, Mankind Pharma, US Vitamins, Cipla and Abbott, are keen to launch the drug. At least 18 firms were reportedly restrained by Novartis last year in Gujarat alone, from launching the drug before patent expiry. 

 What makes the patent expiry significant for Indian pharma is that Vildagliptin is the first among the gliptins to get off the block, and also the first (diabetes) medicine whose end-of-patent life will be witnessed by industry. 


 Confirming the patent expiry of Vildagliptin in December, a Novartis spokesperson said ""We believe there continues to be a huge unmet need in this segment. We are unable to share our plans post patent expiry, as this is competitive information."" Most companies whom TOI got in touch with, did not want to disclose their plans. 

Vildagliptin has about 25% share of the gliptins market of Rs 3500 crore, even as prescriptions are dominated by low-priced Teneligliptin. In 2015, Teneligliptin disrupted the market with its affordability, and became the first molecule to reach the milestone of touching 100-plus brands in two years. 

A similar trend is expected in the case of Vildagliptin, considered a better and safer formulation, with over 20-25 players entering the fray. The price of the drug may settle around Rs 10 for a day's therapy over a period of time, drastically changing the landscape and by bringing in more patients in the advanced gliptin therapy."

25,2019-07-26,Cipla,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 30.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

HSBC has maintained buy rating on Larsen & Toubro with a target price of Rs 1,630. L&T’s focus in its ongoing five-year strategic plan is on improving profitability, reduc ing working capital intensity, RoE expansion and asset monetisation, said HSBC. These focus areas align with investor expectations for the company in the current cycle and should be value accretive for shares, said HSBC. The brokerage has forecast a 16 per cent earnings CAGR over FY19-21 and ROE improvement from 13.7 per cent in FY18 to 16.5 per cent by FY21. The stock ended down 1 per cent at Rs 1,372.95 on Thursday.


Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained reduce rating on Schaeffler India with a target price of Rs 4,200. Schaeffler India reported weak results in the second quarter of calendar year 2019 with 26 per cent year-on-year decline in net profit, which was 26 per cent below estimates, the brokerage said. While long-term growth prospects remain strong, slower growth in the auto segment in the near term is a challenge, said Kotak Institutional. It cut EPS estimates for CY19-CY21 by 14-15 per cent. The stock ended down 1.1 per cent at Rs 4,045 on Thursday.


Edelweiss has retained buy rating on PVR with a target price of Rs 2,049. The brokerage expects PVR to be a key beneficiary of sprawling urbanisation, growth in disposable incomes and rapidly expanding organised retail. Overall, PVR continues to be a best-in-class business with robust financials and sharpened focus on growth, said Edelweiss. The stock ended down 1 per cent at Rs 1,784.75 on Thursday.

CLSA has retained outperform rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 600. Cipla is taking several steps towards establishing new growth triggers, including investments in specialty products in the US, trials for generic Advair DPI, entry into China and several ‘out of box’ ideas such as e-pharmacy and partnership for patient loan financing for anti-cancer drugs, said CLSA. Many of these initiatives will likely bear fruit after FY22, it added. The stock ended up 3.4 per cent at Rs 536.2 on Thursday.

Credit Suisse has maintained neutral rating on Jubilant FoodWorks and cut target price to Rs 1,200 from Rs 1,350. The brokerage cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 by 13-16 per cent. Same store sales growth slowed down further in the June quarter which is a reflection of the broader consumption slowdown and rise in competitive intensity from food aggregators, it said. Credit Suisse said it remains cautious as the business model is severely impacted by same store sales growth slowdown. The stock ended up 1.9 per cent at Rs 1,178.1 on Thursday."
26,2019-07-28,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Homegrown drug major Cipla has urged the government to increase fund allocation for the healthcare sector, improve ease of doing business and formulate policies that aid the domestic pharmaceutical industry.

Addressing shareholders in the company's Annual Report for 2018-19, Cipla Chairman Y K Hamied said basic healthcare in the country will always require urgent attention given its population and disease burden.

""India should formulate legislation on healthcare to suit the specific needs of the indigenous pharma industry as also the healthcare required in the country. An increase in the Government's public healthcare expenditure is the need of the hour,"" the industry veteran said.

Echoing the sentiment, Cipla Executive Vice-Chairperson Samina Vaziralli said with the government returning for a second consecutive five-year term armed with a strong mandate, expectations are high.

""As a pharma company, we look forward to support in strengthening infrastructure and ease of doing business, developing a robust regulatory framework, increasing healthcare expenditure, and balancing of pricing controls with provision of accessible and affordable healthcare,"" she said.

The company is also eager to explore ways to partner with the government in its ambitious healthcare schemes to ensure coverage to the maximum extent possible, Vaziralli added.

Commenting on business aspects, Cipla Managing Director and Global CEO Umang Vohra said the drug major eyes growth in various emerging markets like China.

""We have spoken about our ambitions in China as a future growth market. We are keen to take our well-established expertise in the respiratory segment to patients in China,"" Vohra said.

Simultaneously, the company will also explore various routes to build a portfolio of products in China in other therapeutic areas such as oncology, he added.

The company said it plans to grow private market business in Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In Brazil, it aims to focus on oncology while eyeing partnerships in the biosimilar field in its key markets.

Currently, Cipla's core markets India, South Africa and US continue to anchor its growth, Vohra said.

In India, the company said it will focus on therapeutic segments like diabetes, dermatology, cardiology and women's health. In South Africa, the company aims to scale up its over the counter (OTC) business and also continue momentum in private market.

Besides, the company said its next leg of growth in the US will be driven by opportunities in the respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic areas, where its internal R&D driven contributions to the complex generics and specialty segment portfolios will play a key role.

The company said it will also continue driving cost efficiencies through various initiatives and drive operational efficiencies through a lean model, use of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics."
27,2019-07-29,Cipla,"New Delhi: Eight Roads Ventures has led a $12 million (about Rs 83 crore) investment round in intelligent wealth management platform StashAway, the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International Ltd said on Monday.

StashAway will use the proceeds from the Series B round for product development and market expansion, among others.

The three-year-old venture’s existing backer, Asia Capital & Advisors, the investment firm founded by Francis Rozario, the former CEO of Fullerton Financial Holdings, also participated in the latest round.

The Singapore-headquartered StashAway, which has about 40 employees, has raised $20.4 million in funding till date, across three rounds, it said in a statement.

“The financial backing from Eight Roads Ventures, one of the earliest investors in Alibaba, alongside the continued support of Asia Capital & Advisors, will accelerate investment product development for our clients in Singapore and Malaysia, while also supporting market expansion throughout the APAC region,” Michele Ferrario, CEO of StashAway, said.

Regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, StashAway is described as a robo-advisor to retail and accredited investors, and delivers automated personalised portfolio management to its customers.

It claims users across 125 nationalities and spread across 77 countries have opened an account and used the platform since launching services in Singapore in mid-2017.

The company, which also launched operations in Malaysia last year, has also introduced its own financial education programming, StashAway Academy.

“The disjointed Southeast Asian wealth management landscape offers great potential to low-cost digital investment managers. (StashAway’s) transparent pricing, robust investment methodology, and ease of use make for a compelling customer proposition,” Raj Dugar, managing partner - Asia at Eight Roads Ventures, said.

Eight Roads, which has invested $6 billion since 2008, and primarily backs companies operating across the healthcare, technology and consumer sectors, has invested in a number of ventures that have emerged from Asia’s third-largest economy, including BankBazaar, Chai Point, PharmEasy, Cipla Health and Shadowfax.

StashAway was founded in 2016 by Michele Ferrario, the former group chief executive of Kinnevik AB and Rocket Internet-backed fashion ecommerce venture Zalora; Freddy Lim, the former global head of derivatives strategy at Nomura, and serial entrepreneur Nino Ulsamer."

29,2019-07-30,Cipla,"I do not see Sebi planning to put a cap on broker fees in PMS and AIF as a negative because the pricing and the disclosure in some of the products is not necessarily the best in terms of practices. That may be good for the industry, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

We are already grappling with the consistent sell-off from the FPI fraternity right after the budget. Now it seems the regulator may be tightening its noose on PMS as well as AIFs. It appears to be bad news overall for the markets. There does not seem to be any glimmer of hope anywhere in sight?I agree with the first part that there has been relentless selling by the FIIs and FPIs and as a result, we have seen a huge underperformance by the Indian market the whole of the year and more so after the budget. But the fact that the regulator is looking at some kind of norms or the current practices being followed by the participants in the PMS or the other structures which are available in the market, is not necessarily bad news. 

We have seen time and again that for mutual funds and for any other products in the market. It is the job of the regulator to look at the practices and take the feedback and put in place a mechanism which is in the interest of the investors. I do not necessarily see that as a negative because the pricing and the disclosure in some of the products is not necessarily the best in terms of practices. So, that may be good for the industry. I do not think we should read too much negative into it.


Would FIIs still think midcaps are expensive? Back home, everyone is hunting for value and are yet incredibly risk averse. Where would you be looking at in the midcap universe?Some of the small companies in the cement space definitely look interesting because that space is looking pretty good, particularly in terms of pricing and the fact that you will have some kind of an improvement post monsoon in terms of dispatches. 

JK Lakshmi and Ramco Cement are some of the stocks that one can really look at because there is a lot of uncertainty about earnings in many sectors and there are a few sectors like cement or may be some of the private sector banks and may be a couple of consumption names like HUL where the volume growth was about 5% odd in the most challenging environment and of course Asian Paints. 

The companies which are performing in this environment are the ones the investors should bet on versus the companies where the prices have corrected but one is really not sure about the business and where the debt levels are pretty high.


Apart from Axis Bank, Tech Mahindra is also slated to come out with its numbers today, What kind of commentary are you expecting and how have you read into the kind of Q1 report card that we have seen so far from the IT majors?Typically, this is a subdued quarter for the IT companies in general and in Tech Mahindra, we have seen that the guidance which they had given, both for telecom as well as enterprise solution, was not good. They had tweaked the enterprise business part a bit and the sense that we are getting is that in terms of revenue there could be a 1% dip there. Even the margins could dip by about 160 bps. Typically, Tech Mahindra margins have been relatively lower compared to the general IT services industry. So, net-net, in terms of expectations, they are pretty muted.

The only thing that people would be watching out for is whether there is going to be any kind of a clarity or colour in terms of the overall growth in the telecom space that one is really looking at and what kind of margins can one expect on a sustainable basis. Though in terms of valuation, the stock looks pretty attractive but in terms of growth, the performance may remain muted.


How you are approaching the telecom space? Is it Bharti versus Idea or it is an avoid for both?Overall, things are looking quite tough for the incumbent telecom companies as the operating performance has been extremely weak with high debt levels. More importantly, for any capex they need to do -- whether 5G or for the normal -- it is going to be quite tough. We have been liking Bharti for the fact that now that Rel Jio is already there and that entire competitive intensity is likely to come off.

You might see a bit of price stability but that is taking a while. Our sense is that if you have a one or two year kind of view, Bharti appears to be much better in terms of the balance sheet strength and the overall operating performance that they have. Idea definitely we would avoid at this point of time and more importantly if you see the actual performances in terms of call drops, etc, the network issues that are there it is pathetic in terms of servicing. It would take a while for the telecom companies to show up in terms of better investor sentiment.


 The preferred bets within real estate are Mumbai specific plays like Godrej Properties or Oberoi Realty. At a time when you are seeing real estate in doldrums and it seems that the pain is going to last for some more time to come, is this a good time to buy into DLF? They seem to be ahead of the curve when it comes to deleveraging their balance sheet?I agree on the deleveraging part. DLF has taken some steps and given the fact that the commercial side of the business, the lease rentals, have been good and we had some kind of deals where REITs were launched. These are the positives for DLF but given the overall environment that we have in our economy today, though interest rates are falling, the appetite to buy more into real estate is still not there.

For DLF, on the enterprise level and at the company level, the debt is still pretty high. Unless we see some kind of stability in the residential part of the business, it would be hard to make out a case for buying into a stock like DLF. Yes, because of the lower interest rates, if somebody wants to buy some of the real estate players, maybe some of the better ones like Godrej, etc, one can really look at it but overall we would definitely stay away from the sector for a while.


Would there be any concerns you have on the fundamentals of the Grasim stock apart from the fact that we have seen that rub off price drop yesterday.The structure of Grasim is such that, there is UltraTech and more importantly the remainder of the Idea stake. That could become a pain point for Grasim and the rest of their other commodity businesses like sponge iron and a couple of chemical businesses. 

I do not think there is too much of an issue. But because of the holding company nature and the investment that they have in the telecom, there is some kind of an issue going on in terms of the derating. That could have led to a weakness. On an overall basis, Grasim continues to look quite okay because the UltraTech part of the business where they have significant stake is shaping up well and the other businesses are also quite stable. I continue to have a positive bias on Grasim. Yesterday’s selloff could be either technical or with respect to their stake in the Idea I think.


What you are expecting from Axis Bank’s numbers this time around?In terms of the numbers, the loan growth could be in the range of about 15% to 16%. The key moniterables for Axis Bank could be the slippages because last time around the slippages were somewhere in the range of about Rs 3,000 crore on a total watch list of about Rs 9,500-10,000 crore. The sense that we are getting is that the slippages could be somewhere in that range about Rs 2,800-3,500 crore. 

Fillers that we are getting is that the gross NPL in terms of percentage could be a bit higher versus the last quarter at about Rs 5.7-5.8 crore. So there might be a bit of a negative surprise in terms of the slippages and gross NPL. The loan growth part should be okay and there might be a bit of a negative reaction when these numbers are announced by Axis Bank. Within the banking space, ICICI Bank definitely stands out vis-à-vis some of the other banks.


 What about Dr Reddy’s? How do you read into the kind of quarter that the company has delivered and the kind of management commentary that has come about?The numbers appear definitely subdued. The fact that some of their key products have got pushed into 2020 again because of some regulatory issues is not great news. The only positive takeaway could be that the generic business in the US is stabilising and there was a bit of a growth over there but the rest of the markets -- be it India or some of the other markets there -- has not been that great outcome as far as the Dr Reddy is concerned.

It would take time for some of these companies to come out with a stronger set of numbers given the environment that we are into both India and other markets. Within the pharma space, we like Divi’s Lab and Cipla because performance wise, these two companies are better placed.


What do you think about Zee in light of the fact that a deal could be imminent any time now and earnings this time are pretty much intact as well?It remains to be seen what kind of structure they are looking at and what kind of valuation they are going to get for the overall broadcasting part of the business that they have. The quarterly numbers for Zee have been quite good, particularly on the subscription side of it. One would really want to know what kind of overall structure they are looking at because both on the broadcasting and on the digital part of it, some clarity is required in terms of the thought process and plan that they have. 

Also one of the reasons why Zee was under tremendous pressure was that the debt level at the enterprise level was somewhere in the range of about Rs 13,000 odd crore. Post this deal, what kind of repayment are they looking at and what kind of debt level would they be comfortable with in the balance sheet is something that one would be watching out for. We also hear that for some of the group companies where Zee has a stake, there could be some kind of deal involving those also. So, that is something that could bring about some kind of some of parts valuation aspect for Zee. 

Overall, Zee remains quite interesting at this point of time because just a couple of days are left in terms of the announcement that the management made. So, depending upon the deal there might be some action in Zee at this point of time."

4,2019-08-05,Cipla,"MUMBAI: Former Myntra-Jabong CEO Ananth Narayanan is finalising a move to epharmacy platform Medlife, more than six months after having exited the Walmart-owned fashion e-tailer, three people in the know said.

Narayanan is learnt to be taking on the CEO role at Medlife and has also invested personal capital in the company run by the family behind pharmaceutical major Alkem Laboratories, sources privy to the development said.

Medlife, which sells medicines online along with facilitating diagnostic tests and doctor consultation, is currently in talks with Soft-Bank Vision Fund and pharma major Cipla for a funding round which is estimated at $100-150 million.

“He (Narayanan) has been in discussions with Medlife to take up the top job and build a team as they look to shore up external capital. Till now the Bengaluru-based firm has run only on family funds,” said a person privy to the talks. Narayanan, who was entitled to around $25 million as part of the Flipkart acquisition by Walmart, may have received around $10 million with rest of the amount expected to come in tranches over the next year or more.

An emailed query sent by ET to Narayanan did not elicit a response till press time.



Having joined Myntra in 2015 as its CEO, he had spent 15 years at McKinsey across various geographies. After the Jabong acquisition, he was heading the combined entity. Narayanan had held talks with SoftBank Vision Fund for a possible role but the discussions did not materialise, multiple people said. Narayanan has been backing startups in his personal capacity with investments in Curefit, scooter rental startup Vogo, education platform Unacademy, among others.

For Medlife, bringing someone like Narayanan will help it go out and raise a financing round which has been in the works for months now. Earlier this year, the company which was founded by Tushar Kumar and Prashant Singh in 2014, acquired Bengaluru-based medicine-delivery startup Myra in an allstock deal, indicating early signs of consolidation in India's crowded epharmacy sector.

Medlife, which competes with the likes of 1MG, Netmeds and PharmEasy, said its sales grew to nearly ?700 crore in FY19. The epharmacy is targeting Rs 1,400-1,500 crore in the current fiscal. The company raised Rs 298 crore at a valuation of Rs 2,788 crore from Kumar’s family trust, Prasid Uno, a shareholder in Alkem Laboratories. Kumar’s father was one of the cofounders of Mumbai-based Alkem."
3,2019-08-05,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Temasek is finalising an estimated $100 million equity financing round in Ascent Health and Wellness, as global investors continue to pump in capital in pharmaceutical ventures that not only have a significant distribution presence, but also operate a front-facing e-commerce business.

According to two sources briefed on the developments, the government of Singapore-backed investment major, which has a net portfolio value of $230 billion, and Ascent Health and Wellness are likely to close the deal over the next 45 days, with the latest fund infusion anticipated to value the company at about $650-700 million.

An email sent to Siddharth Shah, chief executive of Ascent Health and Wellness, did not elicit any response at the time of going to press, while a Temasek spokesperson declined to comment. Temasek’s investment in the Mumbai-headquartered company, which also owns online pharma retailer PharmEasy, will be part of the same round, which will also see the entry of CDPQ, the second-largest Canadian pension fund, and LGT, the private banking and asset management group controlled by the Liechtenstein Princely Family into its investor cap table.

According to the sources cited above, the financing round, once it closes, will be one of the largest in the country’s online pharma space, a sector which continues to be racked by a combination of lack of regulatory clarity and conflicting court orders, but has also seen all the major players in the segment either scoop up or in the market to raise substantial capital.

ET was the first to report on CDPQ and LGT investing in PharmEasy, which had merged with Ascent Health and Wellness earlier this year. The two investors, along with its existing set of institutional backers are expected to put in about $100 million into the company.

The six-year-old Ascent Health, which has emerged as the country’s second-largest pharma distributor after Apollo, caters to more than 20,000 retailers across the country, also works with a number of the top pharmaceutical companies such as Zydus, Cadila, Cipla and Sun Pharmaceuticals, along with notable hospital chains, including Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital and Manipal Hospitals. Founded by Shah in 2013, Ascent Health provides the pharma majors with all channels of distribution, including retail and institutional, while separately managing the pharmaceutical supplies, and acting as a vendor for the hospital chains.

For the country’s online drug retailers, gaining control over distribution and supply chain is critical. Almost all of them have invested in pharmaceutical distributors, but have thus far kept the investments at arm’s length.

Separately, India has been an active hunting ground for Temasek. The investment company, which was reported to have a net portfolio value of $11 billion in Asia’s third-largest economy, has invested in ride-hailing major Ola, payments technology firm Pine Labs and is also reportedly in talks to pick up a stake in BookMyShow."

22,2019-08-08,Cipla,"Our growth engine will be India, the US and to some extent South Africa. After a quarter or two, it will definitely be more of South Africa because the base of the tender business would be rebased, says Umang Vohra, MD & Global CEO, Cipla. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Could we talk about the India business first because that is looking very weak with some one-offs as well. Could you update us what exactly went wrong?We have two elements of unusual activity in the India business. The first is – we received a fair amount of orders towards the end of the month and our accounting procedures cut off what we cannot ship by a certain date. That is roughly about Rs 90-odd crore of deferral which means that those revenues get booked into quarter two and then we also had a model change in our generic distribution business. We had to do this. We had alluded to it in Q4 that we are going to implement it. It has a fairly significant impact because the generic business is almost 30% of our overall India business and that has declined. Without these two factors, the India business would have shown respectable growth.


Do you think the lumpy nature of India business will continue? What is the kind of growth that you are expecting for the latter part of the year?Cipla in Q2, Q3 and Q4 should begin to beat industry or match industry growth. We will try to target industry-leading growth Q2 onwards. When we talk about lumpiness in India business, there are several factors at play and most companies have been adjusting to it differently. 

We had underestimated the quantum of change in the distribution side of the business. Suddenly we had consolidators, aggregators, large buying groups and the fabric of the industry has changed. Different companies at different points in time have responded to this. Some responded in previous years, some responded this year, some will respond at the latter half of the year. So it is largely linked to the way the distribution system in the country is changing. That creates lumpiness because you decide to respond to it in a quarter and then that quarter becomes a base for the next particular set of quarters.


The US market did well. What about other markets like South Africa, the emerging markets? They are down 17%. EMs fell by 40% and global API was down by 9%. What happened to other markets?In South Africa, our private market business is up. It is growing faster than the market. It is about 60-70% of our overall business in South Africa. The tender business is rebasing because there is a new tender out at a different price level. This tender is going to be around for three years. It will rebase after three years. We are pretty much at the end of that rebasing cycle. Maybe a quarter more or so and then the numbers would perhaps be rebased to the new tender when it was issued and so maybe a quarter or two more. 

But other than that, volume growth continues to be strong. 

Emerging markets had a cutoff issue and that was linked more to the rain last week when we had excessive rainfall in Mumbai. Our depots could not be reached for getting out stock. We have had a deferral of revenues there to the extent of almost $15 million.


Outside US and India business, what is the visibility for other markets?South Africa should eventually get back to growth. The private markets will grow faster to outstrip what we are seeing on the tender side of the business. In emerging markets, we are not looking at very aggressive growth. If it stays where it is, that is probably a reflection of the stress we see in the geopolitical system around the Middle East. The growth engine will be India, the US and to some extent South Africa. After a quarter or two, it will definitely be more of South Africa because the base of the tender business would be rebased.


The US business was led by some strong performance but why did the base business grow due to the one-off drug? What is the expectation on growth in this year as well?The one off will belong to Cinacalcet. The base business has grown irrespective of Cinacalcet over the previous year. It is marginally lower than the previous quarter but our base business has also shown respectable growth in the US.


What will be a sustainable number in the US on a quarterly basis? Do you expect that growth will only be led by improvement in lead by new launches?That is right. The US business responds to launches. So, we had one quarter where we did not have any meaningful launch and we are hoping that our launch momentum starts again in Q3 or Q4 of this year. The US business would be a little range-bound but we have a very impressive pipeline coming up starting Q3 for the US.


Talk about the US market in terms of generic pricing environment, given that you have a substantial size there?Yes, it would be. It would be definitely important for Cipla because our base has increased for our DTM business. Earlier we were much smaller and now we are almost at a 120 or whatever you know 115, 120, 125 million range. The base business would come under the pricing pressure as well but we are already facing that pressure. It is in our numbers already and we do not believe the pricing pressure has fully stabilised. We see that large businesses are now reorganising and restructuring and we think that in some way this is an opportunity for a company like Cipla and many other emerging markets companies based out of India.


Globally one has seen Mylan-Teva deal. Are you expecting more such deals? It would be to the peak because you have seen announcements from Teva, Mylan and the underlying stress is due to the lack of growth. The underlying stress is to try and see how overall a bigger company’s profitability turns more solid, cash flow turns more solid. It gives them tremendous advantage and currency power. 

There might be one or two other companies which are larger in size and which may go the same way, but overall from India perspective, I still think that you know there is fair amount of growth to be had but it has to come in different ways in the US now.


The EBITDA margin is at 22.7 and is above estimates mainly because of exclusivity which you enjoyed in the Sensipar drug. What is the margin trend now that the exclusivity effect or the booster shot you got because of this one drug exclusivity will wane away?It is core exclusivity. We have been working quite relentlessly on cost control and the way I would look at our business is that our margin profile would be roughly where we were last year in terms of the overall margins that we declared for the year. We had guided earlier that we will try to improve that on a full year basis and we are working towards that goal."

17,2019-08-08,Cipla,"India’s leading drug makers Lupin and Cipla posted healthy growth in the quarter to June, raising hopes among investors that a recovery in the pharmaceuticals sector might be just round the corner.

Mumbai-based Lupin, the third largest pharma company in the United States by prescription, posted a net profit of Rs 303 crore, a 49 per cent jump year-on-year while on a quarterly basis the growth was just 0.7 per cent. The company’s total revenue grew 15 per cent year-on-year to Rs 4,4118 crore.

“We are pleased with the robust all-round performance in our key markets, marking a healthy start for the fiscal year,” said Nilesh Gupta, managing director, Lupin. “This year is critical as we are committed to delivering on our strategic growth drivers, including commercialisation of complex generics, ramp-up of our specialty business and delivering on operational and cost efficiencies. Regulatory compliance remains a top organisational priority and we are making steady progress.”

The company’s sales in North America, which contributes 35 per cent to the total sales, fell 11 per cent on a quarterly basis but grew 30 per cent year-on-year to $218 million from $168 million. Lupin shares closed at Rs 718 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday, up 4 per cent from the previous close.

Cipla, another Mumbai-based drug maker, posted a 30 per cent year-onyear in its net profit to Rs 478 crore. However, its revenue from operations grew a marginal 1.3 per cent to Rs 3,989 crore on a yearly basis while it declined 9 per cent quarter-on-quarter.

Cipla’s US business grew 67 per cent yearon-year to Rs 1,119 crore but declined 2 per cent on a quarterly basis.

The company announced that in a mutually agreed and planned transition, Cipla Ltd will acquire the minority stake of Eight Roads in Cipla Healthcare Limited (CHL), thereby giving Cipla Ltd 100 per cent ownership interest of CHL.

“The development comes in view of Cipla’s growing focus on consumer-facing products, and the high potential for synergy between the CHL and Cipla in-house portfolios,” the company said in a statement.

Cipla’s shares closed at Rs 519 on BSE at the end of Wednesday’s trade, up 4 per cent from the previous close."
19,2019-08-08,Cipla,"I do not think pessimism is over. It is actually being overdone, says Nischal Maheshwari, CEO, Centrum Broking. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


What are you making of the moves in RBL Bank? Would names like these interest you or would you stick with the ICICI Banks and HDFC Banks of the world?
At the moment, it would be better to stick with the corporate banks given that we are seeing some amount of NPAs getting resolved. Every month and every quarter when we go through the results, basically there is hope that resolutions are going to happen though somewhat delayed. At the moment, I would want to stick with the corporate banks -- ICICI, Axis and SBI. 


Where in the financial space is the pessimisms overdone? Is it RBL Bank, AU Financials, Piramal or even Yes Bank? I do not think pessimism is overdone looking at the surprises you keep on getting every quarter. If you remember, a couple of quarters back, when Amitabh came to Axis Bank, he was very confident that this is the worst of the things we have seen. Similarly, last quarter, in the SBI conference call, the chairman once again said it was the worst we have seen and once again you are seeing more groups coming up. 

So I think, they are also just trying to figure out basically how this economy is working out. The economy is not looking up and that is why you are seeing more and more pessimism, more and more groups are either defaulting or becoming NPAs. I do not think the pessimism is over and it is still being overdone actually.


Has anything from within the pharma space stood out for you? Lupin, Cipla reported its numbers. Anything that looks like a standout on the positive side?Aurobindo also reported their numbers yesterday and it was a good surprise. The market was expecting around 20% growth. They came with around 28% growth and the margins also improved by another 300 bps. Aurobindo stood out. Lupin was better than expected but not very starkly. Cipla numbers on the face looked good but when people digged in a bit, they figured out that domestic sales are actually down by Rs 200 crore and they did not have a very good explanation on the call. That is where the concern is. But overall, pharma seems to be okay this quarter, there is no negative surprises till now. 


The Economic Times story this morning is on how Singtel is looking to raise the holding in Bharti Telecom beyond 50%, which is going to give it foreign ownership, if all the approvals get in place. What do you make of this news?This is a positive news for the telecom sector as after a long period of time, somebody is showing confidence to keep on increasing its stake. Obviously it will cost them money but that also shows them that they are getting more confident about the Indian telecom bottoming out as far as ARPUs are concerned. They believe that given that we now have only three large players, some kind of semblance is going to come into the industry. It is a contrarian move and the market should feel confident about this ."

23,2019-08-09,Cipla,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 7.50 points higher this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Investec Securities has retained buy on HCL Technologies and trimmed target price to Rs 1,205 from Rs 1,240. The company reported a solid beat on revenue in the June quarter, said Investec. It now appears that revenue growth could well be ahead of the guided range of 14-16 per cent in constant currency. Margins are likely to be at the lower end of guidance of 18.5-19.5 per cent, it said. Consequently the stock is likely to see consensus downgrades, said Investec. Shares of HCL Technologies ended up 6.4 per cent at Rs 1,088 on Thursday.


Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on JK Lakshmi Cement and revised fair value to Rs 355 from Rs 432. The company’s Ebitda in the June quarter was above estimates on strong realisations, said Kotak. Commissioning of the thermal power plant and the grinding unit should aid in cost control in FY2020-21, said Kotak. The brokerage has increased net debt estimate for FY2021.Shares of JK Lakshmi ended down 0.7 per cent at Rs 330.15 on Thursday.


Prabhudas Lilladher has initiated coverage on Bajaj Finance with a target price of Rs 3,860. The brokerage has initiated coverage given the company’s formidable franchise in consumer financing, strong growth momentum in rural finance and expected uptick in mortgage business post spin off in step down subsidiary. The brokerage expects premium valuations to sustain given ROA and ROE of 3.7 per cent/20.1 per cent, lower ALM risk and strong retail presence in consumer segment. Shares of Bajaj Finance ended up 2.1 per cent at Rs 3,335.95 on Thursday.

CLSA has retained sell rating on Tata Steel and cut target price to Rs 320 from Rs 395. The brokerage has cut FY20 earnings by 22 per cent and said its FY20-21 EPS estimates are 31-40 per cent below Street estimates. Tata has cut down its capex for FY20 by 25 per cent, which is prudent given margin pressure, said CLSA. Even after the sharp fall, the stock trades at a 50 per cent premium to global peers on a one-year forward consensus EV/Ebitda despite much higher leverage, said CLSA. Shares of Tata Steel ended down 3.8 per cent at Rs 367.40 on Thursday.

HSBC has maintained buy rating on Cipla but cut target price to Rs 580 from Rs 600. The brokerage remains positive on Cipla’s stable outlook in the US and other focus markets as short-term disruptions should eventually normalise. Post first quarter result, HSBC has made adjustments in sales across markets and costs in-line with the current outlook which lead to a 3-5 per cent cut in FY20-22 EPS estimates. Shares of Cipla ended down 3 per cent at Rs 503.30 on Thursday."

30,2019-08-14,Cipla,"FIIs have withdrawn around $3 billion but once they see growth, we can see them coming back also, says Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

It is now practically the end of the earnings season. What have been the key hits and misses according to you?It has been a mixed set of earnings. Corporate banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI, IndusInd have delivered good numbers, but there has been some misses also.Among FMCG companies, HUL growth has been modest though Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Nestle numbers have been good. 

Cement companies including UltraTech have come up with good results while auto and auto ancillaries’ performance has been below par. 

Largecap IT companies like Infosys and TCS have done well and the former has actually increased guidance. However, performance of midcap IT companies like Cyient, L&T Infotech has been below par. So, overall mixed results. We had expected slightly better but going ahead, we may see slightly better returns.


Sentiment on the street really seems to have soured with the overall FPI issue. The Prime Minister himself has said he is taking cognisance of it. Would you believe the kind of selloff that we have seen from FPIs is far deeper and has more correlation with the slowdown that we are seeing in the economy as well?The slowdown has definitely affected the sentiment. FPI tax was a trigger at that point of time obviously they wanted a certain structure and the budget had some different meaning for them. They were trying but more importantly, that was only a trigger and it is a domestic slowdown a little bit and obviously the US slowdown. 

If you look at US yield curve, earlier it was only 10-year and we were saying three-month is inverted. Now, even two-years may get inverted soon. The difference is narrowing. A major concern is that if there is a recession worry, if there are other areas all over the world and if so much is parked in negative bonds, maybe that is one of the major reasons. They have withdrawn around $3 billion but once they see growth, we can see them coming back also. 

They have gone out in September-October 2018 and then they invested again. In the last one or two months, again they have withdrawn. This flip-flop will continue and once the growth is visible, they may come back again.


As an investor, what is the right approach right now? Do you buy this decline, do you hunt for names, keep the shopping list ready? What are you advising your clients to do?If you look at domestic equity or India equity story, then mid to long term, it is a great place to be in and one has to have a shopping list ready. But given the concerns, as of now, whether we talk about Hong Kong or Argentina or about the US-China trade war, the flip-flop continues. So, do a staggered purchase and keep your shopping list ready because these times whatever portfolio you build, if you already own some stocks and you have conviction, these are the times when you will find them much cheaper at 10%-20% discount.

Overall, you will benefit but there is no hurry because the consolidation phase will take place and over a period of time you will get more and more opportunities. We have seen 20% of the stocks giving 80% of the return but in 20% of the time. We have seen how Reliance has fared recently but for many years, there was no return on Reliance. So you have to stay invested, you have to keep buying at regular intervals and keep holding good stocks.


What is it that you would identify or which sectors?We are again talking about the private banks, corporate as well as retail focussed and along with that, IT is also a strong bet because we have seen that the overall global spend on IT is still unaffected and the results of the largecap IT and IT services have shown a good growth in the coming year. That is what one of the Gartner reports says.

The monsoon deficiency is more or less gone and so maybe there will be some consumption pickup. We have seen some of the results like HUL and paints. Then comes pharma. There is US business, some kind of growth -- whether you look at Aurobindo, Lupin, Cipla and even Sun Pharma. There is definitely an uptick. 

These are some of the areas and obviously then going ahead we are positive about textiles and chemicals and because if the trade war intensifies, textile will benefit because India is the largest cotton producer, These are some of the spaces where we feel buying can be done."
31,2019-08-17,Cipla,"Drug major Cipla on Saturday said its shareholders have approved a proposal to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore through issuance of equity shares or other securities convertible into equity shares.

In a regulatory filing, Cipla said 99.68 per cent shareholders polled in favour of the resolution to raise funds.

In May this year, Cipla's board had approved raising funds up to Rs 3,000 crore by issue of equity shares/other securities convertible into equity shares."
33,2019-08-19,Cipla,"There is some sprinkling of money coming into some of the smallcap, midcap funds but it is not that sizable. It is becoming very stock specific even on the largecap counters, says Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director -- Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What has been the buying trends with some of the largecap funds?We saw a fair bit of buying in July but half of that has actually from the CPSE ETF -- those four-five large PSU names that we saw -- almost Rs 11,000 crore of purchases that happened. Beyond that, nothing has changed materially. The corporate banks still rule the roost. Axis, ICICI are still leading the charge on what managers are buying. 

Beyond that, we have not really seen too much sizable buying activity. The good part is that we have not seen too much selling either on the large caps or the midcaps which is probably a little bit of hearten in saying and I tie that back to the flows which have come in from domestic investors. They have probably gone up a tad which is great because you have seen the markets come down quite sharply. We have not seen outflows which is great.


Let us break it up and let us talk about the one high flier which has held the Nifty of late and that is Reliance Industries. What are the flows that you have seen in the last three trading sessions post the AGM last weekend, given that the stock has moved almost 10-12% ?I want to have a pulse of the flows what has happened this month but increasingly what has been happening is that over the last 18 months, you have seen incremental additions to Reliance month on month.

We saw about Rs 1,000 crore of purchases in Reliance last month. I would not be surprised if the momentum around that continues because obviously they are making the right noises. Managers had this large part of the rally when they were underweight Reliance and now a lot of them have added significant positions over the last year or so.


In the broader markets, are you looking at adding positions anywhere given the state of things right now? What is the trend looking like when it comes to midcaps and small caps?It has become a little bit of stock-pickers’ markets and for a while a large part of the money is going towards those largish cap names and that is also a derivation of because money is also going to larger midcap, multicap funds. There is some sprinkling of money coming into some of the smallcap, midcap funds but it is not that sizable. It is becoming very stock specific even on the largecap counters. It has been quite a polarised market and money has gone to Reliance. Obviously the corporate banks, HDFC Bank continues to see some flows along with the Axis and ICICIs of the world. May be some sprinkling of money has come into technology but it is nothing sizable to kind of move the needle significantly.


Would you say that the fear quotient or the cautiousness quotient is significantly higher when it comes to broader markets?Absolutely, I would think so and that is the trend that we have been seeing during the course of the year. But it has become even more significant over the last two to three months because FIIs have been pulling out a lot of money. Markets have been going through challenging times not just because of flows; there is much negativity with the NBFC sector as such and the way it has been impacting even the auto sector. In fact, that is the other thing that we have started seeing may be marginally.


You said that last time also …Yes, that is right and that kind of continues. Maruti continues to see some trickle of flows. Earlier in the year, there was a lot of selling in Maruti. It is not sizable but I would look at that as levels have come to a point where I do not want to add some positions.


Besides Maruti and Reliance, where else are you are seeing inflows amongst large cap?A couple of pharma names actually and this is something we spoke about. We saw that last month too and Dr Reddy, Sun continue to see some flows which is quite surprising.


Is it stock specific again?I would definitely say so and again I think just given the way some of these stocks have been hammered, you start looking at from the perspective that okay it cannot get much worse than this and you want to get into some of these counters. I would say the two names that I mentioned; Reddy’s and Sun are the ones which are getting reasonable amount of flows, but even Cipla or a Divi’s is seeing some flows. It is not just restricted to a couple of counters. I would say quite a few counters are getting flows.


Among the largecaps as well, there are a lot of PSU names like NTPC, ONGC, Coal India. Is that some sort of a trend that you see continuing with flows in PSUs?This is just one off-ish because of the CPSE buying that happened. But we also saw not just the CPSE but also addition from some of the regular diversified equity funds buying. It was largely related to this and when the government comes and does this disinvestment, you will see these numbers or names prop up. NTPC is probably one of the few counters that has been seeing flows even beyond the CPSE but I think the others are largely driven by CPSE.


From the broader end of the market, can you highlight some of the top sells and what have been the stocks that have been retained in the portfolio?I would say some of the sells have not been significant and what we have seen is not very significant. We saw some profit booking in the likes of an Infy or an SBI given that they did make sort of lifetime highs in the month of July but it is just very marginal trimming of positions. 

The other one where we have seen some selling out in the midcap counters, is MindTree which had an open offer going and then the management was being replaced. There is so much negative noise around that. We will see how things settle. Investors did get out of it. Some of the NBFC midcap counters like Shriram Transport Finance, Sundaram Finance also saw money being taken off the table. 


Which are the stocks that have been retained from the broader end of the market?Larger names like TCS, ITC have not seen significant or marginal additions. These are some of the names, including some of the other banks that I already spoke about. The HDFC twins continue to retain sizable positions. 

The other interesting theme that we have seen is that we have been talking about ICICI being added. It is the second largest holding that funds hold right now. HDFC used to be leaps and bounds ahead in terms of the favourite stock on the counter. ICICI is almost there in terms of overall exposure. I would not be surprised if ICICI is potentially the largest holding in the near future."

38,2019-08-22,Cipla,"I am not too hopeful of seeing a sustained recovery in auto numbers over the next 2-3 months, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 

There has been a little bit of a comeback in autos. Is this going to be durable in nature?Hard to say at this point of time because at the ground level, things are not looking great. Over the next two to three months, how the monthly numbers look would give a a better indication of that. Also, we have to see if the government has any package for the auto sector. I am not too hopeful of seeing a sustained recovery in auto numbers over the next 2-3 months.


Is this the darkest before the dawn or are we in for a long prolonged winter?The sentiment definitely has been weak and more importantly, the impression one is getting is that the earnings revival is not going to happen very soon, at least within the next quarter. People are not sounding too positive on that and because of that, even when you look at the stock prices and valuations on a longer term basis, you are tempted to buy but because you have gone through such a long grind and you do not see any visibility on the earnings front, it puts you on the back foot. We should take a balanced view. Expect more weakness and weak sentiment before we see a big turnaround. I do not think we can take a call. From a short term perspective, things are not looking great.


Auto stocks will be in focus once again we have got some strong commentary coming in from Gadkari talking about how there would not be a ban and there would not be a deadline with regards to that EV transition. What do you make of those comments?The government’s support and the kind of statement which have come out are actually not supporting the sector because EV has a very small part in the overall scheme of things. Even globally, if you look at the US, China and some other markets, it is not as if because of EVs there has been a major disruption for the other automobile companies. 

What is important from the domestic automobile industries’ perspective is that instead of supporting the sector to revive the sentiment, the government introduced that petrol cess in the budget and they are taking too long to come out with any kind of a package. Thus the slowdown has got extended but despite that, we have seen a decent amount of pullback in some of the auto names. We have to see how the festive season pans out. If you see some stability or growth there, definitely it would merit to look into some of the names which have seen a good amount of correction over the last six to eight months.


There have been sporadic winners within consumption sector like Dabur, Nestle etc which have managed to withstand the slump in the economy and especially in the consumption pocket. What next for Nestle?By and large the FMCG companies have delivered a reasonably good volume growth. Even HUL, Marico and Dabur have been doing pretty well. If one has to hide in the current environment, these are some of the names where you can draw some sort of comfort and we believe these stocks would be giving you about 15-18% kind of compounded growth even when things are not looking up. We continue to be positive over there. Our preferred picks are HUL, Marico and Varun Beverages which is an acquired additional territory from PepsiCo. These are some of the stocks that we would be comfortable buying into. 


We are almost through August. The festive season is around the corner. Is it a little unrealistic to be expecting any miracles in that kind of a time frame?The expectations are extremely muted but we should wait and see how actually the season pans out because sometimes with a low base, if you see good traction, that may give you a momentum from a short to medium term perspective. Things may look better once we have a festive season.


Are there any opportunities within pharma?Sun Pharma, though the quarterly numbers were not that impressive. On the domestic front and some of the specialty business front, there is going to be a steady growth and after such an underperformance over the last three years, some of these stocks are looking quite interesting though the runup may not be very sharp. But from a risk to return perspective, it makes sense to stay invested in Sun Pharma and Cipla both."

39,2019-08-23,Cipla,"ET Intelligence Group: While Indian pharmaceutical companies have been manufacturing and marketing drugs across continents for the past several decades, the boards and top management of most of them do not have any representation of overseas talent.

Among the leading companies, only a handful of them – Dr Reddy’s Labs, Lupin, Glenmark and Biocon – have expat representation on their boards as well as at the top management level. As headwinds in every drug market have intensified, a geographically diversified board and senior leadership have become an imperative. Expats at the helm can help in improving corporate governance and transparency, shaping the strategy and in adopting industry best practices – the much highlighted aspects of Indian pharma companies.

Dr Reddy’s Labs has the most globalised leadership amongst Indian pharma companies. The company, in June, promoted its COO Erez Israeli, a former Teva executive, to be its CEO. It has two expats on its board and has expats heading its North America generics and biologics businesses, respectively.

Lupin too has expats heading its Europe, Middle East & Africa, Asia Pacific & Japan, Latin America and Specialty USA businesses, besides a few serving on the board. Biocon has expats on its board and it recently roped in an expat to head its biologics business. Glenmark Pharma has two expats, respectively, on its board as well as in the senior management.

Except for having a former CEO of Teva as non-executive chairman of its board, Sun Pharma does not have an expat in its senior management. Similarly, Cipla -- a late entrant in the US generics market -- does not have any expat presence in its senior management. Data from Bloomberg show Aurobindo Pharma, Cadila Healthcare and Torrent Pharma neither have expats on their boards nor in their senior management ranks.

Smaller Indian pharma companies such as Ipca Labs, Divi’s Labs and Natco Pharma too have no representation of global talent on their boards or top management.

Indian pharma can take a leaf from the Indian IT industry. The export-oriented sector in India whose success preceded that of the pharma sector, has managed to diversify its boards and in some cases senior management, too. Companies such as Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies have expats on their boards as well as senior management."
42,2019-08-24,Cipla,"A good fundamental outlook along with rupee depreciation helped IT companies at large but a positive announcement from FM and a huge amount of momentum for cyclicals, may lead to IT stocks actually underperforming from a short-term perspective, says Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Do you believe that with a defensive tilt in currency, it is time for IT to hog the limelight?IT is already doing that for the past few weeks and months because the numbers have been very steadfast. If one takes the one-offs away in terms of the margin performance, whether it is due to visa costs, wage hikes or otherwise, there was a very decent show from the IT companies. In a classic scenario, when you are looking at a slowdown happening in most sectors of the economy, the sharp depreciation in rupee against the dollar is a sentimental push through from an earnings translation perspective for IT companies, an obvious reaction that you probably saw on the stocks. 

A good fundamental outlook along with rupee depreciation acted as a cocktail for IT companies at large. But again, there is a caveat here; A positive announcement from FM for the markets and a huge amount of momentum for cyclicals, may lead to IT stocks actually underperforming from a short-term perspective. 

A few of the top tier companies are reasonably valued compared to even midcap stocks. Staying with top tier names and holding on to your positions is a prudent strategy. But as I said, positive announcements may see cyclicals outperforming in the short term vis-a-vis IT.


Where do you stand when it comes to the pharma space?In the space as a whole, all the bad news have probably played out in terms of the earnings de-growth over the past four to six quarters including the FDA concerns and the remedial remediation costs associated with that. There was obviously higher amount spent in terms of the gross R&D expenditure by a lot of these companies to create a speciality pipeline as the generic drugs were under a huge pricing pressure. 

The third element obviously also was the news that we heard in terms of domestic formulations, is the pricing cap and the collusion case that will continue within the US markets. All these factors combined together lead to earnings de-growth for a lot of these pharma companies. Again the exposure in US markets for a lot of these companies, also created the earnings de-growth picture because of pricing pressures.

As the speciality pipeline is evolving for a few of these companies, they are in a very strong position to capitalise on that and they can garner exclusivity from their key launches with the assumptions that most of the plants which either have received EIR or OAI, should probably get resolved over the next couple of quarters, making one hope the remedial cost will go down though R&D expenses might stay at the levels that we have probably seen.

There will be a gradual improvement in margins and the overall earnings profile. So a strong ANDA pipeline, approvals coming through, expectations of benign remediation costs and actually stabilising EBITDA margins should hold out the promise of earnings recovery. 

We continue to hold stocks like Aurobindo, Cipla where our belief is the earnings story will be really good. In the case of Aurobindo, the quarter gone by has given a very good set of numbers. The formulation business has grown tremendously and net debt has gone down 18%. We also expect to see the formulations growth from the European and American businesses and the injectable business holding on with key launches supporting their growth."
43,2019-08-25,Cipla,"MUMBAI: As India’s largest drugmakers stare at an uncertain future in the US, a small startup funded by Chennai-based Shriram Group and Eight Roads Ventures (of Fidelity Investments) thinks that it has spotted a market that has remained unseen by leading pharma companies.

Eywa Pharma, based in Chennai and with offices in New Jersey, is the new pharma kid on the block that is entering the US market — considered the world’s largest, with products that have a total value of $1 billion.

“When we set up our company, we knew that the customer base in US was consolidating, but what we hadn’t considered was the extent of consolidation that was setting in among generic companies. This is where we saw an opportunity for smaller players to come in,” said Srinivasan S, cofounder of Eywa Pharma.

Eywa founders were earlier part of US drugmaker Mylan before they took on entrepreneurship.

And that’s why Eywa, despite its limited portfolio of 26 filed applications across therapy areas of which 13 have been approved, is confident of cracking the market. The competition for these products includes just 3-4 players.

Eywa’s business model is not about becoming a licencing firm, but rather a front-end generic drugmaker. According to its founders, this was done in case the firm had to add products quickly in the market; otherwise customers wouldn’t show interest if they launch just one or two products.

The firm’s optimism is startling as most trends show that there is a slowdown in the US for generic drugmakers. A report by consulting firm IQVIA stated that despite the generics market growing from $47 billion in 2012 to $71 billion in 2017, the annual growth rate has been constantly shrinking — from 22.8% in 2013 to 0.8% in 2016.

“The trend is likely to continue for the next few years with even negative growth rates before the market stabilizes and comes back on track by around 2020,” IQVIA said.

The consultancy firm has also warned that while all generic companies are vulnerable to pricing pressure, it believes that the smaller sized players and new entrants will be most affected due to their vanilla portfolios.

The lure of the US markets for Indian generic makers is an old one. After all with no price control and Indian companies ability to churn out generic drug has made them leaders in the drug formulation business. Companies like Cipla which was an India focused company five years ago decided to enter the US market with acquisition.

Mankind Pharma too in 2016 decided to enter the US market with an investment of Rs 300 crore."

1,2019-09-03,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: Participants of the domestic equity market are a worried lot and they have a plenty of news developments to digest. Worsening of US-China trade woes, June quarter GDP print and infrastructure output, mega PSB mergers, poor auto sales and PMI readings are all making traders indecisive. 

But 50 largecap and midcap stocks still look strong on the technical charts, and going by the signals on the moving average convergence divergence or MACD charts, these stocks might be heading higher in the coming days.

The momentum indicator has signalled bullish crossovers on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. The stocks have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Sun Pharma, ITC, DLF, Wipro and Cipla besides Crompton Greaves Consumer, Corporation Bank, Jubilant Life Sciences, Raymond, Inox Leisure, NIIT, Simplex Infra and Godrej Properties, among others.





The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed 29 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included Future Consumer, Muthoot Finance, Pidilite Industries, Rolta India, Sonata Software and IG Petrochemicals.




The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Some analysts are sensing an imminent bottom for the market.

“We advise traders to refrain from creating shorts and adopt a buy-on-decline strategy instead. On the downside, the 10,950 level followed by 10,874 would now be immediate supports for Nifty,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

Nifty needs to hold above 11,000 to witness a rally towards 11,111 and then 11,141 levels, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Services, who sees downside support at 10,950 and 10,880 levels.


Understanding MACD

A close look at the stock chart of Sun Pharma shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded 0.21 per cent lower at Rs 449.45 on NSE even as Nifty traded 1 per cent down at 10,909."

4,2019-09-05,Cipla,"Steel stocks like Tata Steel, EPC stocks like L&T and a whole host of PSU companies which are sitting on massive order book positions are where you can take a calculated risk, says Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


One needs to take calculated risk in life and by life, I mean markets. Where are you taking these calculated risks?Deep cyclicals for one. I have not always been a great fan of cyclical businesses but bear markets make everyone a little wiser at the end of the day, unlike a steel you start buying gradually. Eventually all this mess within US-China is going to end and the global economy will pick up and steel prices will move up. If you gradually buy steel stocks which are available just now like Tata Steel at 0.6 times price to book. If they get the European business problem solved, the India business is really a power house for them.


If they are not able to fix Corus …Then they will bring it down to a level. At the end of the day, Tatas have been good at shutting down or selling off loss-making businesses. We have seen that in telecom for one. Something similar will play out in steel. We do not know what will happen or how it will happen but you have to have faith in the management. When it does, then over a two-three-year period, a stock like Tata Steel can easily double and that may give higher returns than something in the FMCG space or something which is overpriced just now. 

There is calculated risk in steel stocks. There’s a calculated risk in engineering procurement companies and it could be private sector like L&T. Then, there is a whole host of PSU companies which are sitting on massive order book positions, right from the likes of NBCC to Bharat Electronics to Ircon, Garden Reach, Cochin Shipyard. They are all somehow related to government orders -- be it defence, be it civil. They are sitting on order books which are anywhere from three to four-five years present sales turnover of these companies. 

The visibility is there and valuations are extremely attractive-- single digit or low double digit type of price owning multiple on a trailing 12 month, high dividend yield -- extremely high return on capital. But there is fear because of the PSU label and because near-term performance has not been good. This is where you are supposed to take a calculated risk and lastly we spoke about the pharmaceutical and I would just like to add the hospital business, companies have been doing pretty well over there.


When the FPI tax came in FIIs wanted it gone and now that it is removed, why are not they coming back to India?Now, there is a slowdown in earnings.


So, tax is never an issue and it is a known devil?That is true. Everything is known and so hopefully everything has got discounted in the stock prices and we may have a bottom in place. Let us look at the positive side. No bad news is good news for this market and it is difficult to see how the FIIs think and why they sell and why they buy, but tax certainly was an issue. May be, it triggered a selling pressure and that generally gets some kind of a flow and then bad news follows bad news and then you just do not get the sentiment right. This causes the markets to go down. That is part and parcel of the stock market and it is a bear phase. you have to face it and spend that time in the bear market and hopefully if you are patient enough, then you will have the fruits of a bull market.


 In 2017, prices were here, valuations were here. In 2019, where are the prices and where are the valuations?There are pockets of overvaluation still in the market and there are pockets of undervaluations but undervaluation is based on historical earnings. If an investor has the faith that wherever there is undervaluation, in those businesses, there are temporary problems in the sector or the company and eventually they will get resolved and the earnings will start moving up provide opportunity to make exceptional returns. 

There are stocks which are highly overvalued and still going at 50-60 times PE and PEG of about two and a half times or so. Investors are migrating over there but anyway liquidity is low on those stocks. They are kind of a safe haven to invest in right now, but whenever the bear market turns and the bull market starts, I do not think that is the place which will you give the highest returns.

Investing is of course taking a little bit of a risk and buying when the chips are really down and good quality companies which have a track record to generate exceptional returns for investors in the past but are facing temporary problems, which once resolved, would see the earnings return. Those stock prices are moving up and so it is tough to get into the right stock selection and maintain a good balance. But then, who said bear markets are easy to navigate?


But in that pain and in that trouble in the bad news are you finding opportunities just yet in the market anywhere?The maximum damage has taken place in the banking and financial services industry, especially banks and NBFCs and there are a lot of opportunities. NBFCs, which have been supported and sponsored by large business houses, are available at very attractive valuations and you may see a quarter or two of slow growth and some more credit cost, but the long-term trajectory is fantastic for these companies. These are well managed, have the brand equity and the backing to raise cheap liquidity and to lend it forward. It is a viable business model. A NBFC like Bajaj Finance has demonstrated its capacity in bear markets like this but even smaller players like L&T Finance, Piramal Enterprises, Cholamandalam or Aditya Birla Capital are all great buys from a long-term investors perspective. So, that is one pocket which we are quite optimistic on. 

Then there is this entire pharma healthcare space. While overall consumption has slowed down, the consumption as far as healthcare is concerned has actually increased and for the first time after many months, we saw double digit growth in domestic pharma sales as well. If you have businesses which have got strong domestic pharma or which are into healthcare like hospitals like diagnostics, they are doing pretty well. Some of them are slightly overvalued but these are good long-term secular businesses to invest in.


Would you hunt that at all in autos? Has the time come to take a look at or take a relook at that sector?No, in fact, we made a mistake in auto and now we are looking at ways of exiting auto. When you have such a sharp slowdown in sales turnover, clearly there is something structural and not cyclical. I go back to the phases of high growth industries which when going through structural changes like say a telecom or IT or pharma in the earlier form. They used to have these high growth phase of 20-25% and then suddenly the earnings collapsed and when the earnings actually recovered, they are in that high single digit to low double digit. 

Something similar will play out in automobiles as well where after a period of very high earnings growth and volume growth, it has completely collapsed and whenever this recovers, you will at best get a single digit or a low double digit type of volume growth. It will be highly cyclical and not create as much value. The best years for auto are behind us. We could go into the reasons -- uberisation, better public transportation, high cost of ownership etc. At the end of the day, there is a structural change taking place and investors need to recognise that. 

The only exception is commercial vehicles which also is a highly cyclical play and you could take a bet, if at all, on a company like Ashok Leyland which when the economy turns and we get back to 7-8% growth rates, then the volumes go up by 40-50% for a commercial vehicle manufacture like Ashok Leyland and earnings could double too.


 So what you are doing with your portfolio is that you are preparing for a better tomorrow. You want to prepare your portfolio which will benefit from economic recovery and that cannot be captured in autos and consumption.Absolutely that is the underlying mantra. There is no great money to be made buying a stock at 60-70 PE multiple. Mind you, we look at companies like Titan, which had a high degree of visibility, expensive valuation and growth rates also but then if growth rates collapse tomorrow and the downturn lasts for some more time, even then, Asian Paints will not get impacted. 


Given the volatility on the back of various news points, what is your take on Sun Pharma?We are positive on Sun Pharma. They are following the right strategy in getting into specialised products and a lot of strategy has been changed and they are focussing on the right products and the right geographies and attractive valuation mainly because of this overhang of corporate governance.

I do not see that much is going to come out of this particular controversy and whatever corrective action is required, they have already taken it. Its balance sheet is extremely strong and some of the acquisitions that they have done may take some more time to get the synergies out of it. But at this price, I do not think there is so much of a downside in Sun Pharma unless there is some fresh negative USFDA action or something new blows out on corporate governance side. 

From this point, it can definitely outperform the Sensex and the Nifty and you need to have a slightly longer term view on this company because the strategy which they are following takes a while to start playing out, but it is the right strategy given the conditions. 


Are markets paying disproportionate premium to some of the companies where near term visibility is there? Near term is two quarters and the companies are Asian Paints, Trend, V-Mart among others.I totally agree with you.


Does one buy them because they are safe or avoid them because they are expensive?Avoid them. If you are owning them, remain invested. Nobody wants to sell an Asian Paints even at 79 times trailing 12 months, but you cannot take a fresh plunge in these stocks.


You cannot take a fresh plunge in these stocks?I do not think so. I does not make sense. At whatever limited liquidity you have, you want to buy stocks which have the potential to turnaround. 


Then why not buy IT/pharma? Ray Dalio, Howard Mark are saying that a problem is going to happen in the world. If that happens, the dollar is going to strengthen, rupee is going to weaken. So, pharma/IT maybe are the businesses that thrive on a weak rupee.As I said, we are positive on pharma.


No I am talking about the generic, not the Glaxo, Abbotts of the world.I am very positive on the likes of Sun Pharma, Aurobindo, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla the generic companies. Yes I think that all of these companies have done a lot of change in their strategy. They have right sized themselves. They are focussed on the products in right geographies and they are getting more productive as far as their spending and their assets are concerned. They are not just launching products left, right and centre. They are being a bit careful as far as their selection of products and geographies are concerned. 

Considering that what they have gone through, base effect will benefit them, rupee depreciation will benefit them. At this point, there are more opportunities than threats. Of course, the US FDA will keep on, whenever that happens it is difficult to predict but by and large, you may see good times for pharmaceuticals over the next 12 to 18 months or so. 

If you want to protect capital, then right now, IT is a safe haven because there is going to be no collapse of earnings over there but there is going to be no expansion of the growth rates as well. You are looking at 10-12% type of growth rates which is fine in markets like these while elsewhere you are seeing negative earnings. It is one sector which is at least showing positive earnings.


Do you stick by with the TCSes of the world or do you go little bottom down the line and maybe NIIT Technology, Hexaware, etc.?I am not convinced on midcap IT. Maybe TCS, Infosys are expensive and the likes of say HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Wipro may have slight bit of outperformance but it does not matter. You can go with the best buy TCS, Infosys. They will at least protect your capital in times like this. We are in very uncertain times over here and if this lasts for some more time, the bear market, then where do you hide, where do you protect your capital if you have fresh liquidity coming in apart of putting some of it into these ideas which will benefit from whenever bull market starts. If your intrinsic requirement is to protect some capital and yet be in equities, then certainly IT has a role to play."
5,2019-09-05,Cipla,"ICICI Securities has upgraded Cipla from ‘reduce’ to ‘hold’ rating with a revised price target of Rs 464.

Cipla’s stock price has corrected by over 15% in the past three months due to weak operational performance in Q1FY20 and concerns on domestic business growth.

“We expect growth revival in India business to take another 1-2 quarters due to recent realignment of distributors in the trade generic business, which has resulted in an irreversible revenue loss of Rs2bn. We believe the recent drop in valuations has factored-in these concerns to some extent. We expect base business EBITDA margin to improve with gradual pick-up in base US sales on new launches and expected growth revival in India from H2FY20 onward. Further, limited capex requirement along with improved profitability would result in doubling of FCF to ~Rs20bn in FY20E. Upgrade to HOLD, with a revised target price of Rs 464 per share from Rs 480 earlier,” the brokerage said in a report.


Recovery in India growth still 1-2 quarters awayIndia business declined 12.2% in Q1FY20 due to revenue loss of Rs2bn in the trade generic business because of realignment of distributors. This restructuring was intended to reduce the number of distributors and to have better control over inventory in the system. “We expect Q2FY20 performance to also have some impact on the trade generic business and normalcy to start in H2FY20. Growth in India business would remain subdued at 4.5% vs industry growth of ~10% and we estimate double-digit growth in FY21 on a new base,” the brokerage said.


Base US revenues to gain tractionUS revenues were strong over the past two quarters due to launch of generic Sensipar (US$35mn-40mn/quarter). However, this will reduce substantially as several other players too have launched it and intense competition would make is making it a normal product. Base US sales is currently ~US$125mn/quarter and we expect this to improve to ~US$140mn in FY21E with launch of 10-15 new products and limited-competition products such as Albuterol, Truvada, Latuda, etc. over the next 12-18 months.


INVESTMENT RATIONALE

“We expect revenue and adjusted PAT CAGRs of 7.7% and 10.2% respectively over FY19-FY22E with EBITDA margin improving to 20.0%. Higher R&D spend with build-up of specialty portfolio for the US may pressurise margins. FCF generation of ~Rs38bn over the next two years would help the company become debt-free by FY21E. However, RoE and RoCE would remain low at 11.5% and 10.2% respectively, in FY22E,” the brokerage said.

“We cut our revenue/EPS estimates by 1-2%/3-4% for FY20E- FY22E to factor-in lower India growth. Considering the recent correction in valuations, we upgrade the stock to HOLD from Reduce, with a revised target price of Rs464/share based on 20x FY21E earnings (earlier: Rs480). Key upside risks include high-value product launches in the US and INR depreciation vs USD and ZAR while key downside risks include regulatory hurdles and prolonged lower growth in the India market,” it said."

21,2019-09-24,Cipla,"Markets regulator Sebi has settled a case with an employee of Cipla for alleged delay in making requisite disclosures regarding her shareholding in the company.

The watchdog has settled the matter with Ranjana Pathak, a designated employee of the company, on payment of Rs 3 lakh towards settlement charges, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a settlement order.

The regulator, during its preliminary examination, observed that there was a delay on the part of Pathak in making disclosure to the company under Sebi's PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) norms in respect of change in her shareholding in the scrip of Cipla.

Before proceeding further and initiating proceedings, Sebi issued a settlement notice to Pathak in June, intimating thereby that the proceedings may be settled and disposed of upon filing of a settlement application. Following this, Pathak approached Sebi to settle the case.

""The proposed proceedings that could have been initiated for the defaults...are settled qua the applicant (Pathak),"" Sebi said

Sebi would not initiate any enforcement action against the applicant for the defaults.

The regulator noted that it would have the right to take enforcement actions if it finds that any representation made by the applicant is subsequently discovered to be untrue."

19,2019-09-24,Cipla,"Kolkata | Bengaluru: “Times are busy,” said Sue Ann Vaz, the head of value-added services at ABC Consultants.

Vaz’s team, among other things, is engaged by companies to provide outplacement and career-transition services to employees who are being let go of. Given the recent spurt in layoffs in India Inc, she said she had, at times, been juggling up to four meetings a day.

While the tax reforms announced by the government on Friday have cheered businesses and will likely provide a boost to the employment market, the slowdown that had gripped the economy for months has led to job losses in several sectors. But unlike in the past, when only multinationals offered outplacement services, an increasing number of Indian companies are also now calling in career transition experts, such as Vaz, to help their employees deal with the tough times, as well as ma-nage their brands’ goodwill.




Leading outplacement firms including RiseSmart, Lee Hecht Harrison, Right Management India, ABC Consultants and Persolkelly Consulting said they were getting as much as 35-100% more queries now than a year earlier. Sectors such as pharma, automobile, financial services, information technology and manufacturing are among those reaching out to them.

“Our job is to get candidates market-ready by handholding them through the entire process,” said Vaz.

Outplacement firms manage the entire transition process for their clients. This includes everything from sensitisation workshops for managers, teaching companies how to couch internal communication in the “right” terms, counselling and coaching, identifying reskilling or upskilling requirements, assistance in preparing resumes and for interviews, improving social media presence, and even spouse support through counselling.

There are instances when they help candidates get job offers on the table, but they don’t offer any guarantees.

“In times of slowdown, chances of getting a job in the same industry at the same level is hard. We work with laid-off employees to help them use their core skills and apply it to different industries,” said Joel Paul, the general manager-India at RiseSmart.

“We are also seeing more people becoming open to the idea of starting something of their own, or working in the gig economy.”

Vaz said a CXO at a firm who was getting a Rs 2 crore salary could be placed as an adviser in another firm at about Rs 80 lakh. “We explore all avenues,” she added.

Several of these firms, like ABC Consultants, are part of large groups that also have recruitment businesses, which help in resume seeding and landing job interviews.


More cos seeking help
More and more Indian organisations are warming up to the idea of providing outplacement services to employees impacted by job losses, said James Agrawal, the managing director at BTI Executive Search, India.

According to Prashant Pandey, the country head at Right Management Group, technology and financial services and pharma have seen the highest impact with the number of job cuts in the first half of 2019 matching also that for the whole of 2018.

“Such (outplacement) services are now being provided to even junior employees. In the past, the focus was more on middle and senior levels,” he said. “In the last few months, at least two large organisations have engaged us for providing services to even blue-collar workers.”

Vaz of ABC Consultants said her team was currently helping as many as 600 people. The clients include people from auto financing, FMCG, pharma and realty, she added.

Cognizant, Cipla and Deutsche Bank are among companies that have hired outplacement experts, said people in the business. These companies declined to comment or did not respond to queries.

Most organisations are looking at being sensitive to the interests of employees, said Marco Valsecchi, the country manager at the Adecco Group, India. “Also, it can help organisations deter unwanted media attention and unnecessary legal impediments and portray themselves as an employee-friendly and value-driven,” Valsecchi said. “The significance that organisations perceive by offering these services is backed by the realisation that right-sizing is inevitable in today’s economy.”"

0,2019-10-03,Cipla,"The October F&O series has seen a dip in investor confidence on concerns over the continued troubles in the country’s financial sector. Most of the stock futures which have seen a surge in open interest are from the sector. Auto makers are also seeing build-up of bearish bets. ET takes a look at five stocks which are gaining momentum in the October series and details their near-term outlook.


IDFC First Bank
CMP: Rs 38.6
OI change in October series: 23.85%
Spot price change in October series: -9.06%

IDFC First Bank has seen the biggest increase in open interest in October series. Morgan Stanley sees 45% downside in the stock. “Corporate asset quality has surprised negatively despite high past recognition and provisioning, and remains vulnerable given that around 60% of the credit book is still non-retail and we continue to see rating downgrades in India. Further, we have concerns on retail asset quality given the riskier profile of borrowers and have raised credit cost forecasts,” said Morgan Stanley in a September 30 note, cutting target price to Rs 24 from Rs 30, while retaining ‘underperform’ rating. Sandeep Porwal, technical analyst at Ashika Stock Broking, said the stock has failed to sustain above its 50-day moving average level of Rs 42. “Since then we have witnessed sharp sell-off. Fresh leg of downside is expected once it starts trading below Rs 36,” said Porwal.


State Bank of India
CMP: Rs 255.9
OI change in October series: 13.57%
Spot price change in October series: -8.98%

The stock is seeing build-up of short positions on concerns over exposure to stressed borrowers and uncertainty around its asset quality. Morgan Stanley said there is a credit crunch going on in India among weaker-rated borrowers as flow of credit from challenged lenders has stalled and it sees no signs of this reversing yet, implying risk of continued defaults at these borrowers. “Given SBI’s size, it is one of the largest lenders to many of these stressed borrowers,” said Morgan Stanley in a recent note, downgrading the stock to ‘equal-weight’ from ‘over-weight’. The stock is a short if it breaks the Rs 250-level, said Rajesh Palviya, head-technical and derivatives at Axis Securities.


RBL Bank
CMP: Rs 299.3
OI change in October series: 17.86%
Spot price change in October series: -18.27%

Concerns over the health of the banking industry have also affected the shares of RBL Bank, which were among the biggest laggards in Tuesday’s sell-off in banking stocks. The stock has fallen over 42% in the last one year compared to a gain of 14.6% in the Bank Nifty during the same period. “It has been making lower top-lower bottom and the trend is in pressure as the stock is trading at its multipleyear low levels. The price pattern suggests build-up of short positions,” said Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal. Taparia expects the stock to fall to Rs 275-Rs 280 in the near term.


Cipla

CMP: Rs 412.6
OI change in October series: 17.05%
Spot price change in October series: -6.09%

The stock is at its lowest level in a year and is seeing build-up of short positions as the drug maker recently received 12 observations from the US Food and Drug Administration for its manufacturing facility in Goa. Brokerage Edelweiss believes that risks are priced in, and has upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ while retaining target price of Rs 500. “Though branded franchise in India, private label in South Africa and generic business in the US are on track, volatile performance has led to valuation de-rating... the company’s performance will normalise from H2FY20 and accelerate from FY21,” said Edelweiss. However, the outlook for Cipla remains bearish on technical charts. “Outlook is bearish for Cipla as it has broken important support level of Rs 457. We have seen follow-up correction. One has to see the level of Rs 433 being crossed for a minor short covering bounce,” said Porwal of Ashika Stock Broking.


BPCL
CMP: Rs 493.9
OI change in October series: 11.82%
Spot price change in October series: 5.13%

The stock has been gaining momentum, led by short covering, amid news that the government may off-load stake in the refiner and fuel retailer to foreign and private firms as part of its strategic disinvestment plan for this year. “With a Committee of Secretaries recommending BPCL’s complete stake sale... we think the likelihood of its privatisation has considerably increased,” said Nomura, retaining a ‘buy’ rating with target price of Rs 480. “If there is significant investor interest, on our preliminary estimates, we think the valuation for the deal could easily be Rs 750-850/share,” added Nomura. One can buy the stock around Rs 480 levels for a target of Rs 535-Rs 540 in the next 10 to 20 days, said Palviya of Axis Securities. Palviya advises keeping a stop loss of Rs 465.

The brokerage maintained that both AUM and EPS CAGRs of ~36% over FY19-21E (after adjusting for tax cuts), backed by a solid cross-selling franchise and a high-quality sourcing mechanism. The company's board has approved a QIP worth Rs 8,500 crore, which provides comfort over its valuations. The brokerage upgraded FY20/21 EPS estimates by ~10%/9%. Key downside risks include elevated consumer leverage and prolonged rural distress.

(Source: Emkay Global) NextNMDC | Buy | Target Price: Rs 1402 Oct, 2019The latest amendments made by the government in Mineral Rules, 2015 provide a shot in the arm for NMDC. Edelweiss is of the view the changes have far-reaching impact as they: 1) are likely to facilitate a resumption of the Donimalai mine; and 2) will set a precedence for renewal of other mines of NMDC and other PSUs. Earlier, the Karnataka High Court had struck down the state government’s demand for an 80% premium. The brokerage now believes there is little room for ambiguity on renewals going ahead. Donimalai resumption would be EPS accretive to the extent of 12-15% on an annualized basis, the brokerage said.

(Source: Edelweiss) NextOracle Financial | BUY | Target Price: Rs 3,9102 Oct, 2019This stock has underperformed the Nifty IT Index by 26% YTD and trades at 15.1 times 12-month forward EPS, a 34% discount to the 5-year median. JM Financial finds the pessimism excessive. OFSS should sustain at-least 12% FCF CAGR over FY19-22 on stable margin and cash-conversion (67% OCF/Ebitda) assumptions which translate to a healthy 6% dividend yield (at c.100% pay-out); could be higher given the nil pay-out in FY19 (ostensibly to evaluate a share buy-back) and Rs 386 cash per share.

(Source: JM Financial) NextBrigade Enterprises | Buy | Target Price: Rs 2452 Oct, 2019Motilal Oswal remains confident about Brigade’s commercial and residential growth. The firm's annuity income (excluding CAM) from office and retail is likely to increase from Rs 2.5 billion in FY19 to Rs 5.3 billion in FY22E (BRGD’s share) while residential segment growth will be driven by launches in affordable and mid-income segment, the brokerage said. The pace of under construction work at one of its key projects (BTG in Bengaluru) and project velocity of its first AFH offering (El Dorado) is likely to help the company in tracing the right growth path.

(Source: Motilal Oswal Financial Services) NextGalaxy Surfactants | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,8342 Oct, 2019A rise in demand for HPC products implicitly induces growth for Galaxy Surfactants. Owing to the inherent nature and universal consumer usage of these products, their demand is largely inelastic. GSL witnessed stronger demand in FY17/18 (12.2/11% YoY) vs FY19 (8.8%), led by 18.8% YoY growth in the (high margin) specialty category. HDFC Securities expects strong traction to continue in this category driven by strong demand in developed markets. The stock should trade at a multiple closer to chemical and at a discount to FMCG companies, the brokerage said.

The regulator had inspected the facility between April 15 and April 20 and earlier classified the inspection as an official action indicated, Glenmark said in a filing to the BSE.

Nifty50 opened positive and extended its gains towards the 11,360 level on Friday, but remained highly volatile throughout the session as it traded in a broader trading range of 180 points.

The index formed a bullish candle on the daily as well as weekly charts forming long upper and lower shadows which implied that every dip got bought into. At the same time, supplies remined intact at higher levels.

Now, it needs to hold above 11,250 level to witness a bounce towards 11,400 and then 11,500 level, while on the downside major support is seen at 11,100 level.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 levels. Marginal Put writing was seen at 11,000 and then 11,300 while there was Call unwinding at all immediate strike prices. The options data suggested a wider trading range between 11,000 and 11,600 levels.

India VIX fell 0.52 per cent to 17.14.

Bank Nifty remained highly volatile and continued to trade in a wider range between 27,500 and 28,600 levels. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and a small-bodied candle on the weekly scale with a long upper shadow which suggested selling pressure at higher levels. The index has been stuck in a broader trading range between 27,600 and 28,800 levels from last six sessions. Volatile swings are likely to continue in this wide range.

Now, the index needs to hold and sustain above 28,250 level to witness a bounce towards the 28,550-28,800 zone while on the downside major support is seen at 27,500 level.

Nifty futures closed positive at 11,318 level with a gain of 0.57 per cent. There was long buildup in Biocon, Indiabulls Housing, Tata Global, PVR and Cipla while shorts were seen in RBL Bank, GAIL, TCS and IndiGo.

14,2019-10-11,Cipla,"There is a bigger risk that if the current situation continues, if the select pharma cos do not get USFDA nod for the pending product from the plant which has been stuck currently and that would spoil revenue and profit expectations, says Surajit Pal, AVP-analyst, pharma, Prabhudas Lilladher. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Indian pharma companies are facing a lot of compliance issues. Would we continue to see underperformance largely on the back of regulatory hurdles for pharma?They will face it to a certain extent but it will be company specific like say in Lupin or Cipla or Aurobindo. There is a bigger risk that if the current situation continues, they might not receive the approval of the pending product from the plant which has been stuck currently and that would definitely spoil their expectations as far as revenues and profit is concerned for the next two years.


Do you think we will see things changing in terms of warning letters? It took a lot of time earlier to reinvite the USFDA. Things are speeding up quite considerably. What is the outlook in terms of the turnaround period and do you have any preferences within pharma?The turnaround time will be different for different companies depending on the complexity of the manufacturing issues they have with the USFDA. The best way to resolve it is if you were at fault, you accept that rather than arguing and dragging the things further. So, whatever the issues are there, you should accept and go from there. 

From that perspective, there could be a probe on Lupin’s other Goa plant and the one in Indore rather than the Mandideep plant. Even Cipla, given its track record of very good manufacturing practices, may go off the hook. As far as Aurobindo is concerned, units one, nine and 11 could be going off the hook but in unit seven, there is a bigger chance that the issue could be dragged on and new approval blocked till the time they get a resolution. Given the kind of quality of comments USFDA has made, it could be pretty risky for the company to ignore that."
12,2019-10-11,Cipla,"The share price of drug marker Cipla dived 5 per cent in Friday's session after Equirius said its Goa unit will require extensive changes to meet the USFDA guidelines. The stock later recovered and closed 4.57 per cent higher at Rs 441.55 on BSE. 

According to Equirius, the unit received Form 483 with 12 observation that runs through 38 pages. Observations are largely related to procedure and SOP lapses, it said.

The unit caters to about one-third of the US businesses. The facility will require very extensive changes in SOPs procedures and processes.

As per Equirius, it could take a bit longer to the company to resolve issues. It also sees a strong likelihood of OAI (official action indicated) classification and thus a warning letter.

United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) conducted a cGMP inspection at the Goa manufacturing facility from September 16-27, 2019.

“The inspection ended with 12 observations, none of which are related to data integrity. The Company will respond to the agency within the stipulated timeline,” Cipla had said on September 28."

How are you assessing the markets fundamental especially now that the earnings season is officially started, TCS and Infosys delivered their numbers. Next week, we are expecting big boy Reliance, HUL, Zee Entertainment, etc. So, what is it that you are expecting?
Two, three trends have been very clear in the market. The market is just focussed on the few stocks and it is more concerned about those stocks’ numbers. So starting with TCS and Infosys, the numbers are slightly better than what the Street was estimating, For IndusInd Bank, again, the numbers were good enough. 

So, going forward, there are certain things one needs to look at in the financial space. Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance are the other names which you would like to see. In last six to eight months, we have seen corporate banks doing quite well, be it Axis or ICICI Bank. So I feel this is the focus list for next week.

Then we saw Aurobindo and Glenmark last week hitting their 52-week lows. So, I think this will continue for a while. 

Till the times earnings come up, till the time these issues are not sorted, they will still underperform, while a few others will outperform. Biocon looks interesting from here in terms of valuations and in beaten down space in the large cap name I think Sun Pharma looks attractive with the valuations what it trades at. So, I think the downside in both these two stocks looks limited. So, there could be some decent upside in both the stocks from current levels.



Reliance Industries is likely to come out next week. There is HUL as well which is one of the biggest names from the consumption space. What can we expect this time around as far as the Nifty Q2 performance is concerned?

It looks like the numbers will be good. I think they have been doing quite well in the last two quarters. They are bang on their targets and slightly above what their own commentary. So I think instead of results, more important thing is the guidance, what people would be looking for is the prospective. Secondly, for HUL, the volume growth is the most important thing. Somewhere, we have seen the stock has appreciated quite well in the last few sessions and valuations obviously are expensive. But I think if you look at the consumer names like Unilever, Nestle—we have seen PE multiples have always been revalued and they have gone higher and higher. 

For Reliance, the most important thing is how the Jio is going to be in the new regime of the costing structure in the telecom space. 


Which stocks would you like to talk about, which are the ones you are tracking closely?

I think defensives and corporate banks are in the front seat and we have seen that outperformance in recent rally as well. So, among defensive stocks, I like HDFC Life and HUL are at the top of my mind. So, I think these two stocks look quite interesting. And, among corporate banks, I think ICICI has been the leader and has done quite well."
19,2019-10-14,Cipla,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 24.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.


• HSBC has maintained hold rating on 
Maruti Suzuki India with a target price of Rs 7,200. Passenger vehicle industry continues to struggle as potential buyers see weaker income/ wage growth and changed spending priorities, the brokerage said. Cars like S-Presso are good to maintain market share, but focus for Maruti should now be on Rs 10 lakh-plus cars, otherwise it runs the risk of going back in time and branded as a first-time buyer car OEM, said HSBC. The stock India ended up 1.4 per cent at Rs 6,700.15 on Friday.

• Reliance Securities has maintained buy rating on 
Cipla and lowered target price to Rs 610 from Rs 650. The US FDA has issued Form 483 with twelve observations to Cipla’s Goa injectable facility, an important facility for the company, which contributes around 20-25 per cent to its US sales, said Reliance Securities. Overall, the US business contributes 21 per cent to Cipla’s total sales. The brokerage has reduced valuation multiple to 19 times from 20 times owing to regulatory issues. The stock ended up 4.6 per cent at Rs 441.55 on Friday.


• ICICI Securities has upgraded 
Oberoi Realty to buy from add with a target price if Rs 577. Recent negative developments in the real estate sector, where funding from NBFCs has slowed down, has raised questions about developers’ ability to keep their heads above water and having to resort to steep discounts to offload inventory and pay off their maturing debt, said ICICI Securities. While majority developers in Mumbai comprise mid- and smalltier developers with stretched balance sheets, Oberoi Realty clearly stands out with its strong balance sheet and execution track record, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.34 per cent at Rs 496.5 on Friday.

• Morgan Stanley has maintained equal-weight rating on 
Bharat Forge with a target price of Rs 401. The company is working towards getting product approvals and rampingup sales in new segments like aviation, railways, defense and emobility, the brokerage said. The company’s new business forays are impressive and execution will be key to monitor, said Morgan Stanley. The brokerage has maintained an equal-weight rating citing weak near term outlook due to slowdown in India in FY20 and US business in FY21. The stock ended down 1.4 per cent at Rs 418.05 on Friday.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained neutral rating on 
Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 119. A sustainable recovery in volumes at JLR, particularly for LR and China, along with the ongoing cost-cutting initiatives, is the key to valueaccretive growth and stock performance, the brokerage said. This is particularly important due to the downcycle in the cash-cow India CV business, said Motilal Oswal. The stock ended up 3.8 per cent at Rs 121.35 on Friday."

36,2019-10-21,Cipla,"The Indian pharmaceutical sector has been facing the heat for past several years owing to sales slowdown in the US export market. This is the reason behind the sector’s 30% underperformance (ie ET Pharma Index fell 18% compared to 12% gain in Sensex) in the past one year.

Besides, stock prices of individual companies also react violently to the ‘letters’ they get from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) once in a while and this time it was Cipla’s turn. The pharma company’s share price crashed after USFDA issued notice with 12 observations about its Goa facility, which contributes around 25% of its export to the US. The US business contributes 21% to Cipla’s overall sales.

However, the analysts say that the US FDA observation letter is not very serious and therefore, doesn’t deserve such reaction. These are procedural observations about its facility, equipments, etc and not on data integrity or drug specifications. Only two of the 12 observations, about lack of adequate procedures for the prevention of microbiological contamination merit concern while the other observations like equipment design, size and construction of the building, etc can easily be mended. Also the fact that Cipla has handled US FDA issues quite well, the chance of this ‘observation letter’ becoming a ‘warning letter’ later, ie impacting exports from this facility, is remote. Even if Cipla fails to deal with these procedural issues on time and it ends up as a warning letter, it will not impact the company much, as most of the products from its Goa facility also have filings from alternative facilities.


Analysts’ views
Buy: 23
Hold: 17
Sell: 3

Analysts are also getting bullish on Cipla now because the recent price correction is much more than warranted by the fundamentals and therefore, the risk-reward ratio has turned favourable. For example, Cipla is currently trading at 20% discount to its historical valuation average. Since Cipla is a strong domestic player and its US contribution is less than that of its peers, the valuation discount of this magnitude is unjustified.

Despite the tough environment, Cipla is taking steps to increase its US business by introducing one limited product every quarter and that has started yielding results also. For example, its US business grew by 67% in the first quarter of 2019-20 due to increased Cinacalcet sales. Cipla also got approvals for Ambrisentan and Pregabalin in the first quarter and the same should help Cipla to show higher growth in coming quarters.

Selection Methodology: We pick up the stock that has shown maximum increase in “consensus analyst rating” in the past month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks with at least 10 analysts covering it. You can see similar consensus analyst rating changes during the last one week in ETW 50 table."

39,2019-10-25,Cipla,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Cipla could once again be at the forefront of disruption in the pharma sector. In the early 2000s, it was the company that made AIDS drug affordable for the global South and established the reputation of Indian generic pharma industry for providing efficacious and affordable drugs.

The company has taken early steps to brace itself for a paradigm shift in the role of drug companies, from pill makers to care givers and therapeutic service providers. The new role of a pharma company is being envisioned as one encompassing disease awareness, disease management and patient care, with pills being just one part of its healthcare service.

Most Indian pharma companies are now tweaking their business models, strategies, product portfolio, product mix and market presence to better face the industry headwinds and changing market dynamics. Among them, Cipla is the first to have taken this non-traditional and all-encompassing approach of investing in digital therapeutics.

To this end, the company acquired a 12% stake in Mumbai-based Wellthy Therapeutics in February this year. It is engaged in providing digital therapeutic services to simplify the disease management of patients of cardiovascular disorders. The partnership will enable Cipla to offer a combination of prescription drugs and artificial intelligence-powered digital therapies.

Later in April, it picked a 30% stake in South African firm Brandmed that has developed an integrated real-time monitoring model to address chronic diseases.

The traditional Indian pharma market is undergoing several disruptions — right from rising penetration of diagnostic services and online pharmacies to AIbased medical devices. This is likely to impact the way pharma companies have been doing business. Their business model is going to become more digitised and change from being doctorcentric to more patient-centric. From integrated manufacturing, the pharma industry may steadily move to integrated healthcare offerings that cover awareness, diagnosis, treatment and adherence.

Cipla is taking very early steps in exploring such a role. It has carved out a niche in respiratory treatments. Management of such ailments through digital therapeutics could potentially become the company’s forte. Investors in the sector need to watch out for such a trend shift since if Cipla becomes successful, it could stand out from its peers in the industry at a time when differentiators are few."

Nifty50 opened positive on Friday but oscillated in a wide trading range between 11,500 and 11,650 levels. It formed a Hammer pattern on the daily scale and a small-bodied candle on the weekly chart, as buying emerged at lower levels while the hurdles remains intact.

The index has been stuck between 11,500 and 11,700 levels for last five sessions and now needs to hold its support to aim for the upper band of the trading range at 11,700, while a decisive hold below 11,550 can negate the current short-term bullish setup and take Nifty to its downside support in the 11,480 – 11,450 zone.

On the monthly options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,700 levels. There was Call writing at 11,600 and then 11,550 levels, while Put writing was seen at 11,500 and then 11,550 level. Options data suggested a trading range between 11,450 and 11,750 levels.

India VIX fell 5.70% to 15.31.

Bank Nifty remained volatile and traded in a broad range of 500 points for most part of the session. It formed a Hammer pattern on daily scale, as dips got bought into while a long-legged Doji on the weekly scale suggested a tug of war between the bulls and the bears.

The index is finding multiple supports near 28,800 mark, while supply pressure remained intact at higher levels. Nifty has to hold above 29,200 to witness a bounce towards 29,700 level, while a hold below the same level may make it drift towards 29,000 and then 28,800 levels.

Nifty futures closed flat at 11,604 level. There was long buildup in Star, Glenmark, UBL, Sun TV and Cipla while shorts were seen in Cummins, Torrent Power, Bharti Infratel, GAIL and Marico.

Titan shares plummetTitan tanked 10 per cent to Rs 1,156 on BSE after the jewellery maker lowered its revenue guidance to 11-13 per cent for the second half of the ongoing financial year from 20 per cent earlier.


Infosys jumps after Nilekani remarkInfosys shares ended 2.37 per cent higher at Rs 712.30 after company Chairman Nandan Nilekani denied any role of the co-founders in the whistleblower complaint.

12,2019-11-06,Cipla,"The momentum is coming because the worst is getting over for many of the companies and especially the good quality companies, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Prices have come back, but the economy is not yet back. Are markets running ahead of themselves?What we are witnessing is the phenomena of what is classically termed as the worst is over as far as the markets are concerned. That means, even if the economy is painting a little bleak picture or even if some of the corporate earnings are missing their estimates (volume numbers of automobiles are still de-growing and cement is still not so good), the markets are saying that a suitable base has been formed in terms of earnings and in terms of profitability. The market starts moving up, saying the worst is over. That is what we are classically witnessing right now. We are reaching back to the all- time highs. In fact, Sensex has already crossed the all-time high of the recent months. We believe that the worst is over for most of the companies. There will be good growth ahead for a lot of them.


Have you had a chance to look at Cipla earnings? The stock has cooled off but it was a decent set of numbers. We have been looking at a whole host of pharma names on the back of earnings today.I would not look at the Cipla numbers but some of the pharma companies have reported strong numbers and this is coming on the back of the fact that we have the corporate rate reduction flowing in at the net profit level, not necessarily the PBT level. But for many of the pharma companies, the domestic environment has been relatively stronger and somewhere the US market is depending on which therapeuticals side you are in. It is a mixed bag. Some are doing well, some are not, but the common theme is that most of the pharma companies have enjoyed the tax benefit in full and that is visible in the way, some of the stocks have moved up.


Eicher is up 30%, Maruti is up 35%, State Bank of India has moved from Rs 255 to Rs 310, ICICI Bank is sitting at an all time high. If a client now asks you whether you should chase the momentum now or wait for a meaningful 10-15% decline, what will you advise?No, I do not think we can look at a meaningful decline of 10-15%. Those days are now gone for the market in the near term. If at all, you have to play the momentum game. You cannot miss out the market by sitting on cash. The momentum is coming because the worst is getting over for many of the companies and especially the good quality companies. If a Maruti for example is showing a 25% volume decline in the first half of the month and is guiding for the year to be at a negative growth rate, it tells you that this year is gone is factored in. But the next year is going to be even better and many of these companies have a built-in hope because from an operational standpoint, they have not missed margins. Their margins are not low. 

In fact, if at all, they are guiding for better margins ahead. Financial services companies are guiding for lower slippages, lower NPAs and so on. The guidance that is coming out from some of the large companies is very strong and one has to reiterate that it is a worst is over kind of a market.


What was your takeaway from the Infy conference call?It was very clear that there is no proof behind the allegations that have come from the whistleblower. That was one event which caused the stock to tank and people had the previous episode in mind when the stock tanked when you had similar allegations coming out at the time of the Panaya buy. 

Then, at least a certain proof was submitted, there was a whole lot of investigation and after the churn that Infosys saw in terms of corporate governance, a lot of senior management was changed. Nandan Nilekani came back again.

The track record of Infosys since those days has been pretty strong, both from its business point of view and even from a corporate governance standpoint I would say because this whistleblower complaint was really speaking of a meaningless kind of complaint backed by no proof. 

The entire loss that Infosys suffered in terms of the stock price fall will be recovered. That recovery has not happened still, even at the current price of Rs 710 or 712. We expect Infosys to recover quite strongly.


What is one of your high-risk-high-return ideas where there could be a 10% downside or maybe a 15% volatility, but your analysis is indicating that 30-40% even 50% gains are coming in the next 12 to 18 months?There is clearly one sector where we see something which you did mention is likely to happen and it is in the auto ancillary space. A lot of auto ancillary names have fallen quite sharply. The distinction we are making is that some of the auto ancillaries are global in nature and some domestic. One should look at only those which are domestic kind of auto ancillary companies that have sharply fallen down. 

With a large volatility and perhaps a small downside, they have the promise of delivering very good returns as we move forward. If we take a one-year or a two- year view. Many of these auto ancillaries are suppliers to the large OEMs including Maruti. You can pick names within that. We already have coverage on a small auto ancillaries like PPAP Industries which can likely do well. So this is one space. 

We have some other stocks where one can potentially get great numbers and this is the housing space. More houses built means more cement, more cement possibly means that you will require more coal. Right now, they are dependent on domestic coal but you will have Coal India upping its production after a phase of de-growth. When coal production goes up, there is the requirement of a certain kind of explosives. We recently met a company called Solar Industries which make explosives used by the mining companies. 

So, these are companies which will have solid volume growth. We are looking at companies which can have solid volume growth delivery in the next one or two years, because of a low base effect. With operating leverage coming in and margins improving, probably these companies can deliver great returns in the years ahead."

In talks with RBI to fix realty issues: FMFM Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government is working with RBI to resolve issues faced by the realty sector. “Government is very keen on working with RBI to see how best we can, where necessary, tweak existing laws to help the people who have been affected in the real estate sector,” said Sitharaman at the NSE’s silver jubilee event in Mumbai.

9 hour working day suggested in draft labour codeThe labour ministry has suggested nine-hour regular working day in its draft wage code as against eight hours now but stayed away from fixing a national minimum wage, which may draw wrath from trade unions. “The number of hours which shall constitute a normal working day… shall be of nine hours,” said the draft rules, floated for public opinion. Like the Labour Code on Wages, the draft rule has left a decision on minimum wage to an expert committee.

13,2019-11-07,Cipla,"Some of the real estate companies would benefit from the government moves, but it is not the time to get carried away and just buy any stock, says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Do you think there is reason to get excited about owning realty stocks on the back of the steps announced by the finance minister last evening?Whatever was done yesterday augurs very well for real estate sector. It is more of a relief package rather than a stimulus. Probably a lot of real estate players and home buyers who were stuck would find relief out of this measure. Would all the realty stocks rally from here on? Yes, but to me, the proxy plays would be more important. 

A lot of banks which were already stuck in a lot of such projects which were 50% complete and were about to be declared as NPA or have been declared as NPA. There would be more beneficiaries — some banks, lots of NBFCs, PSU banks, building materials as a sector — all will benefit more. Some of the real estate companies would benefit but as I said, it is not the time to get carried away and buy any type of stocks. 

Stay in the fundamentally great stocks, companies which were not getting relief out of this, would get a little bit of earnings momentum from here on. It will take its own sweet time, three months, six months down the line. However, the structure is not yet finalised and it is not time to get carried away but to buy only the time tested ones.


Do you think chasing stocks for all those who have missed out, still makes sense?The rally has been too fast and furious for a lot of people to digest this type of earnings or rather market momentum. One gets a ‘left out’ feeling among a lot of participants. It is sort of liquidity driven, as foreign investors have started to invest in the last three-four weeks. The sense here is that the market has actually not been led only by liquidity, but is also the revival of earnings. A lot of people had written off the second quarter earnings expecting a washout, but that has not been the case. There are a lot of green shoots as well.

My sense is that this rally is driven not only by liquidity but also by bit of fundamentals and a glimpse of economic recovery which will take place via monetary and fiscal stimulus where RBI is cutting rates and also government has started taking a lot of steps in the last two-three months. So yes, there is some juice left to the rally. Of course, nobody knows if in the shorter term, there can be 200-300 point rally here on, but the sense is that it is more a buy-on-dips market rather than a sell-on-rise. Every dip has to be accumulated to buy fundamentally good stocks. 


 Is Titan one of those stocks one should buy on every decline or does a 10% decline not make it a value buy yet?There are two answers. If you ask whether it is a value buy, the answer is no, it is not a value buy. Rather, it is a buy or an accumulator because what we have seen that there are a handful of such stocks in India, maybe 15-20 stocks like Nestle or Titan, or even something like Bajaj Finance or Finserv. These are normally very common plays and it is cliché to talk about them. 

In the case of Titan, these were quarterly number and a guidance which people knew about, but the management came out and straight forward talked about cutting the guidance from 20% to around 11%. It does not hamper the prospects of a company which has been at the forefront of all these businesses. So my view is yes, if you get another 5-7% correction, you should start accumulating Titan if you want to construct a portfolio for the next two-three years. 

One quarter can still be a dampener but that can again be used as a trenching out opportunity. We would be buyers in this type of businesses where consumption can remain the centrifugal theme in the market for some time to come.


Today we will have results of Sun Pharma, UPL coming out. What is going to be on your radar? In pharma, we have been big fans of MNC pharma companies with high market shares, the foreign player doing a lot of capex. It can be companies like Abbott Laboratories or Pfizer or Sanofi. All these companies have done fantastically well, particularly Abbott Laboratories which we have been buying since last one, one and a half years. We see no reason why this trend will not continue. 

So, rather than playing the Indian pharma story or the generic story, we have been more active on the MNC pharma side. A sort of recovery was indicated in the numbers of Cipla as well as some other numbers. Probably there is a trend which will bottom out in the generic companies as well. But we are not yet very aggressive buyers over there. 


Would you say the pain is in the price and at 7000 plus levels, would you be a buyer in Maruti?It is a good hold. The price movement in the auto stocks and particularly in Maruti, has been a little far ahead of expectations. The last couple of months have seen a good demand recovery, and not entirely due to the festive season. There were a lot of discounts available before the BS-VI sets in. So, in that sense, the price movement in auto is a little uncomfortable in the shorter term, But then, the correction had been a sort of carnage. It is a good hold at this time. 

Let us monitor the auto sales numbers for November and December, where one needs to realise that the festive season demand will be over, but whether the sustainability of a normal course of sales which Maruti used to do last year is achieved or not, will be a key monitorable and already the management is guiding towards lower growth. The stock would react a little bit on that and for that it could be a good hold and after monitoring for the next couple of months, a conclusive call can be taken on Maruti. 


When it comes to some of the FMCG majors like HUL and Marico, the commentary is not boding well despite whatever we may be seeing on the stock price. What would be your call on some of the FMCG names?The market was factoring in a disastrous set of numbers from a lot of companies not only FMCG; but even in some of the blue-eyed boys like paint stocks, the management commentary is not very optimistic. The numbers also disappointed to the extent that the market was expecting, Dabur talked about headwinds which have emerged from the lack of demand or demand being low but the numbers did not show that type of behaviour if you analyse these numbers. The sense here is that FMCGs could still be bought selectively. 

If the market needs to go above from here, there is a lot of interest in the consumption related stocks, building material stocks and paints stocks. There is a demand for the top 50-70-80 companies in India. I do not see any reason for people to sell this off if other companies start doing well in these 15-20-25 good businesses and this portfolio probably would do very well over the longer term."

NSE Nifty started the week on a negative note and traded with a negative bias in the first half of the session. However, it managed to above hold crucial support of 11,850 and rebounded towards the fag end to close near 11,900. The index consolidated in a narrow range of 75 points and formed a small bodied candle on the daily scale as dips were being bought into while hurdle remains intact at higher levels.

The index has been respecting the 11,850 level from the past eight sessions, and now it needs to continue to hold above the same to witness an upmove towards 12,035 and then 12,103. On the downside, supports are seen at the 11,780-11,750 zone.

On the monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest was at 11,600 followed by 11,500 strike while maximum Call open interest was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 strike. We have seen Marginal Call writing at 12,200 followed by 12,300 strike while Put Unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike. Options data suggests a broader trading range between 11,750 and 12,200 levels.

India VIX moved up by 2.46 per cent to the 16.25 level.

Bank Nifty continued its outperformance against the benchmark indices and extended gains towards 31,200. The index formed a bullish candle on the daily scale with gains of more than 350 points as buying interest was seen for most part of the session. It managed to close above its previous swing high and thus gave a breakout from Horizontal trend line on the daily scale. Supports are gradually shifting higher and now it has to continue to hold above 30,800 to witness an upmove towards 31,500 while on the downside, supports are seen at 30,800 and then 30,600.

Nifty futures closed flattish at 11,946. Builtup of long positions were seen in Amara Raja Batteries, RBL Bank, Ashok Leyland, Jindal Steel and IGL, while shorts were seen in Equitas, Indigo, Balkrishna Industries, Cipla and Pidilite.

23,2019-11-14,Cipla,"While the meltdown in the globe was led by auto, the recovery will also be led by auto, says Gautam Shroff, Co-Head, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


VST Industries is going to be in focus when you have a marquee name like Radhakishan Damani picking up stake. If one compares how some of these tobacco stocks have done and how they are quoting in terms of valuation as opposed to their global peers like a Philip Morris etc, do you find value in the space as limited as it maybe?Absolutely. Undoubtedly there is a lot of value in ITC and VST Industries. But the stocks have gone nowhere and on a longer term basis, we are positive, we like the name. There’s only one caveat in the short term. A small study of ours says that between November and February, in the runup to the Budget, ITC has always been a laggard because of the probability of sin tax being imposed. For the next three months, ITC might not go anywhere but on a three-year, five-year call, we are very positive. 

Despite ITC diversifying so much, I still want to believe 90% of the revenue still comes from tobacco. With electronic cigarette ban coming in place, it augurs well for ITC. 


Give me a stock idea or a business where you think right now there is gloom and doom but six months to a year from now, things will settle down. Markets currently are ignoring the intrinsic value of that business because of noise, sentiment and momentum?With Fed easing a double expansion of balance sheet and rate cuts, global is giving me a lot of comfort. Domestically, the economy is yet to recover but the good news is that globally things are looking fine. What we would want to play from here on is export- oriented stories. In the metal space, it is basically the lesson we have learnt from the 2016 cycle, that all the globally linked and the export-oriented stocks will recover first. 

In metals, we would want to play a Jindal Steel followed by Hindalco, followed by Tata Steel. We would want to play export auto, Tata Motors being my top pick over there. 

The one story that will do well from here on which is not doing very well in the auto space, I think is Tata Motors. It can do very well from here on. Given that the parent has injected money, there is an oversight and there is some serious commitment with things turning around. They are also looking to monetise the JLR as an asset which is very marquee and a price asset in their portfolio. Among largecaps, Tata Motors can more than double over a period of time. It is followed by Motherson Sumi, again an export-oriented story. All the capex is behind us. While the meltdown in the globe was led by auto, the recovery will also be led by auto. Motherson Sumi has set up plants across the world which caters to practically 60% of the globe and we want to believe that is one stock which can do very well from here on.


What has gone wrong with Aurobindo Pharma?I have not actually looked at that specific name per se but our top picks in the pharma space have been Cipla, Dr Reddy’s followed by Sun Pharma. We have started liking Cipla of late and we have increased our weight on it followed by Dr Reddy’s.


Today everyone is sympathising that after AGR dues, Vodafone Idea, Bharti’s balance sheets will have a problem. But what about banks?This is a slightly tricky call. We have to wait and watch what actually happens. If some kind of a moratorium or a bailout package comes through, then banks are pretty safe but if that does not happen, then we are staring at large numbers that have been advanced to these telecom companies. 

I am pretty sure that government intervention will be required and some kind of assistance is required to avoid that kind of a disaster. But we have to see how things play out from here. It is difficult to predict.


Our top picks in the pharma space have been Cipla, Dr Reddy’s followed by Sun Pharma. We have started liking Cipla of late and we have increased our weight on it followed by Dr Reddy’s.-Gautam Shroff

Other than Bajaj Finance, AU Financials and Chola are the two NBFCs that have done well. Do you track any of them?AU Bank has been our pick. We initiated our coverage on 10th or 12th of June. We came out with the price target of Rs 880 on the first quarter earnings. We revised our price target to Rs 1,000. With yesterday’s up move in AU Bank, the price to book is looking slightly expensive. It has become five times price to book but given that it is an asset-led story, it can keep compounding without much quality issues and this can go on for about a decade. 

We are very comfortable that the company will raise funds, will dilute and the growth will continue. It is a very illiquid stock and that is why one day of somebody’s interest has given it a 10% bump up. But we are comfortable buying AU Bank even now. There is a lot more steam left in AU Bank.


Just on the back of earnings some stocks that have stood out from a Muthoot to a Britannia, pick up any one where you have looked at the numbers closely. What you would be thinking now going ahead?We are very comfortable even at current prices given that government spending is coming back in rural India. For almost eight, nine months, there was no expenditure there. Money flow has started in the system and despite trading at very rich multiples, there is a lot of comfort in these consumer names. I would still take some money off the table or not choose a consumer company over a consumer durable company and that is where there is comfort in Britannia being a market leader in biscuits. 

Plus, over the years, we have seen that they have gained 900 bps market share from Parle. They have got their act together. We are very comfortable even buying Britannia at these prices."

34,2019-11-19,Cipla,"We have revised our price target for Bharti Airtel upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The telecom sector is in trouble but the Bharti stock is up 52% in the last one year. What is your view?Telecom stocks particularly Bharti has really shot up. There are two or three factors behind this entire rerating and up move. One is that definitely there is a possibility of the government giving some kind of a moratorium to the telecom companies on the payment of the Rs 28,000 odd crore AGR dues that they have to pay to DoT. 

Secondly, sanity returns as we are hearing the news that both Vodafone and Bharti would consider a price hike. We do not yet know the quantum but when you see a price hike after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it. 

Most importantly, for a company like Bharti, there is an under-ownership both at the retail and institutional level because of the issues that they were grappling with. There could be a sense of urgency as far as some of the institutional investors are concerned to own stocks like Bharti. 

So, a combination of these factors are playing out. We too have revised our price target upwards to about Rs 440 and we think that the next couple of years are going to be extremely positive for Bharti.


What is happening in Glenmark?We have seen that people have turned positive selectively in the pharma stocks, either because of some revival in the US business or the fact that even the domestic market for some of these companies is huge and after the price controls, we have seen some kind of a stabilisation. We have seen some pharma companies including Sun Pharma, Divi’s Lab and Aurobindo Pharma all going up. 


When you see a price hike in telecom sector after a gap of so many years, there is going to be definitely a positive sentiment around it.-Hemang Jani
As far as Glenmark Pharma is concerned, the stock has gone up in the last couple of days but our view has been that because of the kind of debt that they are sitting on and the fact that whatever guidance the company had earlier given in terms of growth, the actual performances have been far lower. Recently we have booked out of Glenmark Pharma so we would be more comfortable buying into a Divi’s Lab or a Cipla or a Biocon.


What are you reading into the aviation data? Finally, a positive tick has come in for October as domestic passenger traffic has grown by roughly about 4%. Would you still avoid aviation or could one buy into these stocks?When we look at the aviation sector what has really surprised me is that despite the fact that there are only two or three meaningful players, the growth has come off. Overall, because of Jet moving out of the system and the fact that the market share has gone to Indigo and maybe SpiceJet and Go. We are not able to see any meaningful performances either from Indigo or SpiceJet, even when crude prices are at a more reasonable level. 

Also, post Jet, the prices had really shot up. Insane pricing was prevailing both for the domestic as well as international market. Even when the best of the situation is there in the pricing and crude oil prices, if these companies are not able to report any worthwhile performances, then you know what is the point of trying to give them any sort of a valuation or why would one really want to go for those companies? My sense is because of certain season coming in, you might see good data points etc. but operationally none of these companies have been able to demonstrate the ability to grow EBITDA on a sustainable basis. That keeps us away from the airline space for a while.


All insurance stocks are going higher but nobody is able to tell me why at a time when the private insurance or growth numbers have declined from 20 % to 7-8%, these stocks are rising and how! SBI Life is 76% higher in last one year, ICICI Lombard 50% higher in last one year and ICICI Life , 40% higher in the last eight months?There is a preference for the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) where one can really look at a structural growth story. In terms of the growth rates having come down, I agree with you but given the fact that we have gone through so much of pain for some of the banks and particularly PSU banks and NBFCs, the investors have preferred companies where there is a non-funding exposure. 

Of course, when you look at the insurance sector per se -- be it life or general insurance space -- there is definitely a case for a significant growth from here on and typically the business model of insurance is such that initially for about five years, companies do not make profit, but after that, there is a significant ROE that one can really expect. 

Most of the companies have gone through that curve plus a lot of M&A 2 has happened. This sector overall looks quite promising. We as a house have a preference for an HDFC Life and Bajaj Finserv, because these are the two companies where we are seeing much higher visibility and much better pedigree of promoters etc. We would continue to be positive on those names."

40,2019-11-20,Cipla,"SBI, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give at least a 30% upside from present prices, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive V-P, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

On Aviation StocksThere has been a relative slowdown of the economy but a lot of it is getting addressed. The cost of money is definitely headed lower which means ease in travel and very lucrative rates maybe a thing of the past. Rates may start to head up. We have a buy on both the stocks on declines. There is regular bouts of profit booking which comes when IndiGo was Rs 1m750 and SpiceJet was Rs 145 . But again, these are the two listed companies. Personally, I prefer to travel by Vistara.

But on declines, this is a very consumer centric industry where 2020 should bode extremely well, given that we are very optimistic on the return of the consumer, the economy doing well and aviation as a conduit for that. 


On Telecom
Our clients have been laughing their way to the bank. We have been long on Bharti and Reliance as a disclosure and we are riding it. We think there is going to be a short term bout of profit booking which may last for two-three days but this is one sector which is going to bely most expectations. Most of the underpinnings are over. ARPUs are going to rise and we think there could be a fair package for both Vodafone and Bharti from the government.

We will work on that but we definitely think the government is going to give some relief. On the consumption side, you can see that we have been saying that ARPUs may have bottomed out and we thought that data is definitely going to get more expensive. A disclosure, Bharti, Reliance are two of our top picks. They continue to be in our portfolio and this week has been exceptionally strong for all investors who have held those shares on our account.

We are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months.-Sanjiv Bhasin


On PSU Banks
The weaker or the most hated sectors -- telecom and PSU banks are bouncing back. The Supreme Court judgement on Essar Steel is a path breaking decision and the SBI chairman, smaller banks have said that write backs will be a part of the course as most of the provisioning is done. So, I am extremely positive on PSU banks. There is a Rs 70,000 crore of recapitalisation, which means almost 5.5 lakh crore of book will grow in the next three years.

We think you cannot go wrong given that yields are softening. They are awash with cash and they are going to definitely start the lending cycle on the retail side. So SBI continues to be our top pick. Along with that, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB can give you at least a 30% upside from present prices. 2020 may actually see PSU banks lead from the front


On Divestment 
The divestment candidates like Concor, BPCL & SCI have moved up very smartly.We think this is going to be a path breaking reform by the government. Strategic selloff last happened in 1999 and after that there has been a total hiatus. The government has decided that they have no business to be in business and that is a very positive move.

BPCL, Concor and SCI should set the cat amongst the pigeons. We are extremely positive. I think the valuations they will get will also be fairly impressive, given that all three businesses are monopolies. We have to see in the next three months, how fast the divestment takes place. The finance minister has already indicated that they should be done with it before March and it should see re-rating of the entire PSU basket. 

The government has the intension to bring down their holding to 26% in a lot of other companies like IOC and BHEL. These are all very good entry points because the unlocking of value will be huge as and when it takes place.


On Pharma Stocks
Pharma has been a very big underperformer. This is just about time where smart money is seeing rotation. By the way, pharma numbers, particularly the likes of Glenmark were very smart looking and now people have realised that pharma has consolidated enough and the worries of the FDA issues are now going to be on the backburner. Plus, generic pricing in the US may be back and they are spreading in geographies across the world. The local businesses for all of them have looked up so we are very positive on Sun, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla and Glenmark. You can add a Divy’s there, but if you are a strategic investor, then SBI Pharma Fund and the Nippon Pharma Fund should be very, very good funds to do a SIP at least for the next six months. 2020 could see pharma hugely outperform as a sector.


On Trends in Consumption SpaceThere are three parts. Firstly, these stocks have been the prime of most of the mutual fund portfolios. Nestle, Lever, Colgate and Asian Paints have taken the cake, even though numbers were not that sparkling. But they have been very expensive stocks and have been getting more expensive. For us, the game changer is these two three events which the government has done -- corporate tax cut, strategic disinvestment. The pass through effect of money where the mistrust is now getting allayed and you should see much easier pass through of money from banks as PSU banks start to lend very actively on all three -- discretionary, staples and durables. 

The broader basket will definitely outperform. We are not making a case for Nestle or Lever at these prices. We think in fact if the Nifty sustains over 12,000 and if we hit new highs which is just round the corner, then the broader market consumption should do extremely well. That means discretionaries like auto and select other FMCG stocks could be outperformers in 2020."

However, if index breaks below 11,980 levels it would witness selling which would take the index towards 11,950-11,930.” 

Crude oil prices surged more than 2 per cent on Wednesday after a better-than-expected US crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with OPEC to keep the global oil market balanced.

The US markets ended lower on Wednesday amid reports that so-called phase one trade deal between China and the US may not be completed by the end of 2019. Other Asian peers were also trading in the red as a fresh row between Washington and Beijing over US bills on Hong Kong could complicate their trade negotiation and delay phase one deal that investors had initially hoped to be inked by now.

The Dow Jones index declined 112.93 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 27,821.09. The S&P500 index inched lower by 11.72 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 3108.46. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 43.93 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 8,526."

47,2019-11-27,Cipla,"NEW DELHI: The domestic drug industry and trade have agreed to the government’s proposal to cap trade margins for all medicines outside price control at 30%, a move that will reduce the prices of nearly 80% of formulations.

A consensus to this effect was reached at a meeting held on Friday between the drug pricing regulator, pharma lobby groups and industry associations, said people present at the meeting. The 30% cap on trade margins was preferred over other proposals such as imposing a flat 100% trade margin on all medicines, including those within price control.

“We are Ok with the rationalisation of trade margins. Whatever has been tried out with cancer drugs — fixing trade margins at 30% — we are fine with it. If it has to be extended to other products, it should be done in a phased manner,” said Deepnath Roy Chowdhury, president, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA).

Two people aware of the matter said all Indian and multinational pharma lobby groups had agreed to the 30% cap. “The margin is equivalent to 43% mark-up for the price to stockists,” said one of them.
The move is likely to hit big pharma companies with generic divisions, such as Sun Pharma, Cipla and Lupin, as they will have to reduce the maximum retail price (MRP).

Since the margins of stockists and retailers will be significantly squeezed, the lobby groups for these segments may ask manufacturers to compensate them for the loss. In 2013, when many non-scheduled drugs were brought under price control, stockists and retailers had forced manufacturers to continue to pay them a minimum 30% margin against the stipulated 24% for price-controlled drugs.


10.6k Non-Scheduled Drugs
The proposed margin cap will have an impact on a wide range of pharmaceuticals, ranging from vitamin D supplements to antibiotics. Non-scheduled drugs, or formulations outside price control, account for Rs 10,000 crore of sales in the Rs 1-lakh-crore Indian drug market.

Mankind Pharma chairman RC Juneja described the proposal to restrict trade margins at 30% as “pro-consumer”, and said the move had the backing of the industry.

“The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, IDMA and the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India were supportive and willing to follow the cancer drugs model. There were a couple of reservations. The All India Chemists and Druggists Association sought higher margins of 12.5% (for stockists) and 25% (for retailers),” said another person present at the meeting on Friday.

Some analysts are, however, not impressed. Phillip Capital analyst Surya Patra said medicines not under price control already have a 30% cap on trade margin (20% for retailers and 10% for wholesalers), and therefore there will not be any significant reduction in prices.

Trade margin is the difference between the price at which manufacturers/importers sell to stockists and the price charged to consumers. Currently, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes prices of scheduled drugs (medicines under price control). The prices of non-scheduled drugs can be raised by up to 10% a year. For nonscheduled drugs, the industry norm has been to give 10% margin to stockists and 20% to retailers. However, there have been allegations that actual margins are far higher.

By making trade margins explicit, there will be less scope for exploitation by large institutions, said one of the persons cited above. “Margins will go down for trade, making drugs cheaper,” he said.

According to data available with the health ministry, 70% of India’s total healthcare spending goes towards medicines. Data available with the department of pharmaceuticals shows that there are 10,600 non-scheduled drugs. Some industry experts present at the Friday meeting also expressed concern over distribution and availability of generic-generic drugs and traded business (commodity business model). They said these drugs — supplied to villages and small towns — have a ‘no-return policy’, where traders cannot return expired or damaged products to stockists or manufacturers.


‘NO EXCLUSIONS’
A proposal to exempt lower-priced medicines — that cost Rs 2-5 per unit — from the margin cap was also discussed. But this was opposed by consumer activists.

“We support the capping of trade margins across all non-scheduled medicines. Drugs priced less than Rs 5 per unit should not be excluded from this cap. A large population suffers from chronic diseases. Many of the medicines for managing these conditions could fall in this category. Ensuring affordable access is crucial where patients need medicines continuously,” said Malini Aisola, co-convenor of All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a grouping of several non-governmental organisations."

57,2019-11-28,Cipla,"We are allocating 30-40% in trend/momentum/higher valuation stocks; 20-25% odd on contra bets and about 25-30% in historically good performing stocks facing growth pressures, says Kunj Bansal, Partner, MD & CIO, Sarthi Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The massive move in ICICI Bank following the increase in MSCI weightage is now finally over, but the stock is up 40% this year. How much further can it go up in the near term?One way is to look at some other stocks from some other sectors. FMCG is the top of the mind. If we look at the performance of the stocks from those sectors, beginning 2019, there were lots of discussion on how the FMCG sector has had 3-4 years of outperformance and that 2019 will probably not be the year for FMCG. But today, at the end of the year, we see 2019 again was the year of FMCGs along with some others. 

About 12-14 months ago, ICICI Bank was at a stage wherein all the negative news had been built into its price and valuations, its financial performance. The stock price by then underperformed for almost two and a half years, based on various developments. It has come out from there, so that is one part. 

The other part is, today we are in a market where over the last one-and-a-half-year, corporate governance issues have been coming more and more in focus. As a result, for any investor -- be it global or domestic -- who is cautious about these issues, the investible universe is continuing to shrink.


Your life should be easy if the universe of investing is reducing! All you need to do is bother about 15 stocks. It has never been great for fund managers this year. Where would you go if you want to get out of those 15 stocks?Let me also now throw in my spanner. Over the last two months, Nifty rose 10% but none of the traditionally performing stocks have contributed to business.


Reliance has added.Reliance is an exception.


HDFC Bank has added. ICICI Bank has added.Let me give you some numbers.Some of the stock names that I am taking are with the disclosure and are not investment recommendations. Sun Pharma and Cipla have roughly moved 20% in the last two months. Reliance has been one outperformer. Auto stocks rose 30%. Tata Motors is one of the underdogs. Within banking, we have completely different set of stocks. YES Bank, ICICI and SBI are historical laggards. So, life is not that easy. Last two months have been difficult but over the medium term, it could probably come back to being easy.


What do you do at Rs 500 plus levels on ICICI Bank?I am still positive. We have not bought recently but we have been holding it in some of our clients portfolios.


You are not taking profits anywhere?Not right now.


It does not matter whether it is momentum or liquidity, if prices are going higher, NAVs will go higher. How do you invest in this market when growth is bad and the economy is not recovering, flows are strong and markets are at an all-time high? If you take a view on the economy, you cannot be bullish but if you take a view on the flows, you cannot be bearish!That is a very big dilemma that we face as money managers. I am sure everybody else faces it including retail investors. Sometimes you have to take the trend as an indicator. The market is telling that at the end of the day, there is one way of looking at the market and that price is God. If you take that as a hypothesis and try to analyse the July, August, September data (I have not got October data), the government expenditure has gone up. July was roughly 25% up over last year July; August was 30% up and September 35% -- both capex and opex. That probably is indicating something. 


On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence. It is difficult to justify. That makes it difficult to make money in the market.-Kunj Bansal
If the government has continued a similar expenditure in October and November, it is a matter of time that the secondary effect -- the cyclical effect of that money flow will come into the economy and things will start easing out. So that is one way to look at it. 

The second way is smart money is always ahead. The market moves at least six months ahead of what developments we are able to see as analysts or fund managers or when actual numbers come. As an investment strategy, what I am doing or what we are doing is nothing particular; but very broadly speaking, 30-40% are plays in trend/momentum/higher valuations; 20-25% odd are contra bets, say into auto and auto ancillaries. About 25-30% we are trying to play in historically good performing stocks which have faced growth pressures in the last five-six quarters because of the environment but as a result valuations are relatively cheaper. On an absolute basis you have to take a medium to long-term call.


TVS and Hero MotoCorp and Eicher in last two years would have given terrible returns. It is 36% lower for TVS Motor and 24% lower for Eicher.Let me throw in some additional numbers. Coincidentally, it was not in auto but related to it -- auto ancillaries, more specifically tyres. A similar divergence has been there if we look at five-year numbers. On a five-year basis, MRF and Goodyear have given reasonably positive returns, about 30-40% return. Apollo has given negative returns, as has JK Tyre. Ceat is flat. So that is again a divergence to add to your OEM manufacturers numbers. It is difficult to justify. That makes investing very difficult and makes it difficult to make money in the market. 

Having said that, obviously some of the factors which have worked and what works for Bajaj Auto is export. Also the fact that management was very clear that at the expense of margin, at the expense of doing some discounting sales, they would focus on top line, on volumes. I do not know about the exact market share they have gained but very clearly, it worked in their favour.


Should one subscribe to the SBI Card IPO?I have not looked at the numbers in detail. Let us look at the two other IPOs. CSB Bank IPO closed recently and it was 87 times subscribed.


For a Rs 400-crore, they got Rs 4,000 crore.Where is the risk averse mindset and where is the lack of liquidity? We are going to have the Ujjivan Small Finance IPO. I am not sure if that will attract a similar kind of subscription, interest or over subscription. The reason being that today anybody -- whether a consumer who is buying goods or services in the market or an investor -- is telling me give me a good deal and my money is here. Quality should be there and value should be there. Price offering, valuations should be there. Now, that was not exactly the case with CSB Bank whose financials are not as great, but the brand name of the promoters, partly the valuation got it that kind of subscription. 

Coming to the SBI Card IPO, I still have to look at the numbers in detail but if the financial numbers are reasonably good and valuation offered is cheaper, the market is desperate for opportunities to invest. So, we should see that kind of investment.


What do you do with YES Bank? They are all set for a mega fund raising of about $1.2 billion.Something should come out now. It is high time. Because we have had the names of the sundry Tom, Dick and Harry but nothing has come till now, which is unfortunate. It should not become a story of crying wolf too many times because then the market will really be disappointed. Market has given YES Bank a benefit of doubt and has brought the share up from Rs 25-30 to almost Rs 70 today. Without any concrete development, the stock will be brought down equally fast. So let us see. 

But if we have some concrete names, some actual action on money coming in, around the current levels, YES Bank will have its floor price. From here to go up, we will continue to need developments and announcements in terms of the next one, two, three, four quarters’ financial numbers, some improvement in business, some reduction in divergence with RBI’s audit, NPA control and all those things. But the basic requirement is that capital should come in."

5,2019-12-09,Cipla,"The economic slowdown in India became worse in the second quarter of 2019 and the GDP growth rate fell to 4.5%—the lowest in the last 26 quarters 
(see chart). More bad news followed: the expected economic recovery was not going to happen anytime soon. Most economic indicators like industrial production, merchandise exports, bank credit, freight movement, electricity production, among others, are pointing to weak growth in the first months of the third quarter. 

Since this could mean lower growth rate in the third quarter, economists are busy cutting their growth projection for 2019-20. “Growth could weaken further to around 4% in the third quarter of 2019-20, which will mark a trough. For 2019-20, we are cutting our growth forecast from 5.7% to around 4.5%,” says Nikhil Gupta, Lead Economist, Motilal Oswal Securities.


GDP growth rate has been plummeting

Medium term slowdown
The government and RBI are taking several steps to fight the slowdown. However, despite the efforts, the slowdown is likely to extend to the medium term. “Due to several structural issues faced by the Indian economy, growth rate is expected remain moderate—around 4-5%—in the short to medium term”, says Santosh Kamath, MD & CIO – India Fixed Income, Franklin Templeton. ‘Debt aversion’ among businesses is one of the main reasons for this. Most businessmen are leaning towards avoiding debt altogether. Even Mukesh Ambani wants to make Reliance Industries debt free in 18 months. 

Though good for the long term health of the economy, the ongoing clean-up of the financial sector and massive deleveraging drive by companies will continue to put pressure on medium term growth rates. Fall in nominal GDP growth rate is another worry. Nominal GDP growth rate is real GDP plus inflation and this matrix is very important for stock market investors because the aggregate corporate growth usually mirrors nominal GDP growth rates.


Valuation another concern
While the broader market has reacted to growth concerns, benchmark indices like the Sensex and Nifty are still quoting close to all-time highs, pushed up by a few stocks. Valuation parameters of these indices are also at high levels now. “Though not in the overvaluation zone, their valuation now is above average. In other words, the current market valuation is not supported by the current economic fundamentals,” says Kaushlendra Sengar, Founder and CEO, Advisorymandi.com.


Don’t avoid mid & small capsThough mid and small caps usually underperform during slow growth periods because industry leaders get stronger during such periods, there is no need to avoid these segments altogether this time. This is because some of the mid-cap stocks are sector leaders (they are midcaps because these sectors are small) and therefore, they should be able to do well even during bad times. Reasonable valuation is another reason to look at these segments now.


Mid-cap stocks that are sector leaders are worth considering
Reasonable valuation is a reason to look at mid-cap stocks right now. Small-caps also offer good opportunities.

This is why most stocks selected by us— except Infosys—are from mid-cap space. The small-cap space also offers good opportunities. However, direct equity investing is riskier there and it is better that investors use the mutual funds route to invest in the small-cap segment.

Export sectors
The best way to beat the domestic slowdown is to bet on export-oriented sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, etc. “These low beta stocks are the best bet now. In addition to a stable US economy (their main market), companies from the IT and pharma segments will also benefit from the rupee depreciation triggered by domestic slowdown,” says Sengar. Even among good sectors, investors need to be selective. They should avoid highly valued stocks because the market is now chasing growth at any cost.

The entire pharma industry can be treated as a defensive bet now because their valuation has been down for the last 4-5 years due to their US FDA related woes. However, Cipla continues do well in the US market and its US revenues grew by 26% y-o-y during the second quarter. Another advantage of Cipla is its strong domestic base. Around 40% of its revenues come from India and since people are not going to stop taking medicines during economic slowdown, domestic pharma players are also treated as a good defensive bet. After a dip in the first quarter, domestic sales picked up in the second quarter and the same grew by 29% q-o-q and 6% y-o-y. In addition to the 22% exposure to the North American market, Cipla’s export pie is also diversified to Europe, South Africa, Sub Saharan region, emerging markets from other regions, etc.


Pharma industry can be a defensive bet

Domestic woes will not affect pharmaceutical companies like Cipla.
 
Unlike pharma, IT is mostly a global play. We decided to pick Infosys because the same is still quoting at a discount to the sector market leader TCS. However, its valuation is expected to improve because several research houses have started upgrading the stock. “We upgrade Infosys to ‘buy’ based on better visibility on growth, stable margin trajectory and the recent stock underperformance,” says a recent HDFC Sec report. Infosys is now focusing more on large deals and the same is yielding results—large deals grew by 77% in the first half of 2019-20. Since Infosys is now growing faster than the sector average, its valuation gap with TCS should come down further.

Organised retailers
While normal retailers and small traders are suffering from the slowdown, triggered mostly by the NBFC-driven liquidity crisis, organised retailers are reporting good revenue growth. The economy-wide shift from unorganised to organised due to the implementation of GST is helping them. More importantly, most of the listed players have come of age now. “The systems and processes of organised retail players are established now, helping them to report faster growth and they did the same in the second quarter,” says Kumar.

Though growth is not an issue, exorbitant valuation is the biggest problem with listed retail chains and many are quoting at PEs well above 100. However, Future Retail is still quoting at a PE of 23.22 against the industry average PE of 98.33. Future Retail always used to quote at low valuations because it is not one of the fancied retail players like D-Mart or Trent. However, things are expected to improve at Future Retail due to the strategic tie-up with and a small stake purchase by Amazon. Future Retail’s new strategy of growth with profitability and deleveraging of balance sheet should also result in better valuation ratios. In addition to the cost savings initiatives, Future Retail also plans to shut down unprofitable small stores.


Real estate players
Though the real estate sector is still facing problems and waiting for the implementation of the government’s bailout package, listed players continue to do well. In other words, the strength of strong and organised players are getting amplified by the ongoing turmoil in the real estate market. For example, aggregate housing sales value and absorption of listed players have moved up by 5% and 9% respectively q-o-q. Small time builders winding operations or selling out to bigger players is the main reason for this. “Even the most conservative industry estimates indicate a staggering number of developers in top cities who have been either been wiped off the map or have merged with organised developers,” says Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants.


Organised real estate players will fare well

Phoenix is expected to report better growth in coming years.
 
As organised retailers are expected to do well in coming years, the best real estate player to bet on now is Phoenix Mills, one of India’s largest mall owners and operators. Phoenix is expected to report better growth in coming years because some of its mall projects are expected to get completed in the next 2-3 years. While its Lucknow mall is expected to be operational in 2019-20, the remaining four are expected to be fully operational between 2020-21 and 2022-23.


Corporate facing banks
Retail-facing banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, etc. will continue to do well even during periods of turmoil. However, analysts are more bullish on corporate facing banks now for three reasons. First, the valuations of corporate facing banks are much lower. Second, they are mostly out of the NPA related problem, which was plaguing them for the last 3-4 years. Third, the business opportunity is also increasing for them. “Through aggressive lending, NBFCs weaned away the SME segments from corporate banks in the past and these banks are now regaining market share due to the pains of NBFCs,” says Kumar.

Federal Bank is a good example of a mid-cap bank with improving fundamentals and reasonable valuations. First, its shift to retail book is playing out well and its retail loan growth was placed at 25% in the second quarter of 2019-20, mostly because of increased contribution from low risk housing and gold loans. Asset quality improvement is also visible and its 30% y-o-y increase in other income during the second quarter was because of recovery from written off accounts. “Given Federal Bank’s largely steady watch-list and healthy capital adequacy ratio coupled with low valuations, we are positive on the stock,” says a recent Axis Securities report. Federal Bank’s price to book ratio is placed at 1.22 times, compared to the industry average of 1.60 times now."

6,2019-12-10,Cipla,"ET Intelligence Group: The median number of women on Indian boards doubled in the past five years, but they still form a small proportion of the total board members. A study of the Bloomberg data on gender composition of boards of 91 companies of the BSE-100 index reveals the median number of women on an Indian board was two in 2018-19, up from one five years ago. However, women constituted only 14 per cent of the board, albeit higher than the median 10 per cent half a decade ago.

India Inc has lagged behind the US trend on gender diversity on boards. The 2018 US Spencer Stuart Board Index shows that nearly onefourth of the directors of S&P 500 companies are women, with boards having 2.6 female directors on average. While 87 per cent of S&P 500 companies have two or more women directors, the corresponding number for Indian boards stands at 54 per cent.

The most gender-diversified board (of Apollo Hospitals) among the BSE-100 index has 42 per cent women on it, while the least diversified board (of ONGC) has 6 per cent representation of women. Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have been the traditional laggards in improving the diversity quotient of their boards. They comprised four of the top ten BSE-100 companies with the worst diversity ratios at the board level in FY19. Bajaj group companies — Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finance — also figure in this list.



Contrary to the general trend of increase in board diversity, there are a handful of companies — Tata Global Beverages, Titan, Axis Bank, LIC Housing Finance and HDFC Bank — that have seen reduction in diversity on their boards over the past five financial years.

Having a woman director on the board seems to be for the minimum compliance of the Companies Act, 2013 for one-fourth of the BSE-100 companies. Of the 91 companies, 24 have been consistent in having only a single woman director through each of the past five years.

To be sure, the companies with the highest gender diversity ratio are market leaders or among the leading players in their industries in India. Apollo Hospitals is the country’s largest private sector hospital chain. Godrej Consumer Products is a market leader in household insecticides and is the second largest marketer of soaps in the country. UltraTech Cement is India’s largest cement producer, while Cipla and Infosys are leaders in their respective industries."

16,2019-12-16,Cipla,"Largecap stocks will continue to outperform, the smallcap stocks will sparkle for a while and die out eventually, say Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are we headed for a better 2020 with the fundamentals catching up or are we still in a grey area?I would be very sceptical about the economy getting much better. It might get much worse in the first two quarters before it gets better. Generally speaking, it is also off-season. You cannot expect the economy do very well. But if you are expecting a better 2020 for the stock market, overseas developments are going to be the most important factor. They are looking wonderfully well positioned with the China deal and enough liquidity. More importantly, the same theme continues and that is the disturbing part. The largecaps continue to outperform, the smallcaps sparkle for a while and then they die out eventually. So, nothing new is going to happen. 

Unfortunately 2020 is going to be the same old drudge. For the economy and fundamental to catch up, it depends on which company you are talking about. During the RBI credit policy, all the big influences from Mumbai were saying what about vegetables? Who cares? I heard the argument last night saying milk price hike? Who drinks milk in any case nowadays! We are all vegans in any case. So I think this dichotomy of haves and have not will continue to plague this economy and till the policy changes dramatically differently, you will see the same stock market results as you have seen in 2019, no different.


We have got the budget coming up. Any expectations that that could provide some answers or is it really beyond any announcements for now? Actually before the budget, the GST Council meeting is very important for two reasons. One, of course, is the more popular one that what happens with the states’ money; but more important is the move to raise the GST rate. That is going to be the biggest trigger for a selloff at least in the small and the midcaps. If that increase takes place, it is going to hurt the small and midcaps much more. 

I just told the investors what a lovely way to spend 2020! Do not exercise your brains, index is your best friend, largecaps is your friend. In fact, I am telling investors there would be lesser worry in 2020. 


Even within the largecaps, where do you see maximum potential for further returns? Do you feel things will remain steady because even within that pocket, some are starting to see a clear revival of interest? Let us talk about a deep cyclical. Even SBI is starting to see more of potential investment today as opposed to say a couple of quarters ago.Are you serious about the potential of PSU bank? This is an arbitrary stock, a gambling stock. They are nothing to do with fundamentals. Do you have an account with SBI? I do not. I do not know anybody with an account with SBI. Today is a day of great news for all nationalised banks. They are recovering a lot of money from ArcelorMittal. But, they will find enough reason to have another write off. They already have the Mudra loans coming in. They have the discom power loans coming through. 

If the numbers are correct, the finance minister said Rs 4- 5 lakh crore has been disbursed in the last two or three months to a small sector. It is not going to come back if it has been disbursed. I am not even sure if it has. Do not worry about it. Nationalised banks will sparkle. They will have a good day and then they will come back and give you enough reasons why they will have a write off. 

I am not sure there is a story there. I am sure there is enough space for day traders, weekly traders, monthly traders to go in and out of these stocks. They give you very good returns and they lose big money for you. But is there any investment case? You got to be serious. Nobody opens an account with a PSU bank anymore.


When we talk about private banks, what do you think is the scope of opportunity? Where do you see the valuations versus what are they trading at now?It does not matter because you are looking at a monopoly situation. Tell me how many countries are there where three or four banks and one or two NBFCs control 70% of the portfolio and the trade in the market. As the fear starts, you saw literally the doggedness of the Yes Bank financing situation. IDFC Bank has made losses all its life, maybe one quarter profit here or there. You saw RBL raising funds to cover up the losses, where IndusInd bank is.

So imagine a situation of a country the size of India, where you have a HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, now maybe ICICI Bank and Axis Bank -- four largest banks controlling most of the new initiatives in the market and maybe a Bajaj Finance or HDFC. Seven companies are controlling the NBFC space. The valuations will catch up. Do not worry about it. But, you are talking of a monopoly financial institution situation which is unprecedented in the world.

Tell me how many countries are there where three or four banks and one or two NBFCs control 70% of the portfolio and the trade in the market.-Ajay Srivastava

When it happens, as equity investors, you have to be smart to take benefit of it. I do not see any reason why you need to worry because in 2020, who is the competitor against these four or five banks? They have behaved very responsibly on pricing. They have been good boys in the market. Who is the competition you see for any of these banks? None exist. There is a clear path that investment should continue, additions should be made and there would be corrections there. You will never find a monopoly like this ever in the world.


What do you make of PFCs like Bajaj Finance, which says that the market share will only go up?Bajaj Finance is a little tricky because the valuation is really stratospheric. Over 10 time book values for an NBFC is difficult to fathom and if HDFC Bank’s finance companies start to come into place and if Kotak starts to come into play, this will get crowded. Plus, if all the issues of commercial vehicle financing and personal loan issues start to come into play, the stock will underperform the regular banks. I personally think that is too expensive, the market variables are not in the best frame of mind at this point of time. I would rather be on the side of the bank than be on the side of NBFCs at these valuations.

It has surprised everybody always. Every year, we say it is too expensive. I would hold myself to say yes it surprises everybody but for the time being, it is going to be tepid rather than rocketing share price.


We have for the first time started to see some positive commentary coming in some of those metal names or commodities. Would you keep those stocks on your radar to see if there is any potential for some of the names to turn around?I have a big holding in metals for some time now. I was not expecting a China deal but simply the dividends are phenomenal. There are only few four or five companies in metal that you can invest in. I am of the non-ferrous side. On the ferrous side, I have one or two investments. 

You cannot go wrong in that, given that the valuations below book value one really make money. Most are debt free with very good dividend track record. Some of them are PSUs which give some benefits and one of them is the largest private sector metal company which of course as a promoter needs the money at the end of the day. So, he gives large dividends as well. 

It is not only a capital play, it is also a dividend play. That is why I said buy these, keep these and relax because ultimately three-four years down the line, you will find that 40% of your cost has been covered by dividend and rest is all gravy train. I do not believe that there will be a big turnaround in the capital side. The prices will go up appreciably, but I believe that there is no way they can go down below these prices. Number two, the is dividend stream should continue.


If there is a cycle in some of the commodities that you are talking about, would you expect dividends to increase quite significantly?There has been a lull this year. Last year was boom time for most of the metal stocks and so large dividends came. This year perhaps, the current dividend has been a little lower and one of the companies, Vedanta, has still to declare the dividend. We do not know where it is going to come, but we know promoter compulsion will ensure dividend comes.

If the cycle turns and the cash flow becomes better, that is all the reason why dividend should increase. Even if it does not, there is enough spare capacity in terms of debt holding. The almost debt free nature ensures that shareholders get rewarded in any case -- because either it is a PSU or it is the private sector where the promoter needs the money. 

Both ways promoter or the company needs money at the end of the day. The dividend is coming in a little lower and if the cycle turns, then you are looking at mega dividends. It is pretty okay. The risk and return is pretty okay in the favour.


Within healthcare, what would you look at -- pharma plays, hospitals or diagnostics? I have a huge amount of healthcare stocks. I have pharma and hospitals. I do not have diagnostic anymore. We sold off diagnostic last week because we thought the valuations were peaking out to that extent. It was a more like a trading call long term. 

Of course, India needs all the diagnostic capabilities and the biggest signal is the price increase and the government sanction. From a fearful environment of price reduction, we are talking about government being pragmatic enough to hike prices. We have already seen that the MNC pharma companies have already shot up in advance. In the last six months, they have reached historic highs and so they have done well. 

Indian pharma companies are yet to turn around. You have mentioned some development on Sun Pharma but valuation wise, pharma is at the best level possible. There is huge global PE interest in the company. You can buy pharma companies. They have a lovely Indian franchise and if the government mood has changed now to allow price increases, we will be in a good place.

There are really two or three Hospitals you really have two or three companies we have gotten shares in all the companies. We are waiting for the deleveraging or the promoter to happen to real value to come into this place. Investor wise, it is a safe place to be but not a spectacular place. It is not going to excite you but it is going to keep you safe.


When you talk about Indian pharma franchises, do you mean something which has exposure to US or something which has more exposure only to India?More exposure to India. Glenmark, Sun Pharma or Cipla -- we have shares in all of them. You will find that the valuation of the pharma companies that do not have US business, is significantly higher. Now give me a good reason why a good quality pharma company supplying to the Indian market should not be at a good multiple close to consumer?

We are in a transition stage, where the US impact will start to slow out and people will start to understand that there is an Indian franchise built in these companies which are superior to consumer goods. It will take some time, but the discovery will see the share price get a very healthy return. It is not going to happen tomorrow, but it is already taking place. It will accelerate as time goes by and as GST rates are hikes, that will be game changer for this industry.


Would you want to play any infra capex story or you would want to stick to consumption or the banking names?I have a few infra stocks and strangely, these are the stocks which give very high dividend. Dividend yields are upwards of 5% to 8%. They have not given any capital return but they are giving a healthy return in spite of the odd downturn. We are a buyer there in terms of infrastructure stocks, but we have played a little differently. 

We started to buy the reach of say Indigrid the transmission company. We have gone REITS of real estate. Instead of buying companies, if you are buying REITS, you might be better off in the infrastructure space at least on the power side. 

You saw the problems of PowerGrid. That side of infrastructure is a little tricky at this point of time. We do not buy construction companies because we never know the profitability of those contracts in five, seven or 10 years contracts. The story is in REITS, it is not in the companies."
17,2019-12-16,Cipla,"Mumbai: Beaten-down pharma stocks are back on investors’ radar, as they scramble for value in an otherwise stretched market.

However, for investors seeking to nibble into pharma names, stock selection is going to be key.

BSE Healthcare index has consistently underperformed benchmark Sensex for last few years as the regulatory and pricing pressures hurt drug makers in the US, their largest market.

In recent times, rising revenues in the domestic market have been helping Indian pharma companies make up for the ongoing pricing pressure on generic drugs in the US.

For the year-to-date period, BSE Healthcare index is down 4.32 per cent, while Sensex has logged 12.25 per cent gain. A similar underpeformance was seen since 2016. However, as the benchmark indices hovered around record high levels, and rich valuations made it difficult to go bargain hunting in many sectors, investors can find solace in the pharma space.

“We recommend pharma and healthcare as a tactical buy at this juncture. Valuations look attractive, PE (next 12 months) multiple stands at 21x (around 7-year low), even the PB (trailing 12 months) multiples for majority of the pharma stocks show that they are trading at a significant discount (30-60 per cent) to LTA (long-term average),” JM Financial said in a December 4 note.

The brokerage pointed out that the return on equity (ROE) for the pack has fallen concurrently. “The weightage of pharma in Nifty has fallen by 500 bps (basis points) in last five years, and is around its 10-year low now. Mutual funds are overweight on pharma, compared with the BSE500 index, but the weight itself is very low to make an assessment of overweight or underweight,” the brokerage added.

JM analysts prefers Alembic Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Cipla, Natco Pharma and Sanofi India in the pharma pack.

Frequent inspections of Indian plants by the USFDA and subsequent observations have slowed down growth of pharma exports even as US-China trade war presented huge opportunities for the drug industry.

From a compliance viewpoint, Calendar 2019 has been a particularly harsh year for Indian companies, as USFDA issued 20 WL/OAI (waiting list/official action indicated) status to Indian facilities in 2019, compared with mere six in 2018. Certain facilities like Cipla Goa and Aurobindo Unit-4 await outcome of the recently-concluded inspections.

“Most large Indian facilities underwent inspection in 2019, which makes us believe that regulatory stringency is peaking and will start easing-off in 2020. Past experience has shown that compliance issues sharply impact sentiment; and we expect more positive than negative surprises in 2020,” IIFL said in a November 27 note.

Technically too, pharma seemed to be a good place to stock up, analysts said.

According to Motilal Oswal analysts, Nifty Pharma index corrected around 50 per cent in last four years, but the index now seems to be bottoming out as it witnessed formation of a Hammer candle on the monthly chart,” he said.

“Also, it has formed a 'Morning Star' pattern along with positive divergence of RSI at recent lows on the weekly chart. After a pullback from lower levels, the price structure has resulted in the formation of an 'Inverse Head and Shoulder' pattern on the daily time scale and it is sustaining well above the neckline of mentioned pattern,” the brokerage said.

“We are expecting positive momentum on the pharma counters in the coming weeks. Among them Lupin, Dr Reddy’s Lab and Ipca Labs are our preferred picks,” Motilal Oswal analysts said in a note.

A few feel only a handful of MNC pharma companies were good picks. “Pharma has seen a very selective revival in MNC pharma stocks. A whole host of companies have reported good set of numbers and because of under-ownership and strong visibility, a good amount of traction is being seen there,” Hemang Jani, Senior Vice-president, Sharekhan, said in a December 3 interview to ETNow

“Other than MNC pharma, wherever the companies are reporting either good performances or specific triggers like what we have seen for Biocon, people are getting into those stories. But broadly, at most of the top companies -- be it Sun, Lupin or Dr Reddy’s -- we are not seeing any strong numbers being reported either from the US markets or from the India market,” said Jani.

“So, it is time to be a bit selective here with preferences for stocks like Biocon, Divi’s and select MNC pharma companies,” he added."

30,2019-12-27,Cipla,"MUMBAI: Zydus Cadila, a group company of listed drug-maker Cadila Healthcare, is in preliminary talks with several strategic and private equity investors to sell two of its divisions — anti-infectives and gynaecology — for about Rs 1,000-1,200 crore, seeking to lower debt and strengthen its balance sheet.

This is part of a broader strategy to reduce debt in the company’s capital structure after it borrowed more to help finance the Rs 4,600-crore acquisition earlier this year of Heinz India’s consumer wellness business.

Zydus has approached larger rivals, such as Cipla and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, besides financial investors, such as Advent International, Blackstone, KKR and Carlyle, top industry sources told ET.

KKR, Blackstone and Carlyle declined to comment. Zydus, Advent, Sun Pharma and Cipla could not be immediately reached for their comment.

Investment bank Jefferies has been mandated to run a formal process to find a buyer.

The anti-infectives and gynaecology divisions contributed Rs 565 crore and Rs 282 crore to FY19 overall annual revenue of Rs 11,940 crore, the annual report of the Ahmedabad-based company showed.

The anti-infective division named Vivo sells under brands such as Ampilox, Biotax, Amicin, Monotax — all acquired from Biochem Pharma in 2011.

Zydus’s gynaecology division Gynova sells brands such as Provironum, ZYHCG, Ovucet, and Ccliya — drugs that treat infertility.

After the US business, the formulations business in India is the second largest contributor to the drug-maker’s consolidated revenues. The two divisions being considered for divestment are major contributors to this formulations division revenue.



Founded in 1952 by Ramanbhai Patel and Indravadan Modi, Zydus is a generic drug company and manufactures products in the diagnostics, herbal, skin-care and over-thecounter segments.

“Synergies from acquired portfolio, wider distribution network and negligible tax rates in the near term would allow Zydus to report 26% earnings CAGR over FY19-22E. However, due to an increase in debt, the return ratios of the company are at low single digit and would take a good five to seven years to reach double digit levels,” ICICI Securities said in a note on December 3.

In January 2019, Zydus Wellness completed the Rs 4,600-crore acquisition of Heinz India's consumer wellness business, which included the Complan, Glucon-D, Nycil and Sampriti Ghee brands. The acquisition included two large manufacturing facilities (one in Aligarh and another one in Sitarganj) along with operations, research, sales, marketing and support teams, and a network of more than 800 distributors and 20,000 wholesalers in 29 states.

The funding of the acquisition was through a mix of debt and equity. The company raised Rs 2,575 crore by issuing 18.6 million shares on a preferential basis to Cadila Healthcare (Rs 1,175 crore), Zydus Family Trust (Rs 300 crore), True North (Rs 1,000 crore) and Pioneer Investment Fund (Rs 100 crore) at an issue price of Rs 1,382 per share, resulting in an equity dilution of nearly 48%.

The company also raised Rs 1,500 crore by issuing 9.14% secured, redeemable NCDs on a private placement basis. The balance payment was made through Rs 550 crore cash available with the company.

Private equity funds have been aggressive with their pharmaceutical bets. KKR bought into Gland Pharma two years ago, while Advent International recently acquired Bharat Serums and Vaccines from its promoters.

For Cipla, gyanecology is one of the major revenue contributors, while Sun Pharma may use the purchase to complement its offering, besides edging out local competition.

Cadila Healthcare shares have lost almost a quarter in the past one year, underperforming the benchmark index that rose about a sixth in the same period.

A Sun Pharma spokesperson said the company was not approached by the seller. In addition, he said, the company's acquisition strategy was targeted to enhance its specialty pipeline or expansion to other geographies. ""As we have said earlier, our acquisition focus is largely on enhancing our specialty pipeline or expanding presence in key geographies,"" Sun Pharma said."
