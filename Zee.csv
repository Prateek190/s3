25,2018-01-15,Zee,"Friday’s session remained volatile even as the benchmark Nifty50 swung nearly 80-odd points back and forth amid strong volatility. The market saw a sharp decline in late morning trade while dipping to the day’s low of 10,597, but recovered over 80-points to end the day with a net gain of 30 points or 0.28 per cent.

The market ended the day near the high point of the session. On purely technical basis, the market is expected to open modestly in the green on Monday and continue with its upmove, at least in the initial hours. Though technicals remain slightly overstretched on the daily chart, some more uptick with intermittent bouts of correction may not be ruled out.

The 10,705 and 10,760 levels will play out as immediate resistance for the Nifty50. Supports will come in at 10,655 and 10,610 levels.

The Relative Strength Index of RSI on the daily chart stood at 69.8058 and it has continued to mark its 14-period high, which is a bullish signal. It does not show any divergence from the price. 



The daily MACD is bullish, as it trades above its signal line. On the candles, a Doji is being seen. Also, a candle with a long lower shadow emerged. However, these have occurred during an uptrend and the Doji has no gap above the previous bar. Therefore, they are less significant in the present context.

Pattern analysis clearly shows the rally from the point where the Nifty50 broke above the 10,490 mark being getting extended further. There are chances that the index will test the 10,750 and 10,775 levels, and thereafter, see some corrective consolidation again.

Overall, there is still some steam left in the market to extend the current rally before it starts consolidating again. However, any further move may be accompanied by minor bouts of correction. We expect volatility to remain ingrained in the coming sessions. With no sign of any retracement, we recommend picking stocks selective and effectively rotating the sectors while the market reaches for its overhead resistance area once again. Cautious optimism is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH:
Good technical setup was observed on counters like ICICI Bank, Gammon Infrastructure, Subex, Usha Martin, CG Power, ONGC, ZEE Entertainment, Gayatri Projects and Equitas.

42,2018-01-16,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The Nifty50 index of NSE settled above the 10,700 mark for the first time ever on Monday, but momentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence, or MACD, signalled bearish crossovers for 75 stocks on NSE. 

On the daily chart, the index formed a ‘Shooting Star’ pattern, which suggests a short-term trend reversal is in the offing.

If the follow-up candle fails to make a higher high and then proceed to close under the below the prior candle, it would trap buyers, who would quickly realise that they may have overpaid for the position as prices stop rising, said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Axis Securities.

Among the counters that saw bearish crossovers in the previous trading session were Idea Cellular, Reliance Power, Tata Power, HCL Infosystem, Monnet Ispat, JK Cement, Nitin Spinners, Sadbhav Infrastructure and Bajaj Finance.

Some of these counters also witnessed strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Other stocks that witnessed bearish crossovers included Allcargo Logistics, GM Breweries, Vardhman Holdings, United Spirits, Take Solutions, Deepak Fertilisers, Avanti Feeds and Dredging Corporation.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward movement, and vice-versa.



However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm such trends.

Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers in 33 counters on NSE, which meant ‘buy’ signals. They included ICICI Bank, SBI Life Insurance, La Opala RG, Hathway Cable, Exide Industries, Cyient, HDFC Bank, Gati Ltd, Zee Entertainment, Jay Bharat and Titagarh Wagons.



On Monday, the 50-share Nifty index settled at 10,741, up 60.30 points or 0.56 per cent, from its previous close.

Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said the Nifty has to hold above 10,700 to extend its move towards 10,800 and 10,850 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,650 and 10,600 levels.


Understanding MACD
 A close look at the chart of ICICI Bank shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

56,2018-01-17,Zee,"Mumbai: Media firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) today reported a 28.28 per cent rise in consolidated net at Rs 321.72 crore for the third quarter.

Consolidated income rose 11.50 per cent to Rs 1,886.11 crore in the quarter under review as against Rs 1,691.58 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

Advertising revenue stood at Rs 1,202 crore, recording a growth of 25.8 per cent, while subscription revenue declined steeply to Rs 501.69 crore from Rs 593.46 crore as the company sold the sports business-Ten Sports-- to Sony.

""Adjusted for this, domestic subscription revenue grew by 7.5 per cent to Rs 403.6 crore, while international subscription revenue stood at Rs 98.1 crore,""the company said.

Commenting no the numbers, managing director and chief executive Punit Goenka said, ""we could deliver a strong operating performance in the quarter. Slower growth during the past four quarters was due to specific events which required advertisers to recalibrate spends.

""As the impact of these factors is now behind us, ad spends bounced back strongly and outlook remains encouraging. The recent cut in GST rates across a wide category of products should aid growth further.""

He said domestic ad revenue grew 26 per cent, which is a testimony to the fact that television continues to remain the most effective medium for brand building.

With a dominant time-share along with an increasing reach, television will remain an important medium for advertisers in the foreseeable future, he added.

Domestic subscription grew 7.5 per cent and Goenka admitted that growth so far had been lower than what they took last year as the content deals with the distribution partners were taking slightly longer to conclude due to litigations regarding the TRAI tariff regulations.

Last year the company had closed majority of such deals in the second and third quarters. ""However, this does not have any significant impact on our full year outlook for subscription growth,"" Goenka said.

He said digital platforms are driving incremental video consumption that represents another growth opportunity for content monetization.

""Our new digital platform, Zee5, scheduled to be launched next month, will enable us to capture this growth,"" he added."

57,2018-01-18,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: Zee Entertainment, one of India’s leading electronic media companies, beat consensus estimates on its third-quarter revenue, although higher-than-expected expenses crimped profit growth.

Against Bloomberg revenue and profit estimates of Rs 1,748 crore and Rs 400 crore, respectively, Zee posted Rs 1,886 crore of sales and Rs 322 crore in net earnings in the December 2017 quarter. Advertising revenues rose 26 per cent to Rs 1,202 crore, the amplitude exaggerated by the low base-effect in the year-ago quarter after demonetisation.

In the past two years, the industry’s advertising revenues have risen in the range of 12-13 per cent while Zee’s advertising sales have been rising 19 per cent. The company has been increasing its original programming hours (OPH), which would further boost its viewership in the Hindi General Entertainment Channel (GEC) segment.

Zee has also been faring well with respect to its regional peers. Its Tamil and Kannada channels have shown the fastest advertising growth in the past two years. Analysts say that advertising expenditure growth of FMCG companies is expected to be in the range of 11-13 per cent. Given these facts, analysts estimate that the company may record Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the range of 15-16 per cent for the next two to three years. This is one of the key reasons why analysts have been bullish on Zee.

Besides advertising revenues, the company is expected to benefit from growth in its subscription revenues, largely due to the implementation of phase-III and phase-IV of all-India digitisation drive. At present, subscribers in these markets pay fixed fees. Once the digitisation drive is completed, Zee, which is one of the preferred Hindi GEC channels along with its regional bouquet, is expected to record 12-13 per cent growth in its subscription revenues.

On the valuation front, considering its FY19 estimated earnings, the company is trading at a price-toearnings multiple of 32.9. This is at a premium to the company’s historical average of 29 times. But this premium is justified given the high prospects of the company’s superior advertising and subscription growth in the coming quarters."

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downturn, and vice-versa.



However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

Traders should make use other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm such trends.

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

Meanwhile, the MACD charts also showed that 12 stocks witnessed bullish crossovers on NSE, potentially giving a ‘buy’ signal. They included Petronet LNG, Coal India, Mirc Electronics, VRL Logistics, Alembic Pharma and Zee Entertainment.




 On Monday, the 50-share index settled 60.75 points, or 0.55 per cent, higher at 11,130 and formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart. 

Nifty formed a bullish candle on the daily chart on Monday and it now needs to hold above the 11,050 level to extend this move towards 11,200 then 11,250, while on the downside, supports are seen at the 10,990 level, said Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

India VIX moved up by 2.17 per cent to 17.89 in the previous trading session. The rising volatility index suggests the market could continue to witness volatile swings.

Understanding MACD



A close look at the chart of BHEL shows whenever the MACD line crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

2,2018-02-14,Zee,"In January, two factors played a crucial role in the selection of stocks for leading fund managers. Fund managers have preferred companies with strong current growth and the potential to sustain it in coming quarters. Two, the purchases have not been of market leaders but those that are trading at attractive valuations in comparison with their peers and own historical valuations. Here are five fresh buys of fund managers of leading fund houses in December. 


Varun Beverages (VBL)
CMP: Rs 666
Market cap: Rs 12,166 crore
Buyer: Reliance Mutual Fund

VBL runs a large part of India franchise business of Pepsico, an American multinational food, snack, and beverage company. In December last year, the company acquired two franchises of Pepsico India — Jharkhand (20 districts) and Chattishgarh. With this acquisition, VBL will be a franchise for PepsiCo products across 20 states and two Union Territories of India. This is a key reason leading fund managers have bought the company’s shares in December. VBL has 25 years of association with Pepsico. Close to 47 per cent beverage sales volume of Pepsico in India comes from VBL. As Pepsico plans to make its presence in India stronger and deeper, VBL should be a preferred player for the company. Besides India, VBL also has franchise of Pepsico products in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Morocco and Zambia.


TVS Motor Company

CMP: Rs 661
Market cap: Rs 31,427 crore
Buyer: Kotak Mutual Fund

Three key factors work in favour for TVS Motor Company. It is the only listed two-wheeler company which is expected to record fastest growth in the scooter segment. Among two-wheeler companies, the company’s volume growth is expected to beat the industry’s volume growth. Also, the company launched in December its bike, Apache 310 RR, its first offering in the super-premium segment. According to industry sources, the response to this bike has been encourating and footfalls in TVS showrooms have risen by more than 50 per cent. A large part of orders for Apache 310 RR is from states such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. The bike is expected to boost the company’s margins to double digits from single digit at present.


Zee Entertainment Enterprises
CMP: Rs 585
 Market cap: Rs 56,182 crore 
Buyer: ICICI Pru Mutual Fund

There are a few factors why Zee has attracted the attention of leading fund managers. One, the company has recorded healthy advertising revenues growth. Two, increasing contribution from new channels. Third, high possibility of rising subscription revenues due to pan-India digitalisation drive of the government. And lastly, increasing presence of the company in films and digital platforms. These point out to healthy revenues growth for the company. In the December 2017 quarter itself, Zee recorded close to 26 per cent growth in its advertising revenues. The management has guided on encouraging advertising revenues growth and more than 30 per cent of EBIDTA margin for FY18.


Greenlam Industries
CMP: Rs 1169 
Market cap: Rs 2,821 crore
 Buyer: IDFC Mutual Fund

The company boasts of a large portfolio of surfacing products catering to various segments across price points and benefits post the implementation of GST. It is a leader in the domestic laminates industry with 18 per cent market share, including exports. It is also the world’s third largest manufacturer of decorative laminates and largest in Asia with exports accounting for 50 per cent of revenue in 2017. The company is well placed to leverage its vast distribution network and strong brand equity to successfully expand product offerings in associate categories, such as engineered wood flooring and doors.


Butterfly Gandhimati Appliances
CMP: Rs 555
Market cap: Rs 992 crore
Buyer: IDFC Mutual Fund

The company is a big beneficiary of the move from unorganised segment to organised segment post the implementation of GST. Primarily a South India-based company, the management aims to increase non-South revenue to 30 per cent from current levels of 17 per cent over the next three years. Amongst the top-three companies in India for domestic kitchen appliances with a network of 400 exclusive distributors. With the finance bill of 2018, proposing to increase the number of LPG gas connections from 5 crore to 8 crore under PMUY, and the company’s foray into alternative sales channels such as online, large format stores and exports are likely to drive sales in the coming year."

5,2018-02-16,Zee,"Talking to ET Now, Kaustubh Belapurkar, Morningstar Investment, says in January financials are actually being sold off on profit-booking and stocks like Bharti have been bought into.Edited excerpts: 

While global investors are having a very divergent view and approach, what they bought and sold locally in January is likely to be financials only.Surprisingly so. It has been little different in the month of January. Financials are actually being sold off on profit-booking and rather stocks like Bharti have been bought into. We had counters like Infy, ITC which is a more defensive play and some of the cyclicals or the utilities companies like Power Grid and NTPC, that bought into on the large cap side. Managers have taken a pause on the financial space. They have been buying for the last 15 months. They have clearly seen that the stocks have rallied in January and they have taken some money off the table which is a good sign. In fact, if we look at the top bought stocks, you have just seen SBI featuring in it, where we see a lot of banks and an HDFC among the top selling names. So, that was an interesting move by managers in January.


Which large-cap stock has seen the maximum amount of commitment and maximum selling?Bharti has been the stock that seen the largest amount of buying. Over the last four to five months, managers have actually been adding on to Bharti. There were a couple of triggers obviously including Jio raising prices. Now Bharti is also talking about listing their African ops. Generally, managers are more pro on this particular stock within the communication service space. I do not really see them buying any of the other counters. On the selling side, ICICI Bank, which has actually been the darling of the Street for so long now , has seen some profit-booking. I would say marginal but we have seen about Rs 1000 crore of selling in the month of January in ICICI Bank.


I am also looking at the large-cap buys -- Zee Entertainment and Power Grid. Now they are typically not seen as high ranked stocks where institutions will build a lot of exposure. But they are fancied by the market. What are the trends that you are picking up there?Managers have clearly seen that we want to look at some of the counters beyond what has been happening in 2017. So Zee was an option where one large manager got in and bought out stake which Essel, the holding company, was selling out. They did get to buy that stake out. 

In case of Power Grid, again it is one of the large managers bought it. It is not a very broad based sort of thing. It is more of one or two managers really taking that call and taking sizable exposure in those counters but we have seen more and more managers take those sort of calls and move beyond what really has been happening in the past year.


Among some of the small-cap buys, the likes of Varun Beverage are also part of the list. Is the beverage sector particularly finding some fancy in the markets as an extension of the consumer theme?Consumers definitely have seen a fair bit of buying. ITC was one of the picks which continues to be a favourite or a more defensive play, but I think Varun is interesting . They are the largest bottlers from Pepsico and Indra Nooyi has come out and said that they will look at giving out more bottling franchises out and Varun could be one of the largest beneficiaries of that. We have also seen them getting a distribution tieup with Pepsico for their non-carbonated beverage, juices and Gatorade and things like that. Generally, there is a positive sense about this counter and clearly we have seen managers get into the stock.


I am tempted to ask you what is the flow like when it comes to PSU banks? Considering SBI is a large part of the holding for many mutual funds, has there been any aberration there, any resentment towards some of the other smaller PSBs? I am not talking about PNB but a clutch of others?In January, we saw SBI being bought. I do not suspect it will be any different in February. But we have not really seen too much activity on the other counters any which ways. PNB, interestingly in December, had this huge QIP where we had a few managers subscribe to it. In fact, if we look at last month’s data, it was actually the top bought stock. Yes the managers did buy a fair bit of PNB in December and they will probably take a wait and watch approach but I do not really see them going beyond a BOB and PNB and SBI when they were buying. There has not been much selling on these PSU bank counters."

13,2018-02-22,Zee,"After selling the global media rights of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to Star India for Rs 16,347.5 crore, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is now gearing up to e-auction the media rights of its second-most prized property, the other cricket tournaments played in the country.

The board has initiated the tender process and invited interested parties to bid for the rights of international and domestic cricket tournaments (including the Ranji Trophy and the Irani Cup) which are to be played in India, for the next five years (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2023).

Interested bidders can pick up tender documents upon payment of Rs 6.80 lakh ($10,000). The last date for submission of bids is 10 am on March 27. The auction will start at 2 pm the same day.

Incumbent rights holder Star India had picked up the BCCI rights for Rs 3,851 crore in 2012. Star India’s pay out to BCCI per match was about Rs 43 crore.

BCCI has divided the invitation to tender (ITT) process into three rights packages— global television rights plus rest of the world digital rights, digital rights for the Indian subcontinent and a global consolidated rights bid.

Going by the recent auctions for IPL media rights, the BCCI will be hoping that bidders will go all out to acquire the rights. However, sports marketing experts said that with Indian sports broadcasting becoming a duopoly market between Star India and Sony Pictures Networks, the TV rights may not fetch big numbers and it will be digital rights for the subcontinent which will see the action.

In the IPL media rights auction, Facebook, Reliance Jio and Airtel had bid over Rs 3,000 crore each for the digital rights alone.

“BCCI has taken a smart decision to go for e-auctions. This way, the price escalation will be far more than closed bidding. But TV rights alone may not fetch the same value as the last auctions,” said a sports marketing executive.

Both Uday Shankar, chairman of Star India, and NP Singh, CEO of Sony Pictures Networks, had told ET in earlier interactions that their companies will be interested in the Indian cricket rights only if the value makes a business sense.

When Star India had gone all out to buy Indian cricket rights, it was starting its sports business. It built the entire sports business on the back of Indian cricket rights and later started leagues for Kabaddi and football. Now, with IPL in its kitty, Star India may not be desperate for the BCCI rights.

Similarly, even as Sony Pictures Networks lost the IPL rights, it acquired the sports business of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, which gives the company enough sports content to run the network throughout the year. Apart from WWE, FIFA, La Liga, Sony Pictures Networks also has cricket rights of Australia and South Africa."

The Nifty made high of 11,171 posts which a correction till 10,276 was sharp and now pullback rally is very slow, expect a rally towards 10,700-10,950 before the next leg of correction where 10,275 and 10,033 are important levels. Till Nifty doesn’t cross 10,800 then next leg of correction can become bit deep. In the worst case scenario, 9,800-9,500 could be possible; while in the best case 10,030 would not breach.


What is in store? The euphoric market saw a sell-off and mid-caps and small-caps have corrected more than 15-20 per cent while correction in large-caps was hardly 6-8 per cent. Going forward, large-cap growth stock will perform, like ITC, Reliance, HPCL, Power Grid, TCS, Infosys, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, BEL, Titan, to name a few. The next leg of correction, if it happens, small-cap and mid-cap stocks which have weak fundamentals can correct big time and recovery would take time, so avoid lesser-known stocks. Avoid averaging losses as any stock which starts to correct would take a long time to recover.


What could investors do? An investor should generate some cash, 25-30 per cent would be ideal in this on-going rally and realign the portfolio mix to quality stocks which have not performed in last two years. Outperformers of last 2-3 years can become laggards, while IT and power can be outperformer. Persistent, L&T Info, Cyient, TCS, NTPC, Torrent Power, Power Grid, REC are stocks for the next 12-15 months in our view.

17,2018-03-08,Zee,"MUMBAI: Media company Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) said 
Thursday that it has filed a complaint against multi-system operator (MSO) DEN Networks and its affiliate partners in the information and broadcasting ministry, alleging that the latter is supplying signals of TV channels in an unencrypted and non-addressable mode in digital addressable systems (DAS) notified areas.

Under the Cable and Television Networks Rule, cable or DTH companies are not allowed to offer signals of TV channels in un-encrypted form. Unencrypted and non-addressable signals are prone to piracy and ZEE claims of losing money due to that.

However, when contacted, SN Sharma, CEO, DEN Networks, termed the complaint frivolous. “I am surprised to hear this. We haven’t received any notice and in fact recently BECIL (Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited) conducted our audit and gave us a clean chit. Because we have put ZEE channels on a-la-carte, they are not happy and coming out with such frivolous cases. We follow the law of the land,” Sharma stressed.

ZEE said in the statement that it has submitted video recordings to the I&B ministry as an evidence to show that DEN is taking channels from a direct-to-home (DTH) set top box and retransmitting the channels through its cable networks in an unencrypted and non-addressable mode.

ZEE has added that DEN’s retransmitting of channels amounts to “piracy” which is “not only an offence under the Copyright Act, 1957 but also specifically prohibited under the Programme Code as provided in Cable Television Network Rules, 1994.”

The complaint states that the actions of DEN in transmitting the channels in unencrypted and non-addressable mode and piracy of channels through DTH set top box are not only adversely impacting the Broadcasters but also causing revenue loss to the public exchequer.

Incidentally, DEN has removed all ZEE and Turner channels from its monthly packages and kept them on a-la-carte basis, which means that a subscriber will have to ask for the channels and will have to pay for the said channels on per channel basis.

ZEE claims that while DEN has withdrawn the channel, it has not reduced the consumer prices of its packages as required under Quality of Service Regulations (DAS). “In Mumbai DEN’s Supreme pack was priced at Rs 343 (including. taxes) prior to packaging change in which DEN was providing 388 channels. Post change in packaging, DEN has removed 147 channels, whereas the price of the package remains same,” Zee said."

20,2018-03-09,Zee,"Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned wary about the prospects of the Indian equity market since February following the introduction of long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on equity in Union Budget 2018, a Rs 12,700 crore scam in Punjab National Bank (PNB) and repeated signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates rapidly.

Several global financial services firms, including CLSA and Morgan Stanley, have since cut India’s weightage in their scheme of things.

FIIs have been offloading stocks in the cash market in the recent past. They offloaded shares worth a net of around Rs 12,000 crore between February 1 and March 7 after having pumped in Rs 13,781 crore in January and Rs 49,729 crore in the whole of last year. 

With clear signs of FIIs losing their conviction on India and the global liquidity squeeze posing a clear threat of capital outflow from emerging markets, including India, some analysts say FII-heavy stocks are likely to witness freaky fortunes in the coming months.

“There is a little concern for the FII-heavy stocks in the short term, as they have been selling Indian equities continuously and there are no positive triggers right now for them to change their outlook,” says G Chokkalingam, Head of Research at Equinomics Research and Advisory.

Domestic equity benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are already down about 9 per cent from their respective all-time high levels hit on January 29, 2018. 

On Friday, the benchmark indices traded with gains after staging a solid rebound in Thursday’s trade, when the Sensex leapt nearly 318 points, or 1 per cent.

FIIs hold huge clout in the domestic market, holding around 18 per cent of India’s total market capitalisation.

Within the BSE200 basket, they held more than 25 per cent stake at the end of December in as many as 58 companies, whose stocks appear to be at the maximum risk should the FII outflow becomes rapid.




Going by shareholding data available with Ace Equity, some of the top NBFCs face the biggest risk.

FPIs held substantial stakes in non-banking financial companies such as HDFC (74.76 per cent), Bharat Financial Inclusion (60.71 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (55.34 per cent) and Shriram Transport Finance (49.73 per cent) as on December 31, 2017.

In the banking pack, FIIs held 48.06 per cent, 47.34 per cent, 43.20 per cent and 40.57 per cent in Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, YES Bank and HDFC Bank, respectively, at the end of 2017.

“FIIs are reacting to the news and developments happening on both global as well as domestic fronts. For India, both domestic and global news have not been too conducive. These are short-term disruptions, but they would not continue for a long time. However, it will continue at least for the coming few months,” said Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst, Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

Amid the global sell-off, there has been risk aversion among the FIIs, which raising the risk of their pulling money out of emerging markets like India.

“Investors should understand that India is just one segment for FIIs. So if the country is not attractive for them, they can invest somewhere else,” Srivastava said in a chat with ETNow.

Stocks like Apollo Hospital, Hero MotoCorp, Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Mindtree, UPL, The Federal Bank, Crompton Greaves and Infosys have high levels of shareholding among foreign investors.

From across sectors, stocks where FIIs hold over 15 per cent stakes have risen up to 600 per cent over the past one year.

The list includes Indiabulls Venture (up 586 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (up 144 per cent), Edelweiss Financial Services (up 91 per cent), Tata Global Beverages (up 88 per cent), Jubilant FoodWorks (up 87 per cent) and Jindal Steel and Power (up 86 per cent), among others.

Nitasha Shankar, Senior Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities, said post the Union Budget, the Indian stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. In recent times, it has been hovering in the negative territory.

“This is largely related to the PSU banking stocks which have been ruffled with news flows and developments related to one of the largest PSU banks. This has had a negative impact on the headline indices, considering that banking stocks in general and PSU bank scrips in particular hold a substantial weightage in the benchmark indices,” she said.

NSE’s Nifty index is down 1,017 points to 10,154 as of March 7 from its all-time peak of 11,171 hit on January 29. The 30-pack BSE Sensex has pulled back over 3,410 points to 33,033 from 36,443 during this period.

Milan Sharma, Director, Rivergate Capital, says a trend reversal in FII flows is imminent.

India is not looking as attractive, as it was few months back. Going forward, there will be a reversal in the trend along with a fresh flow of inflows from domestic institutional investors, he said.

“Considering the Rs 12,000-13,000 crore inflow to the equity market through the SIP route, we do not think one needs to be too cautious. We will also see some reversal in FII flows soon,” Sharma said."

26,2018-03-13,Zee,"NEW DELHI: As the Nifty50 reclaimed the crucial 10,400 level on Monday, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled upward crossovers in 50 stocks on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The MACD is known for identifying trend reversals.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Power Grid, Infosys, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Mahindra & Mahindra, Wipro, Dabur India, Zee Entertainment, Maruti Suzuki, PNC Infratech, Shankara Building, Akzo Nobel and Atul.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included La Opala RG, Swaraj Engines, Nilkamal, Natco Pharma and GE Power.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience an upward movement, and vice versa.



However, MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any such trend.

Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed bearish crossovers on 27 counters on NSE, which analysts tend to read as ‘sell’ signal. They included Bhushan Steel, CESC, Uflex, Swan Energy, Avanti Feeds and Ramky Infrastructure.



On Monday, the 50-share Nifty index settled 194 points, or 1.90 per cent, higher from its previous close at 10,421.

“Looking at Monday’s smart bounce back, we may extend the relief rally towards 10,460-10,500 levels. But our directional view remains unchanged. We advise traders not to participate aggressively in this move and rather lighten up long positions at higher levels,” said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking.

“For the next couple of days, a stock-specific approach is recommended. However, one needs to be careful while picking up a stock and should ideally trade with a proper exit strategy,” said Chavan.


Understanding MACD



A close look at the chart of Maruti Suzuki shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has mostly shown an upward momentum and vice versa.


Shares of the company closed 1.69 per cent higher at Rs 8,811 on March 12."
23,2018-03-13,Zee,"MUMBAI: Mumbai: Television broadcasters in India are at loggerheads with the department of space as the latter is allegedly denying all permissions — be it for launch of a new channel or change in logo — to channels that are not operating on Indian satellites.

Over the last three months, all broadcasters who have applied for either new channels or changes in the name of existing channels have been denied permissions by department of space (DoS) with an explicit directive to move to Indian satellites, Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) has complained to minister of state for space Jitendra Singh and information and broadcasting (I&B) minister Smriti Irani in a letter.

ET has reviewed a copy of the letter that has sought immediate relief to the TV broadcasters.

Apparently, DoS wants all the channels to shift their operations to Indian satellites operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from existing foreign satellites like Intelsat, Asiasat, Measat, Apstar and others. Currently 80% of all Indian broadcasters are operating on foreign satellites. Out of 724 active channels, only 156 are on Indian satellites.

In October last year, the I&B ministry had reverted to the erstwhile practice of referring all applications seeking uplinking permissions, or change of teleport and/or satellite in respect of TV channels to DoS for its ‘no objection’.

This, IBF said in its letter, has resulted in permissions being denied to all new channels and existing channels who have applied for new permissions.

Punit Goenka, president of IBF, claimed that capacity on INSAT 4A is satiated while ISRO’s other satellites lack quality teleports. “The capacity that ISRO is offering to broadcasters on GSAT-10 and GSAT-17 have no concomitant approved teleports,” he told ET.

“Such a move would concurrently result in financial and litigating circumstances for the sector, especially for all those networks which have an ongoing contract with the foreign satellites,” said Goenka who is also managing director at Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

Goenka claimed that ISRO's insistence has resulted in pendency for many channels at the level of getting operationalised, which is inhibiting the growth of the sector.

K Sethuraman, director at ISRO, however, told ET that DoS has spent a lot of taxpayers’ money to build satellites and thus there is nothing wrong in directing broadcasters to use these satellites. But he refused to comment on whether or not ISRO is denying any permission to broadcasters.

Industry insiders confirmed that permissions related to name change and new channel launches have been pending for more than three months now. For instance, Star India’s application to convert Channel V into Star Sports Kannada has been pending.

Goenka said that while this move cannot be construed to be antithetical to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of ‘ease of doing business’ in India, any sector would wish to leverage its existing capacities to the core. He said such stipulations are “non-existent” in any other country and “go against the very principle of making India a hub for media, teleports and inexpensive uplinks”.

“As an aftermath, existing uplinks and teleports could contemplate either ceasing their operations or moving out of the country,” Goenka said.

Indian Broadcasting Foundation plans to initiate a dialogue with I&B ministry and ministry of space to find an amicable solution to the issue."

27,2018-03-15,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group : Leading broadcasters such as Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Sun TV Network are expected to record superior growth in subscription revenues in the coming quarters because of handsome gains in the Average Revenue per User (ARPU) of cable operators in the three months to December.

In the third phase of the pan-India digitisation drive that covers areas beyond the metros, cable operators registered about 30-35 per cent growth in their ARPU. Estimates suggest that in phase IV, which is currently being implemented, broadcasters have recorded on-year ARPU growth in the range of 45-50 per cent.

Interestingly, even on a sequential basis, cable operators have recorded 4-30 per cent growth in ARPU. In the media industry value chain, broadcasters provide channels to MSOs, which in turn provide channels to Local Cable Operators (LCOs). In this chain, given the revenue sharing model, broadcasters providing channel services are expected to show a pronounced improvement in subscription revenues.

This growth in ARPU has come at an opportune time for broadcasters as it coincides with strong growth in advertising revenues (double-digit) for the December 2017 quarter. Even if the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) implements its proposed rules, the subscription revenues at broadcasters would be boosted further. According to various estimates, subscription revenues of Zee and Sun TV Network are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15-30 per cent for the next two years.

With improvement in advertising revenues given the consistent double digit growth in auto sales and double digit sales volume growth for FMCG companies, this should boost the earnings per share (EPS) of these companies by 18-45 per cent for the next two fiscals.

On the valuation front, the stocks of Zee and Sun TV Network are trading at FY19 price to earnings multiples of 32 and 25.3, respectively."

Subhash Chandra-promoted ZEE had agreed to pick up 100% stake in 9X Media and its subsidiary INX Music for a total cash consideration of Rs 160 crore.

Later, ZEE had extended the long-stop date to facilitate the investee entities of 9X Media to comply with certain conditions precedent(s) for conclusion of the acquisition transaction.

Email query sent to Pradeep Guha, managing director, 9X Media, did not elicit any response till the time of filing this report.

New Silk Route, which owns about 80% stake in 9x Media, has been looking to exit the company since 2013 after first investing in the then known as INX Media, over 10 years back.

In 2016, the company initiated talks with Sony Pictures Networks India, which agreed to buy 9X Media for over Rs 200 crore. However, after due diligence, some legacy taxation issues were discovered, which could not be sorted out and SPN decided to walk out of the negotiations. Later, in April 2017, ZEE and 9X Media started talking on the acquisition, which was finally announced on October 6.

9X Media operates a bouquet of six music channels - 9XM (latest Bollywood music), 9X Jalwa (Evergreen Hindi), 9X Bajao (Hindi Classics), 9XO (English), 9X Jhakaas (Marathi music), and 9X Tashan (Punjabi music). It also has a digital product, SpotboyE, offering Bollywood's news, gossip, movie reviews and other updates.

At the time of deal announcement, Punit Goenka, MD, ZEE, had mentioned that the acquisition follows ZEE’s stated strategy of expanding into regional markets and niche genres. “9X Media’s six music channels enjoy leading market shares in their respective segments and will further strengthen our entertainment offering to the consumer. The channels will benefit immensely from our network’s strength to achieve higher growth potential and cost synergies,” Goenka had said."

32,2018-03-16,Zee,"MUMBAI: Sports broadcasting business in India has predominantly been shared between Star India and Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN). While the first has made some splashy acquisitions (read IPL global media rights) and big announcements of spending over Rs 20,000 crore on development of sports, SPN has mostly stayed below the radar, quietly building its sports network -- earlier on the back of IPL, and in a recent move by eliminating one competitor (Ten Sports) by way of acquisition.

From a one sports channel -- Sony Six -- five years back, SPN has now grown into an 11-channel sports network.

“Sports has become an integral part of Sony’s growth story,” said Rajesh Kaul, president - sports & distribution, SPN. “When we saw an opportunity to acquire Ten Sports, we grabbed it, which multiplied our scale and since then we have been building aggressively.”

The company has spent close to Rs 2,400 crore on the acquisition of Ten Sports. Earlier, it had spent Rs 8,200 crore to bag IPL rights for 10 years. Currently, it has rights of 7 international cricket boards, including three big ones -- Australia, England and South Africa. It also has rights of FIFA, WWE, UFC, La Liga and many other sporting properties that have allowed the network to position as a one-stop destination for sports.

When it comes to return on investment, Kaul believes that SPN is on track to turn profitable on sports business in the next two years. “We should be profitable by 2020. All our decisions are driven by sharp focus on profitability,” said Kaul.

And while SPN lost the rights of IPL to Star, Kaul is not perturbed. Even as the BCCI’s India cricket rights are up for grabs, he says that with the recent acquisitions, SPN’s dependence on India cricket has come down. “I can’t comment about a competitor, but as far as we are concerned, BCCI is not a must have for us. We have a lot of cricket -- 1000 days in the next 5 years -- including 300 days of cricket in the next 12 months (55 days India cricket),” he said.

However, he said that BCCI rights, slated to be e-auctioned on March 27, are still lucrative and SPN will definitely bid for them, putting a value which makes “business sense”. “We don’t have to go through the roof,” Kaul said.


If SPN gets BCCI rights, it will turn the tables on Star and will become the home of cricket (except for IPL). In the early years of IPL, the league was the only cricket property that SPN had.

Some sports media experts say that BCCI rights are a must have for both Star and SPN. “If SPN fails to get BCCI, its loss may not hurt as much as Star’s winning the rights will. With BCCI and IPL, Star will have tremendous advantage, something which SPN was trying to have in 2012, but failed. So, more than trying to win the rights, SPN will have to go after the rights to stop Star from having them,” said a senior sports executive, who did not wish to be identified.

Interestingly, it is Star which will have more to lose in the absence of BCCI rights as after losing rights of Cricket Australia and ECB, it will not have any cricket between IPL this year and next, except for a New Zealand board. This, sports expert say, may hamper Star’s ability to increase distribution revenues.

And distribution revenue is what SPN is also after. Kaul believes that sports is the biggest driver of distribution revenue and gives huge edge over marketplace. “Way forward, I see 75-80% of distribution revenue getting divided between SPN and Star India.”

It is important to note that SPN entered sports business way back in 1998 with media rights of Sri Lanka cricket board, which was then followed by ICC World Cup rights for 2003 and 2007. However, the network did not launch a sports channel till 2012, despite having 10 year rights of IPL since 2008. It launched the first sports channel -- Sony Six -- in 2012 and even after that, continued to air IPL on Hindi movie and events channel Max.

Later, once Star India started making aggressive moves in the sports sector, SPN also upped the ante and entered into a 7-year partnership with ESPN in 2015. Later in 2016, it announced the acquisition of Ten Sports network from Zee Entertainment Enterprises for $385 million."

The media and entertainment industry has now positioned itself on the cusp of a strong phase of growth, backed by digitisation, improving advertising revenues and increased consumer demand. Also, the industry has witnessed a relatively new trend in deal activity, with emerging segments such as gaming and digital gaining momentum. 

The rising rate of investments by private players and foreign media and entertainment majors has improved India's related infrastructure to a great extent. If news is to believed, the size of Indian media and entertainment industry, which grew at 10 per cent between 2012 and 2017, has added over Rs 50,000 crore of revenue. 

Of all the segments, digital content has started to account for an increasing share of growth in global entertainment and media revenues. Undoubtedly, digital technology will deepen its presence, leading to a shift in consumer behaviour across all segments, and continue to be among the fastest growing across the globe.

Ahead of strong economic fundamentals and steady growth in domestic consumption, coupled with growing contribution of rural markets across key segments, the industry is expected to see huge demand. The industry is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 11.6 per cent to reach Rs 2 lakh crore by 2020. Led by digital media, the industry reached Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2017. Also, advertising is expected to grow to 43 per cent of total revenues by 2020, from the current 41 per cent. 

Print media remained largely static, growing at 3 per cent to reach Rs 30,300 crore in 2017. It is estimated to grow at an overall CAGR of approximately 7 per cent till 2020, with vernacular publications at 8-9 per cent and English at slightly slower rates.

The industry normally sees advertisement growth in the first quarter of the financial year ahead related to education and in the third quarter ahead of festive demand. Brand investing will continue to be a big theme in everything. 

Digitisation is setting new standards for industries in India as consumers are actively interacting with brands and businesses online. The industry is likely to attract revenue from the large advertisement spending sector such as FMCG, automobile, banking, telecom, financial services and insurance, real estate, jewellery and the like. 

Besides, government advertisements will continue to be the biggest source of revenue for both print and electronic media ahead of general elections in 2019. The automobile industry will continue its new launches and hence, more advertising spends. Therefore, one may consider investing in companies such as Zee Entertainment, Shemaroo Entertainment, HT media and the like for the long term."
38,2018-03-19,Zee,"Here’s a lowdown on top macro triggers that may move market on Monday. This report was compiled from agency feeds.



WTO Ministerial Starts Today
Representatives from 50 countries will be gathering in New Delhi on 19-20 March for an informal World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting. The 50 nations will engage in free and frank discussions on global trade to explore the options for resolving various issues and re-invigorating the WTO. The meeting would be more of an ""ice-breaker"" as it is being held after the collapse of talks at the Buenos Aires WTO Ministerial in December. 


IOC, BPCL May Buy 26% Each in GAIL 
State-owned Indian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs 20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms. Following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's February 2017 Budget announcement of creating integrated oil majors, IOC and BPCL had submitted separate proposals to buy the government's 54.89% stake in India's biggest gas marketing and transportation firm, GAIL. The government is looking at transfer of its ownership to a cash rich PSU and the best option would be to split the 54.89% holding in GAIL equally between IOC and BPCL. 


HC Bars TRAI from Penal Action Against Vodafone 
The Madras High Court has ordered the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India not to take any coercive or penal action against Vodafone India, while staying the regulator’s demand that the carrier put all tariff plans on its website, including those offered to retain individual customers. The court will now hear the matter on April 13. It gave Trai time till March 28 to file counter-affidavits and till April 6 to file rejoinders. The order effectively allows Vodafone — and possibly Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular to give segmented offers to specific subscribers whom it wants to retain, without offering that plan to other users, till the case is settled. 


SC Ruling: Cos, Investors Face Higher Tax 
Holding companies of many Indian business houses, corporates investing in subsidiaries and associates, as well as several large individual investors will have to cough up more tax after a Supreme Court ruling last week. The verdict will prevent many companies and investors from treating their entire outgo of interest on borrowings as ‘expenditure’. This will be applicable to almost all holding entities and several corporates earning dividend from subsidiaries and group companies. Even when shares held are treated as ‘stock in trade’ and not ‘investment’, the assessee, should be disallowed from treating a slice of the loan interest as expenditure. 


GST Returns Mismatch
With only 16% of the summary sales returns under GST matching with the final returns, the revenue department has started to analyse major gaps with a view to check any possible tax evasion. According to the GST returns data, 34% of businesses paid Rs 34,400 crore less tax between July-December while filing initial summary return (GSTR-3B). These 34% of the businesses have paid Rs 8.16 lakh crore to the exchequer by filing GSTR-3B, whereas analysis of their GSTR-1 data show that their tax liability should have been Rs 8.50 lakh crore. 


PNB Case Not a Systemuc Problem: World Bank
The World Bank does not feel that nearly Rs 13,000-crore PNB scam is indicative of a systemic problem with the nation's financial sector, in sharp contrast to its Bretton Woods peer IMF that had called for more changes on the governance front to prevent recurrence of such frauds. ""One scam doesn't make a systemic story,"" he added, speaking at a logistics industry event. 


ZEE Call Off 9X Media Acquisition
Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has terminated the acquisition of the music broadcaster 9X Media announced in October last year.

Subhash Chandra-promoted ZEE had agreed to pick up 100% stake in 9X Media and its subsidiary INX Music for a total cash consideration of Rs 160 crore. 


Passport Details of Directors
Ministry of Corporate Affairs is considering a proposal to seek passport details of all individuals who serve as directors on the board of companies in a bid to prevent loan defaulters like Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi leaving the country. In case a person with Director Identification Number (DIN) does not have a passport, the ministry plans to obtain a certificate in the form of declaration that the person does not have the passport, sources said. It is also proposed that the prospective DIN seekers will have to submit passport details for obtaining the 8-digit unique id provided by the ministry.

42,2018-03-20,Zee,"Despite ending below the 200-DMA in the previous session, Indian market in volatile trade on Tuesday managed to keep itself afloat and avoid any serious breakdown.

The NSE benchmark Nifty saw itself in a capped range during the day, while struggling to keep its head above the crucial 10,040-mark. The market finally ended with a net gain of 30.10 points or 0.30 per cent.

As we approach Wednesday’s session, we can expect technical pullback by the market. A modestly positive start is expected, but in any case Nifty will have to move past the 10,166-mark to stay successfully afloat and avoid any major breakdown. The 10,166 level is the 200-DMA.

 Given the oversold nature of the oscillators, even if the Nifty does not immediately find its bottom, there are larger chances of a pullback than an outright breakdown from current levels.



 The levels of 10,166 and 10,245 will act as immediate resistance for the market. Crucial supports come in at 10,040 and 9,980 zones.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 36.0100, and it remains neutral showing no divergences against the price. The daily MACD is bearish, while it trades below its signal line. Pattern analysis shows that the Nifty has continued to resist to the 200-DMA on the upside while attempting to pullback. It will have to move past 10166-mark at the to have a sustainable and serious pullback.

 Until this happens, Nifty remains vulnerable to volatile oscillations, with 10,040 acting as support. Overall, Nifty is not completely out of the woods as yet, but it certainly remains oversold on some oscillators.

 This makes it likely that even if it remains in continuing downtrend, it gives some decent technical pullback. However, the moving past and closing above 10,166 will be crucial for the Nifty to avoid any major breakdown.

 We will recommend avoiding any major shorts at this juncture. Cash should be preserved and extremely select stock specific purchases may be made. Continuance of cautious outlook is advised until we see Nifty moving past 10,166 in a convincing manner.

“The price-wise correction is over for the market; maybe another 100-200 point fall in Nifty is all that we anticipate,” says Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO, Yes Securities.

But the time-wise correction is going to be a lot more painful and individual stocks will keep on moving up and down. So this is going to be a phase which will be terrible for traders, but will be a good time for investors to hold on to stocks and build a portfolio for the long run, he said.


Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver handsome gains over the next three weeks or so.


Sagar Doshi, Technical Analyst, Edelweiss Investment Research


Hexaware | Buy | Target Price: 400 | Stop loss: Rs 360

Out of all sectoral indices, the IT sector is the one which is not participating in the current fall. While the Nifty has made lower lows, the IT index has not yet broken its previous lows of Feb 2018. Out of all the IT stock, midcap firm Hexaware stands strong, with the stock trading just 3 per cent away from its lifetime high. It has also sustained above its 20DMA and is nearing a breakout.


Bajaj Finserv | Buy | Target Price: Rs 5,340 | Stop loss: Rs 4,965

While the market is down 4 per cent in March, this stock is up 5 per cent. Trading in a tapering range and near a trendline breakout, the stock could further continue its outperformance against the market and resume its long-term uptrend. On the longer timeframe chart, the stock is forming a FLAG pattern on a monthly basis.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


NTPC | Buy | Target Price: Rs 187 | Stop loss: Rs 160

This counter appears to have registered a durable bottom at the recent low of Rs 158 hit last February and since then a fresh leg of upswing is in progress. Interestingly, after hitting the said low, it has consolidated in a narrow range for four weeks and then witnessed a sustainable breakout. As long as it sustains above Rs 160 level, one can look for a higher target at Rs 187.


Zee Entertainment | Buy | Target Price: Rs 619 | Stop loss: Rs 547

The way this counter has recoiled after testing its 200-day EMA is suggesting that this counter has bottomed out around Rs 550 level, but can also head to much higher levels in the course of time. In the near term, the Rs 581 level may act as a hiccup but once that level is conquered, it can almost retest its life time highs placed around the Rs 619 level. Positional traders should buy now and on declines in the zone of Rs 560-555.


JSW Steel | Buy | Target Price: Rs 320 | Stop loss: Rs 273

It is very interesting that this counter from the metals pack registered new lifetime high on February 27, when there was turbulence both in the market as well as in the entire metal sector. This is clearly suggesting that this counter has successfully decoupled from the uncertainty related to metals pack and capable of going higher on its own inherent strength, irrespective of market conditions.


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical/ Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities


ICICI Prudential Life Insurance | Buy | Target Price: Rs 400 | Stop loss: Rs 370

This stock has bounced from its support level at Rs 368, which roughly corresponds to the previous intermediate lows, thereby implying a double bottom formation pattern. We also observe that the intense selling seen recently has been reduced in the process, which is encouraging. With the stock on the verge of moving above its 13-day SMA and momentum readings like the 14-day RSI in rising mode and not overbought, we believe the stock has more upside potential.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher


Gujarat State Petronet | Buy | Target price: Rs 204 | Stop loss: Rs 170

This stock recently witnessed a steep correction from the Rs 210 level and has bottomed out at Rs 172 level. The counter has the potential to rise further in the coming days. Chart patterns look attractive and with the RSI indicating a trend reversal from the oversold zone. A buy signal has been triggered to maintain a positive bias. 


Jubilant Life | Buy | Target price: Rs 890 | Stop loss: Rs 780
This stock has taken a support around Rs 780 on two occasions to indicate a strong base at this mark. “We anticipate Jubilant Life to be in the recovery mode from here on and scale further upside targets in the coming days,” said Parekh. Positive candle patterns indicate a positive bias. Also with the RSI turning positive from the oversold zone, the stock is poised for a bounce.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA


GE Power India | Buy | Target Price: Rs 895 | Stop loss: Rs 838

This stock completed its corrective move after testing the high of Rs 1,044. It attempted to find a base in the Rs 810-840 range and is not seen breaking out from this congestion. The prices have ended outside the upper Bollinger Band on the daily chart. The band remains 43 per cent narrower-than-normal and this further increases the chance of a decisive move. MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The RSI is seen breaking out from a formation while marking higher highs. It also shows bullish divergence against the price.


PNB Gilts | Buy | Target Price: Rs 38 | Stop loss: Rs 33.50

This stock has remained in a dominant downtrend for the major part of the previous year. Currently, after testing low of Rs 34, the stock is seen possibly accumulating in the Rs 34-35 zone and might attempt a reversal. A buy signal has emerged over Stochastic with a bullish divergence against the price. MACD remains in continuing buy mode. On the weekly charts, the prices appear to have taken support at the 200-period moving average. The weekly RSI shows a bullish divergence against the price.

Where we are
Indian equity markets opened lower on Friday following global stock markets sell-off on concerns of a US-China trade war. Spurt in crude oil prices also didn’t help market sentiments. The Nifty lost 1.3% for the day to close at 9,998 levels and ended down by 1.9% for the week. The index saw a gap-down opening below the December 2017 low of 10,033 and closed below the psychological level of 10,000.


What is in store
Nifty managed to find support around 9,950 levels and hold above it, providing marginal respite for the bulls. But on the weekly chart, it has formed long bearish candlestick, suggesting that the market is likely to see further downside eventually. The long-term 200-day moving average had acted as a support for the index earlier this month, and it is now acting as a resistance as the Nifty was unable to sustain above it in the bounce-back last week.


What could investors do
If the index finds support around 9,920-odd levels, then the market may see a bounce back. But with the markets heading into a shortened expiry week, any upside is likely to be capped at Friday’s gap high of 10,105 levels. On the downside, breaking below 9,920 levels, Nifty has next major cluster of support around 9,740 levels where August-September 2017 lows are seen; and 100% projection of the first leg of decline (11,172-10,276) from 10,632 high. The Nifty needs to cross 10,230 levels on the upside for rally to emerge in the market. On the stock-specific front, Future Retail, SRF, Zee Entertainment Ltd, Tech Mahindra are looking positive; while Vedanta, DHFL, DLF and Union Bank are looking weak."
0,2018-04-06,Zee,"Sharekhan has a buy call on Zee Entertainment Enterprises with a target price of Rs 680.

The current market price of Zee Entertainment Enterprises is Rs 582.35.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Zee Entertainment Enterprises price can reach the defined target. 

""ZEE network’s viewership share remained steady on sequential basis and increased by 220 BPS in February 2018, driven by Hindi GEC and Tamil genres. We expect overall revenue of ZEEL to grow at 15 per cent y-o-y in Q4FY2018, led by 25 per cent y-o-y growth in ad revenue and growth momentum in ad revenue will continue in FY2019. In the OTT segment, we need to take a wait-and-watch approach to evaluate its success, considering its execution, retention of subscribers and intensity of competition from global OTT players, PE-backed start-ups, broadcasters and telcos. Given lot of headroom for growth in the broadcasting business (35 per cent untapped TV penetration and average TV viewing time lower than European countries), ramp-up of its movie and music business and sustenance of profitability despite digital investments, we expect the company to deliver a healthy 18 per cent CAGR in adjusted net profit over FY2017-FY2020E.

1,2018-04-06,Zee,"BAMBOLIM: Day 2 at the 13th edition of Goafest was a mixed bag. Sessions served up a motley crew of speakers holding forth on a diverse range of subjects. The list included Sparsh Shah aka Purhythm, the 14-year-old singing prodigy, Cameron Worth, founder, SharpEnd, UK-based company specialising in Internet of Things, Bollywood actor Sidharth Malhotra, Colonel Rajyavardhan Rathore and cricketer Jonty Rhodes.

During the session with Navika Kumar, managing editor-Politics, Times Now, Olympic silver medalist and exarmy man Colonel Rathore said, “Brands are those that are reliable, credible and have continuity. They grow over time and have peers to be compared with. PM Modi is (currently) incomparable.”

With the subject of 'fake news' dominating conversations everywhere from newsrooms to social media , the minister had to spare a moment to address the issue. He told a packed room at the conclave: “No news can be stopped in today’s times. If you want to do justice to yourself, put it out first. In this day and age of information and technology, news that has to come out, will come out. It cannot be stopped by anyone.” News will make its way (to the people) and nothing can stop it, he added.

Cricket legend Jonty Rhodes also kept the audience engaged with his trademark wit. He spoke of his India connection and the many years spent during his stint with the IPL's Mumbai Indian team. He also has a personal connection: a daughter named after the country she was born in — India.

The man who was once rated as the best fielder in the world spoke of his active cricketing days, and of his ""well-developed backside"" thanks to his teacher parents who kept him grounded. His dad, a sports coach, used to tell him, “practice makes you perfect is only half the truth. It is the perfect practice that makes you perfect.”

Not to be outdone by sports and politics, Bollywood took center-stage at the fest too. Actor Sidharth Malhotra was welcomed by a cheering audience. He spoke of his relationship with brands and how the advertising and entertainment businesses are intrinsically linked, among other things.

5,2018-04-18,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity markets took a breather on Wednesday after their longest winning since streak September 2014, as PSU bank stocks reversed gains in late afternoon trade.

Market was initially looking to extend their gains for a tenth consecutive session, but fag-end selling forced the benchmark equity indices to snap their nine-day gaining streak.

As a result, the 30-share BSE Sensex closed 63.38 points, or 0.18 per cent, down at 34,331.68, whereas the 50-share NSE Nifty index settled 22.50 points, or 0.21 per cent, down at 10,526.

Abhijeet Dey, Senior Fund Manager-Equities, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund said, “Market mood for the last few days has been fairly benign. With volatility coming to the fore, no clear trend seems to be emerging for now.”

As many as 28 stocks in the Nifty index closed in the red with Hindustan Petroleum falling the most 3 per cent, followed by Axis Bank (down 2.76 per cent), Titan (down 1.98 per cent), Lupin (down 1.75 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (down 1.54 per cent).

On the other hand, ITC, Wipro, UltraTech Cements, Zee Entertainment and GAIL gained between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.

Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said, “Nifty ended down as profit booking triggered on the back of resistance at 50% retracement as it failed to breach higher resistances.”

Sectorwise, consumer durables, banking, oil & gas, healthcare, auto, IT and capital goods stocks witnessed some selling pressure, while FMCG, telecom, realty and power emerged as top gainers on the BSE.

Private sector lender IndusInd Bank and IT major Tata Consultancy Services will announce their financial results for the quarter ended March 2018 on Thursday.

6,2018-04-18,Zee,"Indian stocks consolidated on Wednesday on expected lines. The second half of the session took a volatile turn, as the Nifty fell nearly 90 points from the day’s high.

Despite some recovery attempt, the benchmark index ended the day losing 22.50 points or 0.21 per cent. The consolidation is likely to persist on Thursday as well.

The market is expected to make a quite start on Thursday. The levels of 10,570-10,590 will continue to act immediate resistance. However, looking at the F&O data, the consolidation that we are expecting is not likely to last long. Despite some volatility, the market is also likely to have limited downsides. We see the area of 10,570 and 10,610 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports will come in at 10,480 and 10,450 levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 60.83, and it remains neutral showing no divergence to the price. The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. No significant formations were seen on the candles.



Pattern analysis suggests that the Nifty resisted upper range of the broad rectangle formation. We expect this resistance area to hold and some consolidation taking place in a ranged movement on either side.

Overall, even after nine days of gain, the Nifty not registering any major loss is a sign of underlying strength. However, given the present structure of the market on the daily charts, some consolidation is very much imminent.

We expect Thursday’s session to remain rangebound. Volatility is likely to continue to persist, but downsides, if any, will remain limited.

We reiterate maintaining stock specific approach for Thursday. Volatility should be used to make select purchases, while continuing to protect profits at higher levels.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Favourable technical setup was seen in Bharti Airtel, IDFC, ZEE Entertainment, M&M Financial, Amara Raja Battaries, Greaves Cotton, Rolta India, Thomas Cook, Godrej Industries and Colgate Palmolive.

8,2018-04-23,Zee,"India’s biggest domestic institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) was on a major shopping spree on Dalal Street this March quarter, even as the broader market weakened thanks to a series on domestic as well as global headwinds.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 20 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 35 companies from the BSE500 index. The insurer had exposure to nearly 200 companies on the index.

The insurance behemoth booked a record equity profit of Rs 25,000 crore last financial year, compared with Rs 19,000 crore it had earned in financial year 2016-17.

The domestic equity market witnessed a lot of volatility in the second half of March quarter owing to a Budget proposal to tax long-term equity gains, fears of a trade war following some protectionist measures by the Trump administration, geopolitical crises and signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates more rapidly than expected. This also triggered strong FII outflows from the domestic market.

But the domestic institutional investor increased stake in a couple of companies from across sectors, including rating agencies, IT, pharma, downstream oil and gas players, housing finance, select private banks, FMCG and power companies.

Among the large caps, Coal India saw LIC stake go up to 10.30 per cent at the end of March from 9.66 per cent as of December 31, 2017. LIC also raised its holding in oil marketing company HPCL (from 2.08 per cent to 2.17 per cent), L&T (17.94 per cent to 17.96 per cent), Tech Mahindra (3.60 per cent to 3.77 per cent), UltraTech Cement (2.33 per cent to 2.41 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (3.84 per cent to 4.89 per cent).

Oil marketing companies have since come under pressure amid soaring of crude oil prices, which are currently hovering around their three-year high levels.

Infrastructure major L&T has been seeing a lot of interest from institutional investors in recent times.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recently named it as one of its preferred picks.


The public sector insurer also showed confidence in rating agencies during the quarter gone by, hiking stake in ICRA to 8.98 per cent from 7.45 per cent in December quarter. It held 5.88 per cent in Crisil as of March 31, 2018 against 5.45 per cent at the end of December quarter. ICRA shares are down 8 per cent in last one year, having slipped to Rs 3,812.50 as of April 20, 2018 from Rs 4,152 on the same day last year. Crisil is down around 0.77 per cent at Rs 1940.85 from Rs 1,955.90 that it had quoted a year ago.

LIC also showed confidence and raised stake in Castrol India, Adani Transmission, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Hindalco, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, Swan Energy, Power Grid, Oracle Financial Services, ONGC, NHPC, Mindtree, ICICI Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indraprastha Gas, Granules India and YES Bank.

Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance are up 38 per cent in last one year. The company on Friday posted a 22.6 per cent rise in net profit for March quarter to Rs 1,030 crore from Rs 841 crore reported for the same period of last year.

Hindalco has been among top buy recommendations of analysts on Dalal Street following a major spike in aluminium prices. The stock is up 40 per cent in last one year.

Brokerage Edelweiss says Alcoa’s Q1CY18 numbers and guidance reinforce the belief that LME aluminium price will stay robust in the near term as unprecedented constraints in the global supply chain post sanctions on Rusal and cut in Alunorte’s production, smelter restarts/new capacity are expected to be slower or lower in China and ensure steady growth in global aluminium demand at 4.25-5.25 per cent. Alcoa is world’s sixth largest aluminium producer.

Taking cognizance of the improved outlook, Alcoa has revised its CY18 Ebitda guidance higher by 30 per cent. 

All domestic aluminium companies — Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco — will benefit in the near term, Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

Meanwhile, LIC holdings came down in companies such as Dena Bank, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank, UCO Bank, Tata Steel, Indian Hotels and Cipla."

0,2018-05-01,Zee,"India has traditionally been a single-TV household. The entire family gets together in front of one television set to watch their favourite films or shows every evening. This makes it tough to get viewers’ attention when there are 500+ channels running 24x7, especially when the monthly subscription costs a family less than a dinner at a local restaurant. It also means that someone or other in the family is missing out on his or her favourite show.

However, the fight for the remote may soon be a thing of the past. Almost every family member has a personal screen now, thanks to the smartphone. The turf war among existing and new telecom players has ensured a digital revolution. Not surprisingly, data prices have fallen by more than 90% in the past year and a half, while bandwidth consumption has grown over 4x. This has resulted in proliferation of over-the-top (OTT) players in the market, more than 30 at last count.

“There is a lot of tailwind for digital because of increasing bandwidth and falling prices of data and smartphones,” says Ashish Bhasin, CEO, South Asia, Dentsu Aegis Network. “This is resulting in increased consumption of video on digital. Screens don’t matter to a consumer anymore. We are 18-24 months away from an inflection point when the whole interplay of screens will be seamless.”


According to a recent report on digital advertising by Dentsu Aegis Network, India has 350-400 million internet users now. By 2020, this number will be almost half a billion. Most of them will be mobile first and many will be mobile-only users, says the report. “Also, five years from now, around 2022-23, is when the reach of TV and digital will roughly be the same. That is when reach and frequency will come into play and FMCG and other big categories will start looking at the medium in a very different way,” Bhasin adds.




(Click here to view this infographic in its entirety)

Experts and analysts tracking the media and entertainment industry say digital video is becoming as mainstream as it gets and there is a fundamental behaviour change at two levels. One, in a single TV market, mobile is the new TV. Two, once a viewer gets used to the conveniences of streaming, she doesn’t want to return to a linear platform like TV.

This has made advertisers rejig their media plans to reach their target audience. They now have one more avenue in digital, which is growing at a faster clip than any other medium. To add to it, digital is expected to have a reach that will be on a par with that of television in five years. But the question is, whether or not the digital market will be matured enough to have a measurable return on an advertiser’s investment.


“We expect both TV and digital video to grow handsomely over the next 3 years,” says Rohit Dokania, senior vice-president of research at IDFC. “We estimate digital video to be ~8% of overall video advertising (TV plus digital video) in India, as of 2017 end. With more than ~35% CAGR in digital video advertising, it is expected to garner almost 25% share of incremental ad spends on video advertising in India over the next three years. By end of 2020, we believe digital video could be ~13% of overall video advertising in India.” Sensing this massive opportunity, most TV networks have started investing in their own OTT services. These include Hotstar from Star India; Voot from Viacom18; Sony Liv from Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN); Zee5 from Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE); and Sun NXT from Sun TV Network.


International players Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Viu have also entered India, which prompted local content companies such as Eros International (Eros Now), Balaji Telefilms (Alt Balaji) and The Viral Fever (TVF Play) to also launch their own apps. Telecom operators did not want to be left behind. They have also decided to offer content, leading to the creation of Jio TV, Airtel TV, Vodafone Play.

This, however, has made the OTT space hyper competitive. While the recent players are fighting hard for viewers’ attention and a meaningful scale, longestablished players such YouTube and MX Player continue to be far ahead in terms of daily users. For instance, the watch time of Hotstar, Zee5, Voot, and Sony Liv combined was 13 billion minutes in January, whereas YouTube’s alone was 164 billion minutes, according to AppAnnie, an app market data and insights company.


So the bigger challenge for advertisers, experts say, is to choose between advertising on non-premium video with scale (YouTube or Facebook) and advertising on premium video with limited reach on new OTT services. As long as brands can reach consumers, some argue, it doesn’t matter which platform is being used for advertisement, though premium brands may look at select platforms.

Ashish Pherwani, India M&E advisory leader, EY, says, “When an advertiser chooses a platform, he needs to consider brand-related aspects and quantum of reach, and allocate budget accordingly.” However, a top executive of an OTT company has another view on the reach of aggregator platforms like YouTube, given that they do not have their own content.

“Advertisers are very mindful of reach and find TV+digital a meaningful way of spending advertising dollars. In case of YouTube, one advertiser can’t exploit the reach or time spent as he will have to buy an insane number of insertions to get the kind of viewership he wants. Until and unless there is a big product change, there is not much scope.”


Times Internet, a sister concern of ET, reportedly acquired MX Player, one of the largest video applications for smartphones. It has plans to build a premium OTT offering using this platform. MX Player reaches 52 million viewers a day, as per AppAnnie, only behind YouTube. Digital video advertising is just starting, experts say, and a rising tide will lift all ships. But as the market grows and matures, advertisers will become more selective. They will choose the avenue that gives the largest return on investment.

Ultimately, buying media is a combination of reach and attention. YouTube has reach but its content is mostly of snacking variety and thus attracts low attention. On the other hand, players such as Hotstar, Voot, Alt Balaji may not have a wider reach, but they can boast of more stickiness.

“Right now, advertisers are looking at reach. But, ultimately, the parameters will be content, time spent and brand safety. No brand will want their advertisement next to the wrong kind of content. So clients will be looking beyond the media matrix. They will be looking more closely at the return on investment,” says a senior media planner."

19,2018-05-02,Zee,"Mumbai: India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market Index is likely to fall 20 basis points as a result of inclusion of China A-shares, which would entail total outflows of around $540 million by passive funds, said Morgan Stanley in a report.

The MSCI will announce the results of its semi-annual index review on the morning of May 15 and the changes will be effective from June 1.

“Qualified A-share stocks will be included in the MSCI EM index starting in May with an inclusion factor of 2.5% applied to their free-float market cap. By August 2018, the inclusion factor will be increased to 5%... Subsequently, ceteris paribus, India’s weight in EM would likely fall by approximately 20bp (basis points) by August, implying total outflows of around US$540mn (million) by passive funds,” said Morgan Stanley’s Sheela Rathi and Ridham Desai in a report.

In June 2017, MSCI had announced that beginning June 2018, China A-shares will be included in MSCI EM and MSCI ACWI index. India’s weightage in MSCI EM index is 8.5% currently.

In specific stock inclusions, the firm said Pidilite Industries and Power Grid Corporation of India are high-conviction stocks that can be included in the MSCI India index. UltraTech Cement and Container Corporation of India could see an increase in their weightage in the index, which could lead to potential inflows of $49 million and $40 million respectively.

Avenue Supermarts, Future Retail, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are also potential candidates for inclusion in the index but the conviction for addition of these stocks is less due to lower free float market capitalisation, said Morgan Stanley.

Tata Motors Differential Voting Rights and Vakrangee could be excluded from the index, said Morgan Stanley.

Sectoral classification changes are also likely. MSCI had announced in November 2017 that the telecommunication services sector will be broadened and renamed as communication services to include companies that facilitate communication and offer related content and information through various media.

Apart from the classification of telecoms sector stocks Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel into the communications sector, media stocks like Zee Entertainment would be reclassified into the MSCI India Communications sector from the consumer discretionary sector currently, the report stated."

23,2018-05-06,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market ended on a negative note last week, thus posting its first weekly loss in six weeks. Subdued global cues and heavy selling in IT and pharma stocks weighed on investor sentiment.

The S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.15 per cent lower for the week at 34,915, while the NSE Nifty settled at 10,618, down 0.69 per cent.

Here's a list of seven developments that may move the market in the coming week:


Next batch of earningsAmong notable names, ICICI Bank, Tata Chemicals and Tata Coffee are slated to announce January-March results on Monday, while ABB India and Jubilant FoodWorks will unveil their score cards on Tuesday. Eicher Motors and JSPL are scheduled to announce results on Wednesday.

Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Tata Communications, Titan Company, Union Bank of India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises will release their quarterly numbers on Thursday. Gillette India and Tata Global Beverages will announce January-March numbers on Friday.


Karnataka pollsThe Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections 2018 is scheduled to be held across the state on May 12. Results of the poll will be out on May 15. Leading parties, the ruling Congress and the BJP, have been campaigning aggressively in the state for the last few months to woo voters. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will be fighting against BJP's BS Yeddyurappa for the CM's post in the upcoming polls. Market will keenly follow the developments from the state.


US jobs dataUS job growth increased less-than-expected in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17.5-year low of 3.9 per cent, as some out-of-work Americans left the labour force, Reuters reported.

The report also showed wages barely rose last month, which may ease concerns that inflation pressures are rapidly building up, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening. Financial markets across the globe, including India may react to it when trading resumes on Monday.


All eyes on US sanctions against IranOil prices rose about 2 per cent on Friday, with US crude hitting its highest in more than three years, as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported. On May 12, the US President Donald Trump will decide whether to extend waivers on economic sanctions against Iran. If it doesn’t, the global market could lose about one million barrels of oil a day, says a Market Watch report.

The sanctions on Iran were lifted under a 2015 agreement among a group of world powers, including the US and Iran, aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear activities.


Tech ViewThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a ‘Dark Cloud Cover’ pattern on daily chart, suggesting possible downside ahead. The pattern may have negative repercussions, which will be confirmed if the Nifty50 closes below the 10,600 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

However, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan has a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target 10,910 and reversal placed at 10,500. ""The short term trend will remain bullish as long as it does not close below 10,500. On the way up, 10,708 – 10,785 will be crucial resistance in the near term. The rise in the benchmark index can stretch towards 10,910, if it breaks the crucial resistance level of 10,785,"" Ratnaparkhi said.


Macro numbersThe government will release industrial production data for March on Friday. India's industrial output grew 7.1 per cent in February from a year earlier. This apart, the government will also unveil inflation data based on consumer price index (CPI) for April. Retail inflation stood at 4.28 per cent in March, slowing for the third straight month from a 17-month high, according to data released by the Central Statistics Office.


Global cuesThe big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England’s May 10 meeting, with market expectations overwhelmingly in favour of interest rates being held at the current 0.5 per cent. Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90 per cent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points, Reuters reported.

In addition, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) monetary policy meeting minutes will be unveiled on Monday, 7 May 2018."

38,2018-05-11,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: The March 2018 quarter performance of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, one of India’s leading media and entertainment companies, has been a mixed bag. On the revenues front, the company’s performance (at Rs 1,724 crore excluding other income) has been slightly above Bloomberg’s analysts’ consensus of Rs 1,699 crore, while the net profit at Rs 230 crore has been below the expectations of Rs 260 crore.

In the quarter under review, the company’s advertising revenues grew year-on-year by 24 per cent to Rs 1,050 crore, while its subscription revenues fell by 2 per cent to Rs 546 crore. But sequentially, the company managed its operating costs well: the operating costs as a percentage of the total income fell by 2 per cent to 38 per cent in the quarter.

A key highlight of the quarter is the company’s continued strong performance in regional markets. Its Marathi channel, Zee Marathi, continues to maintain its leadership position, while Kannada and Bengali channels are close to the leaders in their respective regions. The company’s channels have an all-India viewership share of 18 per cent, and in the general entertainment category, it is a dominant player with 18.5 per cent market share.

In the coming quarters, an important thing investors need to bear in mind is how the company’s over-thetop (OTT) offering Zee5 fares with respect to its peers in the industry. Zee5, which has more than 100,000 hours of content, was launched in the March 2018 quarter. The company will share Zee5’s monthly active users from September 2018 quarter, which will give an idea of how its OTT offering is faring.

On the valuation front, considering FY19’s earnings, the company is trading at price-to-earnings multiple of 32. This is at 6 per cent premium to its five-year long-term average of price to earnings multiple. The valuation looks reasonable considering earnings’ growth of more than 15 per cent in the next two fiscals."

37,2018-05-11,Zee,"Speaking to ET Now, Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL, says why Trent and Shopper’s Stop are two of his favourite retail bets.Edited excerpts: 


In light of the Walmart-Flipkart $16-billion deal, where do you think the Indian retail space is headed? Is there merit in further buying into an Avenue Supermart or a Trent or some of the Future Group stocks which are holding out just very well of late?
Sure. Some companies like Avenue are trading at quite a high multiple. A reasonable choice for us would be something like a Trent where the multiple is a bit decent compared to Avenue Supermart. 

Going forward, growth is quite stable and has been quite consistent relative to other companies. In case of Future, a lot of things have been built on future expectations going forward based on the track record of the company in last one and a half-two years. During this period, they have done pretty well.

Within the sector, I would rather go for a Trent and Shoppers’ Stop which had a deal with Amazon and where a restructuring is taking place, 


Clearly the street is taking this with open arms right now but was it a wise decision for the board to pick the Munjal-Burman bid, considering they do not really have the technical knowhow of running a hospital and it does require a fair amount of expertise?
Part of their decision probably would be related to how much cash is being put upfront by each of the bidders. There were some board members who have dissented especially the new ones which have joined the board. So I think, this is still far from over. There is no promoter in the company right now and you could also see people making direct offers to shareholders also.

It can prolong a bit going forward as well. Having said that, there is some value in the company though over last six-seven years, the company’s profitability never increased. But they have created a large amount of assets. With the spend on healthcare increasing following government came up with plan for universal medical coverage, interest in healthcare has increased. 

Fortis being one of the few large players in the market, we are seeing this kind of interest. From a shareholder perspective, one should continue with owning these stocks because there may be some more action and things are likely to even become more aggressive going forward.


There have been a lot of result reaction -- whether it is Titan or Zee Entertainment. I am particularly intrigued by Zee Entertainment because they have been an outlier in markets in terms of the ad revenue growth that they have shown. They have been able to create a fair amount of stickiness, drawing in revenues at a time when the industry at large is still going through a transition. Of course, revenues have picked up a broadcast but they have done better than the market, better than the sector as a whole.
Zee continues to be a decent pick within the media space. There has been an increase in spend because of the launch of ZEE5 and going forward, we are going to see an increased focus on original play with them entering the Kerala market as well as focussing on the online digital property, especially on Hindi. 

The only hindrance that Zee has is currently there is not too much on the sports side but looking at the overall picture and how strong Zee is on the content side, there is money to be made in this particular stock. The results are quite decent which have come yesterday and so we are quite bullish on Zee going forward."

 A likely pro-rural stance by various state governments and the central government could work in favour of the consumption theme, brokerages said. 

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which on Tuesday emerged as the single largest party in the Karnataka election, was called on Wednesday evening by the Governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala to form the government. 

BS Yeddyurappa will take oath as chief minister on Thursday.

Indian markets were also pressured by weakness in Asian markets after North Korea threatened to pull out of the upcoming summit with the US although Indian indices managed to recover some losses and end off day’s lows of nearly 1 per cent.


CLSA
India's macro situation is likely to remain under pressure as the focus on various central and state governments turn more pro-rural going forward, said Hong Kong-headquartered CLSA. Because of the adverse macro and continued earnings downgrades, the firm believes the risk-reward in the Indian stock market is unfavourable though benchmark indices are within touching distance of all-time high levels. The brokerage has increased weightage on consumption theme in its model portfolio given the likely pro-consumption stance of the government. CLSA has added Zee Entertainment and Dr Lal PathLabs to its model portfolio, and deleted SBI.


Kotak Institutional Equities
A six-month hiatus in India’s election schedule will lead to the market attention increasingly shifting towards weakening macro and earnings, said Kotak Institutional Equities. India may witness weaker macro in calendar year 2018 and financial year 2018-19 due to likely higher inflation/interest rates and a possibly higher current account deficit/ weaker currency. The brokerage is confident of a recovery in earnings. However, India’s worsening macro is reflected in rising bond yields, which is quite discomforting when market and consumption stocks are trading at high valuations, said Kotak.


Nomura
The photo finish Karnataka poll result should reduce the possibility of an early general election. In terms of policies, the impact could be felt in the BJP focusing on lifting rural income and alleviating farm distress because of coming elections in three agrarian states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh — and the 2019 general election, said Nomura. Risks from rising oil prices and expectation that political uncertainty will rise again as the 2019 elections approach still suggest caution on the macro front, it said. If the BJP is able to form a government in Karnataka, it would raise expectations of BJP-led governments in the three states going to polls later this year, it added.


UBS
The market has priced in the return of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power in the 2019 general election, but opposition alliances will be a key element, said UBS. Stocks with exposure to rural areas will continue to do well irrespective of whether the policy tilt towards rural or agri sectors is real or just rhetoric, the report added. Hero MotoCorp, Shriram Transport and Ujjivan Financial are among UBS’ preferred rural beneficiary stocks. The firm continues to expect cuts to consensus Nifty earnings estimates. UBS, which has base case Nifty target of 10,500 by December, said riskreward in the market is not attractive."

64,2018-05-24,Zee,"NEW DELHI: It's a sweet and sour feeling the way March quarter earnings have panned out so far.

The short point is there were only a few positive surprises as the season enters its last lap. And the numbers at best are in line with market expectations. 

A few consumption-driven sectors continued with their recent volume-driven growth. But red flags are going up. Rising raw material costs could play a spoilsport for some of them, going ahead. PSU banks with record losses disappointed the most. 

Combined sales of 1,040-odd companies -- apart from PSU and private banks -- climbed 14.9 per cent while their net profit surged 37 per cent on a low base last year. The March quarter of 2017 turned out to be painful for India Inc because of the cash ban announced in November 2016.

Top line rose to Rs 11,55,547 crore compared with Rs 10,05,488 crore in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line for the universe swelled to Rs 1,06,437 crore from Rs 77,801 a year earlier. 

On a sequential basis, sales for these companies went up 7.62 per cent. Profit advanced 4.14 per cent, Capitaline data showed, as compiled by ETMarkets.com.

Banks, especially PSU ones, made jaw-dropping NPA provisions during the March quarter. The result: as many as 14 banks reeled under losses amounting to Rs 46,593 crore. This includes PNB's record loss of Rs 13,416.90 crore. SBI (Rs 7,542 crore), Canara Bank (Rs 4,860 crore) and Allahabad bank (Rs 3,510 crore) suffered huge losses too. 

To give you a perspective, these 14 PSU lenders had reported Rs 4,338 crore loss in the year-ago quarter. If private and public lenders are taken into account, the 1,070 firms reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 71,072 crore for January-March.

""So far, the earnings season has been on expected lines. The upgrades and downgrades are by and large equal to each other following which the earnings estimate for the next year has only been marginally cut by about a per cent,"" said Neelotpal Sahai of HSBC Asset Management India.

From the Nifty bloc, Eicher Motors, Asian Paints, SBI, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Vedanta, HCL Tech, Wipro, Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel fell short of profit estimates. Others such as Bajaj Auto, UltraTech Cement, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Lupin, Zee Entertainment, Hindalco, Tata Steel and Yes Bank came out on top.

""Consumer-oriented sectors from paints to consumer staples delivered not only good results, but very strong commentary on revenue and margin expansion. In some ways, that bullish guidance actually surprised me because I felt that commodity price spike would make them a little more circumspect about margins. Both consumer discretionary and staples are doing fine. Energy companies too performed well,"" Manishi Raychaudhuri of BNP Paribas told ET Now.

For the FMCG sector, what worked is the revival in rural growth, which has beaten the figure for urban areas for three quarters now. 

Metal companies have been putting up a strong earnings show, buoyed by a pick-up in metal prices. This partly hurt outlook for automakers though, which points to further impact of raw material inflation in H1 FY19. They may partially try to offset it by passing on the cost to consumers, said Motilal Oswal Securities. 

The squeeze was on the telecom sector, which saw ARPU downtrading due to renewed competition. That means Ebitda margin for the telcos may remain under pressure, going forward.

""Earning have been mixed bag so for, with IT , Cement , FMCG, Metal, Select private sector banks performing better on revenue, margin and net profit parameters. Some of the high frequency economic data-points such cement production, air traffic growth, petrol/diesel consumption, automobile sales among others, suggest a strong recovery in the economy. Revival in urban demand along with good monsoon led recovery in rural demand would augur well for the economy and corporate earnings,"" said Hemang Jani of Sharekhan. 

For the IT sector, FY19 should see an improvement on a low FY18 base, but the outlook is not exactly euphoric, the brokerage noted. According to Raychaudhuri, the currency depreciation has been a tailwind for software firms.

""In oil and gas space, refining margins have been good. Marketing margins have also been good after a tepid Q3 FY18. Outlook remains uncertain in light of high oil prices, a depreciating rupee, unwillingness of the government to cut excise duties on auto fuels, and the upcoming elections,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said.

Results of cement companies came in above expectations, led by lower-than-expected price decline and a better cost curve. The impact of higher petcoke and diesel prices was mitigated by better operating leverage and other cost efficiency measures, the brokerage added.

Jani said that the outlook for cement sector remains neutral as players across regions except eastern markets will continue to experience pricing pressure.""Moreover high Fuel expenses & logistics cost will keep margins under pressure,"" he said. 

So, where does that leave us with? The market will continue to be more truncated in favour of companies that can grow with earnings visibility, said Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global Financial Services.

""A rise in crude prices which can put pressure on margins due to higher Input costs. It could havesome growth and revenue repurcusion for FMCG, Cement , automobile sector. A rise in metal prices can be dampaner for construction & automotive industry & electrical component industry. Most of the Managements have shown concern regarding higher commodity prices . However, they said they will take price hike if required to pass on the higher RM cost. But we believe price hike might be challenging,"" Jani said."

0,2018-06-01,Zee,"Mumbai: The Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group has raised Rs 1,400 crore by listing of UK-based gaming company Codemasters on AIM on the London Stock Exchange. 

The company said that listing of Codemasters is a part of Reliance Capital’s overall deleveraging strategy.

“I am delighted with the successful outcome of the Codemasters offering in the international markets. This is a classic example of value creation as my grandfather, Dhirubhai Ambani, taught us all, namely, generating extraordinary returns by deploying minimal amounts of capital,” Anmol Ambani, Exeutive Director, Reliance Capital, said in a statement.

Reliance Group has monetised approximatley 60% stake in Codemasters, and will continue holding 29 per cent post this offering.

""Reliance has received net proceeds of Rs 1,400 crore from the offering, realising substantial capital gains and its residual 29% stake in Codemasters is worth another Rs 1,000 crore at the current market prices,"" the Group said.

The shares were offered at a price of 200 pence, and are now trading at a price of 260 pence, reflecting an immediate premium of 30 per cent to the IPO price.

Reliance ADA Group has been selling media and entertainment investments in order to bring down Reliance Capital's overall debt and focus on core businesses.

It has already sold cinema chain Big Cinemas to Carnival Group and radio and TV business under Reliance Broadcast Network to Zee Entertainment Enterprises."
1,2018-06-02,Zee,"MUMBAI: Rising political risk is going to be headwind for the Indian equity markets as next year’s general election draws nears, according to leading brokerages.

Opposition parties emerged victorious in 11 out of the 14 Lok Sabha and Assembly by-polls. The Bharatiya Janata Party lost the important Kairana parliamentary seat in Uttar Pradesh.

CLSA said a united Opposition continues to increase political uncertainty in India. “A clean sweep (it won 73 of 80 seats) in the state in the 2014 elections was the key reason why the BJP was able to obtain to a simple majority of 282 in Parliament. The prospects of a repeat performance in UP are dipping as the Opposition is uniting,” said CLSA.

“…the joint Opposition wins are likely to embolden the formation of the same elsewhere as well and will be a key challenge for the BJP,” the Hong Kong-headquartered firm said.

In Karnataka, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) came together after the polls to form the government even as the BJP emerged the single largest party.

Nomura said that the by-poll results will not affect the existing power structure at the Centre or in the states, but they do underline the effective tactic being increasingly adopted to consolidate into successful non-BJP fronts for electoral gains. The firm said it expects a similar result in the 2019 general election led by the Indian National Congress.

“We expect political uncertainty to remain elevated in the runup to the election. Due to the heavy election calendar, we expect the government to focus on farmers and the ‘common man’ via higher minimum support prices, farm loan waivers (in specific states), social sector spending and the universal healthcare programme,” said Nomura.

CLSA, which also believes that the focus of the government will be on pro-poor policies going ahead, said rural and consumptionrelated stocks should do well.

CLSA’s top consumption picks include Mahindra & Mahindra, ITC, Emami, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, GSK Consumer, DB Corp, Zee Entertainment, Housing Development Finance Corp and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company.

Elections in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram later this year will be the next important political events, said analysts."
2,2018-06-04,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Volatility was the only constant in the domestic equity market during the week gone by, but thankfully both the indices ended higher for the week. The 30-share Sensex gained 0.86 per cent while the 50-share Nifty added 0.85 per cent.

While easing oil prices and good growth vibes in the economy took the Sensex 416 points higher, global issues such as political turmoil in Italy and renewed trade war fears kept investors on the tenterhooks.

Going into a new week, investors will be keenly watching the progress of monsoon and the outcome of RBI's second bimonthly policy review. Besides any change in policy rates, RBI’s inflation projection and growth outlook will influence investor behaviour, said Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities.

He said Nifty has resistance around 10,900 level, which is also the previous top, and a strong support at 10,500. Chances are high that these levels will be tested going forward. 

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver good gains over the next three weeks.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Power Finance Corporation | BUY | Target Price: Rs 91 | Stop loss: Rs 77

This counter appears to have formed a bottom at the recent low of Rs 71, as it registered a reversal formation on huge volumes. After a brief rally, which was followed by consolidation for a couple of days, it appears to have resumed its upward move. In that scenario, it can be expected to test its immediate top of Rs 90. Hence, traders should buy into this counter with a stop below Rs 77 on closing basis for a target of Rs 91.


Zee Entertainment | BUY | Target Price: Rs 590 | Stop loss: Rs 540

This counter appears to be trading in a broader range between Rs 600 and Rs 545. As it has approached the lower-end of the trading range once again, it is attracting some buying interest around the Rs 545 mark. Hence, positional traders should make use of this opportunity to go long for a target of Rs 590 with a stop loss of Rs 540.


Hindalco | BUY | Target Price: Rs 265 | Stop loss: Rs 226

This counter appears to be consolidating in a 25-point range for the past couple of weeks. It can be on the verge of a breakout as the magnitude of intraday price range is increasing on rallies from lower-end of consolidation range. Hence, in anticipation of such a breakout, traders can create long positions with a stop below Rs 226 on closing basis. Once it manages a sustainable breakout above Rs 248 levels, then it can initially target Rs 265.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher


Cholamandalam Finance | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,740 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,460

This stock has formed a higher bottom on the daily chart, taking support at Rs 1,465 and has regained strength currently by moving past the significant 50-DMA level and also the 34-WMA and we anticipate further more upward movement in the coming days.

The stock prices have witnessed a broad-based buying, as per the positive sequence of higher tops and bottoms.

Volume is supporting an upside breakout, and weekly momentum oscillator like RSI is showing positive indication. One may look to buy at Friday's CMP (Rs 1,163.90) and add more on dips up to Rs 1,125, and hold for the upside target of Rs 1250, over the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 1105.


Hero MotoCorp | BUY | Target Price: Rs 3,950 | Stop loss: Rs 3,425

 This two-wheeler automobile stock was in a downtrend over the last 7-8 weeks, before showing a bottom reversal recently.

We observe a formation of an important bottom reversal pattern as per weekly timeframe. Volume is supporting an upside bounce and the momentum oscillator is signalling a trend revival. Buying can be initiated in Hero MotoCorp at Friday's CMP (Rs 3,622), and add more on dips down to Rs 3500, and hold for the upside target of Rs 3,950 for the next 3-4 weeks.

Maruti Suzuki India| BUY | Target Price: Rs 9,250 | Stop loss: Rs 8,620

After testing the high of Rs 9,966 at the end of 2017, the stock has seen a corrective decline and formed subsequent lower tops. Recently, it tested the low of Rs 8,255 and, since then, it has attempted to form a base and pull up. At Friday’s close, the stock took support at its 200-DMA and has moved up. RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high and is seen inching higher, forming higher bottoms. It also shows a bullish divergence against the price. The daily MACD remains in continuing buy mode. A strong bullish candle has emerged. It is significant as it has emerged near the 200-DMA support area. A buy signal has emerged on the weekly chart, showing a bullish divergence against price.


Godrej Consumer Products | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,230 | Stop loss: Rs 1,110

This stock is attempting to break out of a large ascending triangle formation. After peaking out at Rs 1,119, the stock has headed nowhere, even as it faced resistance at this level and formed a couple of higher tops and bottoms. The weekly RSI is seen breaking out of a formation and has marked a fresh 14-period high. The weekly MACD, too, has reported a positive crossover in a bullish indication. The On-Balance Volume or OBV has reported a fresh high as well. Prices have closed above the upper Bollinger band on both weekly and daily charts. A temporary pullback inside the band cannot be ruled out but subsequently, a breakout is possible.

The current market price of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. is Rs 550.7 Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. price can reach defined target. 
 Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., incorporated in 1982, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 52739.03 crore.


Investment rationale by ICICI Securities
Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) is currently witnessing the best of times in its content performance with market share gains across channels. The company over the last 4-5 years has aggressively invested in its portfolio of channels with emphasis on regional markets. Also, post the company divesting out of sport channels, its investment in movies and GEC content has risen and is showing up in improved market share. ZEEL’s investment in content is visible in the sharp increase in inventory by Rs9.4bn, impacting cashflows in FY18. The market share gains should mean ZEEL will be able to outperform industry ad revenue growth assuming the market share sustain at current levels. Also, the company is expected to spruce up its ZEE5 - OTT offering with significant original programming launches in the next two months, which should help us in appreciating the potential of Subscription Video on Demand (SVoD). With the recent decline in share price, we see the risk-reward favourable. Upgrade to BUY with a revised target price of Rs638 (30x FY20 EPS) from Rs620 earlier."

22,2018-06-11,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The bulls were a happy lot last week, as they finally managed to sign off on a high. It was the third straight week when the benchmark indices ended with gains. 

A surprisingly positive outcome from RBI’s policy review and easing of crude oil prices helped lift the mood on Dalal Street. However, a weakening rupee and volatility in oil prices may keep the market on the consolidation path, said Vinod Nair, Geojit Financial Services.

On Friday, the S&P BSE Sensex closed 19.41 points down at 35,443, while NSE’s Nifty50 ended 0.70 points lower at 10,767. Out of the 50 Nifty constituents, 24 closed in the green and 26 in the red. On a weekly basis, the 30-share pack of BSE gained 0.61 per cent while the 50-share Nifty added 0.66 per cent.

Good monsoon progress and a positive outlook for the rural market are giving a boost to the economy, which is already showing signs of improvement. The risk of earnings downgrade for FY19 and weak fourth quarter numbers will test investor sentiment, Nair said.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 12 stock strategies that can potentially deliver good gains over the next three weeks.


Vikas Jain - Senior Technical Analyst, Reliance Securities

HCL Technologies | BUY| Target Price: Rs 1,000| Stop loss: Rs 880
This stock has formed a strong base around its 50 per cent Fibonacci Retracement level of the prior upmove. Later, despite high volatility, the stock rose to a four-week closing high. The RSI reversed from its sub-Rs 45 level for a straight fourth time in this rally, signalling strength in the stock. A bullish crossover in the Stochastic around its oversold zone is indicating limited downside (if any).


Century Textiles | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,060-Rs 1,100 | Stop loss: Rs 880
This stock has formed a bullish reversal pattern (i.e. Piercing Line Pattern) around the 50 per cent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior upmove, signalling a near-term turnaround. The reversal in the key technical indicators – RSI and Stochastic from their oversold zone are also coinciding with our view. Though the short-term trend is negative in the stock, at least a corrective bounce back cannot be ruled out.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, Gemstone Equity Research

Bajaj Holdings & Investment | BUY | Target Price: Rs 3,050 | Stop loss: Rs 2,800
This stock tested its highs in the Rs 3,000- 3,025 range in September 2017. Since then, it has been trading in a broad range and has not made any significant move. Currently, it remains in a large not-so-classical symmetrical triangle formation and looks to make an upmove. The daily MACD has reported a positive crossover and it is bullish while trading above its signal line. The weekly MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The RSI is seen marking higher bottoms and has shown a 14-period high which is bullish. OBV — On Balance Volume on the weekly chart also trades with a fresh high which is bullish. Prices on the weekly charts have closed above the upper Bollinger band, which indicates a likely breakout going ahead.


Zee Entertainment Enterprises | BUY | Target Price: Rs 580 | Stop loss: Rs 545
This stock has not seen any significant rise after peaking out in the Rs 605-620 zone in early 2018. Since then, the stock has remained in a broad range and in a mild corrective decline. Few signals have emerged which point towards likely resumption of upmove. An Engulfing Bullish Candle has occurred. This shows likely reversal of the trend as it has occurred after a decline. A long lower shadow on the weekly charts, too, shows the likelihood of a potential technical pullback. A buy signal over Stochastic has emerged on the Weekly Charts with a bullish divergence against the price.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher

Ambuja Cements | BUY | Target Price: Rs 225 | Stop loss: Rs 195
In last one month, this stock has witnessed much erosion from the peak of Rs 252 to bottom out at around Rs 200 level and has now indicated a pullback recovery with strength and potential anticipated to give a further rise in the coming days. Indicators like the RSI have been hovering around the highly oversold zone and have shown a trend reversal to signal a buy and maintain a positive bias. With rising volume participation in recent days and with favourable indicators supporting our view, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 225 keeping a stop loss of Rs 195.


JK Tyre & Industries | BUY | Target Price: Rs 140 | Stop loss: Rs 117
The stock witnessed decent value erosion in last two months from its peak of Rs 170 to bottom out at around Rs 120 level. Currently, it has indicated a revival and is poised for an upmove. The RSI has hit the highly oversold zone and has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy and the chart looks attractive maintaining a positive bias with strength and potential to rise further in the coming days. With decent volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 140 keeping a stop loss of Rs 117.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Rain Industries | BUY | Target Price: Rs 249 | Stop loss: Rs 190
This counter appears to have bottomed out at a recent low of Rs 190, after retracing almost 80 per cent of the last leg of the rally from the lows of Rs 105-475, as it registered a bullish engulfing formation on daily charts with relatively much higher volumes. As it added around 15 per cent from said lows of Rs 190 in last two sessions, traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding on declines between Rs 215-211 for a target of Rs 249. Stop suggested for the trade is Rs 190.


Granules India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 92 | Stop loss: Rs 70
There seems to be secular upmove in the pharma sector on the back of improved sentiment from deeply oversold levels. With three positive closes in a row and Hammer formation on weekly charts, this counter appears to be ready for a pullback rally in which it can be expected to test its 50-day EMA, whose value is placed around the Rs 94 level. Hence, traders are advised to buy into this counter with a stop of Rs 70 for a target of Rs 92.


Gajendra Prabhu, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Lupin | BUY | Target Price: Rs 900 | Stop loss: Rs 760
This stock has formed a strong bull candle on both daily and weekly chart which indicates the bullish momentum. The price has started a new rising leg, post throwback fall which ended at Rs 745 and in smaller degree higher top and higher bottom formation is developing. Price is in the internals of “wave iii” so dynamic upmove is expected in coming days. In addition, the price is placed well above the key moving averages of 21- & 50-day EMAs; this could add strength to bulls. So, traders may look to buy the stock at Friday's CMP (Rs 808.40) and add in dips to Rs 775 for the upside target of Rs 900 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 760 (Closing basis). 


VIP Industries | BUY | Target Price: Rs 485 | Stop loss: Rs 400 
This stock has witnessed a new lifetime high and is in progress of extending the current rising leg. On the daily chart, inverted Head & Shoulder pattern breakout has been witnessed which is a bullish development. Price is in the internals of “wave v” so there is more room on the upside. In addition, the price has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms which is a bullish continuation structure. So, traders may look to buy the stock at Friday's CMP (Rs 430) and add in dips to Rs 415 for the upside target of Rs 485 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 400 (Closing basis).


Kapil Shah – Technical Analyst, Emkay Global Financial Services

Insecticides (India) | BUY | Target Price: Rs 775 | Stop loss: Rs 690
The stock is in intermediate correction mode and it had found its feet around its previous reversal areas. Thereafter, it has shown sign of improvement which indicates a bullish reversal.


Ajmera Realty & Infra India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 238 | Stop loss: Rs 207

24,2018-06-11,Zee,"In our previous note, we had said that the zones of 10,820-10,850 may provide stiff resistance. On the analysed lines, the Nifty opened positive, saw short covering during the day, posted day’s high at 10,850.55 and saw itself paring much of its intraday gains.

 The NSE benchmark Nifty ended with a gain of 19.30 points or 0.18 per cent, coming off nearly 65 points from day’s high.

 As we enter Tuesday’s session, expect the zones of 10,820-10,850 continuing to offer stiff resistance. A quiet start is likely, but unless the levels of 10,850 are breached on the upside, Nifty will continue to remain vulnerable to corrective actions at higher levels. Tuesday will see the levels of 10,820 and 10,850 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,745 and 10,710 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the Daily Chart is 59.3566. It has marked a fresh 14-period high which is bullish. It does not show any divergence against the price. The Daily MACD is bullish as it trades above its signal line. On the Candles, a Shooting Star emerged. This formation is significant in the present scenario as it has occurred after an up move and near a pattern resistance area. This can potentially throw the market into some consolidation or minor corrective move once again.

 Pattern analysis shows that Nifty resisted precisely at the falling trend line resistance area. This trend line is formed by joining each subsequent falling tops after 10,179 mark. 

 Overall, Tuesday’s trade may not see any runaway upmove. Unless the level of 10,850 is breached on the upside, we will see each up move getting stalled in the 10,820-10,850 zones. We continue to recommend making fresh purchases at lower levels with and make use of each corrective move, however, it would be critical to remain highly stock and sector specific in the approach.

 Also, on the other hand, while adopting a cautious view on the market profits should be guarded at higher levels.

 STOCKS TO WATCH: Relatively better technical set up is observed in stocks such as NCC, Orient Paper, Triveni, Jindal Stainless, Dalmia Bharat, PI Industries, HDIL, Zee Entertainment, TV18 Broadcast and Tech Mahindra.

25,2018-06-12,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The Nifty50 once again failed to hold on to the 10,800 level on Monday, thus indicating how strong the bears are around this level. However, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed upward crossovers for 134 stocks on NSE.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were PC Jeweller, Suzlon Energy, Jai Corp, HDIL, NCC, IFCI, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Aurobindo Pharma.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included Motherson Sumi Systems, Zee Entertainment, Walchandnagar, Havells India, Manappuram Finance, Apollo Tyres, Jindal Saw, Network18 Media, ITI and Genus Power Infrastructure. 

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement, and vice versa. 



The MACD alone may not be sufficient signal to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

Retail investors should consult financial experts before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators. 

The MACD charts also signalled bearish crossovers for 14 stocks on NSE, indicating ‘sell’ signals. They included Bhushan Steel, Fortis Healthcare, Tata Chemicals, Omaxe, Future Lifestyle, Swan Energy, Future Supply Chains and Adhunik Metaliks, among others. 



On Monday, the Nifty50 index rose 19.30 points, or 0.18 per cent, to close at 10,786. A strong selloff from the day’s high of 10,850 wiped off most of the gains that it had logged in intraday trade. This resulted in the formation of a small real body on the daily chart, with a long upper shadow that resembled a ‘Gravestone Doji’ pattern. The formation signalled possibility of a short-term trend reversal.

The index needs to protect the 10,777 level, else selling may push it lower towards the 10,709 level, marking a significant near-term top at 10,850, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. He advised investors to stay neutral and avoid longside bets for the time being.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the chart of Apollo Tyres shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum and vice versa. 

Shares of the company closed 0.18 per cent lower at Rs 275.15 on June 11."

“The entire proceeds from the stake sale would be used to reduce Reliance Capital’s debt by approximately Rs 1,900 crore upon final completion of stake sale transactions,” Reliance Capital had stated.

And while the transaction was expected to be completed in one year, it kept getting delayed because of government approvals. In the latest development, ET has learned that the deal might even be called off as Zee is renegotiating the price.

“It is not off the table yet. We will know by end of this week,” a source in Zee Group said confirming the company is renegotiating.

Another person in the know said that RBN is currently shelling out about Rs 30 crore per month on paying salaries. “There is a perception that this is one of the factors why the sellers may be under pressure to hive off the business,” he said.

A Zee spokesperson replied to ET saying, “The deal with Reliance Broadcast Network has not been called off. We are awaiting the required set of regulatory approvals from the concerned authorities, to take the same forward.” A Reliance spokesperson said the deal was awaiting I&B ministry approvals.

The deal was structured in two parts. While the two television channels – Big Magic and Big Ganga – were to be acquired by Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Zee Media Corp, which houses the news channels of the group, was to initially take 49% stake in RBN’s Big FM. ZEE had the option to buy the remaining 51% stake in the radio business after a 3-year lock-in period as per ministry guidelines. The lock-in period for the then operational 45 stations expired on March 31 this year, while 14 new licences will end in March 2020."

36,2018-06-19,Zee,"Value investing seldom loses its relevance in equity markets. In fact, it becomes even more useful in uncertain markets. A key reason behind this is that value investing as a method helps investors deal with high levels of volatility as it captures the intrinsic value of a stock with respect to its historical valuations. Value investing gives more importance to long-term fundamentals of a company and provides an understanding of whether a stock is undervalued. Therefore, it is important to look at schemes that follow value investing across market capitalisations and have done well in the long term. One such scheme is ICICI Pru Value Discovery Fund.

The scheme focuses on companies which show promise of growth and at the same time are attractive in terms of relative valuation. The scheme focuses on companies, which not only look attractive from growth potential, but also from the point of view of financial ratios, such as price-to-book value and relative market capitalisation. The scheme has consistently followed this style of investing and has justly rewarded investors by recording commendable performance especially in the long term. In the past five- and 10-year periods, the scheme has delivered 22.7 per cent and 18.7 per cent, respectively, while its category (largecap) has given 15.8 per cent and 10.9 per cent returns during the same periods.

In the past six months, the scheme has invested in an interesting mix of companies including those from media, IT and pharma sectors. A few prominent names are Zee Entertainment Enterprises and TCS.


ET Bureau

Expert Take: Harshavardhan Roongta, CFP, Roongta Securities
This is a multicap fund that invests in companies available at a fair or below-intrinsic value (with respect to their price-to-book ratio). In the current liquidity-driven market, it is paramount that momentum stocks with expensive valuations are avoided. Hence, a scheme like this with a clear selection parameter is good for investors especially if the markets were to turn bearish for a sustained period of time."

57,2018-06-21,Zee,"The domestic equity market had a disappointing session on Thursday, as it opened on a mildly positive note but spent most part of the day in an extremely narrow range.

The index slipped further in the last hour of trade and ended the day with modest loss of 30.95 points, or 0.29 per cent.

The session remained without any directional bias, but Nifty continued its ongoing pattern and faced resistance at its pattern resistance zone. As we approach Friday’s session, we once again expect a quiet start to the day, but the pattern resistance zone between 10,820 and 10,850 levels are likely to remain in force. Nifty has to rule out any exceptional move unless these levels are breached on the upside.

The 10,810-10,830 zone is likely to be the immediate resistance zone for the market, while supports should come in between 10,720 and 10,660 levels.

The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 52.1682 and it remained neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD remained bearish, as it traded below the signal line. On the charts, a big black candle occurred. In the current context, it remains important, as it occurred near the pattern resistance area.



This reinforces the credibility of the pattern resistance that Nifty faces. Pattern analysis showed Nifty continued to remain in a broad symmetrical triangle pattern and has been moving towards its apex with each passing day. On the upside, the index continued to face resistance at the falling trend line, which joins the high of 11,171 to the subsequent falling tops.

Overall, the index is still not out of the woods even though it continued to move in a narrow range. It would be critically important for the Nifty to resolve the current pattern with a move on either side. Unless this happens, the 10,820-10,850 zone will continue to remain critical and an important pattern resistance area for the index.

Unless a resolution to this pattern is achieved, investors should remain moderate on overall exposures and continue to vigilantly guard profits at higher levels.

1,2018-07-03,Zee,"Emkay Global Financial Services has an accumulate call on Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. with a target price of Rs 640. The current market price of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. is Rs 543.8. Time period given by the brokerage is a year when Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. price can reach defined target. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., incorporated in 1982, is a largecap company with a market cap of Rs 51768.96 crore.


Investment rationale by Emkay Global
ZEEL has been outpacing industry advertisement growth over the last few years and the same is expected to continue going forward. This would be driven by market share improvement across various regional channels and in flagship Hindi GEC. Enhancing original content offerings and tie-ups with telcos is key for boosting newer avenue of subscription revenue from ZEE5. Maintain ACCUMULATE with TP of Rs640."
2,2018-07-05,Zee,"Mumbai: Hong Kong-headquartered brokerage CLSA has removed ICICI Bank, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Ramco Cements from its model portfolio and added weightage to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Maruti Suzuki India.

In a note on Wednesday, the foreign brokerage said the changes were in line with its cautious view on equity markets.

Last month, CLSA’s India Strategist Mahesh Nandurkar had said in a note that the record low equity risk premium and the gap between earnings yield and the bond yields are making the brokerage cautious on the Indian equity market. The gap between bond yield and earnings yield is at a near record high at 2.2 per cent but history suggests that such gaps do not sustain, CLSA had said in the note dated June 13. Healthcare became an overweight sector in its portfolio, with CLSA adding Sun Pharma to its model portfolio with a weightage of 2 percentage points.

In Wednesday’s note, CLSA increased weightage on the drug maker’s stock in the portfolio. CLSA believes that pharma is an under-owned sector with the worst now in the past.



Replacing Zee with Maruti’s stock, CLSA said the latter continues to report robust growth with market share gain.

The brokerage removed Ramco Cements from its model portfolio saying that the cement industry has been witnessing surprising pricing pressure at a time when costs are on an uptrend. “The fight for market share, particularly by larger players, has raised concerns at a time when demand growth has been quite strong actually,” said CLSA. The brokerage said there will be margin pressure, which poses a risk to consensus earnings forecasts.

Another key exclusion was that of ICICI Bank. The private sector lender’s corporate governance credentials in the last few months have been tarnished by allegations of quid pro quo in providing loans."
3,2018-07-05,Zee,"Sharekhan has a buy call on Zee Entertainment Enterprises with a target price of Rs 680.

The current market price of Zee Entertainment Enterprises is Rs 550.30.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Zee Entertainment Enterprises price can reach the defined target.

""We expect ZEEL to deliver a healthy 30% CAGR in adjusted net profit over FY2018-FY2020E, led by an 18% revenue CAGR. We continue to remain positive on ZEEL, as it is a structural India media consumption theme, and expect its growth trajectory to improve further in the coming years, as it continues to invest on content for its TV and digital business. Further, with expected good monsoon, rural economy is poised to do well in CY2018, which in turn will translate into strong ad growth for the media sector, and ZEEL is expected to be among the prime beneficiaries. The stock has already corrected close to 15% from its 52-week high, factoring weak FCF generation and elevated investment in digital and content. We maintain our Buy rating with a price target (PT) of Rs 680,"" Sharekhan said in a report."

5,2018-07-06,Zee,"If you trust return on capital employed (RoCE) as a good filter to spot growth stocks, you have 20 of them staring in your face. Read on.

History can help understand the present and predict the future. Simply put, it can guide you build a portfolio that can deliver multibagger returns over time. 

It takes time to build good businesses. And it requires company managements to set realistic goals while investors need to have the ability to spot such a business early to be able to capture that growth. 

Home appliance major TTK Prestige created humungous wealth for investors as well as for itself in last 10 years. The company has maintained a return on capital employed (RoCE) of over 15 per cent all this while; the stock has surged over 5,200 per cent to Rs 5,823 on July 3, 2018 from Rs 108.50 on the same day in 2008 and market capitalisation has grown from just Rs 123 crore to over Rs 6,500 crore.

There are 19 other such companies which have a similar stellar record, if not better. On an average, these stocks have delivered 1,000 per cent return since July 2008.

HDFC Bank is one, and even the average investor has been able to notice that. Others include Balkrishna Industries, Kansai Nerolac, Bajaj Auto, Tata Elxsi, Asian Paints, Dabur India, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Rallis India.

One common denominator about them is steady growth RoCE at over 15 per cent through past 10 years. Shares of these companies have rallied between 650 per cent and 2,400 per cent in this period.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a financial ratio that measures a company’s profitability and the efficiency with which it uses capital.

Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga told ETMarkets.com that the RoCE filter is good for stock selection as long as the cost of borrowing or leverage is low.

TTK Prestige is still gung-ho about the opportunity in hand. “The appliances segment constitutes about 40 per cent of our revenue currently and we expect it to reach 50 per cent in next three years,” says TT Jagannathan, Chairman, TTK Prestige.

TCS recently became India’s second $100 billion company after RIL had achieved this feat in 2007. 

Balkrishna Industries continues to be in the good books of brokerages. Kotak Institutional Equities has just upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ (from ‘add’) and believes its valuations are looking attractive after the stock corrected from its high point recently.

The brokerage expects the company to deliver 24 per cent EPS growth CAGR over FY2018-21E and has set a target price of Rs 1,260. The stock traded at Rs 1,151 on Thursday.

Other stocks that fulfil the criteria of a minimum of 15 per cent RoCE year after year for last 10 years and over Rs 100 crore market capitalisation as of July 2008 include Empire Industries, Zee Entertainment, Colgate-Palmolive, Lakshmi Machine Works, Hero MotoCorp, ITC, KEC International, Wendt (India), Infosys and Wipro.

Shares of these companies have rallied between 100 per cent and 550 per cent during this period. 

“A company is considered good if it maintains robust RoCE year after year. It means the company is able to extract better returns than the opportunity cost of funds. It becomes a good option for stock selection. But a decision to invest in such a company should also depend on valuation comfort,” says G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Adivsory.

JM Financial is positive on ITC with a target price of Rs 335, while IIFL prefers Zee Entertainment with a target price of Rs 691.

“We prefer Zee Entertainment Enterprises owing to launch of ZEE5 (OTT platform) with strong content inventory (1,00,000+ hours) and portfolio of channels,” the brokerage said.

Brokerage firm Nirmal Bang recently upgraded Wipro to ‘buy’ (from ‘accumulate’) with a target price of Rs 335."

Indian key indices Sensex and Nifty were trading in the negative zone, tracking mixed global cues. Investors were cautious after an official data showed that China's economy slowed a little in the second quarter.

On the other hand, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, Lupin and Reliance Industries were among the top losers in the Nifty pack of stocks."
21,2018-07-16,Zee,"Selective buying in heavyweight stocks took the benchmark BSE Sensex to an all-time high level last week.

However, most of the stocks in the 30-share index are still giving negative returns on a year-to-date basis. The selling pressure has been severe in midcap and smallcap stocks. 

Headwinds in the form of weak emerging markets, rising rates, higher crude oil prices, election year worries and relative rich valuations have mainly impacted sentiments on Dalal Street this year. 

Global brokerage Morgan Stanley, which estimates Sensex to hit 36,000 by June next year in base case, believes the largecap index has support from an improving growth cycle, strong macro stability and local appetite for equities.

“We expect Sensex earnings growth of 5 per cent YoY in F2018, 23 per cent in F2019 and 24 per cent in FY2020,” the brokerage said in a report.

In a bull case scenario, it sees Sensex at 44,000 and in bear case at 26,500. 


Factors favouring the market
The global brokerage highlighted the factors that are looking favourable for the market. They include macroeconomic stability evident in positive BoP and backed by RBI’s commitment to keeping real rates positive. 

A bullish steepening of yield curve, which is at a post-2010 high, correlates positively with stocks and low and falling beta, which augur well in a weak global equity market environment.

In addition to this, India’s growth is likely accelerating relative to emerging markets. “Our work shows corporate confidence is at a multi-year high and profits are likely to mean-revert from below trend. Strong domestic flows, currently averaging around $2-2.5 billion a month, are in a structural uptrend,” Morgan Stanley said.

The brokerage prefers largecaps to midcaps and like sectors, including banks (private corporate and retail), discretionary consumption, industrials and domestic materials, while avoiding healthcare, staples, utilities, global materials and energy.

The brokerage further says crude oil prices remain a key risk to equities given its ability to cause pain to fiscal deficit and, therefore, growth. It sees strong growth in 2018 and 2019 driven by consumption, exports, government spending and a nascent recovery in private capex.


Valuations
Morgan Stanley said equities do not look compelling compared with long bonds. India’s recent outperformance has lifted relative valuations above average. “Our composite valuation indicator suggests low double-digit index returns in the coming 12 months,” it added in a report.


Stocks in focus
Bajaj Auto, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, Titan, ITC, ITC, RIL, Bharat Financial, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, M&M Financial, Shriram Transport, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Adani Ports, Havells India, Asian Paints, Ultratech Cement, UPL and Infosys are among the stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focus list. 


Factors against domestic equities
The global brokerage said a likely rise in crude oil prices can put pressure on growth, while upward pressure on inflation from food price hikes indicate that more rate hikes are coming. The election cycle, which brings its own set of uncertainties, relatively rich midcap valuations (even after the recent drawdown) and high equity valuations relative to bonds, which indicates that the market is pricing in some part of the coming growth recovery, are some of the factors looking against Indian equities."

PNB, other PSBs: The government may infuse about Rs 8,000 crore in five or six state-run banks that are likely to fall short of regulatory capital requirements, a senior finance ministry official said. These banks may include Nirav Modi scam-hit Punjab National Bank.


Tata Steel: Tata Steel is planning to raise as much as $3.1 billion via overseas loans to repay existing high-cost debt ahead of the merger of its European operations with German steel giant Thyssenkrupp. Once completed, this could be one of the largest refinancing programme by a corporate this year to drastically cutdown borrowing costs.


United Breweries: World’s largest beer maker Heineken NV, the majority partner of United Breweries with Vijay Mallya, is understood to have sought legal opinion over its right to appoint a chairman at the Indian company, top officials close to the development said.


ICICI Bank: The lender, which is in the midst of two independent probes has postponed its annual shareholder meeting by a month following a change in the meetings at subsidiaries and group companies. The meeting would be now held on September 12.

Dr Reddy's Labs: The pharma company on Monday said it will appeal the decision of a New Jersey court that ruled against the company over the opioid drug Suboxone, for which a UK drugmaker claims a patent. 


NMDC: The company's move to invite bids for operation and maintenance (O&M) of its upcoming Rs 15,000-crore steel plant at Nagarnar in Chhattisgarh has created a buzz in the industry as O&M of an integrated 3 million tonne steel plant by a third-party contractor is unheard of in the steel industry, globally.


Eros International: The company said its over-the-top entertainment platform Eros Now has entered into a strategic distribution partnership with Xiaomi, for its smart Mi LED TVs."
24,2018-07-17,Zee,"At a time when the Sensex has achieved a new high, there is no palpable sense of upbeat sentiment in markets. Market experts and sector analysts are keenly monitoring earnings growth, which would justify high valuation of companies. They have adopted a cautious stance about equities and it seems that they would change it only after looking at performance after at least three quarters. In such a situation, it makes sense to be with schemes that have consistently spotted interesting growth ideas across large- and medium-sized companies. Two factors work in their favour: One, exposure to large-sized companies ensures consistency in earnings due to dominant share in their respective sectors. Two, after the recent steep fall in mid-sized stocks, there could a certain pool of companies which are placed well due to superior operations and cashflows but their share price fell due to weak broad market sentiment.

A fund with such a combination of well-placed large-sized companies and attractive growth-oriented mid-sized companies (after the recent fall in the midcap index) should serve as a good investment option for retail investors. One such scheme is Mirae Emerging Bluechip. This five-star rated scheme has been a distinct performer. Its category of schemes has given 10 per cent and 19 per cent returns in the past three-year and five-year periods, while the scheme has given 16.1 per cent and 30 per cent returns in the same periods. Consistency in beating its benchmark and its peers with superior returns has been the hallmark of this scheme.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund manager Neelesh Surana has constructed a diversified portfolio of companies which have extremely stable earnings’ visibility in the coming quarters. These include well-placed large-sized companies such as HDFC Bank, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Dabur India.


ET Bureau

Expert Take: Rupesh Bhansali, Head - mutual funds, GEPL Capital
One of the strengths of this scheme is its consistency in superior performance almost across market cycles. The fund is overweight on banking and financials theme, allocating close to 31 per cent of its portfolio. Besides this, even though the scheme is all about spotting emerging bluechip companies, its beta is quite low, which caps portfolio downside. Investors with at least three-year view can consider an SIP in this scheme."
25,2018-07-17,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices opened on a positive note as investors cheered a sharp drop in crude oil prices overseas. This is in the backdrop of a trim in India's growth forecast by IMF by 10 basis points to 7.3 per cent for the current year, citing higher crude prices and faster-than-anticipated monetary tightening. 

Investors were keenly awaiting US Fed's Jerome Powell’s first congressional testimony slated for later in the day.

At 9.26 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 85.28 points, or 0.23 per cent, higher at 36,409.05. Nifty50 was trading 27.20 points, or 0.25 per cent, higher at 10,946.05.

Aviation and OMC shares jumped on drop in crude oil prices. Brent crude futures tumbled 4.6 per cent on Monday. On Tuesday, the prices were hovering around $72.20 a barrel. 

Among Sensex stocks, Tata Motors rose 1.83 per cent to Rs 256.15. Tata Steel gained 1.44 per cent, followed by Sun Pharma, YES Bank and Vedanta which gained up to 1.4 per cent. 

ONGC, Adani Ports and ICICI Bank were other gainers from the Sensex pack. Tata Steel was up as the company is planning to raise as much as $3.1 billion via overseas loans to repay existing high-cost debt ahead of the merger of its European operations with German steel giant Thyssenkrupp. 

Tata Motors gained on launch of JLR's F-TYPE sedan with a new petrol engine in India. 

ICICI Bank was up after the lender, which is in the midst of two independent probes has postponed its annual shareholder meeting by a month following a change in the meetings at subsidiaries and group companies. The meeting would be now held on September 12. 

Hindustan Unilever, meanwhile was the worst Sensex performer. The stock fell 0.9 per cent even as the company reported a 19.17 per cent increase in standalone net profit at Rs 1,529 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared with Rs 1,283 crore in the yearago period.

26,2018-07-17,Zee,"Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey, discusses HUL, Zee Entertainment, Dr Reddy’s and OMCs with ET Now.Edited excerpts:  
I have a HUL report from CLSA which is a three-year old report and it is headlined that silver is available at the price of gold. At that time, HUL was Rs 1200. Now HUL is at Rs 1700. Even though valuation concerns were there three years ago, that has not stopped fund managers from buying into HUL. Why is nobody paying any heed to basic theory of investing?
In this quarter, results has shown around 12% or 12.5% top line growth and the EBITDA, PBT and the bottom line growth is in the vicinity of 20%. If the company is moving smartly on pricing or the margin front, that is one important aspect for this particular business. 

There is a higher amount of demand in the rural market because of the availability of funds in the hands of the rural masses. As a result, FMCG products will see relatively higher volumes with consumption picking up. But these numbers are not going to be beyond 15%. The key lies in improving the margin and that is what this company is doing. 

The GST rollout has been by and large very successful for many of these consumer companies. On one side, they have been able to destock their inventories and the working capital benefits. On other hand, the just-in-time inventories into the system has helped them to bring down the costs. Though one cannot say that it has been reflecting completely into the accounts of the current quarter, as we see the GST stabilising, the bigger beneficiaries would be some of the larger FMCG companies. 

The likes of HUL, ITC will continue to produce better profit performance from the FMCG business. This is likely to continue going ahead. Whether HUL valuations are right I do not know. This is one company which has always been expensive even in the past. This is a story for the people who buy today and await their return to come into their portfolio two years hence. For two years, if you are satisfied with the muted returns, then that you can buy the stock at higher valuations and start earning your return after two years of investments.


Do you think that Zee Entertainment will continue to lead the sector when it comes to ad revenue growth? Does it make you bullish on the entire broadcast space?
Broadcasting along with internet will be the combination to look out for for as far as the entertainment companies are concerned. because more than TV channels, larger amount of contents are going to be consumed through the internet through different other channels including the mobile phones, ISP channel, the MS or DTH channels. All of these channels would probably start demanding higher amount of contents coming through the internet and as a result of it, distribution reach and consumption could possibly increase.

From that perspective, there is a reasonably good possibility for ad revenues to increase because the size of the property itself is increasing. 

Companies like Zee and Network18 Group have been engaging themselves to create this particular situation for them which ultimately enlarges the ad pie for them. Whether Zee becomes a buy at this point of time, I am not too sure. Valuation is always at a stretched level because of one premier company in the entire space vis-à-vis others. May be a small correction in the market price -- 10-20% at any point of time if -- would be a good opportunity to add the stock to the portfolio.


What is your view on OMCs? Between IOC, HPCL and BPCL where would you place your bet?
Valuation-wise, we are finding comfort now because they have corrected. But whether allocation of money should go into OMCs per se or to Reliance is a debate. Reliance has given maximum comfort to me and it has been validated in last few years largely because of the size of the company getting doubled from balance sheet point of view. To a greater extent, Reliance may be a relatively better choice from the allocation of money point of view because when you see profits doubling in two-two and a half years time, one gets confidence that the stock will give you 100% return in two years.

This doubling of profit is largely due to the Jio platform which is now rolling out to the fiber to home kind of a product. I remain a little bit more confident on Reliance and the reason I am not preferring OMCs is because Reliance has better clarity and visibility to me.


After the injunction on Suboxone, DRL got punished in trade yesterday. The weakness on DRL has rubbed off on the rest of the pack too. Do you sense this decline could be bought? May be not Dr Reddy’s but the others?
You should not be treating all the companies at the same level. The patent suit which has been filed in case of DRL is definitely not something which it is applying to all other companies, which are India companies. Most of the Indian pharma companies have basically moved from pure generics to the branded generics and now the speciality products. Many companies have already put up the plants for some of the specialty products including DRL. We are likely to see in the second half of the financial year new product launches in USA and they promise to have relatively better turnover and profits thereafter. 

I do agree that world over the generic pharma companies would face the pressure of margins, but that would not be same as what we have seen three years-four years back. The new product launches relative to growth coming into the books would possibly show relatively better profit performance for the pharma companies. So yes, any correction of major degree which we have started seeing in pharma companies, should be seen as a buying opportunity at lower levels.

We think companies like Cipla, Sun Pharma have greater clarity as far as growth is concerned. You can expect FY18-19 would be of lightly average growth but FY19-20 should be reasonably smart growth year."
27,2018-07-17,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Zee Entertainment on Tuesday said its profit after tax (PAT) rose 31.4 per cent to Rs 326.40 crore for the quarter ended June 30. 

The media company had reported Rs 248.40 crore profit in the corresponding quarter last year. 

Operating revenue for the quarter rose 15 per cent to Rs 1,772 crore compared with Rs 1,540.30 crore in the year-ago quarter.

The company said its consolidated advertising revenue rose 18.6 per cent YoY to Rs 1,146 crore. While ad spends by consumer goods companies are increasing as their traction in rural markets improve, the growth in other categories also continues to be strong, it said. 

The subscription revenue for the quarter rose 12.3 per cent YoY for the quarter but international subscription revenue slipped 6.6 per cent YoY during the same period.

""The growth in consumption, now being driven by rural as well, bodes well for advertising spends. In addition, increasing availability and adoption of digital medium, across different sectors, will have a positive effect on the country's growth trajectory,"" company Chairman Subhash Chandra said. 

Based on our discussions with the advertisers and the visibility on ad campaigns, we believe that the ad growth for the industry could be higher than the initial estimates for this financial year, said Punit Goenka, Managing Director & CEO at Zee Entertainment."

29,2018-07-18,Zee,"MUMBAI: Zee Entertainment’s heavy investments in its digital venture Zee5 may assure investors that the company has an appropriate strategy in place for the highly competitive, 30-player Over the Top (OTT) business in the country.

One of the key factors working in favour of Zee, India’s largest listed media and entertainment company, is its focus on creating content in regional languages.

For Zee5, the company has rolled out a three-pronged strategy — original shows, exclusive films and premium content from non-English overseas markets. While the company has already released 14 originals in six Indian languages, it has also lined up 20 more series for the September 2018 quarter.

Next year, Zee5 will premiere 150 exclusive films across Indian languages and will stream premium content from countries such as South Korea, Turkey, Spain, and France, dubbed in multiple Indian languages.

A Deloitte report estimates that by 2021, vernacular users will be more than 2.5 times the English internet user base. At present, regional content constitutes close to 40 per cent of OTT viewership. Thus, Zee’s content initiatives targeted especially at regional audiences should stand in good stead in the coming years.

Analysts point out that the content acquisition cost targeted especially for regional audience would not be high for Zee in addition to the element of variety in them. Also, Zee has a big library of films and television content, which can feed into Zee5.

In the June 2018 quarter, the company’s revenues of Rs 1,770 crore came in slightly below Bloomberg’s consensus revenue estimate of Rs 1,785 crore. But the company’s advertising revenues showed robust growth of close to 19 per cent. Zee also continues to maintain and gain market share in regional markets such as Marathi, Telugu, Tamil and Bangla.

On the valuation front, on a oneyear forward basis, the company is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 28.9, which looks reasonably attractive when compared to its five year average of 30.8."

""Updated annually, the Variety500 reflects the accomplishments of its members over the previous 12 months. They were selected by the Variety editorial board, which conducted extensive research for its selections.""

Topping the list is Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Robert Iger, who ""has a strong track record for taking savvy risks"" with big-ticket acquisitions like USD 4.05 billion for 'Star Wars' owner Lucasfilm in 2012, USD 4 billion for Marvel in 2009 and USD 7.4 for Pixar Animation in 2006 paying off handsomely.

Salman Khan, Variety said, is one of the unrelated Khan triumvirate comprising Aamir and Shah Rukh that has been ruling the Bollywood box office for decades. Of the top ten grossing films of all time, Salman has three, as does Shah Rukh, while Aamir has four.

""Unlike his contemporary Khans whose fan bases are staid by comparison, every Salman release generates mass hysteria across India, a frenzy surpassed only by the fans of South Indian superstar Rajinikanth,"" it said.

However, the 'Dabangg' actor is no stranger to controversy. In 1998, two separate cases were registered against Khan under Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act after he allegedly poached three chinkaras - two in Bhawad village, and one in Mathania (Ghoda Farm) during the shooting of the film 'Hum Saath Saath Hain'. Along with him, Saif Ali Khan, Neelam, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Dushyant Singh were also named in the case.The same year, in October, he was charged with possessing an unlicensed 0.22 rifle and a 0.32 revolver and using them to poach two black bucks at Jodhpur's Kankani village.In September 2002, the 'Sultan' star was accused of running his car over a group of people sleeping on a sidewalk outside a bakery in Mumbai's Bandra locality.NextShilpa Shetty Kundra7 Apr, 2018Shilpa Shetty-Kundra found herself in a sticky spot for making a disparaging remark and hurting the sentiments of the Scheduled Caste community. An FIR was filed against the actor-turned-entrepreneur for her quote in an interview, ""I look like a bhangi"". The FIR against her alleged that she was encouraging and spreading ill-feeling among the entire society. Later the actress has posted an apology on Twitter, too.NextNawazuddin Siddiqui7 Apr, 2018Earlier this year in March, Nawazuddin Siddiqui was accused of spying on his estranged wife and acquiring her call detail records (CDR).NextShah Rukh Khan7 Apr, 2018Shah Rukh Khan was booked for allegedly 'rioting' and 'damaging' railway property during the promotion of his film 'Raees' at Kota Railway station.In 2002, he was caught on camera misbehaving with the Mumbai Cricket Association officials and manhandling a security personnel at the Wankhede Stadium.Next
Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's ""USD 30 billion investment in Jio is a big deal there in digital entertainment, the fastest growing segment of the Indian media scene,"" Variety said. Jio is a data, mobile phones and wi-fi outfit.

""India is poorly connected, with only some 200 million internet users and more than 800 million mobile connections with slow and expensive data. Jio aims to tap into the vast number of people who consume media on their mobile devices by providing high-speed data at costs that are at a fraction of their local competitors,"" it said.

Jio's media services allow users to access HD TV, music and news across devices from hundreds of channels, in various categories and languages. Reliance Industries aims to make Jio available to 90 per cent of India's 1.25 billion population. Only 61 per cent of Indian households have a television set, it said.

""Ambani has been pushing deeper into media at the same time that his brother, Anil Ambani, has been slowly backing out of the sector with his rival outfit, Reliance Group,"" it said.

After splitting Reliance Group with his brother, Anil Ambani ""quickly identified media and entertainment as growth areas, buying up Adlabs in 2005, with cinemas, distribution and film processing as its core businesses.""

That was complemented by moves further into post-production, TV production and TV and radio broadcasting. In 2008, the company paid USD 1.2 billion to invest in Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks.

""But lately most of Reliance ADAG's media moves have turned to ashes. Focusing increasingly on capital intensive infrastructure projects, Ambani has withdrawn in all but symbolic fashion from most of the entertainment positions he took a decade ago. Market leading positions in theaters and post-production crumbled and have been sold. TV joint ventures collapsed,"" it said.

Ambani and Reliance Entertainment's name continues to appear on the credits of a smattering of movies per year, thanks to a restructured deal with Steven Spielberg's new Amblin Partners. Reliance Entertainment also retains a minority stake in Hollywood sales and finance company IM Global, after Ambani sold the majority to China's Tang Media.

""Ambani is currently selling off a wide range of assets beyond the media sector to erase massive debt across his company,"" it added.

On Priyanka Chopa, Variety said she had envisioned an engineering career but changed direction after winning the 2000 Miss World Pageant.

13,2018-08-13,Zee,"MUMBAI: A tussle is brewing between TV broadcasters and advertising agencies over discounted rates being offered to advertisers. The broadcasters claim they are not being consulted when agencies discount ad rates while pitching for business to clients (advertisers) and this has resulted in stagnation of advertising rates and adversely affected business. With total advertising spends on television close to Rs 30,000 crore, TV still remains the cheapest medium in India in terms of reaching the masses.

While TV viewing has grown in the past decade with increased cable and satellite penetration — 836 million TV viewers as per a Broadcast India 2018 survey — advertising rates of broadcasters have remained largely stagnant. This even after a 67% growth in eyeballs between 2012 and 2017 and a many fold increase in the cost of operations for broadcasters.

Last week, the Indian Broadcasting Foundation, the apex body of broadcasters, sent a letter to the heads of advertising agencies — a copy of which was accessed by ET— “strongly objecting” to the practice of committing comparatively reduced rates to clients and then approaching IBF members to cut their rates. The letter, signed by Punit Goenka, president of IBF and MD of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, said consent on ad rates must be sought by agencies from IBF members as a normal ethical business practice before pitching for a client’s business. “Over the years, better technology and innovation have resulted in media industry increasing value delivered to the clients. This is a win-win situation to both advertisers and media. A price-focussed approach by the intermediary is detrimental to the industry overall. Agencies should adopt a more value-additive mind-set and not try to be the best deliverer of discounts,” said MK Anand, MD and CEO of Times Network.



“A price-reduction strategy never succeeds in the long run. A simple look at the viewership and impact delivered by media over the last decade and the prices media operates at will show this corrosion. This is not good for the industry,” Anand added.Times Network is part of the Times Group, which publishes The Economic Times. Broadcasters that ET spoke with said such renegotiations do not reflect wisely on both stakeholders and that such practices result in significant business losses for the broadcasters.

“Advertisers have started shifting agencies every two years as compared to five years in the past,” said Ashish Sehgal, COO at Zee Unimedia, which oversees ad sales and other revenue opportunities for the group across entertainment, news and print. Sehgal added that in the current situation, with the supply side overpowering demand, clients are bound to ask for reduced pitches regularly.

However, agencies are under pressure to retain clients. In recent times, big advertisers including Titan, ITC, Wipro, Marico, Mondelez, Lenovo, Viacom18, Motorola, GSK, Samsung and Vivo have called for pitches. All of them spend Rs 100 crore to Rs 400 crore on advertising annually. Vineet Sodhani, CEO at media audit firm Spatial Access, said that while strategic and planning inputs continue to be critical, cost is becoming an important reason why most pitches are being called these days. “As a response, agencies come up with aggressive cost commitments, which clients are unable to verify, but nevertheless get excited by the prospect of savings. The end result often is these commitments not being met… sometimes leading to yet another pitch!”

Agency heads said it is counterproductive for advertisers to call for a pitch just to get lower rates. “The real benefit a client is going to get from a media agency is meeting its business objectives at the best deal. But best is not necessarily cheapest,” said Ashish Bhasin, chairman of Dentsu Aegis Network, South Asia.

He said an agency is not supposed to trade in inventory but act in the best interests of its clients. Unfortunately, some agencies have started acting like wholesalers and have opened trading arms.

“That is a detrimental practice and should be strongly discouraged,” Bhasin said. “Broadcasters should refuse to give their inventory to such trading agencies as it commoditises it and in the long term, collectively it is going to harm the entire industry.” Some members of the Advertising Agencies Association of India said that the issue could be discussed at its meeting scheduled later this month."

20,2018-08-20,Zee,"MUMBAI: Indian media conglomerate Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) entered into a 3-year multi-layered partnership with telecom major Bharti Airtel within a week of removing all its content from Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Jio after a disagreement over price.

As part of the strategic partnership, Airtel and Zee will work closely on creating exclusive video content for Airtel’s video-on-demand app Airtel TV and ZEE’s over-the-top (OTT) app ZEE5.

Also, over 50 million Airtel TV app users will get access to ZEE5 content including ZEE5 Originals, movies, TV shows, plays and more as the subscription cost will be bundled under Airtel TV’s plan.

“It’s a larger partnership and a win-win for both of us,” Punit Goenka MD, ZEE told ET. “Airtel brings a huge consumer base, which today, potentially, is not even exposed to the OTT world or even some of the new age youth audience which is not available to TV.”

Goenka stressed that ZEE has managed to get a very significant deal for app-in-app integration at the cost-per-download level compared to retail price, apart from good minimum guarantees on the Airtel TV piece for providing content.

Airtel will also share consumer insights and data of the users with ZEE as part of the deal. Goenka said that based on the demographic of Airtel TV consumers, ZEE will see which pieces of content are best fit for which platform.

For Goenka, consumer data was very critical from a long-term partnership and it was one of the key negotiation points for the deal. “It is very critical in today’s time because that’s the way we will understand our consumers’ behaviour and how they are reacting to the content. We are not just pure content suppliers. It’s a strategic alliance and therefore it has to be treated in that manner,” Goenka added.

Incidentally, none of this was part of the Reliance Jio deal, and Goenka thinks the company was not getting fair value for its content.

ET first reported on August 8 that ZEE has removed all its content from Reliance Jio, including 35 live TV channels and more than 2 lakh hours of video-on-demand content after failing to arrive at an agreement on price.

However, he maintained that withdrawing content from Jio and the deal with Airtel are not to be seen as connected.

“The Jio exit and Airtel deal are independent of each other. We have been in talks with Airtel for long,” Goenka said. “This doesn’t mean that we don’t want a deal with Jio. I would love to offer our content on Jio, provided we get a fair value. But going ahead, we will ask for consumer insights also to be part of the deal.”

On why consumer data is so important, Tarun Katial, CEO, ZEE5, said that it will allow the company to have full understanding of the consumer. “We will have their profile, their usage pattern etc which will help us in creating better content for them, better targeting and personalisation. We want to use content, data and technology as three pillars in this deal.”

Gopal Vittal, MD — India & South Asia at Bharti Airtel said that the partnership is a natural fit. “Exclusive content from ZEE brings that extra element of differentiation to our digital play while providing this content better discoverability across our large user base.”"
21,2018-08-26,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Remember the days when your smartphone was on a perpetual data diet, and you shut apps or refused to download more just to save your plan from finishing before the due date? Cut to now when you've binge-watched an entire series in full HD and still have hundreds of GB to roll over to the next month.

Of course, one reason is that competition has made telecom service providers more generous about letting you carry over unused data but another big reason is tech innovation which has made streaming far less data-intensive. Two years ago, a 90-minute movie would have consumed 1.5-2GB data. But now you can watch a film of a similar duration for 200-300 MB — a tenth what you would have consumed earlier, said Manish Aggarwal, business head at Zee5, Zee Entertainment's over-the-top (OTT) arm. OTT refers to content providers that distribute streaming media as a standalone product directly to consumers over the internet.

No wonder households are binge-watching the latest flicks on the internet and cricket-lovers streaming matches without a worrying about their bill. The fall in data tariff is only adding to the streaming boom.

""While overall consumption of data has gone up by 8-10 times over last year, it is true that many users across the country are currently accumulating massive amounts of data,"" said a senior executive at one of India's largest telecom companies.

While data providers don't sound too happy, Indians are rejoicing. Watching online videos is the most common online activity in India. Indians spend around five hours every week watching video on the internet and have the least patience in the world for slow-loading websites, according to a study by Limelight Networks. Only a third of internet visitors from India are willing to wait five seconds or longer for a page to load, before leaving.

This has made OTT players sit up and take notice, with many improving their streaming technology for low-bandwidth markets such as India. For instance, a Netflix user can now watch 20 hours of video for just 2GB of data and can experience good picture quality in lower-bandwidth conditions.

""A critical piece is how Netflix encodes video to allow users to stream a good picture quality even in bandwidth as low as 200kbps,"" said a Netflix spokesperson. The California-headquartered company last year showcased its Dynamic Optimiser system, which uses AI techniques to analyse each shot in a video and compress it without affecting quality. For instance, you will use up more bandwidth watching Tom Cruise chase villains in MI6 because the scene is elaborate and contains fast-moving action than watching him steal a kiss in a hallway.

OTT companies utilise adaptive bitrate streaming, which allows a video provider to create a different video size for different screen sizes such as mobile phones, tablets and televisions without affecting quality. ""In a country where most content is being consumed on inexpensive mobile phones boasting screens that are six inches or smaller, this helps to optimise data usage greatly without affecting viewing experience,"" said Girish Dwibhashyam, head of content at Spuul.

Compression intelligence has improved as well. Large video files are compressed like zip files before being delivered to a screen. Newer encoding formats like VP9 have reduced the size of videos considerably, to the tune of 40 per cent-70 per cent, thus reducing data usage when viewed. Data for video is being delivered in small byte sizes compared to earlier, when the full video would download despite the user watching only a part of it.

""Now, you won't find the full video downloading at once,"" said Ali Hussein, COO of Eros Digital. ""We will first give you five minutes worth of data, and once you have watched three minutes of the video, we will send you the data for the next five.""

Hussein said OTT players are working with AI and machine learning to predict user habits. This means, depending on your behaviour of how much you watch for how long, data would be delivered to you in the future.

""Earlier, I would run out of data every month and would get this dreaded message that I will have to buy more data,"" said Ipshita Kumar, media executive and a resident of south Delhi. ""Things have changed. I have increased my video consumption and opted for a smaller data package. Even then, I am left with more data than I need!"""

A ‘buy’ signal occurs when the MACD rises above its signal line and vice-versa.

Once effective, channels like Zee Anmol, Zee Anmol Cinema, Zee News, Big Magic, Big Ganga and Zee Hindustan will not be available in any of the FTA bouquets of cable or private DTH operators.

However, the channels are likely to be available free of cost on public broadcaster Prasar Bharati’s FTA service, DD FreeDish. “All news channels of the ZEE group, along with FTA channels, will be available as part of the pay bouquets or at an MRP.

These channels would not be available in the FTA pack. We will announce individual pricing soon,” a source at the company told ET.

This will allow Zee to bundle all the channels together, as under the new order, pay channels and free channels cannot be clubbed together. While various broadcasters are gearing up to declare their channel prices, ZEE’s decision may force cable operators and DTH players to move the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, since these channels will be available for free on DD FreeDish.

The move is in line with the fast approaching August 31 deadline for announcing the MRP for television channels under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s new tariff order. As per the plan, ZEE will offer options to its consumers to choose from bouquets created specifically for Hindi speaking markets (HSM) and different regional language markets (Marathi, Bangla, Odia, Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam).

For each market, there will be multiple bouquets available at different price points. Each bouquet would consist of a mix of channels from different genres including general entertainment, movies, news, infotainment and music."
0,2018-09-01,Zee,"MUMBAI: India’s leading companies seem to have shrugged off any immediate fears of a drop in female recruitment in the wake of the Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Act passed in March last year that increased paid maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks. 

Some experts suggested the effects could be adverse further down the economic scale. The amendment also required establishments with more than 50 employees to have a creche for working mothers. After growing at 11% for the previous two years, the total number of permanent women employees in 32 Nifty companies grew at 5% in FY18.

However, that contrasts with total employee numbers rising 3.7% during the year, following on from 3.5% and 7.9%, respectively, in the preceding two years. Workforce reductions in IT and banking, both large recruiters of women, have impacted female employee growth numbers. But the overall diversity ratio of these Nifty companies has steadily improved in the past four years from 22.7% in FY15 to 25.5% in FY18.

The focus on improving diversity appears to be outweighed by concerns about the higher costs of recruiting women at large Indian businesses. Only four — Tech Mahindra, Bharti Airtel, Zee Entertainment and Adani Ports — of the 32 Nifty companies reported a drop in their diversity ratio over the past four years. “It is too early to assess whether maternity leave has had an impact on women’s hiring,” said Lohit Bhatia, CEO of the staffing division of Quess Corp. “For large companies, sustaining gender diversity would be key.” Bhatia said banks and IT companies have not added many women to the permanent rolls “but my fear would be the lower strata of economy — the cost-conscious SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and small private companies — may avoid hiring women and their informal employment might get impacted”.




Impact on Smaller DeptsTeamLease had said in a recent report that the net effects of the maternity law amendment are likely to be negative with potential job losses of 1.6-2.6% across sectors in FY19, and industry behaviour that ranges from benevolent to manipulative.

While large, professionally managed companies in the private and public sector and medium-sized, state-owned firms will actively back the amendment and hire more women, large and mediumsized private companies are likely to maintain the status quo or reduce their intake, the report had said. Startups and SMEs are likely to also reduce hiring, the report said. The post-maternity retention cost (at 80-135% of annual salary for each beneficiary) could be seen as prohibitively expensive by some firms, it said.
For large companies, implementing the changes doesn’t translate into a big cost. “Even before the amendment, companies used to grant maternity leave without pay for a period more than three months,” said the human resources head of a banking and financial services company. “The new law has just made the arrangement more structured.”

According to industry professionals, the adverse impact of the new law can be felt in smaller departments such as finance, accounts legal and secretarial that have three-four employees who may not be easily substituted or in the case of companies that are in a stable phase rather undergoing rapid change through expansion. “It may be a case of what economists call ‘revealed preferences’ — a slowdown in hiring women due to the costs involved,” said TeamLease founder Manish Sabharwal.

“Bigger companies have higher productivity, hence are more likely to be amenable to comply with the Act but the same is not the case with the informal sector.”"

Chaos in currency market Sliding for the seventh day in a row, the rupee slipped below the 72 mark for the first time ever as the US dollar eased a bit. The local currency is down over 12 per cent on a year-to date basis, making it one of the worst-performing currencies among emerging markets and giving jitters to the financial markets. A Reuters report said the Reserve Bank of India was not seen intervening after the rupee fell below 72. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday attributed the fall in the rupee to global factors and said there was no need for panic or knee-jerk reactions. He said RBI was doing whatever was necessary to deal with the situation. 


Trade war aggravatesEscalating the ongoing trade tussle, China on Thursday warned that it would go for tit-for-tat action if fresh tariffs are imposed on Chinese imports to the US. China will be forced to retaliate if the US implements any new tariff measures, China’s commerce ministry warned, as the world’s two biggest economies remained locked in an intensifying trade war. Earlier, the US President had threatened to raise tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Stocks fell in Asia and Europe for the fifth day on Thursday.


Cement & realty stocks riseThe Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted the ban on construction activities in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand after the two states submitted their respective solid waste management policies to the court.

13,2018-09-06,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: A comparison of companies constituting the Nifty in 1996 and now shows that the index is still dominated by old-economy companies. In over two decades since the launch of the index, an average Nifty company has grown five years older and a little more promoter-owned.

The average age of a Nifty company has increased to 43 years now from 38 in 1996. The NSE benchmark index comprises a higher number of older companies than what it had over two decades ago. Only a dozen companies are less than 25 years old in the current Nifty constitution — in 1996, this was 20. The age of a company is the number of years since its incorporation.

“Despite the services sector taking lead in the country’s GDP, the benchmark index is still dominated by older-economy companies,” said G Chokkalingam, managing director of Equinomics Research. With six companies from the automobile industry and the same number from oil & gas, four each from metals and pharma and two companies from the power sector, the index has more representation of the manufacturing sectors than those like IT, banking and financial services that together have 16 companies in the 50-stock index.


Agencies
Only 13 stocks, or a little over a quarter, of the original list are still part of the Nifty. These are HUL, ITC, Dr Reddy’s Labs, L&T, Reliance Industries, SBI, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Grasim, Hindalco, HDFC, HDFC Bank and Hero MotoCorp.

The average promoter holding of these 13 companies has increased to 30.5% now from 27% in 2001. “The promoter holding is likely to continue high since promoters in India have historically preferred to have higher control of their companies,” said Nilesh Shah of Kotak Mahindra AMC. The average promoter holding of all the Nifty companies was 40% in 2001. Now, it is 42%.


ET Bureau
Sectorally, the Nifty has not changed drastically except for some aspects. There are now five IT companies in the index compared with none to begin with. Six fast moving consumer goods companies in 1996 have come down to two. Instead of having a hotels company (Indian Hotels) then, there is now an entertainment company (Zee Entertainment). While a shipping company (GE Shipping) has made way for a ports company (Adani Ports), a consumer durables stock (Titan) has replaced a tyre company (Apollo Tyres).

“Twenty years from now, the index would be different from its current avatar,” said Chokkalingam. “New thematic business models like ecommerce and microfinance will be part of it,” he said. Like IT companies that grew and created space for themselves in the index, it remains to be seen which will be the next sector that will make its pronounced entry into the index in the coming years."

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 35.85 points at 11512.8, while the BSE Sensex was up 139.37 points at 38,157.68.

20,2018-09-08,Zee,"Mr Market finally made a top during the week gone by and started correcting in response to the local and global tailwinds, primarily due to a strengthening dollar, growing current account deficit, inflationary expectations, global tightening and worsening geopolitical conditions. 

Stocks have been bruised and battered after making new highs and we expect downward pressure to increase, as none of the above macro conditions are likely to subside soon. Not only India, but markets across the world have also started a corrective phase, as the dollar continues to gain strength vis-à-vis other emerging market currencies.

Uncertainty is likely to persist and the downward drift might not ease anytime soon. Fears, doubts and unpredictability have gripped investors and this very uncertainty is a friend of bear markets! Therefore, the indices should continue to be under pressure and profit booking will continue till the onset of quarterly earnings.

Weak passenger vehicle sales numbers from auto companies for August also indicate that the economy is slowing down due to reduced purchasing power of consumers amid the currency depreciation. (As the rupee reaches new lows, prices of petrol, diesel and other products rise and end consumers will have to shell out more from their pockets.)


Event of the Week

Aurobindo Pharma rose 15 per cent in last two sessions after it acquired dermatology and oral solid division of Sandoz (generics) business of Novartis. It is going to be a $900 million all-cash deal and the proposed deal is valued at a mere 1 time the price to sales, which shows the generic business is cheaply valued. Indian pharmaceutical industry is the largest exporter of drugs to the US and this deal is a red signal for the Indian pharma companies, which are currently trading at extremely high valuations of 3-4 times their price to sales. Nifty Pharma index has risen 32 per cent from its bottom of 8,020 hit in June 2018 and such high valuations will cap the rally in this space from a medium-term perspective.


Technical Outlook

The Nifty50 witnessed selloff after facing resistance at the upward parallel sloping channel. On the weekly chart, an engulfing bear pattern has been formed, indicating that the correction as expected has indeed begun. It is expected that the market will partially retrace the fall and, therefore, some short-term bounce can be expected, but eventually it will fall again. Traders should take this opportunity to exit long positions and create short positions with proper stop losses in place. 



Expectations for the Week

In the coming weeks, geopolitical uncertainties might escalate and that may keep the markets under selling pressure and threaten the bulls. Typically, during bull market tops, markets punish the companies when they announce expansion plans. Two cases in point were Balkrishna Tyres and Zee Entertainment, whose shares got hammered after they announced capex/expansion plans. When the stocks are priced to perfection, there is little margin of safety and, therefore, no sooner the company wants to venture out for expansion, the stocks got hammered because of increased risks.

As the corrective phase is expected to continue, investors should wait for a deeper correction before investing and should seriously consider booking profits in some of the highly overvalued sectors such as FMCG, consumer durables and consumer discretionary, IT and select pharma stocks.

Nifty ended last week at 11,589, down 0.78 per cent."
21,2018-09-10,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Snapping a two-day winning streak, the BSE benchmark Sensex clocked its biggest point-wise drop since March 16 on Monday, as a fresh record low in rupee raised fresh concerns over foreign fund outflows, which hit Rs 5,600 crore in the last five sessions.

The BSE Sensex tanked 467.65 points, or 1.22 per cent to 37,922.17 with four stocks managing to close on a positive note in the 30-share index.

Axis Bank was the top index gainer as the bank said Amitabh Chaudhry of HDFC Life will join as chief executive officer from January 1.

Sun Pharma was the biggest loser and ended 3.72 per cent lower at Rs 639.50. M&M, Vedanta, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, HDFC, ONGC, Bajaj Auto and Coal India were among other stocks that ended on a weak note and lost up to 3.50 per cent.

The NSE Nifty ended the session at 11,438.10, down 151 points or 1.30 per cent. In the 50-share index 8 stocks closed higher and the remaining 42 ended lower.

HCL Tech was the top index gainer followed by Axis Bank, Zee Entertainment, Cipla and TCS. Bajaj Finance emerged to be the worst index performer and tanked nearly 5 per cent. 

No sector managed to shut shop in the green although the Nifty IT index did manage to end on a flat note. The Nifty PSU Bank index was the worst sectoral performer with all 12 constituents closing in the red.

Pharma, auto, FMCG, realty and financials stocks too helped the Nifty PSU Bank index in dragging the NSE benchmark Nifty lower.


What caused the decline?
1. Rout in rupeeThe domestic unit tanked 94 paise in today's trade to hit a fresh record low of 72. 67 against dollar. However, the domestic unit gained some ground in afternoon trade and was trading 72.38 at the time of writing this report.


2. Spike in bond yields10-year bond yield rose to its highest since late-2014 on Monday as worries of higher crude prices and weakening rupee bolstered inflation concerns, according to a Reuters report


3. Weakness in global marketsThe anxiety over the US-China trade war kept investors on the edge globally as world shares flirted with their longest run of declines since early 2016.

Another interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve later this month also has investors worried.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March, Reuters reported.


4. Firming oil pricesOil prices rose today as US drilling stalled and as investors anticipated lower supply once new US sanctions against Iran's crude exports kick in from November. 


What experts say:
Jayant Manglink, President, Religare BrokingMarkets started the week on feeble note and lost over a percent. Weak global cues combined with widening trade deficit, due to continuous fall in rupee against the dollar, dampened the sentiment. Selling pressure was witnessed across the board and almost all the sectoral indices ended lower.

The fall was evident, citing deteriorating local cues and continuous threat of trade war escalation. We feel it's a normal correction, considering the rise that we had in Nifty in recent past. Indications are in the favour of further decline ahead and we expect Nifty to find support around 11,300. Trades have no option but to align their position accordingly and avoid naked longs.


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesMarkets slid as fears of escalating US -China trade war dented the confidence. As a direct impact of rising crude oil price, widened current account deficit and strengthening dollar on account of a strong US job data, rupee succumbed to a new low and 10-year yield rose further. The poll forecast of a likely ease in inflation couldn’t uplift the sentiment as concerns of a weakening rupee and volatility in oil prices overshadowed."
22,2018-09-11,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra promoted Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) and Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio have initiated talks to break a monthlong deadlock over pricing of content on the telecom operator’s platform, according to people aware of the development.

ET had reported on August 9 that ZEE has removed all its content from Reliance Jio, including 35 live TV channels and more than 200,000 hours of video-on-demand content, after the two companies failed to agree on content pricing.

Last weekend, the promoters of the two companies decided to sort out the matter and talks are on to get ZEE content back on Jio this week, the persons cited earlier told ET, requesting not to be named.

Email queries sent to ZEE and Reliance Jio remained unanswered till as of press time on Monday, but an executive of Reliance Jio said, “The talks are going on at the promoter level and both ZEE and Jio seem to have arrived at an agreement. We have been told to provide data on subscribers’ consumption, etc on an urgent basis. So in all probability, the deal should be signed this week.”

A top executive at ZEE said a formal announcement in this regard was likely before Thursday.

On August 6, the management of ZEE had decided to withdraw all content from Reliance Jio Digital Services, terminating a multi-year deal signed in mid-2016.

This included live channels as well as library content — non-air shows and movies — offered to Jio subscribers via the Jio Cinema mobile application.

Incidentally, within a week of snapping ties with Jio, ZEE announced a three-year multi-layered deal with rival telecom player Bharti Airtel, where the two companies decided to work closely on creating exclusive video content for Airtel’s video-on-demand app, Airtel TV, and ZEE’s over-the-top (OTT) app, ZEE5.

The deal with Airtel also allowed ZEE to push ZEE5 to over 50 million Airtel TV app users with the option to bundle in subscription cost under Airtel TV’s plan.

According to sources, what helped seal the deal was the fact that Airtel agreed to share consumer insights and data of the users with ZEE as part of the deal.

Punit Goenka, managing director of ZEE, had told ET in an interaction after the announcement that consumer data was critical for a long-term partnership and it was one of the key negotiation points for the Airtel deal. He had also mentioned that ZEE was not getting fair value for its content in the existing deal with Jio, while maintaining that the exit from Jio and partnership with Airtel were two separate decisions.

“This doesn’t mean that we don’t want a deal with Jio. I would love to offer our content on Jio, provided we get a fair value. But going ahead, we will ask for consumer insights also to be part of the deal,” Goenka had told ET.

Sector experts point out that since its commercial launch, Jio has grown to have over 215 million subscribers, and with many of the subscribers consuming live TV on their phones, broadcasters are looking at renegotiating their deals, seeking better commercial arrangements."

32,2018-09-21,Zee,"MUMBAI: At a time when Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is trying to get more transparency in the pay TV ecosystem with its new tariff order, public broadcaster Prasar Bharati’s free-to-air (FTA) platform DD FreeDish is becoming a concern for the TV broadcasters and the distribution industry.

If it gets implemented, Trai’s new tariff order will cap the monthly cable or DTH bill of television households at Rs 130 (plus taxes) for the first 100 FTA channels. However, DD FreeDish is a lifetime free service, which doesn’t have a billing system.

Multiple broadcasters ET spoke with say that DD FreeDish is totally in contrast with Trai’s tariff order and interconnection regulations, and completely un-addressable.

Even Prasar Bharati is not aware of total number of active subscribers on the platform.

“There are various estimates of 22-24 million households using the service. It is impossible to get the exact number as there is no encryption or monthly billing,” a source in Prasar Bharati said.

As per consulting firm EY, the number of DD FreeDish subscribers is expected to reach over 40 million by 2020.

Incidentally, it was the rural reach and growth of DD FreeDish that made broadcast networks like Star India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Sony Pictures Networks India, Viacom18 and others to launch their FTA channels on the platform in the first place. These networks initially were seeking advertising moolah from clients targeting the middle and lower income viewers.

But now Free-Dish is available across the country and has grown to a size where it may become a threat to the entire value chain.

Most broadcasters have converted their FTA channels into pay in order to create bundles and packages under new tariff regime. Broadcasters fear that this will make availability of these channels on Free-Dish an issue with distribution platforms like cable and DTH players."
33,2018-09-21,Zee,"MUMBAI: When the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hired former National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) executive Sudha Balakrishnan as its first ever chief financial officer (CFO), the move was another indicator of the growing demand for specialised financial skill sets from India Inc.

At least 50 listed companies have changed their CFOs in the past 10 to 15 months, according to top executive search firms, and their compensation packages have jumped by over 40%, almost reaching the salary levels of chief executive officers.

CFO compensation is now in the range of Rs 2 crore to Rs 5 crore compared with Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 3 crore two or three years ago.

CFOs are now managing the ‘moral requirements’ of an organisation — in terms of financial governance, said Harsh Goenka, chairman of the RPG Group. They are as involved as CEOs today and it’s extremely important to get a good calibre talent for that role, he said. RPG recently hired a group CFO.

With more companies going public and private equity-funded companies coming of age to build size and scale, the need for CFOs has increased, said R Suresh, founder of INSIST Executive Search, a company that placed 15 CFOs in listed companies over the past few months. The search firm just closed a CFO role for a domestic pharmaceutical company for Rs 5 crore.

Investor expectations from CFOs, tougher compliance requirements and demand from top startups have also led to a churn in the market, search firms and financial experts said.

Compensation packages are starting to match the growing challenges that the new-age CFO has to face, said Santrupt Misra, director, group human resources of the Aditya Birla Group.

“The business environment is complex and they are being brought in from diverse sectors with a bigger profile and skills that compensation packages have to match,” Misra said.

Infosys is yet to pick a successor for MD Ranganath, the CFO who is stepping down in November. Ranganath quit in August, after replacing Rajiv Bansal in 2015.

There is greater pressure on CFOs to be the “investor’s representative” within the company management, officials said. Experts said there is a massive rise in the responsibility of key managerial personnel in the Companies Act and the conservative and risk-averse are moving on.

“The aspirations of CFOs of successful companies are rising dramatically and they are seeking board positions like never before,” said Shailesh Haribhakti, a chartered accountant who is also on the boards of some companies.

“Rather than being information and insight providers and minders of the store, they want to take the strategic calls.”

Experts said CFOs don’t want to remain in conflicting roles that go against their ethics and practices. They prefer to quit than continue. “We are held accountable not only for our tenures but even beyond that,” said a CFO who resigned from a blue chip company recently.

Milind Sarwate, former CFO of Marico and now an independent director on some company boards, said it is clearly a sellers’ market and good CFOs will command greater premium. “There is growing focus on the CFO’s ability to create and sustain corporate value, through both business performance management and governance.

Some of them may be too stressed to continue,” he said. Traditionally, CFOs used to ‘fix’ things. Today, they are more like ‘co-pilots’ in the business and need to be aware of compliance and other issues, said Suresh of INSIST Executive Search. CFOs need to handle the growth of companies by not only bringing in new capital but also allocating growth to various projects.

Several CFOs have quit in the past year, including Gagandeep Singh Bedi of Fortis Healthcare and Chandrakant Karkare of Gitanjali Gems, which is embroiled in the Rs 11,400-crore Punjab National Bank scam. Bharat Kedia of Zee Entertainment Enterprises quit in April and Hathway Cable and Datacom’s Vineet Garg put in his papers in March 2018. 

Indian fashion retail chain Shoppers Stop said its CFO Sanjay Chakravarti stepped down in December. CFOs are willing to take up challenging roles even in smaller outfits, which give them a different work experience and provide substantial compensation.

The financial function is becoming more complex – from a pure accounting and book-keeping role, its getting more strategic and business-oriented.

Infrastructure, energy, healthcare, consumer services and ecommerce are further generating demand for CFOs with a strong focus on fundraising and experience in investor relations.

“Good CFOs, like any good talent, are scarce. Some of the recent churn is suggestive of that. In many situations, CFOs could also have a very different stance to organisational issues. It may also lead to exit decisions” said Prabir Jha, president and global chief people officer at Cipla."

35,2018-09-26,Zee,"MUMBAI: Top television broadcast networks, including Star, Zee and Sony Pictures, have decided not to offer their channels in the basic pack of cable and DTH operators, once the new tariff order for the industry comes into effect, multiple highly placed people have confirmed to ET.

This will be a shock for viewers who were expecting a significant drop in monthly cable or DTH bill, as many of their favourite channels will not be available in the basic pack capped at Rs 130 (plus taxes) by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in its tariff order.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), Viacom18 and TV18 are among networks that have converted all their free-to-air channels into pay channels.

“All of us decided not to offer our channels in the basic pack for two reasons,” an industry executive said.

“First is that there will be a mad rush to be a part of these packages and distribution platforms (cable & DTH) will ask for astronomical carriage and placement fee, and secondly, viewers will not want to go for higher packs if they can get their dose of entertainment at a low price,” the person told ET on condition of anonymity.

Legal experts said this cannot be seen as an attempt to cartelise the industry, because the TV networks have submitted a la carte rates.

“Offering of channels in the base pack or any particular package, is to be done by the delivery platform operator (DPO). The broadcasters are only mandated/required to declare the MRP of their channels and the channels must be offered on an a la carte basis.

These prices are competitive and definitely not likely to be the same,” said Abhishek Malhotra, partner at law firm Bharucha & Partners. “If the broadcasters’ channels do not figure in the base pack offered to the consumer by the DPO, the broadcasters cannot be held liable for price fixations, and definitely not for cartelisation,” he said.

Trai had implemented the tariff order and interconnection regulations in early July after the Madras High Court upheld them.

Star India has challenged the Madras High Court order in the Supreme Court, and the apex court is hearing on the matter.

Except for Star India, most broadcasters have complied with the tariff order by announcing their respective reference interconnect offer (RIO) documents, listing the maximum retail price of channels and bouquet rates.

As per their RIO documents, ZEE, SPN, Viacom18 and TV18 have converted all their free-to-air channels into pay channels.

A top executive at a broadcasting company said the idea was to make the basic pack “unattractive” for subscribers. “For long the pay TV industry has suffered low ARPU (average revenue per user) and we decided not to continue with the same mistake we committed with FreeDish,” the person told ET. “With none of the channels of the top broadcasters available, they (subscribers) will be forced to opt for pay channels at higher price.” At given RIOs, a subscriber will have to shell out Rs 400-450 per month for all the standard definition (SD) channels of top broadcasters.

“We are pricing our driver channels in different genres at or close to Rs 19 as we want to offer a la carte and bouquet options,” a SPN spokesperson said. “It’s a response to the tariff. Can’t comment on what other broadcasters are doing.” Trai has capped a channel’s price in a bouquet atRs 19 per month. ZEE and Viacom18 did not revert to ET queries as of press time on Tuesday.

If the Supreme Court order is in favour of Trai, broadcasters will have to sign their interconnect agreements with cable and DTH companies by December 27 and comply with the new tariff order, which offers consumers choice to get first 100 channels for not more than Rs 130.

“Out of these 100 channels, 26 are mandatory Prasar Bharati channels and we expect a rush among broadcasters to pay to get in the remaining 74 channel slots,” said a senior executive at a national cable company.

“However, a consumer will have the option to select 100 channels of his or her choice as well. They will just have to pay a la carte price of the particular channel.”"

0,2018-10-01,Zee,"Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has announced a new initiative, Arth, a culture quest with an aim to understand and find meanings of the Indic civilisation and discover its soul.

“At ZEE, we have always endeavoured to build new and exciting platforms for the society to connect with the rich diversity of cultures in our country. The core concept of Arth is to bring alive the best of everything that India has to offer across various fields in a manner that is collectively interesting, informative and also enriching,” said Shreyasi Goenka, founder, Arth. “In the years to come we hope to have regional as well as international editions of Arth to take this message across frontiers.”

The cultural festival not only aims to celebrate the essence of Indic thought and philosophy, but also seeks to make it a journey of discovery for the audiences. Bringing together an array of thinkers, scholars, philosophers, indologists, artists and authors.

ZEE has roped in author, historian Vikram Sampath as co director for Arth. “Going beyond shallow jingoism, there is so much about our civilisation and its values that we can be genuinely proud of,” he said. “Unfortunately, these have never been part of curricula or popular discourse, as we seem to love self-flagellation. Arth--through lectures, panel discussions, concerts and performances, will try to contextualise a lot of this traditional knowledge to modern times.”

Beginning with regional editions in Kolkata in December and Pune in January, Arth will culminate in a three-day gala in New Delhi kicking off on February 8th at the lawns of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). Over these three editions more than 250+ scholars, writers, and artists are expected to participate.

The festival will feature artists, writers and individuals including TV Mohandas Pai, Sonal Mansingh, Ricky Kej, Bombay Jayashree, Pt.

1,2018-10-03,Zee,"The domestic equity markets witnessed an impulsive correction in September. As a result, nearly 60 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks breach their respective support at the 200-day moving average (DMA). 

As of September 28, 2018, blue chips such as Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Coal India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, YES Bank, UPL, Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, Grasim Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment and Kotak Mahindra Bank were trading below their 200-DMAs.



When a stock falls below its 200-DMA, it generally means it is trading below its last one-year’s average price. The 200-DMA is most commonly used indicator among traders and investors as it typically represents one working year. 

The average is perceived to be the dividing line between a stock that is technically healthy and one that is not. Furthermore, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving averages helps determine the overall health of the market.

However, when a stock dips below its 200-DMA, it in a way gets oversold and shows signs of recovery and a possible technical pullback. It also offers good entry points to investors from a medium-term perspective.

“What we saw in the market in September was a sharp revision to the mean. Mean revision is a powerful concept wherein we see a market return to its average,” says Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“This usually occurs when the market runs up much ahead of its curve. With regard to largecaps that are trading on, near or below their 200-DMAs, many -- but not all -- have shown signs of bottoming out. In this kind of a market, investors should remain with largecaps and use these levels to make bargain purchases,” he said.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said historical behaviour of a particular indicator or technical tool should be given due importance while making buy and sell decisions in technical analysis and the 200-DMA is not an exception to that rule.

“Technically, we can conclude that stocks that breached 200-day moving averages are in a longer-term downtrend, which may not be practically true because often we find stocks or indices breaching 200-day moving averages for a brief period and then resuming their uptrend,” he said.

For instance, Maruti Suzuki breached its 200-day moving average in May and stayed below it for a couple of days and then resumed its uptrend from the low of Rs 8,255 to move all the way to Rs 9,929. A similar thing happened with HDFC Bank in December 2016. 

“Just a breach of 200-DMA is not an indication to stay away from a scrip, especially if it is from the largecap segment. Along with this average, it is important to consider the larger trend and direction of the market. Unless the entire market itself is reversing, we should not avoid such largecaps. They should be considered an opportunity to create fresh longs by looking at various other technical parameters,” Mohammad said.

However, Ruchit Jain, Technical Analyst at Angel Broking, said largecaps that have breached their 200 DMAs in this correction are likely to continue the underperformance in the near term.

“Traders should avoid bottom fishing in such stocks. A prudent strategy for traders should be to avoid bottom fishing at current juncture. In such times, weekly charts should be given more weightage and only when a reversal pattern is formed on the higher time frame charts, should traders look at opportunities for stock picking,” Jain said. 

He said this market could correct further in the near term and hence, traders should wait on the sidelines and be vigilant on market moves.

Other analysts also said while over half of the largecaps are trading below their 200-DMAs, only a few of them look attractive.

Mohammad said one can look at the HDFC twins and Kotak Mahindra Bank at present, as they appear to have formed a short-term base after breaching their 200 DMAs. Asian Paints also looks good as it is taking support on its 200 DMA.

“As Maruti Suzuki is trading far below its 200-day moving average, traders or investors should avoid this for the time being till the price stabilises at a particular point,” he said.

Vaishnav said stocks from pharma, infrastructure, IT, metals and energy sectors qualify for bargain hunting at this moment. “The main reason for selecting these sectors and leaving the rest out is that they have clearly outperformed the broader market on a relative basis and are improving on their relative momentum when benchmarked against the broader market,” he said.

IT stocks Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies are now trading above their 200 DMAs. Reliance Industries (RIL) and ICICI Bank were also trading above their 200 DMAs as of September 28, 2018."
2,2018-10-03,Zee,"Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has become the first Indian entertainment company to take its over-the-top (OTT) video service, ZEE5, to over 190 countries. So far, only international players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have a global presence of this scale.

The launch coincided with ZEE completing 26 years of operations on October 2.

“Since the time we launched ZEE5 in India earlier this year, our global viewers as well as platform partners have been asking us when we are going to launch globally. As our channels already reach across 72 countries outside India, we knew that a piecemeal approach is not going to work. So, on our 26th anniversary we opened up 190 countries,” Amit Goenka, CEO - ZEE International and Z5 Global, told ET.

As part of the launch, ZEE5 has been made available across the web, android and iOS platforms. “In a few weeks’ time, we will roll out the service across connected devices such as smart TVs, Amazon FireTV stick, and Apple TV,” said Goenka.

Unlike Netflix, which has a unified pricing model across the world, ZEE5 will adopt different strategies for different markets. For developed markets such as the US and UK, the service will be available as a subscription video-on-demand (SVOD), while in a few markets of the Middle East and North Africa, there will be a freemium model. 

“For the premium content, ranging on market’s paying capacity, we have kept subscription between $2 and 10. For some markets, we have kept 100,000 hours of library and ZEE content as ad-supported and a small subscription fee for originals and premium movies,” said Goenka.

Subscribers of the service can also access ZEE5 for no extra cost in the international markets for 15 days.

At present, ZEE5 will offer multi-genre content including news and entertainment across English, Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali, Oriya, Bhojpuri, Gujarati and Punjabi. The service will also have English subtitles and live TV offering, along with the video-on-demand content.

Industry watchers said that with simultaneous launch across the world, ZEE has taken a bold move, but with predominantly Indian content, its acceptance will be constraint to the South Asia Diaspora. 

Goenka said that the company has planned a big official launch in about 5-6 weeks and after a few months ZEE5 will also start producing international originals.

ZEE is already in talks with platform partners in other countries to bundle the service with the existing packs."

5,2018-10-05,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market witnessed the biggest weekly decline in two years, as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lurched sharply lower in Friday’s trade after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained status quo on repo rate in its fourth bimonthly policy review.

A plunging domestic currency and rising crude oil prices remained an overhang while dollar strength against its peers and firming bond yields in the US aggravated FII outflows. 

The 30-share Sensex plunged 792 points, or 2.25 per cent, to 34,377, with 27 stocks ending in the red. The Nifty50 closed 283 points, or 2.67 per cent, down at 10,316. Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, only eight managed to finish in the green.

Rupee hits a new lifetime lowThe domestic currency breached the 74-mark for the first time. Sustained capital outflows amid surging US Treasury yields and firm crude oil prices racing mainly impacted forex market sentiment. At the time of writing this report, the rupee was trading 27 paise lower at 73.86. 


Rs 4 lakh cr investor wealth goneFreaky Friday caused BSE companies to suffer a cumulative loss of Rs 3.79 lakh crore. Since Monday, 3 September 2018, investors have lost Rs 21.96 lakh crore on BSE.

6,2018-10-07,Zee,"NEW DELHI: While an over 4,600-point fall in the BSE Sensex in 25 sessions has baffled one and all, thanks to a host of factors such as a weakening rupee, rising crude oil prices and spiking bond yields, some analysts feel there is more pain left in this market.

With US sanctions on Iran coming in a few weeks and back home five states- Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana – going into assembly elections, volatility is going to increase and the market would, at best, go into a long consolidation. 

In terms of absolute points, the market witnessed biggest-ever fall last week, with the Sensex losing about 1,850 points, or 5.11 per cent, and Nifty shedding 614 points or 5.62 per cent. 

From their August record highs of 38,989.65 and 11,760.20 points, Sensex and Nifty have pared about 12 per cent each. A massive Rs 3.79 lakh crore investor wealth was eroded on last Friday. Since Monday, September 3, 2018, investors have lost Rs 21.96 lakh crore on BSE. 

Macro data, earnings and state election uncertainty will play key roles in the coming week. Let's take a look at the key factors that will sway the market next week:


CPI and IIP dataCountry's industrial production (IIP) data for August and retail inflation (CPI) prints for September will be released on Friday. Industrial production grew 6.6 per cent in July, backed by the good performance of the manufacturing sector and higher offtake of capital goods and consumer durables. While several experts are expecting the IIP numbers to remain the same for August also, a print greater than the last month will infuse positive sentiment in the market. Retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. The numbers may come slightly higher owing to falling rupee and rising crude prices. Some key global macro numbers will also be in the radar of market. Among them, monthly payrolls report and September CPI of the US and China's Caixin Services PMI for September are most important. 


Key earnings lined up for the weekSome corporate bigwigs, including Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Zee Entertainment and Bandhan Bank, will announce their September quarter earnings during the week. Beating Street estimates, TCS had reported a 23.46 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated profit for June quarter at Rs 7,340 crore. FMCG major Hindustan Unilever had reported at 19.17 per cent YoY jump in net profit at Rs 1,529 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Their positive earnings numbers can be a booster dose for the bear-hammered market.

Rupee movement to be keyThe rupee touched the historic low of 74.22 last week. The domestic unit ended nearly 19 paise down at 73.77 on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept interest rates unchanged in a surprise move. There was a market-wide consensus that rates would be increased to stem the fall in the local currency. A falling rupee will distort the maths for country's current account deficit and put the fiscal deficit target in jeopardy. Experts do not expect the rupee health to improve if crude oil prices remain elevated. 


Crude oil shows no signs of relentingCrude oil prices ended higher on Friday after climbing to four-year highs earlier last week, amid concerns that supply will continue to tighten ahead of the imposition of US sanctions against Iran that will come into effect in November. Saudi Arabia and Russia have said they would increase the output slightly to ease the disruptions from restrictions on Iran. Meanwhile, the US is considering a waiver for countries that are cutting their imports of Iranian oil. As per news agency Reuters, the US is actively considering waivers on sanctions it will reimpose next month for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil. India has said it would buy 9 million barrels of Iranian oil in November. 


Bond yields fallingDomestic as well as the US bond yields will be another factor influencing market sentiment. RBI’s status quo on repo rate cheered the bond market as the benchmark government bond yield dipped 13 basis points to close at 8.03 per cent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. Short to medium term rates fell 10-40 basis points in the bond mart.

The US dollar and bond yields have been on an upward trajectory, backed by a positive outlook for the US economy and solid jobs report. Last Friday, US bond yields jumped to their highest levels in many years. A further increase in treasury yields will aggravate capital outflow, putting pressure on an already weak domestic currency. 


Nifty’s technical outlook weakThe Nifty50 hit a two-year low in an eventful session on Friday and formed a ‘Three Black Crows’ pattern on the daily chart, which suggests the market is not done with the correction yet. Bearish candles on the daily and weekly scales suggested the bears were holding a tight grip on the market, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. 

""During the week’s action, the Nifty formed a big bear candle with good volumes and it was the third consecutive strong bear candle, which indicated that the bears were having a strong momentum and the Nifty could continue to show further negative momentum,"" HDFC Securities said in a report. ""Now all technical evidence is in favour of the bears and we could see further weakness in the coming days. Overall, we maintain a negative stance as long as the index stays below the previous day’s high. Downside targets for the index are 9,900, 9,300 and 8,700, which are key retracements of the last rise that began from 6,825. However, if a bounceback starts, then Nifty could test 10,800 to 11,000 levels,” the report said."

17,2018-10-09,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Zee Entertainment has returned to Reliance Jio's digital TV platform, around two months after Subhash Chandra-led firm had pulled out of JioTV app. ZEE Entertainment Enterprises and Reliance Jio Infocomm on Tuesday announced that an agreement has been achieved to release ZEE's entire content library on Jio's platforms, with immediate effect. 

""We are delighted that our esteemed customers will now have access to the engaging and diverse content from Zee Group. At Jio we are committed to providing our consumers the best of content from India and the world in our quest to accelerate digital inclusion in the country,"" Jio Director Akash Ambani said in a statement. 

Zee had signed strategic partnership with Jio's competitor Bharti Airtel in August after quitting Jio's platform. 

 Return of Zee to Jio's platform will give the broadcaster potential access to over 227 million subscribers of the 4G telecom service provider. 

""The expansive reach of Jio enables us to entertain a larger base of consumers with an appetite to consume content-on-the-go,"" ZEE International & Z5 Global CEO Amit Goenka said. 

Under the new pact, ZEE Entertainment and Reliance Jio will jointly market the content offering by leveraging their consumer touchpoints, the statement said."
16,2018-10-09,Zee,"Zee Entertainment is slated to announce its financial results for the quarter ended September on Wednesday. 

Brokerage HDFC Securities sees domestic advertising revenue growth of Zee Entertainment (ZEEL) to be healthy at 19 per cent. It further believes that strong performance to be led by market share gains in flagship channels and continued strength in regional markets. 

HDFC Securities sees 20.30 per cent, 19.40 per cent and 17.80 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in adjusted profit after tax, EBITDA and net sales, respectively, of ZEEL in Q2FY19.

Market participants should zero in on the outlook on advertising and subscription revenue growth as well as investment and outlook on digital business.

Edelweiss Securities projected around 19 per cent YoY ad growth for Zee Entertainment in Q2FY19 on a comparable base of around 3 per cent. It also expects ZEE’s EBITDA margin to remain strong at 31 per cent despite investments in new channels and ZEE5.

Ad revenue growth is likely to be aided by resumption in ad spends, particularly by FMCG companies. International subscription is expected to decline marginally by 1 per cent YoY on a negative base of 16 per cent. ZEE's new OTT platform ZEE5 is also likely to begin contributing to the company's top line. EBITDA margin growth is expected to be flat on account of higher content cost incurred for the launch of new regional channels, costs incurred in the movie business and significant investment & marketing for ZEE5. PAT growth is estimated to decline 28.2 per cent YoY, primarily due to an exceptional item of Rs 134.6 crore in Q2YF18, according to Edelweiss."

27,2018-10-10,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has posted a strong 24.9% jump in its operating revenues in the quarter ended September 30, 2018.

Total revenue for the quarter swelled to Rs 1,975.9 crore, compared to Rs 1,582.1 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. The company said the growth was driven by the strong performance of domestic broadcast and other businesses.

ZEE’s operating profits or EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter grew by 37.6% to Rs 675.7 crore, while EBITDA margin stood at 34.2%. In the year ago period EBITDA was at Rs 491.2 crore.

ZEE’s expenses, meanwhile, also grew by 19.2% to Rs 1,300 crore, from Rs 1,090.9 crore in the year ago period.

However, a tax expense of Rs 262.4 crore (compared to Rs 148.9 crore in the previous year quarter) dragged down ZEE’s consolidated net profit by 38.2% to Rs 386.7 crore. In the year ago period, ZEE had posted a net profit of Rs 625.5 crore.

“Our broadcast business continues to grow at an impressive pace as evident from the domestic advertising and subscription revenue growth numbers. We continue to consolidate our viewership share which is driving our market leading growth,” said Puni Goenka, MD & CEO, ZEE. “We believe that our broadcast portfolio has the potential to further increase its market share and the launch of new channel in Kerala will surely help it.”

As per Goenka, the advertising and subscription revenue growth will be aided by the scaling-up of digital business and the growth outlook for both remains strong. “This robust performance also gives us room to increase our investments in digital, if required,” he added.


Strong revenue growth
ZEE’s consolidated advertising revenues grew by 22,7% to Rs 1,210.6 crore in the quarter under review, compared to Rs 986.7 crore in the year ago period.

The company said ad revenue was driven by the robust demand across key categories for TV advertising and digital service ZEE5’s contribution to advertising revenue. While the TV advertising revenue growth was led by the continuous increase in network’s market share over the last few quarters, ZEE5’s growing user base and time-spent will aid the overall growth, ZEE said.

Total subscription revenues in Q2 grew by 21.3% to Rs 608.2 crore. The domestic subscription revenue grew at 26%, while international subscription revenue has show a marginal 1.9% improvement.


Growth of ZEE5Since the launch of the revamped offering under the new brand ZEE5 in February, ZEE’s OTT service has been the fastest growing digital entertainment platform. ZEE claimed that it has become the No. 2 platform in India.

In September, ZEE5 had 41.3 million monthly active users (MAU), recording a growth of 190% compared to April’18. Over the same time, video views grew 340% and videos viewed per user almost doubled, leading to a significant improvement in user engagement, the company said.

At present, ZEE5 users are spending an average of 31 minutes per day on the platform as per the company.

“ZEE5 is the fastest growing entertainment platform in the country. In a little over six months, it has become the second most popular OTT platform. With a monthly active user base of 41 million and an average daily time spend of 31 minutes, it is growing faster than our expectations,” said Goenka. “Despite the strong initial performance, I believe it is just the beginning of a long digital journey for us. With a strong pipeline of original content and partnerships with key players in the digital eco-system, we are confident that ZEE5 will become the default entertainment platform for digital audience.”"

33,2018-10-11,Zee,"A fair value of Indian markets is still 10-15% away, but there is value in IT, pharma and export-oriented auto stocks, 
Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

Do you really think that US equities are seeing a big trend reversal or is it just sentimental knee-jerk reactions? 
I really do not know that much about US equities. My reckoning is fair value for the Indian market. It is at least 10%, perhaps 15% away. I have been saying this for the last one year or so that the market is significantly overvalued. Yes, we have corrected meaningfully but I still think that the Nifty and the Sensex is overvalued. 

The biggest pocket of overvaluation in the Indian market was in financial services stocks. Their valuations made no sense at all a month or so ago. I still think there is a further derating to come in wholesale funded lenders in particular but there is still value in IT. There is lots of value in pharma and export oriented auto stocks are still worth buying. There are pockets of value in the Indian market but the overall market and especially wholesale funded lenders are very significantly overvalued.


At what point would you say India holds value?
I do not think anybody can invest by looking at the market day to day. That is just for getting stomach ulcers rather than getting rich. It is exactly for this reason that legends like Robert Kirby created the Coffee Can Portfolio where you buy your bunch of high quality stocks such as HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Marico and you hold them through. There is no way on earth where you can buy stocks and react to events like last week or a day like today. You will never make any money. You just give yourself heartburn, blood pressure and stomach ulcers.


How do you get the conviction to buy at any price point? 
One of the key parts of our jobs -- whether you are on buy side, sell side, in the media or an investor, is to decipher the signal, the underlying structural trend from the noise. The signal in our country is that the Indian investor has given up the ghost of making money from real estate and land and so on and has decided that financial assets is the way forward. 

There might be a temporary lull in that because of what we are seeing in the stock market and the bond market at the moment but the structural trend towards financial assets is not going to go away in India. 

Secondly, our stock market is fortunate and the economy is fortunate that there have been a dozen and a half companies in the Indian market who over the last decade have shown that they can systematically allocate capital and generate solid results. The names that I mentioned, Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, Marico are three of examples but I will say there are dozen-and-a-half strong portfolio of great companies which consistently allocate capital in good times and bad times. So you focus on the underlying signal, the signal is real estates’ days are behinds us. 

Whatever is left of residential real estate as an asset class will be turned into rabble over next six months as our housing finance companies face funding challenges and hence the shift towards financial assets is here to stay. 

Secondly, we do have high class companies in the Indian stock market with high class management teams, great capital allocation and the focus has to be on investing in them. It could be TCS in the IT sector. It could be Marico in FMCG. It could be HDFC in the banking sector but you have to focus on quality rather than trying to time market and figuring out what will happen with the Fed and in America and with our own policies.


TCS is slated to come out with its numbers today. How much of the good news is already priced in? 
In October-November last year, exactly a year ago, I started banging the drum on IT. My reckoning is the sort of currency tailwind that the IT sector has, will lead to business wins. It is impossible to believe that given the sort of currency tailwinds the Indian IT sector has got, they will not see sharply higher business wins in the coming quarters. 

Secondly, unless a miracle saves India, the rupee is likely to fall further. If you had to look at one sector in the Indian economy where there is a complete competitive reset, it is Indian IT. 

Within Indian IT, focus on the scale gorilla, focus on a company with 30% ROCE almost a 100% dividend payout ratio. In times like this, let us not try to second guess its PE multiple and say whether it is fully valued or not. There is enormous competitive tailwinds to Indian IT sector and it will be sort of a second guessing of a very high order to say TCS is fully valued at this juncture. 


Is midcap IT likely to match up with the performance of some of the frontline names considering secord quarter is traditionally a strong quarter for IT?
You are right. This is in a way the analogue of midcap stocks in the broader economy where they do not have any tailwinds anymore. Midcap stocks in the broader economy, excluding IT and pharma, have negative tailwinds as their margins get crunched and as they lose top line growth as well. Midcap IT is likely to do well. If I had to choose one player in the middle segment of IT, I would go for L&T Infotech. All these guys will get currency tailwinds but L&T Infotech is a well managed firm and I think there is good reason to believe beyond producing good results L&T Infotech will use this currency tailwind to strengthen its competitive position over the next three, four quarters.


The RBI paused on rates this time around and that kind of unnerved the markets as well. They are going to do calibrated tightening but they are also concerned about inflation.
Let us break it into two parts; our authorities both in Delhi and in Mumbai deserve a lot of credit. There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes to ensure that the Indian economy and the financial market get a soft landing. After all, once interest rates start rising and the economic cycle starts decelerating, there will be trouble for wholesale funded lenders. 

Our authorities deserve a lot of credit for working very hard behind the scenes to ensure a soft landing for the financial system. That being said, I am still not sure that investors how they have recognised just how big a reset the NBFC valuations deserve to become aligned to reality. 

Almost every wholesale funded lender in India can give up the ghost of growing its balance sheet over the next 12 months. It is not going to be possible. At best, well run wholesale funded lenders can keep their loan book at broadly the same level as it is today but they will become an ex-growth sector and I do not think valuations reflect that as yet. 

The incredible runup in the stock prices yesterday suggests that investor in wholesale funded lenders are still on cool aid and have not come to recognise the fundamental reset that valuations for this sector deserves. Our authorities are doing their job, it is the investors that need to come to their senses with regards to this very large sector of in the Indian stock market.


The consumption theme always finds favour in the market despite high valuations as we step into an extended festive season. Is Zee Entertainment’s numbers telling you that the consumption story is far from done?
I agree with you. Wherever consumption is not funded through credit, by taking loans from banks and NBFCs, we will be in a pretty good shape. Whether it is FMCG or electricals, that element will hold up quite nicely. Where the challenge will kick in obviously is the consumption sector where the spend is heavily financed by borrowings from banks and NBFCs. So, car and truck OEMs look vulnerable from a top line growth perspective.

34,2018-10-13,Zee,"The domestic equity market had a roller-coaster ride during the week gone by, owing to both global as well as domestic worries. The equity indices finally managed to settle in the green, thanks to significant gains in the week’s final trading session on Friday. 

The rupee hit a fresh record low of 74.48 against the dollar during the week, but rebounded smartly to log biggest one-day gain in 29 months to rise 55 paise and close at 73.57 to the dollar.

Globally, stock markets witnessed severe selling pressure on the back of growth worries because of trade tensions and expectation of further liquidity tightness amid rate hike by global central banks. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned last week that sustained trade tensions could slash Asia’s economic growth by up to 0.9 percentage point.

Amid these worries, Dalal Street scripted a smart bounce on Friday. The 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 356.59 points, or 1.04 per cent to 34,733 for the week, while the 50-share NSE Nifty gained 156 points, or 1.51 per cent to settle at 10,472.

39,2018-10-23,Zee,"MUMBAI: Imagine being able to smell the food that’s been cooked on a cookery show or the perfume of the protagonist of a daily soap and being able to order it online with a click of a button. 

This is not a science fiction or a thing of distant future. With the lines between technology and entertainment blurring at a faster pace, consumer facing companies are looking at solutions to engage viewers in new and innovative ways. 

And making its first breakthrough, India’s home-grown entertainment company Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has secured a US patent for a ‘five-senses’ tech platform that allows the television audience to touch, feel, or smell products.

Developed by the Silicon Valley-based Zee Media Lab, the platform aims at bringing the five-sense experience to the living room with home entertainment. Users would be able to touch, feel, smell and experience products on television. Viewers will also be able to order any product that is being consumed or used by the protagonists on the screen, at the touch of a button.

“We launched Zee Media Lab in the Silicon Valley in 2016 with the vision to be future ready. There is no point in denying that the overall media landscape is changing very fast and we need to be ready for five years from now,” Amit Goenka, CEO, Z5 Global, told ET. “We set up the lab to understand what shape media technology convergence is taking and how we can be a part of the next revolution.”

The platform is built on technologies such as 3D audio, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), digital scent, holograms, and touch.

Goenka said that the company is exploring partnerships with hardware manufacturers in the US, the UK, Israel and other countries and is expecting to commercially roll out the product in the next 9-12 months.

“We have already started developing content that will give that immersive experience, and also developed a tool to convert existing content into five-sense experience. We will lunch experience centres in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru soon to showcase partners and people what can be achieved through this platform,” Goenka said."
40,2018-10-23,Zee,"Overseas portfolio investors started the current round of major selloff on Dalal Street towards the later part of the September quarter, which turned the market highly volatile.

While foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been withdrawing from most emerging markets ever since the US economy started firing and bond yields there turned more attractive, soaring crude oil prices and a falling rupee only hastened this selloff. 

FPIs offloaded stocks worth Rs 6,000 crore in the domestic market in Q2, and at least double that amount in September and October.

Curiously, at the same time, they were busy picking stocks from sectors like chemicals, abrasives, auto ancillary, select private and public banks, pharma and information technology.

Within the BSE500 basket, FPIs raised stakes in almost half or over 200 stocks during the quarter. Among notable names, Aarti Industries saw FPI holding go up to 4.20 per cent at the end of September quarter from 3.80 per cent at the end of June quarter.

Among others, FPI holding went up from 4.02 per cent to 4.11 per cent in Gujarat Fluorochemicals, from 5.47 per cent to 5.59 per cent in Atul, 2.36 per cent to 2.45 per cent in Himadri Speciality Chemicals, 23.95 per cent to 24.41 per cent in Jubilant Life Sciences and 11.83 per cent to 11.87 per cent in Pidilite Industries. 

Shares of Aarti Industries and Atul have rallied 10 per cent and 17.78 per cent, respectively, so far in 2018, whereas those of Himadri Speciality Chemical and Jubilant Life Sciences are down 19 per cent and 13.51 per cent, respectively.

As many as 489 companies from the BSE500 index reported their shareholding patterns for the September quarter till October 21, according to corporate database Ace Equity. 

Foreign portfolio flows into equities turned positive in July and August after an outflow of more than Rs 20,000 crore during the first quarter of 2018-19. However, FPI outflow of Rs 10,824 crore in September against net investment of around Rs 4,040 crore in July and August set the clock back, resulting in net outflow for second quarter. 

Several banks also saw FPI holding go up during the quarter. AU Small Finance Bank, DCB Bank, The Jammu & Kashmir Bank, The Karnataka Bank, Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Central Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Union Bank of India all recorded increase in FPI holding during the quarter.



Select beaten-down construction and real estate players also managed to attract overseas investors money during the quarter. Among them were included Dilip Buildcon, DLF, Indiabulls Real Estate and Sunteck Realty. These shares, incidentally, were down up to 53 per cent on year-to-date basis till October 19.



FPIs also did a fair bit of shopping in the NBFC space, raising their holdings in Bajaj Finance to 20.08 per cent from 20.05 per cent. The stock is up 24 per cent so far in 2018.

FPIs also bought additional shares of Capital First, IFDC, Manappuram Finance, Reliance Capital, Shriram City Union Finance, Multi Commodity Exchange of India and Tata Investment Corporation. Shares of these companies are down up to 60 per cent this calendar.

FPI holding went up from 54.34 per cent to 55.52 per cent in Indiabulls Housing Finance, 52.42 per cent to 54.47 per cent in Fortis Healthcare, 47.41 per cent to 48.70 per cent in Shriram Transport Finance, 42.90 to 45.37 per cent in Care Ratings, 43.08 to 43.17 per cent in Cyient, 40.69 to 42.37 per cent in UPL, 42.20 to 42.29 per cent in Bharti Infratel, 40.30 to 42.17 per cent in Team Lease Services, 40.73 to 42.17 per cent in NIIT Technologies and 40.77 to 40.81 per cent in Zee Entertainment.

However, Bharat Financial Inclusion, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Apollo Hospital Enterprise, YES Bank, PVR, Sobha, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Tata Power, Piramal Enterprises Delta Corp and Radico Khaitan were among 268 stocks where FPIs offloaded significant amount of shares during Q2.

They reduced holdings in HDFC from 72.89 per cent to 72.19 per cent and in HDFC Bank from 40.86 per cent to 39.18 per cent.





On the other hand, these overseas portfolio investors kept their holdings intact in Bank of Maharashtra, Corporation Bank, Forbes & Company, Greenply Industries, Indian Overseas Bank, Ratnamani Metals & Tubes, Solar Industries and The New India Assurance."

  RBL, Kotak Mahindra and IndusInd Bank will come out tops, Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Capital, tells ET Now. Mehta also stays focused on private banks, NBFCs, consumption-oriented stories and select pharma and IT companies.Edited excerpts:


Tech Mahindra is holding out. We have seen a slow build-up in appetite for technology stocks ever since the biggies reported their numbers. Has this earnings’ quarter rerated tech more than what we witnessed three months back?
Not really. Tech stocks have moved up and we have seen a follow-through in terms of quarterly numbers for several tech companies. There have been a few misses like Mindtree, and some of the other midcap tech companies but by and large, tech companies have delivered on what investors have been expecting. 

Going forward, it may get challenging for them. No doubt. the rupee benefit may come through for a quarter or two but thereafter sustaining the kind of growth rates which they have displayed in the first two quarters of this year may get difficult. The end point is that we are dealing with single digit or mildly double digit or just about 10-12% type of growth rates and that has been priced into the PE multiples.

I do not expect tech stocks to outperform going forward. There may be a few exceptions depending upon the business models and the likes of say Tata Elxsi or LTTS or for that matter, some of the product companies like Intellect or Nucleus Software which have a differentiated business model. But larger IT companies like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and Mindtree may continue to be market performers or slight underperformers as the cycle will also slow down depending upon how the US economy shapes up. 

So, while tech stocks have moved up, I do not expect that they will follow through and outperform over the next six to 12 months the way they have over the past 12 months.


It is almost that ICICI Bank has gotten rerated after its earnings under the new leadership. After the sharp rebound from the lows of Rs 340-350, is the stock a buy?
It is a nice trading buy and you could expect this bounce to continue for a few more weeks, maybe even a quarter. A lot of expectation will build up for the December quarter for ICICI Bank in the hope that they will deliver another decent quarter. Base effect also benefits ICICI Bank and on the whole, some of the uncertainty surrounding the top management has been resolved. 

You could see a trading bounce, may be 10-15% upmove from these levels, but beyond that, we still prefer the retail-focused private banks likes of HDFC Bank, Kotak or IndusInd Bank, maybe even RBL which have consistently delivered at the time when ICICI and Axis Bank have underperformed. 

While we may see a technical bounce in ICICI Bank over a period of two-three years, our money still remains with the compounders. 

The compounding stories are the likes of HDFC, Kotak Mahindra or some of the other banks which I named. These are now available at attractive valuations whereas ICICI valuation ratios have moved up and even after having such a spectacular quarter, if you compare the net interest income and the core profit growth of ICICI Bank versus some of its peer group, the peer group still fares far better. 

In the short to medium term, ICICI Bank may remain in focus and outperform but clearly, with a two, three year or even a five-year type of a view, the other private sector banks like HDFC Bank, RBL, Kotak Mahindra and IndusInd Bank may outperform ICICI and Axis Bank.


What are your top two or three high conviction ideas in the broader markets and among the midcaps?
We remain quite committed to NBFCs like Bajaj Finance or L&T Finance. Also, we are quite positive on some of the consumption oriented stocks, especially media stocks. The Zee Group companies have come out with a good set of numbers, Zee Entertainment, Zee media and Zee Learn as well. 

At the same time, private sector banks like RBL or even IndusInd Bank which has corrected considerably from its highs because of the amount lent to IL&FS can be considered at this point of time. We remain focussed on private sector banks, NBFCs, consumption-oriented stories and select pharma companies, especially those engaged in contract manufacturing like Jubilant Life Sciences or Suven Life Sciences. We have seen excellent numbers coming from Divy’s Lab as well. These also could be considered by investors. 

Broadly the strategy is to go for banks, NBFCs, consumption oriented and within pharma and IT, companies which have a differentiated business model. In case of IT, companies that are focussed on products or technology or design and in case of pharma, those which are focussed on contract manufacturing have a very high backward integration into APIs and strong position in select molecules. 

That broadly explains our strategy and the stock picking process.


Why not auto and specifically Maruti, after a 33-34% correction from higher levels? From short-term perspective, which are the concerns that are keeping investors away?
Passenger cars grew in a cycle and we have seen a fantastic upcycle over the past few quarters, notwithstanding GST and demonetisation. Passenger vehicles have done very well over the past two-three years. Same is the case with two-wheelers but that’s the base effect and some of the headwinds related to higher interest rates, higher insurance costs and factors like higher petrol costs are acting as headwinds for the sector.

In may be one or two quarters, soft sales will come through from the entire industry whether it is Maruti in four-wheelers or Eicher or even TVS Motors in the two-wheeler space. That is the reason why despite the market picking up, investors just want to wait and watch. In next five-six months, the monthly sales figures also may be disappointing. The automobiles companies, especially Maruti and the others, tend to move up and react to monthly auto figures. 

The Street is pricing in slower growth as far as monthly sales figures are concerned and lets this base effect get normalised. We have some clarity on petrol and diesel prices as well as insurance norms. These need to be absorbed by the marketplace and thereafter once we return to double- digit volume growth, we may see the auto and the auto ancillary stocks coming back into reckoning. 

Till then, it is better that investors who are already there, remain invested in these blue chip companies as they will turn out to be great wealth creators over the next three to five years or so. Fresh investors would find that there is value and growth in sectors other than auto at this point of time.


How are you looking at the consumption play ahead of the festive season? Which pocket are you betting on most?
It is going to be a mixed festive season. You may see soft sales coming through from the auto companies but FMCG companies, food companies and to an extent appliance companies may do well. The company to watch out for would be Havells India. They have come out with a good set of numbers for the September quarter and the management is also quite positive on the prospects going forward. 

They have integrated the new acquisition -- Lloyds -- pretty well and once the factory starts producing, you may see expansion of profit margins over there as well. This is one company we are quite positive on going forward. It is a company in which we and our clients are invested in.


Do you believe that there is a trading opportunity in OMCs or should one stay away totally?
You can trade in them from time to time but they are not investment grade companies because of the kind of position that they are in. 

Looking at the price to book or dividend yield, you could consider buying into the oil marketing companies but once the oil prices start moving up, then there are certainly challenges and it is difficult to call even as far as their performance is concerned. There is a high degree of volatility in their earnings even when oil prices are stable. I find it difficult to get a handle on OMCs. There are better sectors from a long-term investment perspective for investors to focus on.


What about aviation? We are now stepping into what is called traditionally the strongest of the quarters, the holiday season, the year end winter months?
We have been positive on aviation companies but they have disappointed big time -- all the three companies. Although we may remain invested for some more time, we are looking for exit opportunities and as and when we see the prices of oil declining and some amount of semblance of stability and lower competitive intensity coming in the aviation stocks, you may seen an upswing but those are all levels to selloff. 

This is not a great industry for investors to be in over a longer period of time. The competitive intensity will remain strong even going forward. It is somewhat similar to the telecom sector where there is no pricing discipline within the existing players and while we may see good volumes they do not really get captured into the top line and bottom line value creation from a business or a stock market perspective. It is best to avoid aviation stocks, at least the new investment. Existing investors should remain invested and if they see 30-40% rise from these prices and that certainly is likely after one or two good quarters and some amount of positive developments on the industry front. 

On the pricing side, we could see the stocks rallying but those are all levels to exit. Again, like oil marketing companies and telecom, aviation will become a sector you can trade in but not a nice long-term secular growth oriented sector you can invest for three to five years or so."

42,2018-10-31,Zee,"In a judgement that will have far reaching implications on the Indian broadcast industry, the Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea from Star India, paving the way for the implementation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s new tariff order for the broadcast sector. With a go-ahead from SC, Trai will now be able to enforce the tariff order and interconnect regulations, which will entirely change the way broadcast deals were done in India since the advent of the private satellite television.

The new tariff order, industry experts said, may force broadcasters to shut down weaker channels and initiate further consolidation in the cable, DTH as well as in the broadcast sector. For starters, TV broadcasters so far used to sign fixed-fee deals with the delivery platform operators (DPOs), including cable and DTH players, charging a lump sum amount. The DPOs, on the other hand, used to charge a monthly fee from the consumers, without giving them the actual option to select channels of their choice.

This all will change with the new tariff order, which will force TV broadcasters to announce maximum retail price (MRP) of their channels individually and of bouquets, which will allow a consumer to select and pay only for the channels she wants to watch.

Broadcasters and cable operators have welcomed the order.

Subhash Chandra, chairman, Zee Entertainment, said that the SC order is the best thing that could have happened to the industry, players and the consumers. “Supreme Court’s order has empowered the consumers across the nation... it is for the first time in 26 years that such a strong and positive step has been taken to eradicate the lack of transparency in the entire value chain,” Chandra said.

While many in the industry feel that it will be a nightmare for the service providers to comply with the required initial timelines and activities and implement the order, Rajan Gupta, president of All India Digital Cable Federation, said that this is the watershed moment the industry has been waiting for. “We feel that the new framework will bring in much-needed transparency, parity, promote exercising of choice for the consumer and ensure orderly growth of the sector,” he said.

For broadcasters, the biggest challenge will be sustaining the channels with lower viewership as those will get dropped completely.

“Better brands and better products will get rewarded and the new order will benefit companies like Times Network,” said MK Anand, MD and CEO of Times Network, who believes that the move will also help broadcasters to move from a B2B to a B2C model.

According to Anand, the status quo in the cable and satellite distribution favoured the entrenched order. “The biggest inefficiency in the current system is the ground level collection and onward flow of value at the LCO level. This bottleneck will be cleared, which will improve the flow through the system and eventually benefit the industry and the consumer.”

With Tuesday’s judgment in the appeal filed by Star India against the orders of the Madras High Court dismissing its challenge to Trai’s jurisdiction to notify certain portions of the Interconnect Regulations and Tariff Order dated March 3, 2017, the near two year-long battle between the broadcasters and the regulator has come to an end.

Abhishek Malhotra, partner at Bharucha & Partners, said that the broadcasting business will undergo a massive operational shift with the order. “We will now see an MRP rate instead of price ceilings. For the first time, DPOs shall have to notify their reference interconnect offer. Most importantly, the consumer will finally know the MRP of the channel/s that she is subscribing to,” Malhotra said."

1,2018-11-18,Zee,"Analysts have been conservative about increasing their price targets on stocks these days given that corporate earnings growth revival continues to remain elusive and investor sentiment is turning cautious. At the same time, they have been prompt in cutting target prices at the slightest evidence of stress. Asset management companies, insurers and healthcare players are among the stocks that saw the biggest increase in consensus target prices after the September quarter results, while companies in banking, telecom and housing finance spaces saw the biggest cuts to target prices. ET takes a look at 10 stocks that have seen the biggest increases or cuts in target prices by analysts after the September quarter results.


HDFC ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY
The largest AMC in India reported a 79% jump in profit after tax at Rs 368.3 crore in the quarter ended September. The stock is trading at three times its issue price of Rs 1,100. While the AMC has seen one of the biggest target price increases in recent weeks, many believe the upside is limited. “HDFC AMC is the best placed to capitalise on the long-term growth opportunity in India’s mutual fund industry...But near-term upside is limited, given the recent re-rating,” said IIFL Securities in a note.


WHIRLPOOL OF INDIA
Analysts said Whirlpool’s second quarter results were ahead of estimates. “Q2FY20 was a robust quarter for Whirlpool, likely boosted by pre-festival sales in September 2019 as well,” the brokerage said. Whirlpool’s net profit rose 63.8% to Rs 128.7 crore in the September quarter. Though the consensus target price increased by 26% after September quarter results, analysts believe valuations are stretched at 40 times FY21 estimates.


MANAPPURAM FINANCE
The company’s consolidated profit jumped 82% in the September quarter to Rs 402.3 crore, which led to a 20% increase in consensus target price. “Pick-up in gold-loan in the coming quarters, higher gold prices and favourable regulatory environment will act as a positive catalyst. We believe that the company has the potential to deliver 20% plus RoE (return on equity) driven by RoA of 4% plus,” said IDBI Capital, retaining buy with a target price of Rs 195.


NARAYANA HRUDAYALAYA
Net profit of Narayana Hrudayalaya rose 233.80% to Rs 45.33 crore in the quarter ended September as against Rs 13.58 crore in the same quarter last year. “NARH remains the best-positioned hospital to benefit from the formalisation of large latent demand. The past three quarters have shown better execution and improved margins. Management has also said it is not looking at further capex,” said Jefferies in a note last week, retaining its buy rating and target price of Rs 340.


DR LAL PATHLABS
The company’s consolidated profit in the September quarter rose 41.4% at Rs 81 crore. “We believe that the long runway and good visibility on growth and high return on capital employed (RoCE) should continue to support premium multiples. We believe that the long runway and good visibility on growth and high RoCEs should continue to support premium multiples,” said Citigroup, raising its target price on the stock to Rs 1,700 from Rs 1,475.


INDIABULLS HOUSING FINANCE
Indiabulls Housing Finance reported over 32% decline in its consolidated net profit to Rs 702.18 crore in the September quarter. Morgan Stanley has cut its target price by 49% to Rs 210 as it continues to find the risk-reward unfavourable given the uncertainty on multiple counts and high stock volatility. “The stock has been and should remain volatile given numerous swing factors — news flow around the litigation outcome, asset quality, and funding access. We expect significant downside in our bear case,” said Morgan Stanley.


RBL BANK
RBL Bank’s net profit slumped 73% in the quarter ended September as bad loans weighed. Analysts do not rule out further negative surprises on the asset quality front. “The management has guided for almost similar slippages in the next quarter. Further surprises on asset quality cannot be ruled out given the high exposure to stressed corporate sectors like NFBCs, real estate, construction and power, and higher exposure to riskier credit card/ microfinance sector in a slowing economy,” said Ambit Capital, retaining its sell rating with a target price of Rs 269.


ZEE ENTERTAINMENT ENTERPRISES
Zee reported muted second quarter results. The company reported a 6.9% rise in net profit for the second quarter. “Material growth is likely to resume once demand from FMCG, auto, among others, revives...though the valuation is attractive now, resolution of promoter’s pledged shares remains key trigger for the stock,” said Edelweiss in a note. The brokerage has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 399.


MAHINDRA LOGISTICS
The company reported a decline of 41% in September quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 11.2 crore. “Plummeting auto volumes remain a near-term obstacle, but robust growth in non-Mahindra, non-auto and warehousing segments, and robust client addition are encouraging long-term developments,” said BOB Capital Markets in a post results note. The brokerage has maintained buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 460.


DISH TV INDIA
The DTH operator reported a consolidated loss of Rs 96.4 crore in September quarter. “DTH business may remain under pressure from NTO and also from cable operators led by Reliance. Stock is trading at 3.7 times EV/EBITDA which is a 60-70% discount to its historical average, making it attractive from an M&A perspective,” said HSBC, retaining hold rating and target price of Rs 34."

4,2018-11-19,Zee,"EuroKids, a leading playschool chain in the country controlled by US private equity firm KKR, is in preliminary talks to acquire Asia’s largest preschool chain Kidzee from Zee Learn for Rs 1,000–1,200 crore people aware of the development said.

The deal, if it goes through, will help Subhas Chandra-promoted Essel Group further deleverage its consolidated balance sheet, sources said.

The group that owns broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises, direct-to-home service DishTV and specialty packaging firm Essel Propack is battling with a debt repayment issue of close to Rs 7,500 crore, across its diversified businesses.

New York-headquartered KKR — which bought 92 per cent stake in Euro-Kids for about Rs 1,500 crore in September — is believed to have made a non-binding offer to acquire educational portfolio of Zee Learn, particularly Kidzee, and is awaiting a response from the management, people cited earlier said.

“EuroKids and Kidzee complement each other, so that’s the key target,” said a person involved in the talks. “Adding Mount Litera into the negotiations could take more time, something the Zee Group can ill-afford at this time.” The person requested anonymity because the talks are in private domain.



The transaction involves demerging the preschool business from the listed parent company Zee Learn and subsequently hiving it off through a slump sale, sources said.

An Essel Group spokesperson said both strategic and financial investors have shown interest in its education vertical Zee Learn and that the group is “actively evaluating” those offers.

“The divestment of Zee Learn Ltd is in line with the overall asset divestment process undertaken by the group,” the person said. “Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements.”

EuroKids declined to comment.

Zee Learn has more than 1,900 Kidzee preschools in more than 750 cities across the country. It also has the country’s fastest-growing K-12 school chain, Mount Litera Zee Schools (MLZS), with more than 120 schools in 110 cities in the country, besides Zee Institute of Media Arts, Zee Institute of Creative Art, and Himgiri Zee University, an UGC approved state private university in Dehradun.

EuroKids is looking for aggressive expansion of its portfolio.

In an investor call in October, Punit Goenka, CEO at Zee Entertainment, had said, “We have been approached by some marquee investors, both strategic and financial, for the Zee Learn stake and we are considering their offers seriously.”

The group is already selling noncore assets in infrastructure and financial services as part of its efforts to pare debt. It may also sell part of promoters’ shares in flagship Zee Entertainment pledged with lenders.

Essel Group in an exchange filing in September had said the group is in steady and progressive dialogue with all lenders and had sought an extension of deadline for repayment of debt to few mutual funds and nonbanking institutions.

Zee Learn more than doubled its consolidated revenue for the year ended March at Rs 549 crore against Rs 272.50 crore in FY18. Its profit after tax rose to Rs 83 crore from Rs 49 crore in the previous fiscal. Its revenues from educational services and related activities stood at Rs 398 crore in FY19 against Rs 186 crore in FY18. Kidzee’s FY19 Ebitda was around Rs 70 crore.

The current market capitalisation of Zee Learn is Rs 755 crore. Promoters own 57.17 per cent of the company, of which 82.74 per cent is pledged with lenders.

Zee Learn shares have fallen 37.84 per cent in the past one year, significantly underperforming the benchmark Sensex, which gained 12.61 per cent during the same period .

In February 2018, Zee Learn had acquired a controlling 44.5 per cent stake in MT Educare, a Mumbai-based firm that runs the popular Mahesh Tutorials coaching classes, for about Rs 200 crore to expand its footprint.

“The overall financial performance has remained stable keeping in view the acquisition of MT Educare which has supported the revenues and profitability,” Brickwork Ratings had said in a note in July. “The total debt has increased to Rs 379 crore in FY19 versus Rs 258 crore in FY18.”

Zee Learn’s Mount Litera Zee School partners with local educational trusts and offer services such as school set up assistance, teacher training, assessment, teaching materials, student learning resources, and branding. It also runs five CBSE company-owned company-operated schools and an IB school at BKC Mumbai.

EuroKids is one of India’s largest education services providers in the preschool and kindergarten to K-12 segments. Its portfolio brands, including EuroKids, EuroKids DayCare, Kangaroo Kids, EuroSchool and Billabong International, serve more than 120,000 students from 1,115 preschools and 35 K-12 schools across five countries.

There is a wide potential for foreign investments in Indian education that is estimated to reach $144 billion by 2020 from $97.8 billion in 2016. The country allows 100 per cent foreign direct investment in this space under automatic route. An estimated investment of $200 billion is required to achieve the government’s target of 30 per cent GER for the education sector by 2020, according to Zee Learn annual report."

14,2018-11-20,Zee,"MUMBAI: The promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) are looking to sell up to 16.5% more of their stake in India’s biggest listed media company to repay lenders.

Of the total promoter stake earmarked for the sale, up to 15.72% will change hands in block deals on Thursday.

According to a term sheet seen by ET, three promoter companies - EMVL, Cyquator and Essel Corporate - will sell 77 million, 61 million and 11 million shares, respectively, totalling 15.72% of the equity base. The stake will be sold at an indicative price of Rs 277 per share, translating into a 10% discount to Wednesday’s closing price of ZEE at Rs 307 apiece, the term sheet document showed.

At the floor price, the value of the 15.72% stake is worth $582 million (nearly Rs 4,132 crore).

Citigroup is the book runner for Thursday’s proposed block deals.

In a separate filing with the stock exchanges, ZEE promoters said that out of the planned sale of up to 16.5% equity, the promoters are seeking to sell around 2.3% stake in ZEE to OFI Global China Fund, a subsidiary of the Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund that had earlier bought into the Mumbai-based media company.

On July 30, ZEE’s promoters had reached an agreement with Invesco Oppenheimer to sell up to 11% stake for Rs 4,224 crore (Rs 400 per share): In this transaction, the promoters had completed the sale of 8.7%.

Separately, banking sources told ET that some foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have already committed their participation in the block deals.

“These deals are almost done. ZEE promoters will sell 15.72% via block deals and the remaining will be sold off-market. They will continue to hold 5% in the company, with Punit (Goenka) continuing as MD and CEO,” a highly placed source told ET.

Promoter Subhash Chandra and his family office have to repay more than Rs 7,000 crore they owe to domestic lenders, including mutual funds, and Russia’s state-backed lender VTB.

ET had earlier reported that ZEE promoters were talking to three FIIs to sell 10-11% stake. However, as the stock price fell, the promoters now have to sell more stake in the company.

As of September 30, ZEE promoters owned 22.37% stake in ZEE, out of which 96% is pledged with the lenders. VTB Capital has a charge of more than 100 million shares, worth 10.71% of the company’s equity.

After the next round of sale, ZEE promoters will continue to own 5% stake in the company, out of which around 1.1% will remain pledged, the company said.

A ZEE spokesperson had earlier said that Essel Group has appointed investment bankers to lead the divestment process of media and non-media assets, and that the group is also in a “constant process of evaluating proposals from the prospective partners,” keeping the interest of its lenders.

ET reported on Tuesday that private equity firm KKR-backed EuroKids is in preliminary talks to acquire preschool chain KidZee from Zee Learn for Rs 1,000–1,200 crore. Earlier, in an investor call, CEO Goenka had said that the promoters have recently been approached by some marquee investors to buy a stake in Zee Learn, where the Essel Group owns 57.18% stake.

Apart from KidZee, the company also owns a network of K-12 schools (Mount Litera) and Mahesh Tutorial."

Despite negative global cues on Thursday, NSE Nifty opened with marginal gains, but failed to capitalise on the gapup opening, as it witnessed selling pressure in the later half of the day.

The index made lower high and lower low and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. Formation of a negative candle after a Doji candle doesn’t bode well for the bulls. However, the overall chart structure is still bullish and till Nifty holds above 11,850, we maintain a positive stance on the market for a target of 12,050 and 12,103 levels.

On the flipside, immediate support is placed at 11,920, 11,850 and 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest (OI) was at 11,900 followed by 11,800 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200 strike. We have seen some Put writing at 12,000 and 11,900 strike, while Call writing was visible in 12,000-12,200 zone. Option data suggests a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200 levels.


India VIX fell 1.22 per cent to 14.97 level. Now it needs to continue to hold below 15 to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty continued to hold above 31,200 for a second consecutive session and formed a small red bodied candle on the daily scale. The index made higher lows for a fifth consecutive session and ended on a flat note. The index moved within the territory of Wednesday’s trading range and thus formed an Inside Bar pattern on the daily scale. Till it holds above 31,200, we may see extension in ongoing optimism towards 31,500 and then 31,750. On the downside, supports are placed at 31,000 and then 30,800.

Nifty futures closed fell 0.39 per cent to 11,971. Builtup of long positions were seen in Zee Entertainment, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bosch, Cadila Healthcare and L&T, while shorts were seen in Vodafone Idea, Sun TV, Auro Pharma, Bata India and SAIL.

Experts Take
""Nifty traded lackluster and settled marginally lower, taking a breather after the recent upmove. It opened flat and remained range-bound thereafter, however, movement on the stock-specific front kept the traders busy. Most sectoral indices ended lower in line with benchmarks and the broader indices too remained under pressure. We strongly feel that market is set for profit taking or consolidation prior to further rise. Traders should limit their naked leveraged trades in the index and book profits on every rise. In case of decline, 11,800-11,850 zone would act as a cushion in Nifty. Stocks, on the other hand, would continue to see movement on both sides thus maintain extra caution in the stock selection"" -- Ajit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking.


Global markets

The scrip jumped 12.40 per cent to close at Rs 345.25 on the BSE. During the day, it zoomed 14.99 per cent to Rs 353.20.

In terms of the traded volume, 70.32 lakh shares of the company were traded on the BSE and over 10 crore units on the NSE during the day.

Subhash Chandra-led cash-starved Essel Group on Wednesday said it is planning to sell a 16.5 per cent stake in its flagship ZEE Entertainment Enterprises to financial creditors to meet its loan repayment obligations.

""Essel seeks to sell up to 16.5 per cent stake in ZEEL to financial investors to repay loan obligations to certain lenders for whose benefit such shares are currently encumbered and who have consented to such share sale by it,"" the company said in a statement.

In September, the group had sold 11 per cent in ZEEL to Invesco-Oppenheimer fund for over Rs 4,224 crore and then retired debt worth Rs 4,000 crore."
18,2018-11-21,Zee,"Shares of Zee Entertainment hit the upper circuit in opening deals on Thursday after reports said 14.52 crore shares of the company changed hands in a block deal on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The Subhash Chandra-led Essel group on Wednesday said it was planning to sell 16.5 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) to financial investors in order to repay loan obligations to certain lenders of the group.

After this transaction, the promoter stake in Zee Entertainment will be reduced to 5 per cent, which means that media baron Subhash Chandra will lose control of Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

According to a term sheet seen by ET, three promoter companies — EMVL, Cyquator and Essel Corporate — will sell 77 million, 61 million and 11 million shares, respectively, totalling 15.72 per cent of the equity base. The stake will be sold at an indicative price of Rs 277 per share, translating into a 10 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of Zee at Rs 307 apiece, the term sheet document showed.

Zee, considered to be the pioneer of television entertainment industry in India, was launched by Subhash Chandra in 1992. Ever since the launch year, the company expanded operations to enter packaging, infrastructure, education, precious metals, finance and technology sectors.

At the floor price, the value of the 15.72 per cent stake is worth $582 million (nearly Rs 4,132 crore). Citigroup is likely the book runner for Thursday’s block deals.

Earlier this year, Essel Group sold up to 11 per cent in Zee Entertainment to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for Rs 4,224 crore.

Value investors Safir Anand in a tweet said, “The news on Zee promoter stake sell while retaining control on business is a big positive. The overhang on the pledge stands settled. Oppenheimer and others now in majority. As it is business had no issues and was doing well.”

The shares of the company closed 12.40 per cent higher at Rs 345.25 on BSE."
25,2018-11-21,Zee,"Mumbai: The domestic stock market ended flat on Thursday, but stock-specific movements kept the traders busy throughout the day. While telecom stocks such as Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel plunged despite some government relief, Zee Entertainment spiked on stake sale by the promoters.

Stocks fell in line with weakness in global peers after US legislation on Hong Kong raised investor apprehension that a US-China trade deal would not be sealed anytime soon.

Sensex closed 0.19 per cent or 76.47 points lower at 40,575.17, while the 50-share Nifty dropped 0.26 per cent or 30.70 points lower at 11,968.40.

“The consolidation phase below 12,000 continued. The region around previous all-time high of 12,100 is witnessing some profit booking. It is not at all unexpected to witness some retracement near all-time highs. Broader structure continues to remain positive and the uptrend is intact. Near term corrections towards the support zone should be utilized to build long positions,” said Manav Chopra, Head Research - Equity, Indiabulls Ventures.

DHFL recovers in late trade

34,2018-11-22,Zee,"Shares of Zee Entertainment extended their rally for a third straight session after several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in the company as the promoters sold stock to repay loans.

Shares of country’s biggest listed media company were sold in block deals on the NSE on Thursday at Rs 304 apiece. While the promoters are now left with just 5 per cent stake in the company, they raised more than Rs 4,500 crore from the deals to repay lenders.

Citi and JP Morgan were the book runners for the block deals.

Among the domestic funds that bought into the stock were SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential, Sundaram, Axis Mutual Fund, and the Edelweiss Group. Among the other overseas funds were Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, Fidelity, and Nomura.

According to ICICIdirect, one key positive takeaway form the stake sale was removal of overall stock price led volatility owing to pledge issue. “However, we note that sale to financial investors was a tad disappointing as strategic investors coming in would have added value to the stock. On the operating front, the aggressive spending to build a content library as well as related party dues remains a spoiler,” the brokerage house said.

The brokerage house further added that the near-term concerns include softer advertisement outlook due to macroeconomic challenges as well as possible risks of tweak in NTO policies.

Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team. However, on the other side it added that net cash in the balance sheet fell to Rs 1,480 crore in Q2FY20 from Rs 3,240 crore in Q4FY18.

The shares of the company closed 3.66 per cent higher at Rs 357.90 on BSE."
27,2018-11-22,Zee,"MUMBAI: Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans.

Shares of India’s biggest listed media company were sold in block deals on the NSE on Thursday at Rs 304 apiece. While the promoters are now left with just 5 per cent stake in the company, they raised more than Rs 4,500 crore from the deals to repay lenders.

Among the domestic funds that bought into the stock were SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Sundaram, Axis Mutual Fund, and the Edelweiss Group. Among the other overseas funds were Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, Fidelity, and Nomura.

OFI Global China Fund, a subsidiary of the Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund that had earlier bought into the Mumbai-based media company, also picked up a 2.3 per cent stake. The total divestment by ZEE promoters stood at 16.5 per cent of their shareholding.

“I am overwhelmed by the positive response received from our investors,” Punit Goenka, MD and CEO of ZEE, said in a statement. He disclosed that the book was oversubscribed approximately three times.

Three promoter companies, EMVL, Cyquator and Essel Corporate, sold 77 million, 61 million and 11 million shares, respectively. The floor price was set at Rs 277 per share, at a 10 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 307 apiece, but the deals were carried out at Rs 304 apiece.


After the sale of shares, many broking firms upgraded the ZEE scrip, which rallied about 15 per cent intraday to close at Rs 343 on NSE, up 12 per cent from their previous close.

Morgan Stanley India noted that heightened volatility in the ZEE stock in the past few months could be largely attributed to the sale of pledged shares and uncertainty with respect to the sale of the remaining pledged shares. However, with promoters now selling a 16.5 per cent stake, a large portion of the promoter debt could be resolved.

“This reduces the risk of pledged stock coming to the market, so we lower our bear case probability,” the report said.

Proceeds from the sale will go toward repayment of more than Rs 7,000 crore the promoters owe to their lenders. With the stake sale, around 1.1 per cent of the promoters’ stake (amounting to 22 per cent) will remain pledged.

The Essel Group is also in talks to divest other media and non-media assets to clear debt."

30,2018-11-22,Zee,"Analysts have started re-rating Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) after Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra said he will sell 16.5 per cent stake in the company to investors. The average target price on the stock has been raised to Rs 405 against the current market price of Rs 345 as the stake sale reduces the risk of pledged stocks flooding the market.

Essel promoters will use the stake sale proceeds to repay a large portion of the debt. Shares of Zee rallied 12.44 per cent to Rs 345.35 on Thursday.


“All in all, it is a better outcome than what it looked likely at the peak of the Essel Group’s debt crisis. Zee’s execution remains healthy in a challenging environment.” said GV Giri, analyst, IIFL Securities. “Over time, US media players could consider acquiring a stake in Zee, potentially triggering an open offer; but this is still some time away.”"

NSE Nifty opened on a flat note on Friday, but soon reversed course and extended losses, as the session progressed. The index fell sharply in the first half of the day, but due to some pullback in the later half, it managed to close a tad above the 11,900 level.

The headline index made a lower high and lower Low and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. For the second straight week, Nifty has traded in a narrow range of 171 points, which is the narrowest weekly range in the last six months. It formed a Doji candle on the weekly scale for the third week in a row, which clearly shows lack of momentum in either direction.

Now, the index has to hold above 11,850 levels to witness an upmove towards 12,000-12,103, while on the downside, major support remains at 11,850 and then 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest was at 11,900 followed by 11,800 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,100 strike. We have seen meaningful Call writing at 12,000 and then 11,950 strike while minor Put writing was at 11,850 and 11,800 strike. Option data suggests a trading range between 11,800 and 12,100 levels.

India VIX fell 0.72 per cent to 14.87. VIX needs to continue to hold below 15 to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty corrected by 0.76 per cent and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. The index, which concluded the week with a marginal gain of 0.33 per cent, formed a Doji candle on the weekly scale. It continued to make higher highs and higher lows for the sixth consecutive week, and thus the overall trend remains positive. Till the time, it sustains above 30,800, we maintain positive stance for an upside momentum towards 31,500–31,800, while next support is below 30,800 is placed at 30,350.

Nifty futures fell 0.51 per cent to 11,913 level. Builtup of long positions were seen in Zee Entertainment, Equitas, Eicher Motors, Bosch and HDFC, while shorts were seen in Infosys, Hexaware, Wipro, Ambuja Cement and TCS.

36,2018-11-22,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Heavy selling IT and select banking counters dragged the benchmark indices down by over half a per cent on Friday.

Besides, telecom counters, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, extended their fall for a second straight session after the recent runup. On the other hand, Zee Entertainment extended rally after promoters sold stake in the firm.

Overall, the 30-share Sensex settled 215.76 points down at 40,359, while the 50-share Nifty index closed 54 points lower at 11,914.

Joseph K Thomas Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management said: “The weakness in banking and IT stocks were the major contributing factor behind weak market. We believe it is largely an effect of profit booking in some key counters. The support received from the recent runup in key telecom counters was also missing today.”

Here is the lowdown on the movers and shakers of Wednesday’s session on Dalal Street:


Telecom stocks extend fall
Shares of telecom majors including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea plunged for the second straight session after the recent rally. The former closed 2.09 per cent down at 417.35, while the latter settled 1.36 per cent lower at Rs 6.55. AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets said, “The government proposal is just a deferment of payment. AQR waiver only will be a lifeline for telecom.”


IT index cracks the most
Heavy selling in Infosys (down 2.89 per cent) and TCS (down 2.20 per cent) dragged the BSE IT index (down 2.21 per cent) the most among the sectoral indices on the exchange. Other sectoral indices including Telecom, Capital Goods and Consumer Durables also cracked more than half a per cent.


Midcaps and smallcaps outperform
Broader market outpaced benchmarks as BSE Smallcap closed 0.03 per cent down at 13,353, while Midcap index settled 0.14 per cent down at 14,738. With a fall of 4 per cent each, IGL and Castrol India stood among top losers among midcaps. Mphasis, Concor and Bayercrop also retreated between 2-4 per cent. On the other hand, Gayatri Projects, Uco Bank, Zee Learn and Tejas Network declined 7-10 per cent in the smallcap space.


Who moved my Sensex
Infosys wiped off the most 75 points from the Sensex. HDFC Bank, TCS and Kotak Mahindra Bank also wiped off nearly 150 points together from the benchmark index. On the other hand, HDFC, RIL, and ITC capped the downside.


Most active stocks
Zee Entertainment was the most active stock in terms of transacted value on the NSE, followed by RIL, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Infosys, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and RBL Bank. In terms of transacted volume, Vodafone Idea topped the charts. Others among the top five included YES Bank, Zee, Dish TV, Indiabulls Housing and SAIL.


43 stocks flash ‘sell’ signal
As many as 43 stocks crossed below the MACD signal line to flash ‘sell’ signals. They included HDFC Bank, Hudco, Raymond, Divi’s Lab, DCB Bank, Kesoram Industries and Reliance Industries, among others. When the MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal and indicates that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when the MACD crosses above the signal line, the indicator gives a bullish signal. MACD gave buy signals for IDBI Bank, Infibeam Avenues, Adani Green and Jagran Prakashan.


Zee rallies for third session
Shares of Zee Entertainment extended their rally for a third straight session after several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, picked up stakes in the company as the promoters sold stock to repay loans.

26,2018-11-22,Zee,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 3.50 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained a Buy rating on 
Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 7,390. The brokerage increased its consolidated earnings per share of Maurti for FY20 by 18 per cent to factor in the possible increase in the sales volumes. While the near term demand headwinds persist, Maruti is best placed to weather these headwinds, particularly BS6 transition due to limited price inflation, the brokerage said. Shares of Maruti Suzuki closed at Rs 7,017 apiece on Thursday, down 1.9 per cent.

• SBI Cap has maintained its hold rating on 
Marico with a target price of Rs 335. The brokerage belives core Indian hair oil revenue of Marico will be under stress along with Saffola edible oil. Further, expansion in adjacent categories is likely to outgrow overall company growth. With several FMCG companies noting weak demand, the brokerage expects the topline growth guidance of Marico’s core portfolio to be at risk. Shares of Marico closed at Rs 356 apiece, up 0.3 per cent on Thursday.


• Edelweiss maintained its buy rating on 
Zee Entertainment Enterprises with a target price of Rs 443. According to the brokerage, advertising growth in FY21 is likely to pick up due to anticipated revival in gross domestic product and benefits from corporate tax cut. Further, the ongoing promoter stake sale is likely to remove the promoter pledge related overhang on the stock. Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises closed at Rs 343, up 11.7 per cent on Thursday.

• Axis Securities has given a buy rating on 
City Union Bank with a target price of Rs 239. The brokerage said it remains positive on account of its consistent earnings and stable asset quality. Slower loan growth and asset quality stress could impact in the near term but the recent tax cuts will aid the bank. City Union Bank reported a tepid second quarter earnings on account of slowdown in loan growth and compressed net interest margins due conscious focus on credit quality and pricing pressures. Shares of City Union Bank closed at Rs 215, up 0.5 per cent on Thursday.

• ICICI Direct has maintained a Buy rating on

IPO update: CSB Bank sails on Day 1
Kerala-based CSB Bank’s IPO got fully subscribed on the first day of bidding on Friday. The initial public offering (IPO) received bids for 1,20,87,450 shares against the total issue size of 1,15,54,987 shares, reflecting 1.05 times subscription, according to data available with the National Stock Exchange.

On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.
Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team.

RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike. With a market value of Rs 9.80 lakh crore, share of the company signed off the week with gains of over 5 per cent at Rs 1,546."
44,2018-11-25,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra, the media baron who rode India’s tumultuous media and entertainment scene to make Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) one of India’s biggest media groups, on Monday quit as chairman of the company which he founded in 1992 after watching CNN make a big splash with satellite television. He will, however, continue as a non-executive board member, ZEE said in a statement.

The resignation comes days after Chandra’s family saw its stake in ZEE fall to 5% following a series of mistimed and expensive infrastructure bets. Chandra’s investment companies had borrowed heavily from mutual funds and non-bank firms to fund road and renewable energy projects.

The family had pledged ZEE shares to obtain these loans but was forced to sell and repay after lenders threatened to offload them in the market in case of a default.

The Chandra family’s stake in ZEE has come down to 5% now from 41% a year ago while the shares have fallen 27% year to date. On Monday, they ended 5.33% lower at ₹339, ahead of the resignation.


NEW DIRECTORS
ZEE said in a statement that Chandra stepped down to fulfil the requirements of Regulation 17 (lB) of SEBI Listing Regulations, which mandated that the chairperson of the board shall not be related to the managing director or the chief executive officer of the company.

The ZEE board inducted three independent directors – former finance secretary R Gopalan, ex-head of Intelligence Bureau Surinder Singh and art aficionado Aparajita Jain in lieu of two independent directors Niharika Vora and Sunil Sharma as well as nominee director of Essel Group Subodh Kumar. After reconstitution, the board now has six independent directors besides two members from the Essel Group —Chandra and his son Punit Goenka.

“The reconstitution of the board was to strengthen and induct independent members with varied experiences to build value and provide a strong signal to the existing and new institutional investors who have recently reposed their faith in the intrinsic value of the company,” the statement said.


TAKEOVER TARGET?
The resignation seemingly creates a vacuum at the top of the board. Punit Goenka continues to be the MD and CEO but the board will soon have to appoint a chairman and is expected to do so in its next meeting. It also raises the question of whether Chandra’s resignation and the fall in the family’s holding will entice a hostile bid from rival media and entertainment groups.

What makes ZEE attractive is its 20% market share in India’s entertainment market, programming content in 12 languages and a billion plus viewers across more than 100 countries. An attractive price could make investors hand over shares to a new bidder though hostile takeovers have rarely succeeded in India and the news and entertainment business is a highly sensitive sector.

Chandra is likely to continue to enjoy political heft and clout despite the apparent loss of control of ZEE. The long battle to save the company and prevent a precipitous collapse in share price and stake may have sapped his financial strength but the new bidder will also have to contend with ZEE’s existing investors, especially ones who have been around for a long time and are considered close to the Chandra family.

Invesco Oppenheimer, now the largest shareholder in ZEE with almost 19% stake, has been a ZEE investor since 2002. For any interested party seeking control of ZEE, it is essential to reach out to the fund. Another large chunk is with Singapore governmentbacked GIC, which now owns around 8.5%.

“The basic rule for any hostile takeover is that you pick up 26% and then do an open offer. In ZEE’s case, there are only a few big institutional investors like Invesco Oppenheimer that can deliver a big block. But given their long relationship (with the promoters) and the fact that they rely on the promoter family to run the business, it is difficult to imagine,” said advocate Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S&R Associates and an expert on M&As.

“ZEE is an attractive opportunity, but a hostile takeover is highly unlikely. For all practical purposes, the promoters will continue to run the show,” said Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research, IDFC Securities.


THREE-DECADE REIGN
Chandra’s move brings an end to a successful, near-three decade reign as boss of Zee Entertainment, India’s first satellite television company. He successfully built ZEE into an entertainment conglomerate in face of stiff competition from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing’s Star, which was later taken over by Rupert Murdoch, and the local arm of Japan’s Sony Corporation. He launched India’s first dish TV firm and promoted a controversial, short-lived T20 cricket league, forcing the Indian cricket board to come up with the now-famous Indian Premier League (IPL).

“Chandra has been the original media entrepreneur in India...He is the towering personality, and even if he steps down today, I am sure a newer innings is waiting to happen. He has got too much fire in his belly. He is too young to hang up boots,” said Sameer Nair, CEO, Applause Entertainment. As former CEO of Star India, Nair often sparred with Chandra’s Zee in the late 1990s and early years of the 21st century."

Analysts’ views
''The market touching all-time high is a clear reflection of expectations of continued reforms by the government, especially with regards to critical issues such as disinvestment and labour reform. Since a lot of money has been sitting on the sidelines and considering the fact that there has been improvement in margins for most corporates in the last quarter, market sentiment for next six months is quite positive,” -- Prakarsh Gagdani, CEO, 5Paisa.com.

“Bullish sentiment is likely to continue and Nifty is likely to scale 12,400. Markets have climbed a wall of worries and have hit fresh all-time high, which signals sheer strength. We have maintained our bullish stance for a while. The 12,000 level is the immediate support zone. Traders should utilise dips towards support zone to build long positions,” -- Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst with Indiabulls Ventures

58,2018-11-27,Zee,"Mumbai: India’s largest entertainment company Star India slipped into the red in the financial year ended March 2019 with a Rs 1,216.13-crore loss as against a net profit of Rs 287.69 crore a year ago, according to its recent filings with the registrar of companies (RoC).

The company followed a ‘conservative accounting principle’ and booked expenses of Rs 4,000 crore on the Indian Premier League (IPL) during the fiscal under review. Star India suffered losses despite a 35% increase in revenues during the year. An e-mail query sent to Star India remained unanswered till press time Tuesday.

According to the consolidated financial statement, sourced from business intelligence platform Tofler, the company’s total revenue from operations stood at Rs 12,341 crore in FY19 as against Rs 9,149 crore a year ago. This includes advertising revenues of Rs 7,311 crore – up 49% – and distribution revenue of Rs 4,128 crore – up 9%. Revenue from other sales and services also doubled to Rs 902 crore.

Total expenditure also jumped 58% to Rs 13,707 crore from Rs 8,694 crore a year ago. The spike in costs is attributed mainly to a 66% increase in programming and operating cost to Rs 10,296 crore, a 34% jump in employee cost to Rs 1,198 crore, and a 57% jump in marketing cost to Rs 1,168 crore.




ET estimated that the company recovered around Rs 1,750 crore from advertising revenue on the 11th edition of the IPL. FY19 was the first time when Star India had both TV and digital rights of the cash-rich cricket league, after it outspent its rivals with a break-the-bank bid of Rs 16,347.5 crore for five years in 2018.

“In FY19, Star had one full IPL season and almost 20% of the 2019 edition, which was advanced due to the general elections. As per its accounting practice, Star has recorded over Rs 4,000 crore expenses on IPL in FY19, which has put a drag on its balance sheet,” a source said.

Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research at IDFC Securities, said that Star has done a great job in monetising IPL. “While there is a significant jump in ad revenues because of the way it monetised IPL, there is also a drag on the profitability, which is as per the nature of any sports rights. In the initial years, you will lose money, while by the end of the cycle, you hope to recoup and make profits. The same is visible on the cost side,” he said.

Also contributing to the loss was Star’s digital streaming service Hotstar, which individually reported a net loss of Rs 558.38 crore on a revenue of Rs 1,112.74 crore. Senior officials had earlier said that the company believes in the future of Hotstar and is committed to invest for long-term gains.

According to Dokania, Hotstar will continue to be a near-term drag, but it is a necessary one. “Digital business requires heavy investments in content and technology. That should not be too worrying for Star,” he said.

During the financial year, Star India invested Rs 832.32 crore in Novi Digital, the holding company of Hotstar. Ajit Mohan, the Hotstar chief executive quit to join Facebook as India head during the year.

Star India’s highly profitable regional entertainment business also witnessed a 9% drop in net profit to Rs 271.85 crore, down from Rs 298.22 crore. The regional business’ revenue was up 11% to Rs 1,445.10 crore during the fiscal.

Star India’s topline puts it ahead of its peers like Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) and Viacom18, but in terms of operating profit, ZEE leads by a wide gap. In FY19, ZEE had posted an operating profit of Rs 2,564 crore, SPN Rs 780 crore and Viacom18 Rs 199 crore. Star India’s operating loss stood at Rs 1,336 crore in the fiscal, as per data sourced from RoC."

62,2018-11-27,Zee,"New Delhi: Two former directors of Zee Entertainment - Subodh Kumar and Neharika Vohra - who resigned from its board, had raised concerns over several issues, including Rs 2,200 crore film advance given in 2018-19, according to a regulatory filing by the firm.

They also had flagged issue of no action on large outstanding from group firms Dish TV and Siticable for content.

The company, however, said its Board of Directors have noted that all of the issues raised by the resigning directors have been duly discussed, deliberated and acted upon from time to time in the previous committee/ board meetings in which the said directors were also present.

On Monday Zee Entertainment Entrprises Ltd (ZEEL) had announced that Independent Directors Neharika Vora and Sunil Sharma along with Non-Independent Director Subodh Kumar have resigned.

ZEEL said Sharma had informed that his resignation followed the sale of shares by the promoter group and reconstitution of the board.

On the other hand, Vohra and Kumar raised many issues and cited them as reasons for their resignation from the board.

According to a BSE filing by ZEEL, the two directors flagged the issue of ""film advances given in 2018-19 to the tune of Rs 2,200 crore"", to which the company responded by saying the information has already been disclosed in its annual report and clarified in various investor interactions.

Kumar and Vohra also raised the matter of ""a scheduled bank"" appropriating ""Rs 200 crore of the company's fixed deposits towards promoter loans and the management did not take legal action"".

ZEEL, however, said issues pertaining to the wrongful revocation of the bank guarantee stand resolved with the company having being secured by the promoter companies and appropriate legal notices were sent to the bank at the relevant time.

The two directors also stated that no action was taken on large outstanding from Dish TV and Siticable for the content supplied by ZEEL.

The company, however, said, ""the same have been secured by definitive plan and situation is being strictly monitored as instructed by the Board and also discussed in various analyst calls"".

They also raised the issue of non-implementation of certain decision of the board meeting held on October 17, 2019 relating to treasury operations, to which ZEEL said it is ""exploring options to withdraw these deposits in a phased manner without effecting the long term relationship with these banks"".

Vohra and Kumar also alleged ""laxity in spending of CSR amounts given to a related party foundation/trust"" but the company said CSR funds have been allocated in compliance with law and necessary certification was obtained.

The two directors also brought up the matter of a bank writing to all directors in October 2019, that a subsidiary of the company had guaranteed the repayment of certain loan given by the bank to a related party.

ZEEL said it has a ""legal opinion to state that the Company is not liable and in any event there has been no enforcement of the 'guarantee' by the bank, other than to write letters, including to all the directors"".

In their reasons for resignation, Vohra and Kumar also highlighted a matter relating to a ""letter received from a PMS (Portfolio Management Services) entity holding preference shares of the company raising questions regarding build up of related party balances and advances for content acquisition"".

To this, ZEEL said, ""Audit of the issues pertaining to related party transactions and advances is underway by auditors"".

In the regulatory filing, ZEEL said the company, ""while accepting the resignations and intimating the exchanges about the same, has discussed the same in detail in the board meeting held on November 25, 2019"".

The issues raised by the resigning directors have been duly discussed, deliberated and acted upon from time to time and disclosed in the public domain in financial statements and investor calls which are available on the company website, ZEEL said."

69,2018-11-28,Zee,"Typically, long term money comes into the market because of the view that the next two-three years could be good but unless and until we see hard core data points coming from the corporate sector, the sustainability of this could be question mark, says Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.



I thought India was slowing down, but overseas investors have poured more than Rs 44,000 crore in the domestic equity markets since September 1!For the large part of the year, we have seen a good amount of selling by FIIs. Also, year till date, India is up almost about 11-12% versus the US markets -- be it Dow or S&P or NASDAQ -- which for that matter are up anywhere 20% to 30%. Then there has been some kind of a cool-off in the bond yields. Plus, in the last two months, because of the steps taken by the government, there has been some revival. So these flows have reversed. But I do not think we should read too much into that at this point of time. 

Typically, long term money comes into the market because of the view that the next two-three years could be good but unless and until we see hard core data points coming from the corporate sector, the sustainability of this could be question mark.


Two independent and one non-independent directors resigned from Zee Entertainment citing a whole host of issues. Are these of concern for a stock that has already borne the brunt of a lot of concerns on promoters’ pledged shares and Subhash Chandra resigning from the helm?The market is extremely sensitive to any news pertaining to corporate governance. There is going to be a bit of discomfort. The important question to ask is are these new concerns? I would say that a large part of this news was already known. In the previous board meetings, they have been deliberated and discussed. So it is not as if a new revelation has come today. 

Then there is the fact that because of certain corporate governance issues, Zee for the last six to eight months had underperformed big time. Now with the recent deal, Mr Goyal has actually reduced the stake and the new investors are coming in. We have to see what kind of numbers we really looking at over the next six to 12 months. That is a call one would really have to take rather than worrying too much about the recent development. 

There might be a knee jerk reaction but there may not be a case for a severe correction in Zee at this point of time. 


How are you looking at RBL Bank just now?After the severe underperformance and recent recovery, if the company can go through a fund raising, the quantum and the pricing needs to be seen, that would definitely add to a lot of comfort because we have seen a big rally across the bigger financial names. The SBI Card IPO is also coming up. We might see some more positive traction for RBL Bank from current price point.

There might be a knee jerk reaction but there may not be a case for a severe correction in Zee at this point of time.-Hemang Jani


It seems telecom is not going anywhere?Well it would not be fair to say that it is not going anywhere. We have seen both Bharti, Reliance and even Vodafone have gone up quite a bit in the last 7-10 days, ever since the news of a likely moratorium relaxation by the finance ministry has been talked about. The question is that after this kind of a run up, are we really looking at any substantial rerating for the sector. A part of this positive news has already been discounted in stock prices of Bharti and it might consolidate.

For Reliance Jio, depending upon how the actual price hikes are taken and what kind of numbers we see over the next two or three quarters and more importantly depending upon the demerger or getting some investors into the platform, that could be a potentially bigger trigger and which is what the market is sensing at this point of time. We need to be overall positive on the telecom sector because the sector is under-owned by both institutional and retail investors. There might be a desire to chip in, whenever there is an opportunity over there."

63,2018-11-28,Zee,"HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential MF and Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund have received payments from the Essel group after the promoters sold stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) to repay lenders. The recovery is on loans that were given to Essel, with ZEE shares used as collateral.

In a filing with the stock exchange, HDFC Mutual Fund said it has received Rs 167 crore toward part repayment of debt instruments, along with interest. The outstanding exposure of HDFC MF to this debt reduced to Rs 13.7 crore from Rs 1,156 crore. ICICI Prudential AMC has received its entire principal of Rs 267 crore along with interest, while Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has received Rs 840 crore.

“With this repayment, the aggregate market value of the outstanding exposure… which was Rs 1,156 crore as on March 31, 2019, stands substantially reduced to Rs 13.7 crore as on November 26, 2019, which is adequately covered by listed shares of DishTV India Ltd,” HDFC Mutual Fund said in a note to investors.

In the case of ICICI Prudential mutual fund, two open-ended schemes had exposure to the Essel Group, with ZEE shares used as collateral.

“Pursuant to the sale of shareholding by the promoters of ZEEL, the above schemes of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund have received repayment of the total principal amount invested along with the accrued interest thereon. Subsequently, none of the schemes of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has any investments in debt instruments issued by the promoter group companies of ZEEL,” ICICI Prudential Mutual fund said in a statement to investors.

A spokesperson at Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund said it received Rs 840 crore, which included the interest accrued on the principal advanced.

However, three schemes of Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund have exposure to Adilink Infra and Multitrading, an Essel group company that defaulted on loan repayment commitments. Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has segregated Rs 787 crore of Adilink Infra & Multitrading debentures that its schemes held."

74,2018-11-29,Zee,"MUMBAI: Japanese major Sony Corp, which owns Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) is likely to create a new joint venture with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries-owned TV18 Broadcast, which will house all the entertainment assets of both the companies, two people with direct knowledge of the development told ET.

Sony will own a majority 51% stake in the proposed JV, while TV18 will own the remaining 49%. As part of the deal, the two companies will transfer 100% of SPN, 51% of TV18’s share in Viacom18 (US entertainment conglomerate Viacom Inc owns 49% in Viacom18) and 100% of Jio Studios business to the new entity, one of the sources said. He added that the basic framework is ready and talks are on with Viacom Inc on structure of the deal.

If the deal fructifies, the combined entity will own 63 channels, two video streaming services (Voot and Sony LIV), four film studios, and two digital content studios, making it an entertainment behemoth with the largest share of voice among the networks in India. “While there were rumours about Sony looking at acquiring stake in Relianceowned Viacom18, the talks were on for a much larger partnership,” said second source close to the development.

Incidentally, Sony’s top brass, including CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, and Mike Hopkins, chairman of Sony Pictures Television (SPT), are scheduled to visit Mumbai on December 9.

A few senior officials from the Japanese major’s US office are expected to arrive earlier.

“Sony’ India entertainment business is doing very well and this trip by Mike and Mr Yoshida was long planned. Mike had come to India two years back also and they had met with Mukesh Ambani. While discussions at that time were very different, a possibility of partnership was discussed then for the first time,” a second person close to the situation told ET.

Last week, Bloomberg reported that Sony was in talks to acquire a stake in the Indian television network controlled by Mukesh Ambani. “Consolidation is good for any industry and if this deals happens, it will straight away put the combined entity among the top two players,” said Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research at IDFC Securities.

“There are lot of synergies. Sony does not have a strong regional portfolio, whereas Viacom18 has a reasonably strong regional play. Viacom18 doesn’t have sports, while SPN has a strong sports portfolio. Only on the Hindi GEC front, how they will find balance is something that needs to be seen.”

Viacom18 posted a net profit of Rs 81 crore on a revenue of Rs 3,667 crore in the last fiscal. SPN, on the other hand, posted a net profit of —346 crore on a revenue of Rs 6,224 crore.



Together, the combined entity will have very strong presence across Hindi general entertainment, kids, Hindi movies, and sports. Sony and Viacom18 complement each other in many genres. Sony is weak in terms of regional, kids and youth entertainment, whereas Viacom18 doesn’t have a sports or infotainment business.

As per BARC India data for last four weeks, in terms of all India viewership (excluding news) Star India was leading with 20% share, followed by Zee Entertainment Enterprises (18%), where as Viacom18 and SPN both had a market share of 9% each. Together the combined entity will have 18-20% share."
82,2018-11-29,Zee,"Bharti Infratel, which has had a stellar week, gained further 7 per cent on Friday to log the best weekly gain since listing. ICICI Securities gained 5 per cent, as it settled a case with Sebi.

YES Bank slipped ahead of the outcome of its board meeting. Edelweiss had upgraded the scrip to ‘buy’ this morning with a price target at Rs 101. 

Among various sectors, realty was the only one that ended with gains on NSE, adding 1 per cent. Nifty PSU Bank was the biggest loser.

BSE flagship Sensex fell 336 points to 40,793. Its NSE counterpart Nifty shed 95 points to close at 12,056. Broader market indices, however, closed with gains, as Nifty Midcap index edged higher by 0.06 per cent and Nifty Smallcap index 0.94 per cent.

""Profit booking ahead of economic data and selling pressure in other Asian markets due to a risk of retaliation from China added volatility to the market. The recent rally has lifted the market to supreme valuation, which may limit the headroom for the key indices to perform well in the short term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

The investors are likely to shift focus to quality midcap and smallcaps, which should outperform in the near term.


Here is a lowdown of the movers and shakers of Friday’s session on Dalal Street: 


Bharti Infratel leapfrogsBharti Infratel recorded its best week since listing as it gained 19 per cent in five sessions. On Friday, it was the biggest Nifty gainer to end 6.7 per cent higher at Rs 273.80.


YES Bank slips as board meetsShares of private lender YES Bank slipped 2.5 per cent to Rs 68.30 as the lender’s board met to consider offers from investors.

HCC gains on winning case in SCHindustan Construction Company (HCC) share price rose 3.94 per cent to Rs 11.62 after the company won a challenge in the Supreme Court to set aside Section 87 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The company will now be able to execute awards worth Rs 1,584 crore.


ICICI Sec bounces after settling with SebiShares of ICICI Securities settled 5.17 per cent higher on BSE after the company settled a case with the market regulator SEBI. ICICI Securities paid Rs 28 lakh as a settlement charge in a case of an alleged violation of stockbroker norms.


RIL proves biggest dragReliance Industries, which hit the Rs 10 lakh crore mark on Thursday, proved the biggest drag on Sensex, bleeding 89 points. ICICI Bank (45 points), HUL (45 points), SBI and TCS (25 points each) were key drags on the index.


Smallcaps shrug Nifty trendSmallcap index was an outlier as it ended with gains when headline peers faltered. The Nifty Smallcap index gained 0.94 per cent to 5,814, while Nifty Midcap edged 0.06 per cent higher to 17,222. Nifty 500 closed 0.57 per cent lower at 9,813.

It was pushed by gains in Sunteck Realty (up 3.4 per cent), Brigade Enterprises (2.07 per cent) and Prestige Estate (2.04 per cent). Nifty PSU Bank was the biggest sectoral loser, down 1.73 per cent.

In volume terms, YES Bank topped the charts, followed by Vodafone Idea, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dish TV and IDFC First Bank.


31 stocks give ‘sell’ signal As many as 31 stocks flashed ‘sell’ as they crossed below the signal line on MACD. They include Zee Entertainment, Axis Bank, HDFC AMC, Munjal Auto, Andhra Sugars and Cummins India, among others. MACD is a momentum indicator which if falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal. Conversely, when the MACD rises above the signal line, the indicator gives a bullish signal."

0,2018-12-04,Zee,"Value investing is all about selecting stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values. Besides, when value investing is coupled with the strategy of selecting stocks based on how cheap or attractive they are with respect to broader indices, it adds a solid edge to such investing as it gives better view of valuations.

Among schemes that follow this strategy, conservative investors can consider investing is Tata Equity PE. The scheme’s fund manager Sonam Udasi selects 70% of the stocks in his portfolio that quote at price-to-earnings multiple (trailing) lower than that of the Sensex. The remaining 30% is invested in companies, which may quote at price-to-earnings multiples higher than that of the Sensex, but have higher earnings visibility and attractive return ratios. This strategy has worked for the scheme’s performance. The scheme has given 14% and 22% returns in the past three- and five-year periods, while its peers have given 10% and 18% returns during the same period.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers Sonam Udasi and Amey Sathe have stuck to their conviction bets, which strictly follow the value investing theme. These companies are Coal India, Bajaj Finserv and ITC.

Where we are: Nifty, after the pervious month’s advance, witnessed some profit booking last week as it faced crucial hurdles around the 10,850-10,900 zone. The short-term trend remains bullish as long as the index holds the 10,550-10,500 level which also coincides with the November lows. The recent decline looks corrective in nature and is likely to hold its support levels. Bank Nifty is likely to consolidate its gains and indicates strong support clusters round the 26,000-25,900 levels on the downside which likely to provide cushion in case of a decline.


What is in Store: Nifty indicates range bound action around the 10,500-10,850 levels before any bullish trending move. The oscillators have declined from its overbought zone and any fresh bullish crossover will witness momentum once index exceeds 10,750 levels for higher targets towards the 10,950 and 11,200. Bank Nifty has tested its key long term averages and needs to close above 26,750 levels for any bullish breakout. Expect defensive sectors to outperform and traders can expect a short-term momentum play from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Glenmark, Dabur and Colgate-Palmolive.


What could investors do: The FMCG sector has shown relative outperformance and we continue to maintain our long term bullish view. Colgate-Palmolive, Marico & Britannia are our top picks from this segment and we expect an upside potential of 10-15 per cent. PTC India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and GSFC are stocks that can be bought for an upside potential of 15-20 per cent for next few months.

Traders are advised to trade with a negative bias as the upside is pegged at 10,941 levels whereas the downside target comes to 10,050 levels, hence the risk to reward ratio is more than 1:2 on the short side, according to technical analysts. They have identified Colgate-Palmolive, Marico, Britannia, PTC, Zee Entertainment and GSFC, which have an upside potential of 15-20% over the next few months


Where we are: While the November expiry week ended on a promising note, the market participants were completely baffled with the market moves in the week gone by. The earlier breakout zone of 10,770-10,800 was expected to act as a support on the pullback moves, but a plunge in the global markets kept caught market participants on the wrong foot as index breached this range with a downside gap.


What is in store: Five state election results on Tuesday and the verdict of the Brexit deal are likely to have a significant impact on our markets as well and hence, this could well be the week, which would determine the short- to medium-term trend for our markets. As far as levels are concerned, major supports are seen at 10588-10489 and a breach of this could result into a sharp correction. On the flipside, the recent high of 10890–10940 is the resistance end which if breached, would lead to strong up move.

What could investors do: Amongst the sectoral indices, the Nifty Bank index rebounded higher from its support zone in Friday’s session. In case the market moves higher in the coming week, then the Nity Bank could be the outperforming index. At this juncture, we like ‘Dmart’ which has clearly been bucking the trend. One can look to go long for a target of Rs 1,710 and stop loss at Rs 1,397. Britannia looks promising for some immediate upside of Rs 3,280 and stop loss at Rs 2,880. From the midcap space, ‘Sun TV’ formed a Dragonfly Doji pattern, which could give a decent move towards Rs 640 and stop at Rs 568. All these should be considered if there is no unfavourable outcome during the week.

7,2018-12-11,Zee,"Mumbai: India’s telecom regulator has moved the Supreme Court seeking an order to reinstate the 15% cap on discounting of channel bouquets.

The 15% cap, which is part of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) new MRP-based tariff order, was set aside by the Madras High Court on a plea filed by some of the broadcasters. The new tariff order comes into effect on January 1.

The tariff order allows consumers to decide which channels to watch and mandates broadcasters to come up with the per month maximum retail price (MRP) of the channels. Broadcasters are also allowed to offer bouquets of channels, which as per the initial tariff order, should not be priced lower than 85% of the sum of the MRPs of all the channels in the pack.

In other words, broadcasters were not allowed to offer more than 15% of discount on the bouquet pricing. 

But a Trai executive said the high court order defeats the whole purpose of the tariff order.

“The 15% cap on discount gives a level playing field to the broadcasters as well as cable and DTH operators,” said the executive. “If you remove the cap, broadcasters will arbitrarily and discriminatorily resort to heavy discounting on the bouquets as compared to the MRP rates, and choice in true sense will not be there. Consumer will once again be forced to buy the entire bouquet.”

Incidentally, broadcasters have introduced bouquets with discounts ranging from 35-55%.

“Most of the broadcasters have kept the bouquet pricing very maturely and whatever I have seen from the market, largely the discount is not more than 50%. Mostly it is between 35-50%,” Punit Misra, CEO of domestic broadcast business at Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), told ET.

In its special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, the regulator has pointed out that the discounts on bouquets are generally more than 50%, which is unreasonably high and prone to distortion. Trai has also highlighted that there is no ceiling on channels that are offered on à la carte and the broadcasters are free to price their channels, which are offered only on à la carte basis.

The petition says the high court committed a grave error by holding the 15% discount cap on bouquet rates as arbitrary and non-enforceable as the scope of the challenge before the court was the power and jurisdiction to frame the tariff order and the interconnection regulation.

The Supreme Court has not yet listed Trai’s petition but it is expected to take it up in January when it resumes work after the winter vacations."

9,2018-12-17,Zee,"MUMBAI: Indian TV consumers may have to shell out more money for their monthly cable or DTH (direct to home) bill starting January 1st, after the new tariff order for the broadcast sector comes into effect as per the directions of TRAI.

As per the new tariff regime set by the regulator, consumers now have the option to select and pay only for TV channels they want to watch at the maximum retail price (MRP) set by the respective broadcasters.

In the last few days, all the TV networks have come out with the a-la-carte MRP of their channels.

Major broadcasters have also come up with their own bouquets that attach non-performing or non-popular channels with the driver or flagship channels.




Back of the envelope calculation by ET shows that at the announced bouquet prices, for the basic, non premium channels, a consumer in the Hindi heartland (no HD or regional channels), will end up paying Rs 430-440 per month under the new tariffs. Currently, in phase III and IV towns, consumers pay a monthly bill of Rs 200-250, and in large cities, a cable/ DTH bill for 250+ channels – which includes sports and regional channels – costs between to Rs 350-400.

As per the new rate structure, a consumer will have to pay up to Rs 130 (plus taxes) for first set of 100 channels, which will be mostly free-to-air (FTA) channels.

This doesn’t include any popular channels from top TV networks like Star India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Sony Pictures Networks India etc.

If a consumer decides to buy basic packages from top broadcasters, which include popular genres like general entertainment, movies, kids, music, news and infotainment, she will have to pay additional Rs 184 for 95 pay channels. And on top of that a network capacity fee of Rs 100 (Rs 25 per 20 channels) will be extra.

In short, in the new regime, a consumer will have to pay up to Rs 450 a month for the basic channels, without regional or sports, if he or she is opting for bouquets. If they go for a-la- carte, the bill will be over Rs 800 as bouquets are at a discount of 35-55%.

Vivekanand Subbaraman, analyst at Ambit Capital, said, “One can expect Phase I/II subscribers to pay more but convincing price sensitive Phase III/IV subscribers to cough extra for TV services, who are currently paying Rs 200-250 per month, will be a challenge.”

As per TRAI, four metros fall under phase I, while cities with population of over 1 million form phase II markets. Phase III are those cities with population of over 1 lakh, while below 1 lakh towns are part of phase IV.

A worried cable operator, who did not wish to be named, said, “There is no way consumers are going to pay extra for less number of channels just because TRAI has changed the rule. Even if metro consumers agree, phase III and IV consumers, who have recently started paying double after digitisation of cable TV, will create a riot if we start asking double again.”

It is important to note that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) intention with the new regulation was to make the entire framework completely transparent, provide choice to consumers, and ensure a fair deal amongst audience. RS Sharma, chairman, TRAI, told ET in an earlier interaction that customers should get the choice to select whatever channels they want and no channel should be shoved down the throat of the customer.

However, with no cap currently on discounting of bouquets (the matter is sub-judice in the Supreme Court) the broadcasters have kept the MRP of popular channels between Rs 15-19. Effectively, even if a consumer decides to opt for 50 popular channels, she will end up paying equal or more than current monthly bill.

“We are less than 15 days away from implementing the change and still consumers are not aware of this major change. Nobody knows what will happen on January 1. If there is a blackout given that cable and DTH operators are yet to get consumers’ choice of channels, brace for consumer anarchy this new year,” said a top executive of a broadcast network."

23,2018-12-20,Zee,"IIFL has a buy call on Zee Entertainment Enterprises with a target price of Rs 581.

The current market price of Zee Entertainment Enterprises is Rs 462.50.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Zee Entertainment Enterprises price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage:


ZEE5’s focus is on originals and movies: ZEE5 targets becoming the leading entertainment app as it envisages users gravitating to mostly two apps (one for entertainment and the other for sports) over time. A large and exclusive movie library would be ZEE5’s USP and movies would help target youth and males (earlier targeted with Ten Sports). ZEE5, as against Netflix, has a very large creative team that covers regional markets (non-English is 93 per cent of content and rising).


OTT can have major ad revenue potential: Though Zee foresees TV revenue growth remaining robust for the next 3 years, we believe it will plateau over time and OTT will become mainstream. ZEE5 would mainly be subscription led and telco tie ups would provide impetus. Ad spend in the economy can grow significantly from 0.4 per cent of GDP, if OTT apps can create new ad revenue streams by enabling micro targeting for SMEs, which currently stay away due to available mediums being national and costly. To tap into this, ZEE5 is building an ad salesforce aimed at SMEs.


Strong linear TV growth lends support: If management aims for ZEE5 to contribute 30 per cent of Zee’s topline in 5 years (we est. 20 per cent in 3 years), ZEE5 would need 35m subs@Rs40 ARPU (telco ARPUs have to rise) plus 50 per cent more in ad revenue. We think broadcaster app reach will rise to a few 100m MAUs over time and cannibalise TV revenues to a large extent, helped by home BB. Strong linear TV growth will buy vital time. Difficulty in arranging sale of group assets or the strategic stake in Zee before the committed time of March 2019 will cause group lenders to worry."
24,2018-12-22,Zee,"A big blow was enough to make market fortunes go haywire on Friday. The impact was so intense that key stock indices let go of all their gains made during the week. 

As a result, the BSE Sensex fell to 35,742 on December 21, from 35,962.90 on December 14, sinking as much as 0.61 per cent. 

Rising global economic growth concerns and a looming threat of a partial US government shutdown dealt the blow. 

The NSE Nifty came off 0.48 per cent to hit 10,754 from 10,805 during the same period.

Here are stocks and sectors that made the buzz during the week gone by.

On the other hand, Reliance Communications, APL Apollo, ABB India and Zee Entertainment and Infosys lost 8-10 per cent.


News from IPO mart
Studds Accessories, manufacturer of helmets and two-wheeler accessories, has received Sebi approval to float an initial public offer (IPO). The company, which had filed draft papers with the market regulator in August, obtained the latter's observations on December 14, latest data showed.


Sectoral update
Among BSE sectoral indices, the IT index tanked 5 per cent during. Teck (down 4.90 per cent), Consumer Durables (down 2.47 per cent) and FMCG (down 0.52 per cent) too had a dismal week. On the other hand, BSE Power, Oil & Gas, Metal, Realty and Auto gained 0.55-3 per cent.


RCom hits a bump
Shares of Reliance Communications declined 10 per cent after reports that the Department of Telecom rejected the deal to trade airwaves between the Anil Ambani-led company and Reliance Jio. The scrip slipped to Rs 14.20 on December 21, from Rs 15.80 on December 14.

NDTV gains weight
Shares of NDTV rallied 10 per cent on Friday after the company’s digital arm NDTV Convergence said it has signed a five-year deal worth over Rs 300 crore with content recommendations engine Taboola.


Capital push for PSBs 
The government on Thursday said it will enhance capital infusion in public sector banks to Rs 83,000 crore, taking the total to Rs 1.06 lakh crore for 2018-19. The capital will be pumped in over the next few months, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, adding that the move will increase the lending capacity of public sector banks (PSBs) as well as help some of them come out of RBI's watchlist.

Rating pain for Zee Ent
Shares of Zee Entertainment cracked 8.55 per cent to Rs 447.30 on December 21, from Rs 489.10 on December 14. The scrip witnessed some selling pressure after BofAML downgraded the stock to 'Underperform'. The financial services company called the stock valuation expensive, given the current slower growth, revising downwards its target price to Rs 375. 


IL&FS stocks in a sweet spot
IL&FS group companies, including IL&FS Engineering and Construction, IL&FS Investment Managers and IL&FS Transportation, jumped 27 per cent, 23 per cent and 21 per cent during the week. The group announced its plan to sell equity stakes in its road assets to raise funds. 

On Monday, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) group, which sits on a debt pile of about Rs 90,000 crore, said it will sell equity stakes in its road assets to raise funds. The IL&FS board, acting on behalf of its relevant subsidiaries, including ITNL, initiated the process of exploring divestment of IL&FS group's stakes in road assets, the group said in a statement. This was done in order to ascertain market interest and examine feasibility of maximisation of value in an orderly and transparent manner, it said."
25,2018-12-24,Zee,"By Abhishek Karande 
Technical & Alternate Strategist, Indianivesh Securities
Technical analysts expect the Nifty to find support between 10,600 and 10,700 in the short term, and said that the index is likely to face resistance in the 10,900-11,000 zone. Oil and gas, capital goods, metals and banking sectors are expected to show strength in the coming weeks, they said.


Where we are: The index sustained the intermediate supports of 10,350 and rebounded until 10,985. However this appears to be the on-going pullback which commenced from the lows made October 2018, which could possibly get capped at 11,000 levels.


What is in store: Intermediate supports for the week going ahead are placed at 10,650-10,600. On breach of these levels, bears will attempt to break 10,350 levels and continue to oscillate lower until 10,200. Stocks that have posted a similar pullback to Nifty index are TCS, Titan, UPL and Zee Entertainment. These stocks witnessing pullback now have their upside capped and could witness a fresh leg of correction that could possibly unfold on the lower side. These corrections would initially have a 10 per cent leg on the lower side.


What should investors do: Within the pharma sector, Biocon at current market price of Rs 621 has a limited upside. The stock is now gearing up to break the intermediate supports of Rs 610-600 levels. On a decisive break below Rs 600, bears could gear up for extended move until Rs 580-570 levels.

Stocks that are bullish on higher time frame charts mainly quarterly/ yearly and could possibly continue to march towards the northern trajectory are Bata and L&T. Bata at current price of Rs 1,116 has a initial target of Rs 1,300-1,350 and L&T which is poised to post the highest close after 2017 has a target of Rs 1,800. However, stock prices hold the potential to travel beyond Rs 2,000 mark. Similarly UBL at current of Rs 1,348 could post a highest close, well above 2017 highs. Initial target for the stock is at Rs 1,550-1,600 level."

0,2019-01-01,Zee,"It is that time of the year when one submits proofs of investments for tax exemption under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, which makes it necessary to look at some Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS). There are several advantages of investing in ELSS. Among tax-exempt investments, it has the shortest lock-in period of three years. The Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate (NSC) have lock-in periods of 15 years and six years, respectively. Tax-free fixed deposits in banks are locked-in for five years.

ELSS is an equity product, which helps the investor gain better returns in the long term as compared to the other alternatives. Given these factors, it makes sense to opt for ELSS for conservative investors. Among various schemes, investors can consider Invesco India Tax Plan. The scheme is it follows multi-cap strategy. Fund managers Amit Ganatra and Dhimant Kothari have maintained a ratio of 60:40 exposure large-caps and other stocks. This multicap approach has been a key factor in the scheme’s consistent performance in almost all market cycles.

In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 11% and 17% returns while its benchmark BSE 200 index has given 12% and 15% returns in the same period, respectively. In general, ELSS schemes on an average have given 10% and 15% returns in the past three-year and five-year periods respectively.

In the past six months, the fund managers have enhanced exposure to well-established companies which have been attractive due to two reasons: strong business model (demand in the sector, high cashflows) and fall in markets. These companies are Bajaj Finance, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises.


Expert Take
HARSHVARDHAN ROONGTA, CFP, Roongta Securities

This scheme is suitable for investors looking at a conservative equity portfolio with predominantly large-cap companies available at reasonable valuations. In volatile markets such investment approach is expected to provide some cushion to investor anxiety. Being an ELSS fund, there is a lock in of three years, however, investors should select equity investments with a time horizon of at least 5-7 years."

5,2019-01-12,Zee,"TCS, IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, Delta Corp and Tata Elxsi were some of the big companies that came out with December quarter earnings this week.

Some of these companies posted healthy earnings, but the market did not reward them. For instance, shares of TCS settled 2.44 per cent lower at Rs 1,842 on Friday. This is even as the IT major posted its highest-ever third quarter profit. Revenues reported by the largest IT player was also at the highest level in last 14 quarters.

This is an indication that 2019 could be negative for the entire IT sector. An expected slowdown in the US could hurt these export-oriented companies and the best might be behind us.

Other than IT, the week also saw IndusInd Bank reporting a 5 per cent (YoY) growth in third quarter profit. The expectations of higher growth did not materialise. With the bank failing to provide fully for the IL&FS mess, its shares remained quite under pressure post results. 

Bandhan Bank too was hit by IL&FS provisioning, but it took IL&FS exposure as non-performing assets (NPAs). The bank reported 10 per cent profit growth for the quarter.

IT stalwart TCS posted profit growth of 24.1 per cent YoY while Tata Elxsi reported a mere 5.14 per cent rise in profits YoY due to margin compression.

A look at the global scenario suggests that “all is not well.” Trade talks between the US and China concluded this week. It was extended to third day, which suggests its seriousness. The outcome of the meeting has not been made public. This delay in the disclosure of the outcome of this closed-door meeting points to something unfavourable. Had it been positive, the details would have been out by now.

No sooner are the details are out, the market will react sharply. Most likely, some disappointment is around the corner.


Event of the week
The week saw yet another merger of a young bank and an NBFC -- Bandhan Bank acquired Gruh Finance in an all-share deal. 

The decision was made primarily with the objective of lowering the bank’s promoter holding and expanding its housing finance portfolio. It will bring down promoters’ stake in the bank to 60 per cent, which is still much higher than the 40 per cent-cap Bandhan Bank promoters need to maintain, as per RBI requirement. IDFC Bank and Capital First completed their merger last month. 

A new order is emerging in the merger of NBFCs and young banks. They are pooling war chests to create synergies to be able to compete against larger rivals.

Merging is more of a requirement in times of crisis like this, as liquidity is drying up and margins are compressing. Many such mergers can be expected in this space. Incumbent private banks may face tough competition from the merged entities.


Technical outlook 
Nifty50 has formed a Triangle Pattern, which suggests that Mr Market is not certain in which direction it will move. Besides, major moving averages (200, 100 and 50 EMAs) are converging, which further confirms that the market is in an indecisive phase and about to move sharply. The likely move will be downwards, given the structure of the Triangle. We would advise a 'sell on rise' with a stop loss placed above 11,000 level on the Nifty50.


Outlook for the week
The market is likely to stay volatile in the coming week. Investors would await the details of trade talks between US and China. These deltails may influence financial markets the worldover. Investors are advised to be on the sidelines and book profits at higher levels. Buying at lower levels would be prudent, given the uncertainties and muted corporate numbers.

Major results to look out for next week will be those of Wipro, SBI Life Insurance, Zee Entertainment, ICICI Lombard, L&T Infotech, AU Small Finance Bank, Mindtree and ICICI Securities.

Nifty50 ended the week 0.63 per cent higher at 10,794."
6,2019-01-13,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty managed to close the week gone by on a positive note despite losses in the last two trading sessions. 

However, gains remained capped due to lack of any directional cues from global markets and soft third quarter earnings.

On a weekly basis, Sensex advanced 315 points or 0.88 per cent and Nifty inched up 68 points or 0.63 per cent. 

Weakness in Indian rupee, following rally in global crude oil prices, made investors wary and look away from Indian equities. 

Going into the new week, earnings, global sentiment and macro numbers to remain among most important factors that may dictate market movement this week.


Here is a list of some of the key factors that may sway market mood during the week:

RIL, HDFC Bank, HUL earnings: The week will see December quarter earnings of heavyweights, including Zee Entertainment, Hindustan Unilever, Reliance Industries, Wipro and HDFC Bank. Analysts think that earnings so far have not been able to excite bourses, hence the numbers of these company will among most important triggers and they can alter the course of the market. 


Inflation numbers: India's wholesale and retail inflation prints for December will be released on Monday. Both these numbers are important indicators of the health of the economy and may dominate market movement. Retail inflation, which is calculated on the consumer price index (CPI), plunged to a 17-month low in November at 2.33 per cent, mainly on account of decline in prices of kitchen essentials. On the other hand, country's wholesale inflation fell to a three-month low of 4.64 per cent in November, driven down by the decline in prices of food articles, especially vegetables, and some easing in rates of petro products. Experts are expecting the numbers to be broadly in the same range for December as well.


Global sentiment: Fourth-quarter results of heavyweights, such as Micron Technology, Netflix, Citi, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, will come out this week. Global markets will hope for upbeat numbers from them since they will either bolster the view of a slowdown in economy or infuse positivity in the market. 


Global macros: Many significant global macro numbers, including China's exports and imports data for December, US balance of trade data for November and retail sales for December, are slated to be released this week. Besides, China might release its fourth quarter GDP data this week. The US Federal Reserve will issue the Beige Book of Economic Condition, which is a report of current economic conditions, trends and challenges in the US, on Thursday.


May's deal: The British Parliament will vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal deal on Tuesday. The chaos around Brexit can bring discomfort to European markets, which may degenerate to global stocks. As per Reuters, the agreement, which May and EU leaders say cannot be renegotiated and is the only one available, will almost certainly be rejected. If so, uncertainty, paralysis and the likelihood of a disorderly ‘no deal’ Brexit will rise.


US-China trade deal: Even as the last week's talk between the US and China did not reveal much for the market, the optimism is still in air. As a key trade data- China's export growth- will be out this week, a soft data may push Beijing to be more accommodative with fiscal policies as well as with the US demand on trade. 


Crude's course: Oil prices fell nearly 2 per cent on Friday, but ended the week higher. Hopes of a Sino-US trade deal have given a leg up to oil prices and as the US signalled that more waivers for Iranian oil imports after the reimposition of US sanctions is unlikely, India has something to worry about in the wake of an ongoing supply cut by Opec and its ally Russia. 


Technical outlook: Nifty settled below its 200-day moving average on Friday. The lower-level buying suggested that the fight between the bulls and the bears is even and market may swing in either direction. ""Market has been in a rangebound move with Nifty having 10,787 as a fulcrum point. The support for the week is seen at 35,330/10,580 while resistance is seen at 36,550/10,960,"" said Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher."
7,2019-01-14,Zee,"Valuations are attractive as far as Infosys is concerned and we prefer Infosys over TCS currently, Nischal 
   
   
   Maheshwari, CEO, Institutional Equities, Centrum Broking, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What do you make of Infosys numbers, is there headroom left for Infosys post these numbers, the numbers were good, business is strong and valuations are attractive?
It was a good set of numbers from Infosys. Yes, there is a disappointment on margins front but I am very enthused with the kind of growth which they have shown. Again, improving the guidance, the number of people they have taken in, all indicate a strong performance in the coming quarters. 

Both Infosys and TCS numbers are showing a very strong bench. But both of them have indicated some margins deterioration and that would continue. This is going to be a strong growth story but the margins are going to be amiss. Valuations are attractive as far as Infosys is concerned and we prefer Infosys over TCS currently. 


What are you making of Avenue Supermart’s performance? It has been the slowest in eight quarters. Would there be some derating in the richly valued stock?
Though we do not cover the stock, I have just looked at the numbers very casually and see pressure on the margins. That was expected given that the competition is coming in and more and more players, especially the Amazons of this world basically go into grocery which is the prime focus for D-Mart. 

But I am very enthused with the top line growth basically, it still continues to be there. I believe margins is a short-term phenomenon. They will get it back but the top line is basically a good number.


What is the bottom line here? Are the top line numbers not convincing enough for someone to buy a stock at a PE multiple of 80 plus?
That is right. At 80 times stock, basically it is not a buy for us. Though we do not cover it but still I would not be recommending a buy on that stock. 


What is your take on the media space as a whole? Reports are indicating that we could see good Zee Entertainment numbers and strong ad revenue growth as well. What is the outlook?
Media is going to be a good quarter for them, especially the ad growth revenue. But the transition which is happening especially on the revenues front, is going to be a challenge. I think the transition which is happening is going to be a bit of a challenge for the media sector. But ad revenues are going to be strong.


What is the expectation from RIL’s oil and gas business? How are you seeing the overall earnings?
Overall, we expect a flattish kind of number for the current quarter as far as Reliance is concerned. The oil and gas margins have been flat as far as the GRMs are concerned. We are enthused by the potential of revenue growth for the telecom side of the business. There they will continue to show a strong growth. 

On the profitability front also, I believe there is going to be a strong growth coming in from the telecom side. Overall, we are projecting a 10-11% growth.


Everybody is bullish on corporate banks. Whereas corporate bank is a good trade, it is just becoming a consensus trade, like the NBFC trade of 2016 and 2017. What is your view?
I agree but the trade is yet to play out. Most of these stocks have been up by around 10% to 15% but the recovery has started. There are two things which are positive for them. One is the falling interest rates, held to maturity portfolios on the bond side. PSBs are going to benefit out of that. 

The second thing is growth coming back as far as the corporate loans are concerned, given that NBFCs are going to lose out a bit on that front so that should be positive for corporate banks.

Third is the recovery from the NCLT front. So I think these are two or three things basically which are going to play out in the next two or three quarters. Most of the corporate banks are going to do well in the next two to three quarters. I believe there is definitely an upside from anywhere between 10% and 15% for most of these banks. 


What is your view on cement?
Cement would disappoint actually. There has been a very strong growth as far as volumes are concerned. Across the country, we have seen very strong volume growth but the margins are not sustainable. Rather margins would be down for them as there has been cost increases which they have not been able to pass through. Last and the current quarters are the best quarters for cement. However, post monsoons, they have not been able still to get any price increases and that is a disappointment. With such strong volumes, if there is no price increase coming in, it is going to be difficult for them to maintain margins. 

In the coming quarter, some costs are coming off. The third quarter numbers should be better than what they are going to declare. Fourth quarter number is going to be better than what they have declared in the third quarter. 


Do you think we could see a significant revival in the likes of a Mindtree or Persistent or would they continue to be at best in line if not underperform?
Mindtree might come back. Basically, we are projecting around 12-13% kind of a growth for Mindtree. Persistent has been a disappointment. I still see a lot of challenges as far as Persistent is concerned but I think Mindtree should revive. 

Overall, if you look at it most of the stocks have corrected almost 25-30% from the top so they seem to be in a good spot. Mindtree is among some of the midcaps which we like along with the Larsen twins. But obviously, the valuations for Larsen twins is a bit challenging but their growth is much better than the industry average, They are all growing between 16% and 20% and that is where our preference lies. 



The IIP numbers have slumped to a 17-month low and there are talks of interest rate cut coming in February. You have the CPI as well as WPI numbers today. What is the expectation on the macro front?
The interest rate is definitely up to that watch. It is one thing which is becoming positive. 

The second factor is that the oil prices continue to move in $50-60 range. That is another very big positive for the country. I was a bit disappointed with the IIP numbers. Inflation is within its trajectory and so we do not have much worries on the inflation side. But overall. this should be positive for the emerging markets and especially for India given that growth is back. 

Growth concerns are receding after the last FOMC meet. This should be positive for the emerging markets and for India particularly.


Could we see FIIs reversing their outlook on India on the back of an improving macro picture?
That is what my call is for the current year, especially across emerging markets and this is more to do with the whole emerging markets than to India alone. India obviously has a better picture given that the oil prices are down. The risk-on trade seems to be now falling in place because there is a synchronisation of interest rates reversal kind of story from December 19 when the FOMC meeting happened and they said that they is going to be only two rate hikes instead of three. 

Then PBOC cut the CRR and then Japan and Europe all of them are falling into line saying that there is a question mark as far as growth is concerned and anhy way interest rate hikes are too steep. So, that seems to be falling in place. 

The falling interest rate should be positive for the whole emerging markets. Currencies are in a better shape. This year should be positive for the emerging markets and India once we are passed this uncertainty about the general elections. we are going to see good strong flows coming in to the country again."
8,2019-01-14,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Media conglomerate Zee Entertainment Enterprises is expected to deliver healthy numbers for the December quarter of 2018-19, say brokerages. 

The company is set to report its Q3 earnings on Tuesday.

It had reported a rise in operations and advertising revenue for the second quarter, which may well continue for the third quarter as well, aided by festive season buying. 

""Domestic advertising revenue growth may be healthy at 17 per cent. Market share gains in the flagship channels and continued strengthening of its base in the regional market will lead to strong performance,"" brokerage HDFC Securities said. 

The brokerage expects subscription revenue of Zee to grow by nearly 18 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

While the brokerage thinks Zee is in a sheltered position for the near future owing to increasing viewership in regional markets and better advertisement and subscription revenues, the market will closely observe its outlook on digital business and revenue growth.

The company has to face increased competition in the OTT (over-the-top) space, which will be a challenge. 

The OTT space is seeing huge content investments by big players like Amazon, Reliance Jio, and the like. Increased competition in the regional market and the digital space may pose a challenge for the company.

Edelweiss Securities anticipates revenue, Ebitda and PAT of Zee to jump nearly 14 per cent, 20 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively, on a YoY basis.

The brokerage is expecting a spurt in advertising and domestic subscription revenue. 

""Growth in revenue is to be led by nearly 15 per cent YoY surge in advertising revenue (on a base of about 26 per cent; 22.7 per cent YoY in Q2FY19) and 14 per cent YoY domestic subscription revenue spurt (on a negative base of 16 per cent; 26 per cent YoY in Q2FY19),"" Edelweiss Securities said.

The brokerage expects that the domestic subscription revenue may remain robust on account of Phase III monetisation and digitisation.

Kotak Institutional Equities, too, has an optimistic view on Zee's earnings.

""We expect 20 per cent YoY growth in advertisement revenues and domestic subscription revenues to grow 20 per cent YoY, aided by catch-up revenues and phase-III monetisation,"" the brokerage said.

The brokerage expects a 230 bps YoY rise in Ebitda margin, despite higher investments in content and operating costs.

Brokerages are expecting a double-digit advertisement revenue growth for broadcasters and multiplexes for the third quarter and are optimistic about the future prospects for the sector in the wake of the new tariff regime and GST rate cut. 

However, intense competition in the OTT space and aggressive promotions and discounting after Jio’s entry are the key challenges for the industry."

“India is poised to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Decline in crude oil prices and rationalisation of GST rates will further boost the economy and help maintain the growth momentum in consumption. Even in M&E space, content consumption is growing at a brisk pace across mediums. This trend along with macroeconomic tailwinds will drive growth in both advertising and subscription revenues. We have delivered yet another quarter of strong performance across all our businesses. ZEE5 is scaling up in line with our expectations and is on course to become India's number one digital entertainment platform,"" said Chairman Subhash Chandra."
9,2019-01-15,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Concerns over falling Chinese exports and a crucial vote on Brexit deal due on Tuesday may keep global markets cautious. And domestic equities may be no exception.

Singapore trading sets stage for positive start 
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 35.50 points, or 0.33 per cent, higher at 10,804.50, indicating a positive start for the Nifty50.



Nifty forms Bearish Belt Hold
The Nifty50 index on Monday fell for a third straight session to settle below the 10,750 level. During the session, the day tested the 10,700 level, before buying emerged at lower levels. That said, the opening proved the day’s high as the index formed a 'Bearish Belt Hold' pattern on the daily chart. If Nifty stays below the 10,806 level on a sustainable basis, chances are that it may break below its swing low of 10,628 sooner than later, said analysts. 


Index futures hint at room for a bigger correction
The Nifty has substantially more room to correct, if foreign portfolio investors’ (FPIs) cumulative net open interest (OI) positions on index futures is anything to go by. Data from March 2018 more succinctly indicate that whenever cumulative net OI has been around or exceeded minus 1,00,000 index futures contracts, the Nifty tends to bottom out; and when the net OI stands at anywhere between 16,000 and 55,000 contracts, the index tends to have topped.


Asian shares on back foot
Asian shares were on back foot on Tuesday as an unexpected drop in China’s exports heightened worries about the global economy while the British pound braced for a showdown in parliament over the government’s Brexit plan, Reuters reported.

US stocks end lower
US stocks declined on Monday as an unexpected drop in China’s exports reignited worries of a global economic slowdown and prompted caution among investors as the corporate earnings season kicked off, Reuters reported.

18,2019-01-16,Zee,"Mumbai: Cost control and robust advertising and subscription revenues helped Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) exceed Street estimates of third-quarter performance by a fair margin.

Against Bloomberg estimates of Rs 2,095 crore of quarterly revenue, ZEE recorded sales of Rs 2,166 crore in the quarter under review, up 18 per cent.Net profit climbed 50 per cent to Rs 562 crore.

ZEE has been following a strategy of maintaining costs without ceding the share of eyeballs in the regional markets. In the third quarter, ZEE’s other expenses remained flat at Rs 230 crore. Cost control, when looked in the backdrop of 18% revenue growth, shows relative success in restraining overhead costs. In the quarter, ZEE gained incremental market share in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Also, its new general entertainment channel, Zee Keralam, shows the company is keen to buttress its presence in the regional content markets that have higher potential of growth given the large of number of vernacular subscribers. The company already has channels in six Indian languages.

ZEE is also expected to generate more regional content for the OTT platform, Zee5. It plans to create 72 original shows across six Indian languages in the next one year. Among Indian OTT players, ZEE has distinguished itself by following a strategy of producing content with ‘mass appeal’.

Bloomberg

For vernacular subscribers, watching mass appeal content with reasonably good production value on platforms other than television amounts to only an extension of viewing content on television rather than replacing it.

Keeping this in mind, ZEE has been generating content on Zee5, which has 56.3 million subscribers at the end of the December quarter.

ZEE should continue to beat the industry’s advertising revenues growth — it has outrun the broader industry for the past six quarters. The company’s promoters have clearly expressed the intention to sell half their stake to a global strategic partner for content-distribution technology. If ZEE successfully achieves this stake sale, it would serve as a major trigger for investors.

On the valuation front, considering FY20 earnings, the stock is trading at EV/EBIDTA of 14.8, which is quite attractive when compared to its past three-year average of 26.9."

Punit Goenka, MD & CEO, Zee Entertainment, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

A second straight quarter of healthy numbers for you, with ad subscription and revenue surpassing estimates. Is this run rate sustainable?
First and foremost, this performance was possible because of the stellar performance of my team across the broadcast sector both in domestic markets, the international markets and also the ZEE5 team. They have delivered on all accounts. 

Going forward, we will endeavour to beat the industry growth by a margin even if our market share does not grow. I expect that with the launch or Zee Kerelam, we will strengthen our regional bouquet and that will give us more leverage to see growth on both advertising and subscription side.


Despite a higher base, your domestic and international ad revenue growth has been very strong. What would you attribute this to?
It is a combination of performance across genres. We have seen increase in our viewership share in both Hindi as well as the regional markets and that has led to this growth. I, particularly, want to call out three of my regional markets; West Bengal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. These three markets have had a stellar performance and allowed us to achieve these numbers.


Tell us about the new content deals that you have signed in the past few quarters. What are the upcoming deals that will help boost your subscription revenue?
The content pipeline is very robust. On both Hindi as well as the regional language side, we have been expanding our content portfolio by adding more original hours of content and increasing our offerings. We will be further strengthening that with the launch of our Punjabi channel and we are planning a Karnataka movie channel very soon. On the back of these, we will be able to further strengthen our portfolio and see the growth on both subscription and advertising.


What has been your total programming costs on account of aggressive content launches on ZEE5 and the TV business?
On the television side, we track content on a per hour basis on the cost per hour basis. I do not expect that cost to go anywhere beyond the inflation kind of growth numbers but on the ZEE5 digital side, we will see a significant ramp-up in the content costs in the next fiscal as well, given that we will be making a lot more high quality tentpole properties going forward. 

Our endeavour will be to have six original web series per month in the six languages that we are focussing on.


Marketing and promotion costs are slated to rise on account of spends on OTT platforms. Is that the case and could we look at a very steep uptick coming in here?
We are already spending disproportionately on the OTT platform marketing spend even in the current fiscal and on the marketing side. it will be pretty stable going forward. But content side, we will be investing more aggressively.


Could the higher content cost and investment in movie content to a certain extent limit your margin expansion?
As I had guided earlier, for the current and next fiscal. We are pretty comfortable to deliver a 30% plus kind of an EBITDA margin and I would like to stick to that for the time being.


What growth have you seen in ZEE5? Where is the OTT platform moving?
We are increasing our partnerships with both the telcos and the OEM manufacturers and other payment gateways as well. I believe that the next step of our growth will be driven on the subscription side of the business while the advertising piece will follow. We have done already pretty well on that but we now want to focus our efforts on the subscription revenue from the OTT platform.


What about your overall viewership? What has been the progress on your regional channels as well?
Very well. Our portfolio on the regional investments in the last three years has yielded us the maximum return and we will continue to invest in regional, going forward. Today with the launch of Zee Kerelam, we are the largest network spanning nine Indian languages and that gives us the edge on the market share and therefore our revenue monetisation capabilities.


What is the outlook on your earnings growth, can you share some guidance?
We are already seeing a boom in the content consumption in the country on the back of electrification, smart device penetration and reduced data costs. This is a great opportunity for video players like ourselves to penetrate further on not only television but also on the OTT side. And our strategy will be to drive TV and digital and it is not TV or digital. I have two very strong independent teams running the two portfolios for us and we hope to take the company from strength to strength from here.


The street is keenly awaiting commentary on the promoter stake sale,. How close are you to the deal?
Since we started the process two months back, we have met several prospective strategic investors and I am happy to share that I am pleased with the process so far. We are on track and hopefully we will have something to announce very soon."

The bank sees the promoters’ intention to sell up to 50 per cent if their shareholding to a strategic partner as a positive for minority shareholders.

33,2019-01-24,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) is planning to pull the plug on its linear television service in Europe, Australia, Fiji and a few other overseas markets and offer content only via the video-over-the-top service, Zee5.

Earlier this month, Star India had discontinued distribution of television channels in Canada and the US and has been offering content only through its video on-demand player, Hotstar.
While Zee5 is not yet present in the US, due to its non-compete clause with Dish Network which restricts Zee from launching a direct-to-customer service in that market, the broadcaster has shortlisted markets where it is now looking to stop distribution of channels via cable or satellite.

“There are markets like Europe, Australia, Fiji, etc., where Indian and South Asian population is too fragmented and it doesn’t make sense to reach via a linear service. We will stop broadcasting our channels in these markets and instead will be available via Zee5,” Amit Goenka, chief executive of Zee International and Z5 Global, told ET.

The move, Goenka said, will not just save on the cost of distribution and transmission, but also help ensure the customer is getting content in legal way. “High cost of the Indian channels force some of the consumers to buy pirated boxes. They end up paying $100 annually for those boxes and we don’t get anything either. This way, all of our content will be available to consumers legally, at a much lesser price,” he added.

Unlike Star India, which is flying solo, Zee5 has a different go-to-market strategy for global markets, wherein the company is partnering with distribution platforms.

“We are in advanced discussions with service providers for joint go-to-market plans. We will work on revenue-share arrangements where we will be sharing 20-30% of subscription amount, depending local partners’ marketing efforts, minimum guarantees, etc.,” Goenka said.

In India too, Zee5 has signed deals with telecom players like Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Zee had soft-launched its service in 190 countries in October last year. However, it is now that the company is focussing on various markets with local strategies.

In the first step, it launched a marketing campaign in Pakistan and Bangladesh. It will next target other South Asian countries.
Zee has already partnered with the Axiata Group’s Apigate in Malaysia, Dialog in Sri Lanka, Tapmad in Pakistan, as well as Smart TV providers Zeasn and NetRange.

“In the next financial year, we will launch service in international languages in regions like Thai, Filipino, Indonesian, French, Arabian, German, Russian and Spanish,” Goenka said.

For the US, however, the company will have to wait as its current contract with Dish Network doesn’t allow it to launch the service till March 2021. “We are in talks with them (Dish) to allow us to offer the service sooner,” said Goenka."

34,2019-01-25,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: Several companies catering to retail consumers have reported higher sales volume growth for the December 2018 quarter reflecting a sustained demand across various segments of consumption.

Asian Paints, Kajaria Ceramics, Reliance Retail, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Consumer Care, and Interglobe Aviation are some of the prominent companies that have shown strong volume growth. In addition, some of the companies increased product prices by 2-5 per cent sequentially.

Asian Paints, which commands over half of the market share in the paints business, recorded volume growth of 20 per cent. This was not only better than the 14 per cent growth estimated by analysts but also the strongest in any of the quarters in eight years. The festive demand during Q3 and reduction in GST rates on paints were key growth factors. It hiked prices by 7.3 per cent in the past nine months.



In the building-products segment, Kajaria Ceramics posted volume growth of 16 per cent, the highest in the last 16 quarters. The company’s management expects double-digit growth to continue in the coming quarters. It hiked prices of ceramic tiles by 2-3 per cent.

The passenger growth of Interglobe, India’s largest aviation company, was above 20 per cent for the fourth consecutive quarter. Its average ticket prices improved by 6 per cent year-on-year to ?4,176, the highest rate in five quarters. The company has guided for 30 per cent capacity addition in the March 2019 quarter. Its capacity in terms of available seat kilometres rose by 29 per cent and 33 per cent in the September and the December quarter.

HUL recorded double-digit volume growth for the fifth consecutive quarter supported by rural growth, which was 1.3 times the growth in urban markets. Its average realisation grew by 3.8 per cent year-on-year. Bajaj Consumer Care reported volume growth of 9.4 per cent in almond hair oil segment, the highest in the last 15 quarters.

The volume momentum in consumer goods has also resulted in advertisement growth of media companies. For example, Zee Entertainment’s advertisement growth was 22 per cent in Q3. Nearly 60 per cent of ads came from the consumer oriented companies.

Reliance Retail, the country’s largest retailer by revenue, reported 89 per cent growth in revenue for the December quarter and 108 per cent growth in the past nine months.

The festive season sales and new store openings resulted in high revenue growth and its operating area rose by 42 per cent to 20.6 million square feet in the first nine months of FY19."
35,2019-01-25,Zee,"Mumbai: The promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) have zeroed in on three companies to sell half of their holding in the entity, according to three persons with direct knowledge of the development.

The three companies include Sony Pictures, which owns rival broadcast business Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), a US-based media conglomerate, and a Chinese company.

It is learned that ZEE promoter Subhash Chandra, who is also chairman of the company, had discussions on the proposed stake sale in the UK and the US. “Chandra has had extensive meetings and discussions to sell half of his holding in ZEE. There are three final players in the ring,” said one of the sources.

A ZEE spokesperson said the company’s discussions pertaining to the stake sale with the prospective partners are on and the progress is extremely positive. “At this stage, we do not wish to comment on the name of the prospective partner. Once the deal is at an advanced and closure stage, we will certainly announce the relevant details.”

When asked about the development, NP Singh, chief executive of Sony Pictures, called it speculation.

Top Sony officials like Mike Hopkins, chairman of Sony Pictures Television, and Tony Vinciquerra, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, visited Chandra and his family at his residence after Chandra on November 13 last year announced to sell half of the promoter holding in ZEE to a global strategic investor. The promoters own 41.6% stake in the company.

Punit Goenka, MD and chief executive of ZEE, had later told ET that his first preference was a company which was not present in India, preferably from tech or internet background. “We don’t need any money for the South Asian business. We need somebody to take us to the global markets,” he had said.

ZEE is India’s largest entertainment business by market cap and is looking for a partner to compete in a market prone to major technological disruptions.

ET had earlier reported that China’s Tencent and Alibaba and American telecom giant Comcast Corp were among those which have been approached by Goldman Sachs, investment banker for the promoters.

Comcast has been looking out for opportunities in India and had a failed bid to acquire 21st Century Fox from Rupert Murdoch."

41,2019-01-25,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Breaking its two-session winning run, Shares of Zee Entertainment cracked 30.92 per cent to Rs 229.70 on the NSE on Friday, logging its worst-ever fall. Zee Entertainment's subsidiary Dish TV also tanked 37.41 per cent to Rs 21.

A report in Wire said that a link has emerged between Essel Group and a company being probed for suspect demonetisation deposits.

""Dreamline Manpower Solutions, a company being probed by the SFIO, carried out transactions involving a few Essel entities in 2016-17 and is also at the heart of a legal spat between Videocon and Essel,"" a Wire report said.

Zee Entertainment clarifiesLater, Zee Entertainment in a clarification said that the company is unaware of the news item and factual correctness of the news report on Essel Group.

“The company is unaware of the news item referred in your letter or its source or factual correctness of the information contained therein,” the company said in a clarification to BSE.


Stake saleThere are also reports that Zee Entertainment’s promotors’ plan to sell stake in the company has gained fresh momentum.
The promoters of Zee Entertainment have zeroed in on three companies to sell half of their holding in the entity, an ET report suggested. 

The three companies include Sony Pictures, which owns rival broadcast business Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), a US-based media conglomerate, and a Chinese company. 

The report further added, quoting a company spokesperson that the ZEE’s discussions pertaining to the stake sale with the prospective partners are on and the progress is extremely positive. 

Exceeding the market expectations, ZEE reported 50.26 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit at Rs 562.38 crore for the third quarter against Rs 374.26 crore in the same period last year.

However, experts say there are headwinds affecting the company in short term which will keep the downside risk high.

""Regulatory changes in broadcasting, as the customer gets to choose what to watch, will impact the viewership and subscription revenue in short to medium term and will eventually impact the valuations as advertising revenue is directly related to viewership,"" said Sameer Kalra, founder and equity research analyst of Target Investing.

""Promoter stake sale of 25 per cent and above is another downside risk as it is a family influenced management, which reduced the incentive for minority investor,"" he added."
44,2019-01-25,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Dalal Street's relief rally didn't last long as the benchmark indices took a U-turn and ended half a per cent lower on Friday, shrugging off firmness in other markets.

Media and auto stocks took the biggest knock on a day when automaker Maruti Suzuki's poor December quarter earnings did much of the damage. 

BSE Sensex slipped 170 points to settle at 36,026 while NSE's Nifty slipped 69 points to close at 10,781. Among Sensex stocks, 10 advanced while 20 slipped. 

Maruti, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank proved the biggest drag on the Sensex. 


Market at a glance:


>> 
Maruti threw a curveball
Maruti Suzuki reported a 17 per cent plunge in net profit at Rs 1,489 crore and missed estimates, which led to a severe beating of the stock. The scrip closed 7.40 per cent lower at Rs 6,516 and was the worst index performer. Maruti was responsible for a 68-point plunge out of the total 170-point decline in Sensex. 


>> 
YES Bank on top for Day 2
YES Bank was the best index performer in Sensex pack, rallying 14 per cent in intra-day trade after it announced on Thursday the appointment of Ravneet Gill as new MD & CEO in place of Rana Kapoor. However, the stock pared most of the gains to settle the day just 2.71 per cent higher at Rs 219 apiece. 

Other gainers among Sensex stocks included HCL Tech, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Vedanata and HDFC. 


>> 
ZEEL, Dish TV bled
Shares of Zee Entertainment and Dish TV plummeted 26 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, after online news website TheWire.in reported that a link has emerged between Essel Group and a company being probed for suspect demonetisation deposits. There were also reports that Zee Entertainment’s promotors’ plan to sell a stake in the company has gained fresh momentum. 


>> 
CBI raids DLF offices
Shares of DLF came under pressure after CBI carried out searches at 20 locations in Delhi-NCR, including offices of the realty major, on Friday in connection with alleged irregularities in land allocation in Gurgaon in 2009. The stock ended 11.50 per cent lower.


>> 
Sectoral Watch
Barring IT, all other sectoral indices closed lower on NSE with media stocks witnessing the worst hammering. The Nifty Media index tanked over 16 per cent on a massive slide in Zee Entertainment shares. 

Auto and realty were two other worst-hit sectors on NSE. Among auto stocks, Maruti Suzuki was the worst hit while in DLF was the top drag for the realty index.



Factors that dragged market:



Maruti, bank stocks bleed
Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank dragged Sensex lower in Friday's session. Maruti was responsible for nearly half of the point-wise decline in Sensex. ICICI Bank slipped after CBI on Thursday booked the bank's former CEO Chanda Kochhar on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and abuse of official position for “dishonestly sanctioning loans to the Videocon Group”.



Rupee slips
The rupee slipped against the US dollar to hit an intraday low of Rs 71.23. The domestic unit declined some 16 paise against the greenback mainly on account of rise in crude oil prices.



Rise in crude oil prices
Oil prices edged up on Friday as turmoil in Venezuela increased the chances of tighter global supply if the United States makes good on signals that it could impose sanctions on Venezuelan exports. But fresh data on surging US fuel stocks and worries about US-China trade talks weighed on prices. Brent crude oil futures traded at $61.17 a barrel, up 8 cents, or 0.13 per cent.



Expert-take:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
""Market pared the opening momentum due to intensified selling in media stocks and below expected quarter results while global market rallied. Rupee weakened and 10-year yield inched higher due to concern on rise in oil prices on account of turmoil in Venezuela. Market may extend the range bound movement as global risk factors like US China trade talks and growth concern continued to gain investor’s attention.""


Rajah Yadav, Sr. Research Analyst, 
Today trading session remained very much volatile as after making a gap up opening, market ended with half a percent of cut. It continued to trade in the green in the afternoon session driven by some stock specific movements. However, in the late afternoon session, heavy selling was witnessed in auto, media and banking stocks that weighed down the market. Index heavyweight like Maruti Suzuki and Ultratech were down over 7 per cent after posting weaker than expected results. Zee Entertainment was down ~30 per cent amid some business concern. Broader indices continued to face sharp selling and both mid and small cap indices were down over 1.3 per cent. Stock-specific movement in the ongoing earning season continues to dominate the market trend in coming sessions."
45,2019-01-25,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Disappointing December quarter earnings of Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, weighed in on market sentiment, causing the benchmark indices to settle in the negative territory on Friday.

The market traded steady all through the first half of the session, but took a plunge after Maruti came out with a set of numbers that fell below expectations. 

A wave of selling emerged across sectors, led by auto, media, realty and bank stocks, which erased all the gains of the morning session and made Sensex and Nifty close in the red. 

Positive mood of most emerging markets failed to lift the mood. A 170 points, or 0.47 per cent, fall dragged Sensex to 36,025 at close. Nifty lost 69 points, or 0.64 per cent, to settle at 10,780.

Midcaps and smallcaps suffered most as their sectoral indices plunged up to 1.58 per cent.


Let us walk you through the highlights of the day’s proceedings:

Maruti's misery continuesThe automaker maintained negative trend in quarterly earnings. A 17.21 per cent drop in third quarter profit marked the second consecutive quarter of negative growth. On the back of a 10 per cent YoY slippage in September quarter profit, December quarter numbers turned out to be worse; and worst ever since March quarter of 2014. Maruti reported 35.46 per cent quarterly de-growth in profit after tax. The scrip closed 8.11 per cent down at Rs 6,469 on NSE.


Zee logs worst-ever fallShares of Zee Entertainment tanked 30.92 per cent to Rs 229 on NSE, logging their worst-ever fall. Company's subsidiary Dish TV tanked 37.41 per cent to Rs 21. Both stocks crumbled after reports that a link has emerged between Essel Group and a company being probed for suspect deposits during the demonetisation drive. “Dreamline Manpower Solutions, a company being probed by the SFIO, carried out transactions involving a few Essel entities in 2016-17 and is also at the heart of a legal spat between Videocon and Essel,"" the report said. However, Zee told BSE it was not aware of any such probe.


Indian Bank plunges as Q3 profit halvesIndian Bank's third quarter profit halved to Rs 152.26 crore on account of rising provisions for bad loans. The bank had posted a net profit of Rs 303.06 crore in the corresponding October-December period of the previous financial year. The stock closed 7.23 per cent down at Rs 237.45 on NSE. 


Pfizer rises on Q3 numbersShares of Pfizer jumped 3.53 per cent to Rs 2,777, a day after it reported a 51.24 per cent rise in profit at Rs 131.94 crore for the quarter ended December 2018 against Rs 87.24 crore reported for the previous quarter ended December 2017. 


YES Bank extends gainsShares of YES Bank closed 2.11 per cent higher at Rs 219, extending the gains into the third consecutive session. The company has named Ravneet Singh Gill as the new MD and CEO to succeed Rana Kapoor, whose term ends on January 31. After a subdued set of December quarter numbers, global brokerage firm CLSA has maintained a ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 280. It added that clarity on new strategy and management churn is to be watched. 


DLF plunges 10% after CBI raidsShares of realty major DLF cracked 10.27 per cent to Rs 159.50 after CBI carried out searches at 20 locations in Delhi-NCR, including its offices, in connection with alleged irregularities in land allocation in Gurgaon in 2009. A PTI report said CBI has registered a new case against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda over glaring irregularities in acquisition of 1,417 acres land by the then Haryana government in Gurgaon in 2009. 


L&T falls 1% ahead of Q3 numbersShares of Engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro closed 0.56 per cent down at Rs 1,288 on Friday ahead of its third-quarter numbers. Post market hours, the company posted a 37.02 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in Q3 profit at Rs 2,041 crore over Rs 1,489.98 crore in Q3FY18. The numbers came as better-than-expected as analysts in an ET Now poll had estimated a profit of Rs 1,860 crore. 


110 stocks signal potential fallAdani Power, Punj Lloyd, JSW Steel, Zee Media Corp, United Breweries and Greaves Cotton were among 110 stocks that showed bearish crossovers on BSE, as per the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. Meanwhile, 35 stocks, including Vedanta, InterGlobe Aviation, BPCL, Kaveri Seed Company, Oberoi Realty and Pfizer, showed bullish crossovers on BSE.


Nifty Media top sectoral loserThe media index suffered a 16.37 per cent loss, owing to deep cuts in shares of Dish TV India, Zee Entertainment and Zee Media Corporation. Out of 15 components on the index, 11 closed the day with losses, 3 logged gains and 1 remained unchanged.


IT pack lone sectoral gainerThe IT index closed as the lone sectoral gainer on NSE. The index closed with a nominal gain of 0.45 per cent, backed by rise in shares of HCL Tech (up 3.02 per cent), TCS (up 0.94 per cent), Wipro (up 0.70 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (up 0.45 per cent)."
46,2019-01-25,Zee,"NEW DELHI: After Zee group stocks took a heavy beating on Friday, Subhash Chandra, Chairman of ZEE and Essel Group in an open letter said that certain “negative forces” attacked the stock of Zee Entertainment to sabotage the company’s strategic sale process.

In the letter, Chandra said that buying D2H from Videocon was a wrong investment decision and he made some incorrect bids in the infra space. 

Shares of Zee Entertainment cracked 30.92 per cent to Rs 229.70 on the NSE on Friday, logging its worst-ever fall after a report in the Wire said that a link had emerged between Essel Group and a company being probed for suspect demonetisation deposits. 

""Dreamline Manpower Solutions, a company being probed by the SFIO, carried out transactions involving a few Essel entities in 2016-17 and is also at the heart of a legal spat between Videocon and Essel,"" a Wire report said.

Zee Entertainment’s subsidiary Dish TV also tanked 37.41 per cent to Rs 21. 

In the letter Chandra also urged the lenders not to react in an anarchical manner and to maintain patience, till the process of ZEE Entertainment’s stake sale was completed.


Here’s the full text of the letter:At a very early stage of my life, I have learnt the most important lesson from my grandfather, Shri Jagannath Goenka, which taught me that a direct dialogue with the creditors should be maintained, should you find it difficult to repay any sort of loans, and this message is my earnest effort in doing so.

First and foremost, vide this message I would like to express my deepest apologies to our esteemed financial supporters. I have always been the first to accept my faults and we have been consistently accountable of the decisions taken, and I will maintain the same today as well. For the first time in my career of 52 years, I am compelled to apologize to our bankers, NBFCs & Mutual Funds, since I believe that I have not lived upto to their expectations, despite the best of my intentions.

I am extremely certain that there is no promoter in India Inc., who has dared to sell the jewel of his crown, to pay off the liabilities. While the process is still ongoing, there are some forces which are not willing to see us succeed.

That said, I am not indicating that there are no mistakes done from my end, and as always, I am willing to face the consequences of the same. I assure you, that I am not running away from the core issue and will do my best to repay each and every person. The best time for the same, however, is difficult to be mentioned at this stage.


I would also like to state through this message, the key points which have gone wrong:



Essel Infra: As most of the infra companies, even we have made some incorrect bids. In usual cases, Infra Companies have raised their hands and have left their lenders with nonperforming assets, but in our case, My Obsession of not walking away from the situation, has made me to bleed Rs 4,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore . Despite the loss making projects, we continued to pay the interest and the principle, by borrowing funds against ourshareholdings in Listed Companies.
Acquisition of D2H: My recommendation made to my brother Jawahar Goel to buy D2H from Videocon was one more key error, which costed me and Jawahar both, a fortune.
When our family business separation was implemented, as the eldest member of the family, I had taken the entire burden of the debts. I believe, it was my mistake to have told myself that “Subhash you can earn and repay the creditors”. Post which, most of my bets on the new businesses have not worked, which led to the increased debt, due to the added interest levels.
The situation at hand, became further unmanageable after the IL&FS issue, came to public light. Till then, we were managing our borrowings efficiently. The IL&FS meltdown stopped the roll overs, diminishing our ability to service our borrowings.
From May / June 2018 onwards a negative force which was acting against our grip as promoters became strongly active. This was followed by some anonymous letters being sent to all Bankers, NBFCs, Mutual Funds, Shareholders, etc.
Whenever we have reported some really good results from the operating Companies, the share prices were intentionally hammered by these negative forces, driving away the investors.


While the above, are the reasons of the current situation, I must also mention what steps were taken from our end:


We wrote a number of complaints to the Department of Police, Home Minister of Maharashtra, SEBI and other concerned authorities, right since November 2018, but all the efforts did not result in any action.
Till December, we continued to pay the due interest and principle, to all lenders.
I have also given my best to expedite the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment. Infact, I have just returned back from London, last night itself, after a series of positive meetings with potential suitors.

The mentioned negative forces, possibly after getting a hint of these positive meetings, have attacked the share price today, with a clear intention of sabotaging ZEE Entertainment’s strategic sale process.

I must also mention that there is no systematic protection against the insidious attack on us by the mentioned negative forces, but we will continue to seek the support of the system in order to thoroughly investigate the matter.


About the Operating Companies:


All Operating Companies, especially our most precious one which is ZEE Entertainment, are performing exceptionally well and are under NO stress whatsoever. The debt burden is purely at the promoter level, which is reflecting negatively on the Companies.
I would like to reiterate that ALL the Companies are performing exceptionally well and there is no problem whatsoever.

Having said the above, I still believe, strongly feel and would like to urge the lenders, not to react in an anarchical manner and to maintain patience, till the process of ZEE Entertainment’s stake sale is completed. Post the sale process, we will be positively able to repay the entire dues, but if the lenders react in a panic situation, it will only hurt them and us.

I would again like to reiterate that I have no intention whatsoever, to keep a single rupee, till all the dues to the lenders are paid.

Yours truly,

Subhash Chandra"
43,2019-01-25,Zee,"Jawahar Goel, CMD, Dish TV, says their team had arranged loan to Videocon Group in lieu of the pledge of their 
  
  
  D2H shares and this money had come from the banks and it was not a cash but a bank-to-bank transaction and had nothing to do with demonetisation. Goel also says 20 of their distributors had put Rs 7 crore money in their bank account after demonetisation but they had already replied to I-T department about it.Edited excerpts:

We are seeing a massive market cap meltdown in Zee Entertainment and Dish TV. Is there any concerns with respect to any probes that are currently being conducted with respect to demonetisation with the Essel Group? Can you please clarify?
Dish TV Essel Group has got nothing to do with it. In Dish TV our daily collection is around Rs 20 crore and Dish TV had only Rs 22,000 cash in hand at the time of demonetisation. However, some 20 of our distributors had put money in our bank account to the tune of Rs 7 crore. They are PAN holders. About all these things, we had adequately replied to the income tax department.


There is a lot of nervousness on the Street today. With respect to Dish TV right now, is it business as usual? Are any probes being conducted?
No there is no probe in Dish TV or on the Zee side or in Essel Group. But definitely, because of the pledge issue, there is a pressure and as our group has decided to partly sell Zee TV, quite a lot of people have shown interest. Two are very serious contenders. That transaction will take three to six months. On business side, you must have seen the excellent results of Zee as well as Dish TV. 

Businesses are very good and are pretty well intact. The new tariff order is happening, Dish TV will get the higher EBITDA because the NCF will straightaway come to our profit. Our content cost will come down probably from 38% to 30% and that is a good thing.

Dish TV is ready to roll out the shifting of the subscribers to the new regime from 27th January midnight. And within 7th February we will shift all the subscribers.


 Since we have you with us, maybe you could just run us through the sequence of events that happened between 2015 and 2017. The report states that the Serious Fraud and Investigation Office is currently probing a company called Nityank Infrapower, formally Dreamline Manpower for deposits over Rs 3,000 crore made just after demonetisation. Examination of the document shows that Nityank and a group of shell companies carried out financial transactions that involved a few firms associated with the Essel Group between this period.
These companies are not Essel Group companies. The Videocon transaction had happened. So our team arranged the loan to Videocon Group Companies in lieu of the pledge of their shares of D2H and this money had come from the banks. It has nothing to do with demonetisation because demonetisation inquiry only happens if there is a cash deposit. If it is a banking transaction from end to end, there cannot be any such inquiry. 


What was the size of the loan and what is the status on that loan right now?
I am not directly involved in this transaction but this much I know this was a bank loan and the pledge of shares that is of D2H company. It was a bank to bank transactions.


Who did the transaction, which bank was involved in this?
You should ask the concerned officer in SFIO in Hyderabad. They will let you know and the inquiry is almost complete now.


Nityank Infrapower, formally Dreamline Manpower, is it a part of a firm that was involved with Essel Group of Subhash Chandra between 2015 and 2017?
Now they were known people. One of our managers arranged this transaction and the bank loan was raised to pay the advance in lieu of those shares that is it and this transaction has been very well explained and they are about to close the inquiry.


Do you have any idea when the SFIO will come out with a final verdict on this enquiry? It seems that there is still a lot of investigation required in the matter?
No. When there is no illegality, no cash money or public money is involved, then SFIO has nothing to do with it. They simply have to close the enquiry.


Would you be able to give us more details on that?
Well I am not in my office today so I cannot but certainly on Monday I can provide the information.


You are speaking on behalf of the entire group and saying that as of now, there is no cash money or public money involved and that SFIO will have to close that probe. Are you speaking on behalf of the company?
There is no cash money involved. Yes, yes, I know for that because our people were also called and that is why we know there is no cash money involved, there is no public money involved.


When was this probe conducted?
They started the probe seven-eight months ago.


You are saying that the probe has reached its conclusion and that the Essel Group...
No, Zee has nothing to do with it and the company is not Essel Group company.


But has that been officially communicated by SFIO? Have they given a clean chit to Zee and Dish TV?
You see they have not given clean chit but we had adequately replied to them and they know and we also know for sure that there is no cash money involved. It is banking money and it is not public money.


What about this new tariff order by TRAI is that going to impact Dish?
TRAI order will impact us positively, our EBITDA will go up, our content cost will come down and if we are successful we will garner more subscribers more than what we could have done in normal course. 


What is the outlook on your market share as well as the kind of customer addition that you could potentially see going forward?
A few weeks back, we said that we are changing our business model of getting the loss in our books. Instead, we will sell the loss and business is going as usual. The whole team is preparing for the new regime which will give us a breather on the content cost. The content cost of our immediate peers, that is cable companies, is much lower than us. Now, we will get the parity and you will see how advantageous it is for DTH companies."
47,2019-01-26,Zee,"MUMBAI: Zee and Essel group chairman Subhash Chandra on Friday evening issued a dramatic and unusual statement claiming that “negative forces” were trying to sabotage Zee Entertainment’s strategic sale, while acknowledging that he had committed mistakes. He apologised to his bankers, non-banking finance companies and mutual funds, after shares of group companies crashed during the day.

The immediate trigger for the sharp drop in shares (Zee Enterprises fell over 26%, Dish TV by nearly 33% and Essel Propack 16%) appeared to be a news report on the website thewire.in, which mentioned alleged links between the group and Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures, a company that is under the scrutiny of the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore during or after demonetisation.

Some of the developments mentioned on the website had also been reported by ET on December 18.

In statements issued on Friday, Essel Propack and Zee said Nityank did not belong to Essel Group.




Chandra’s ‘open letter’ did not mention the Nityank issue. Instead, he said he was compelled to apologise to bankers, NBFCs and mutual funds as he had not lived up to their expectations.

He said wrong bets in the infrastructure sector combined with the meltdown of IL&FS had resulted in “Rs 4,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore” of losses. The wrong infrastructure bets had left the company with nonperforming assets, he admitted.

“Despite the loss-making projects, we continued to pay the interest and the principle, by borrowing funds against our shareholdings in listed companies,” Chandra wrote in the note.

His efforts to repay creditors, Chandra said, was on account of his “obsession” with not walking away from difficult situations.

The Essel Group promoter said the company’s inability to handle debt worsened after the IL&FS meltdown. “The IL&FS meltdown stopped the rollovers, diminishing our ability to service our borrowings,” he said.


D2H Acquisition Cost a Fortune: Chandra
Chandra admitted that the ballooning debt was also a result of some other decisions, notably the acquisition of DTH operator Videocon D2H. He termed the acquisition a key error that cost him and his brother Jawahar Goel a “fortune”.

In an investor call with analysts on Friday evening, Zee MD Punit Goenka said Essel Group promoters had total debt of Rs 11,000-12,000 crore.

Chandra had pledged shares of his listed companies to borrow funds to invest in Essel Infra, the unlisted infrastructure company.

He pointed out in his mea culpa that till December, the company had paid due interest and principle to all lenders.

Hinting at possible sabotage, Chandra claimed there were was “a negative force”, which was acting against the company’s interests. He said anonymous letters were written to regulators whenever the company announced good results.

Referring to the stake sale in Zee Entertainment, Chandra said he has had good meetings with potential investors but that the “negative force” was “hammering” the stock. “The mentioned negative forces, possibly after getting a hint of these positive meetings, have attacked the share price today (Friday), with a clear intention of sabotaging Zee Entertainment’s strategic sale process,” he said.

ET reported on Friday that Chandra had held meetings in the US and London last week and that the company is now in talks with a number of players.

Chandra asked investors to repose faith in the company.


INVESTORS LOSE Rs 13,686 CRORE
The crash in the shares of group companies wiped off nearly Rs 13,686 crore of investor wealth, as per ET’s estimates.

Chandra also said that at the time of the division of his family’s business, he had taken the entire debt burden upon himself, which added to his troubles.

ET had first reported on December 18 that Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures (formerly known as Dreamline Manpower Solutions), a company with apparent links to Essel, was being investigated by the SFIO.

In a late Friday evening statement, a Zee spokesperson said: “Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures is an independent company and does not belong to Essel Group. The group at this stage does not wish to comment on the legal matter between Dish TV and Videocon Group, since the same is sub judice. As per our limited knowledge, the queries received from SFIO were directed to Nityank, regarding demonetisation.”

The statement added that the transactions referred to in media reports, “regarding involvement of Essel Group companies”, had been “undertaken with due approvals and compliance of applicable laws and regulations and through proper banking channels. The said investigation or the mentioned transactions do not have any bearing or connection with any of the operating entities of Essel Group.”

Videocon Group companies have alleged in court filings that Nityank had transferred Rs 1,626 crore to the former’s promoters by subscribing to debentures of Hindustan Oil Ventures (HOV) — a Videocon Group company.

Domebell Electronics, a Videocon Group company, approached the Delhi High Court on August 31 last year, claiming it had received payment from Essel through Nityank as an advance for selling shares in Videocon D2H, which was merged with Zee Group’s Dish TV in March last year.

Documents accessed by ET show that Nityank had also provided security in the form of HOV debentures to Yes Bank for loans worth Rs 1,600 crore taken by three Essel Group companies — RPW Projects, Pan India Network Infravest and Mumbai WTR.

Videocon first approached the Delhi High Court on the grounds that Essel had unlawfully invoked a pledge on Videocon D2H shares that were kept in its custody till the merger with Dish TV received regulatory approval.

It also claimed the shares were given as security if the merger failed, since it had already received an advance from Essel."
48,2019-01-27,Zee,"NEW DELHI: The Essel Group claims to have reached an understanding with lenders who hold pledged shares of the group’s promoters. This could arrest the decline in the Essel Group stocks. Group companies shares had plummeted 10-33% on Friday, triggered by reports of payment defaults and sale of pledged shares.

While the sharp fall in stock prices dented the NAVs of equity funds holding these scrips, there were fears that the crisis would spread to debt funds as well. More than Rs 8,000 crore worth of bonds and debentures issued by group companies are held by 150 debt mutual funds. Of this, Rs 6,329 is invested in 60 open-ended debt funds while the balance Rs 1,672 crore is in 90 fixed maturity plans (FMPs).

In a statement issued after the meeting with lenders, the Essel Group stated that it has been agreed that the no default will be declared due to the steep fall in price and there will be synergy and co-operation amongst lenders. A. Balasubramanian, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC said, “We have always believed in the intrinsic value of Zee Entertainment. I am very glad with the outcome of the meeting, which enabled us to arrive at a consensus, in the interest of all stakeholders.”

The Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund is the biggest investor, with an exposure of Rs 2,936 crore spread across 28 schemes. This is almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to the Zee group.

However, Balasubramanian is confident that the prices of these bonds and debentures will not be impacted. “These bonds are secure,” he says. 

One scheme alone has Rs 1,288 crore invested in Zee group bonds. As on 31 December 2018, the Aditya Birla Sun Life Medium Term Plan held zero-coupon bonds worth Rs 720 crore issued by Sprit Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd. (credit rating A) and Rs 568 issued by Adilink Infra & Multitrading Private Ltd (unrated). The two holdings account for 12.5% of the fund’s total Rs 10,272 crore portfolio and are its top holdings.

Another scheme, the Aditya Birla Sun Life Credit Risk Fund, held Rs 740 crore worth of zero-coupon bonds of Sprit Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd. and Adilink Infra & Multitrading Private Ltd. The two holdings account for 9.2% of its portfolio, with Sprit Infrapower as its top holding (5.62%). The Aditya Birla Sun Life Dynamic Bond Fund has over 8% of its Rs 5,136 crore portfolio invested in Sprit Infrapower bonds.

In percentage terms, Baroda Mutual Fund schemes have the largest exposure to bonds issued by Zee group companies. As on 31 December 2018, the Baroda Credit Risk Fund had Rs 168 crore invested in zero-coupon bonds of ARM Infra & Utilities Pvt Ltd. and Cyquator Media Services Pvt. Ltd. Together, this is 17.7% of its Rs 947 crore portfolio.

The silver lining for debt fund investors is the new rule that allows side pocketing of distressed assets. It is an accounting method that separates illiquid bonds from quality investments in a debt portfolio. If the Zee group bonds crash, open-ended debt funds may cushion themselves by putting them aside in a separate side portfolio. The fund’s NAV then reflect the value of the liquid assets, with a separate NAV assigned to the side pocket assets based on their estimated value.

However, this will not apply to fixed maturity plans (FMPs) where the scheme has a limited tenure and bonds are held till maturity. HDFC Mutual Fund, the second largest investor in Zee group debt with an exposure of Rs 1,196 crore, has most of its exposure through FMPs. It has invested over Rs 900 crore in bonds and debentures through 38 FMPs. Some FMPS have over 20% of their assets invested in Zee group companies."
49,2019-01-27,Zee,"Subhash Chandra-promoted two Essel group companies Zee Entertainment Enterprise and Dish TV on Sunday denied links with Nityank lnfrapower and Multiventures Ltd, a company being probed by the SFIO for suspicious demonetisation deposits, as claimed in a media report.

Zee Entertainment Enterprise Ltd (ZEEL), in a regulatory filing, said Nityank lnfrapower and Multiventures Ltd is an ""independent company and does not belong to Essel Group"".

It further said that involvement of Essel Group entities in the the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) investigation against Nityank is being done only with ""malicious intent"" and ""legal action as advised"" is being initiated in this regard.

""At the outset, we wish to reiterate and confirm that Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has no connection whatsoever with any alleged transaction(s) contained in the article published by a website,"" said ZEEL.

Over allegations of involvement of other Essel Group entities in the media report, the filing said that all ""queries relating to demonetisation, if any, from SFIO were directed to Nityank"".

The Essel group entities have already provided other information sought by the SFIO and no further information is sought from them.

""In view of above, since all information sought by SFIO has been provided by Essel Group entities and no further information has been subsequently sought, the matter stands closed for Essel Group entities,"" said ZEEL.

While its DTH arm Dish TV has also denied any transaction with Nityank in its scheme of merger of Videocon D2h with the company.

""In response to communication received by the Company in July 2018 from SFIO, seeking information relating to Nityank Infra power and Multiventures Ltd (Nityank), while providing requisite information/replies including relating to Scheme of Arrangement for Amalgamation of Videocon D2h Limited with and into Dish TV India Ltd, the company had categorically denied having had any transaction with Nityank,"" it said.

On January 25, shares of ZEE group companies had come under massive selling pressure, plummeting up to 33 per cent, and suffered a combined erosion of Rs 13,352 crore in market valuation.

Later, Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra apologised to lenders and said his company is in a financial mess and blamed the same for the aggressive bets on infra, which has gone out of control since the IL&FS crisis and also the acquisition of Videocon's D2H business.

Chandra also alleged that some negative forces are out to sabotage his efforts to raise money through a strategic sale in the flagship company Zee Entertainment Enterprises."

52,2019-01-28,Zee,"Promoter and chairman of the Essel Group Subhash Chandra got a threemonth breather from lenders and creditors to find a buyer for half his stake in the flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) in a major relief for the Indian entertainment giant.

ZEE promoters and their lenders also agreed that the latter will ensure no default is declared due to the steep fall in share price of the company.

Chandra on Friday issued an unusually dramatic statement claiming “negative forces” were trying to sabotage his efforts to find a buyer. He simultaneoulsy apologised to investors for his strategic mistakes. On Saturday, he had hectic parleys with mutual funds, NBFCs and banks, which went way past midnight.

“Lenders have given Chandra three months to find a buyer. They have agreed that the fundamentals of ZEE are strong and there is no current need to panic, and they seem to have agreed to not invoke the pledged shares,” a highly placed source said.

ZEE said on Sunday it was decided there will be synergy and cooperation amongst lenders for a unified approach.

“I am pleased to share that we have achieved an understanding with lenders,” Chandra said. “We have always valued their immense trust and faith sown in us and the positive and progressive outcome of the meeting is a true example of the same.

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, HDFC, Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential, Baroda Mutual Fund are among top investors with biggest exposure in Zee group companies.

As of December 31, 2018, ZEE promoters owned 41.62 per cent in the company of which 59.37 per cent are pledged with lenders.

Sources said that on Friday, when ZEE shares started nosediving, about 62-63 lakh pledged shares, or 0.65 per cent of company’s total share capital and just under 1.5 per cent of promoters’ shareholding, were sold.

“After Saturday’s meetings, ZEE promoters have managed to buy some time. Though there is nothing wrong with ZEE, a lot will depend on how soon they manage to get a buyer and how long they can stop lenders from invoking the pledged shares,” said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.

ZEE’s shares crashed 26 per cent, while other Essel group companies — Dish TV and Essel Propack — plummeted 32 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, on Friday, the biggestever single-day crash for the companies. As per ET estimates, the crash eroded nearly Rs 13,686 crore in investor wealth.

Rajiv Sharma of SBICAP Securities, in his report on January 21st, maintained a buy for ZEE shares with a target price of Rs 550. “We believe investor concerns around the future prospects of TV are overdone and the market is not pricing in Zee’s ability to create value in OTT after inducting a strategic partner. We are valuing the core business at Rs 520 and the OTT business at Rs 30 per share,” the report said.

On November 13, 2018, Cahndra announced his intention to sell half of promoters’ holding in ZEE to a global strategic investor as it wants to transfer business into content technology company in view of the changing landscape of the Indian media with data growth. However, there were also concerns on high promoter pledge and liquidity issues in group’s various Infra businesses.


ZEE SAID ESSEL DOES NOT OWN NITYANK
The shares of ZEE group companies tanked after reports about alleged links between the group and Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures, a company under the scrutiny of investigative authorities for deposits of over Rs 3000 crore during or after the November 2016 demonetisation.

However, Essel Group and ZEE have denied ownership of Nityank.

ZEE said on Sunday that Essel Group filed a “legal case against the media platform, which has maliciously attempted to establish a linkage between the SFIO’s investigation and ZEE promoters.”

ZEE also said that all queries relating to demonetisation from SFIO were directed to Nityank and all the information/ documents relating to certain transactions sought by SFIO were provided.

“As the letter reads, since all information sought by SFIO has been provided by Essel Group entities and no further information has been subsequently sought, the matter stands closed for Essel Group entities,” ZEE informed bourses on Sunday."

57,2019-01-28,Zee,"Zee stock may provide an opportunity in the short run. In the slightly medium term, more re-rating will take 
  
  
  place when you get the cash back and you see more uptick, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


What are you making of the entire Zee situation and do you think that the clarification would manage to soothe investor nerves?
There were a lot of drama unfolding in Zee. The stock lost 40% and there cannot be problems which were not known. The business is extremely viable and we have seen that even the quarterly results were very good. Creditors giving Zee three months’ extension means that the re-rating will only happen once you really get the money on the table. 

Maybe the deal will take place in a very hurried fashion. If you could lie low and ignore the rhetoric, then at Rs 350 or Rs 320, Zee is definitely a screaming buy. It trades at almost 50% discount to the one year forward multiple, which has never happened in the last three years. We think the OTT platform and the rest will play a very good upside on the media side. However, in the short run, there is a lot of exposure with mutual funds and some of the NBFCs. Even though they have spoken of a hiatus, we hope they follow through with that. All will depend how fast they can get the money on the table.


But given that we are talking about pretty strict timeframe now, just three months, do you think that in terms of the valuations it might not be as lucrative and hence pose a problem for Zee Entertainment?
Correct. So this fall has definitely upset the table for them. We know that they are at the end of the process of finding the right suitor. Maybe they sell slightly more than 50% but there are enough suitors -- whether it is Amazon or Comcast. Everyone wants to get into media or maybe Reliance itself may just be a fence sitter and take a stake, because in the end they are calling the shots on both telecom and media. 

So it is a glass half full, half empty. The stock may be giving you an opportunity in the short run. In the slightly medium term, more re-rating will take place when you get the cash back and you see more uptick once the management clarifies that the debt has been reduced and there is no such unforgettable incidences of collateral selling which really hurts the investors and the mutual funds."

While the agreement between Zee promoters and lenders, including mutual funds, to provide a three-month breather while a buyer for Zee Enterprise is found, could provide some respite to the group’s shares, concerns over promoters’ indebtedness would keep investors in debt MFs, which hold the securities of promoter entities, on the tenterhooks.

At least 11 mutual funds — HDFC, Aditya Birla Sun Life and ICICI Prudential among them — have an exposure of Rs 6,600 crore to the Essel Group’s debt securities.

Senior industry executives said a large chunk of this lending has been to promoter entities with shares as collateral. Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) too have lent to promoter firms.

Zee Enterprises slumped 26 per cent and Dish TV fell 33 per cent on Friday after a news report alleging links between Essel Group and Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures, a company being probed by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore after demonetisation. The slump intensified due to sale of pledged shares, which market participants believe belonged to the promoter group. ECL Finance, lending arm of Edelweiss Group, and IIFL Wealth Finance sold approximately 24.3 million shares of Dish TV, equivalent to 1.3 per cent of company equity, on Friday.



The stock slide prompted group chairman Subhash Chandra to issue a statement in which he apologised to bankers, NBFCs and mutual funds for wrong bets on infrastructure. He also accused “negative forces” of trying to sabotage Zee Entertainment’s strategic sale.

Any further drop in stock values will force lenders and mutual funds to offload pledged shares unless promoters provide fresh equity as collateral. Executives of MFs holding Essel group debt securities met the group management on Saturday to understand how promoters plan to deal with the crisis.

“We’ll continue to follow news flow on companies/group — await details on pledged shares that the company is likely to provide in the next few days, as well as colour on the group’s liquidity/deleveraging process near-term,” said Citi’s Aditya Mathur and Surendra Goyal in a client note after a conference call with analysts over the weekend. “These are likely to have an important bearing on the stocks, possible shareholding changes and play an important role in the consummation of any deal for Zee.”

Many mutual funds and a handful of NBFCs loaned money to at least 16 Essel Group and promoter entities, which pledged shares or property as collateral. Promoters have pledged almost 60 per cent of their 42 per cent in Zee Entertainment. Ratings depend on the quality of the collateral — shares or property. Zee promoters pumped borrowed money into the infrastructure business but losses there hit repayment capability. While the group has been able to service debt through rolling over of loans, the stock crash could make this difficult, forcing promoters to raise money elsewhere.

After the slump, the coverage ratio — the minimum shares required as collateral — for some fund houses has come down to 1.1 times, said a money manager. Hypothetically, if the share price falls by a further 11 per cent on Monday, a mutual fund will not have enough shares to cover its investment in debt securities. Depending on the company, its credit rating and risk profile, mutual funds generally have a cover of 1.5-3 times. When share prices fall, lenders have two options — one is to ask for more collateral from the promoter. The other is to sell some of the shares to maintain the coverage ratio. It could not be ascertained if mutual funds sold shares of the company on Friday.

“It is one of those peculiar cases of the company being healthy while promoters are heavily indebted. Stress at promoter level is impacting the company,” said a senior executive at a large mutual fund owning a sizeable chunk of Zee shares and with exposure to the group's debt instruments.

Friday’s crash in Zee and Dish TV prompted some distributors and financial advisors to ask rich clients over the weekend to pull money out of mutual fund schemes with exposure to the group’s debt. These instruments are held across various credit risk funds, dynamic bond funds and corporate bond funds.

“If the stock price continues its slide, we could see a lot of redemptions from HNIs (high net worth investors). If the fund house does not write down its investment, it could affect the remaining investors in the same,” said the research head of a private banking outfit.

In the recent past, investors have suffered losses in debt mutual fund schemes, which fully wrote down investments in Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS). A few other schemes have written off a fourth of their investments in SPV of road projects of IL&FS."
62,2019-01-28,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Many foreign brokerages have maintained their buy ratings on Zee Entertainment as the stock now trades at a deep discount to long-term averages following Friday’s 27 per cent plunge. 

Nomura India said there is no change in business fundamentals after Friday's correction in the stock price. A large part of the correction in the stock price was in the futures and options segment, and actual deliveries were much lower, it said. 

The stock took a beating on Friday on a report suggesting the company’s alleged link with Nityank lnfrapower, which is under SFIO investigation. The company has strongly denied the report and on Sunday said it has reached a deal with lenders on not invoking shares of the company if the stock price falls further.

Deutsche Bank in a note said promoters' intention to sell up to 50 per cent of their shareholding to a strategic partner, which is expected to be completed in March or April, will be positive for minority shareholders.

“Of the three Infra assets, one deal is done (expect funds to come in very shortly - weeks/months). Solar and road asset deals too should see full consummation to happen in 3-6 months. EV of the three infra asset sale is upwards of Rs 20,000 crore with equity value of Rs 8,000-9,000 crore. Sale of the Infra assets would remove a significant part of the pledge, only a small amount would be left to take care of,” the brokerage said.

On Monday, the scrip rose 14.29 per cent to hit a high of Rs 365 on the BSE. The promoter group of the company has said the stake sale process in Zee is at an advanced stage and will be met within the stated timeline.

The management on Monday said 96-97 per cent of the lenders have agreed not to invoke shares if the shares fall further. After the agreement, the company has not pledged further shares as collateral after Friday’s sharp fall, said CEO Punit Goenka said in an investor call.

There is standstill on part of lenders for now, Goenka said. The management said stake sale in Zee will not be hit by recent developments.

Following the revocation of company shares on Friday, promoter holding has dropped 60 basis points to 41 per cent, the management said. 

Essel Group has pledged 59 per cent of its Zee ownership (effective 25 per cent) to group lenders, CLSA said.

“While pledging of Zee shares is not new, its rise from 42 per cent in December 2013 to 59 per cent in December 2018 and Zee’s stock price fall have exacerbated risk of pledges being invoked,” CLSA said. 

That said, the brokerage has retained its buy call on the stock as it sees valuations compelling at 16 times FY20 PE, a 45 per cent discount to 10-year average PE.

Deutsche Bank values Zee at 28 times March 2020 earnings, a 15 per cent discount to its five-year average trading multiple and has a target price of Rs 575 on the stock.

CLSA said Zee’s valuations look compelling after the sharp fall, adding that it sees 19 per cent earnings CAGR over 2019-21."

77,2019-01-28,Zee,"Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises rebounded 16.6 per cent Monday, after the Essel Group said it obtained an assurance from lenders that Friday’s rout in the group flagship’s market price would not lead to declaration of a default. Shares of other group companies also gained sharply after managing director Punit Goenka, in a pre-market call with analysts, reiterated that there was no change in the growth guidance of the company and that its stake-sale plans were on track.

Zee management went into a fire-fighting mode over the weekend after the shares tanked 26 per cent, the steepest ever during a day’s trade, on Friday, even as chairman Subhash Chandra made a dramatic statement claiming that “negative forces” were trying to sabotage his efforts to find a buyer for Zee’s stake and apologised to investors for what he called his strategic mistakes. 

Promoters and top executives reached out to analysts and media over the past two days, as well as held a series of investor calls to allay fears of erosion in the company’s market value.

Chandra had last month announced that the promoters were looking for a strategic buyer for half their stake in Zee. This was to help in its global expansion and repayment of loans. There was a fear that lenders would sell shares pledged by the promoters if the value fell further.

Zee shares closed at Rs 372.50, up Rs 53.15, Monday on the Bombay Stock Exchange, while Dish TV gained 5.5 per cent to close at Rs 24 and Essel Propack rose 10 per cent to Rs 107. 

The benchmark Sensex ended 1 per cent lower.

While analysts are optimistic about Zee’s business prospects, they also flagged concerns over promoters' indebtedness.

Although the business remains robust, the promoter entity needs to reduce debt, said Edelweiss in a note to investors, adding: “We believe that the emerged developments will tone down the management’s potential to realise the value in business.” The brokerage cut its one-year target price on the Zee stock by 20 per cent to Rs 489, but maintained the ‘buy’ rating after the recent fall in the price.

Sharekhan, the retail broking arm of BNP Paribas, downgraded the stock to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’, citing the ongoing developments. 

“Although the fundamentals of the Zee group remain intact, the vulnerability of the stock has gone up,” said Gaurav Dua, head of research. “There could be a derating in the stock due to the ongoing developments, which could change the price-to-earnings multiples of the stock.”


DEAL WITH LENDERS 
Just before the opening bell, Goenka, who is also Zee’s chief executive, informed analysts about reaching an agreement with lenders where they agreed that they would not declare default due the fall in the share price on Friday. He said they had given the promoters more time to reduce their stake in the flagship company.

The new terms with lenders include completion of the deal and loan repayment in a time-bound manner.

“We have got a timeframe which extends beyond the April 2019 deadline that we had committed towards the stake sale,” Goenka said on the call. “We will now reengage with the prospective buyers and I'm confident that we should be able to do it in within the timeline we have set for ourselves.”

ET reported on Monday that lenders had given Chandra three months to find a buyer.

When asked about what Goenka meant by reengaging with buyers, a Zee spokesperson told ET that in view of the drop in the company’s share price, it was natural for additional players to find the deal attractive than before. Hence, the dialogues with them would certainly get initiated “while discussions with the shortlisted partners, on the other hand, are anyways in a good progress,” he said.

According to Goenka, Friday’s drop in the share price would not have any bearing on the deal, as the “intrinsic value of the asset remains the same”. There are “multiple suitors” for the stake, he added.

The company refused to comment on whether promoters would be willing to sell more than 50 per cent of their shares, calling it too early.

Meanwhile, Zee said it filed a defamation case against the online publication that wrote about alleged links between the Essel Group and a company that was under scrutiny for large cash deposits during or after demonetisation. 

Goenka said the Essel Group and Zee had nothing to do with the allegations.

Goenka also said the promoters had pledged shares only in India. The management assured lenders that proceeds from any deal will first go to them and only after that the promoters will claim their share, he said."
76,2019-01-28,Zee,"Subhash Chandra, the grains-to-media tycoon, is facing a storm just after he set his eyes on bigger things and decided to divest up to 50% of promoter holding in India’s leading entertainment company Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (ZEEL). Shares of Zee and Essel group companies shares were pounded on Friday. Zee Enterprises slumped 26 per cent and Dish TV fell 33 per cent after a news report alleging links between Essel Group and Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures, a company being probed by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore after demonetisation. 

This was followed by a dramatic mea culpa by Chandra and then a three-month breather to him from lenders and creditors to find a buyer.


The Nityank affair
In the eye of the storm is a company called Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures which is being probed by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). ET reported in December the legal tussle between Essel and Videocon over Nityank. It all started when a merger between the DTH arms of Videocon and Essel groups, which took place in March 2018, landed in the Delhi High Court. 

In a case filed on 31 August of 2018 a Videocon group company has claimed that Essel group unlawfully invoked pledges on certain Videocon D2H shares that were placed in their custody. 

The legal tussle between Essel and Videocon started after Nityank approached NCLT to prevent allotment of shares to Videocon group company Domebell in the merged Dish TVNSE 4.46 % entity on the grounds that it had a pledge on Videocon D2H shares owned by Domebell. Nityank claimed the shares should be allotted to itself. 

Domebell and a group of other Videocon companies such as Electroparts later approached the Delhi high court on 31 August this year claiming that Nityank is an Essel group company and had unlawfully invoked a pledge on Videocon D2H shares that were placed as security with it in the event a merger with Dish TV were to fall through. 

Domebell and a group of other Videocon companies such as Electroparts later approached the Delhi high court on 31 August this year claiming that Nityank is an Essel group company and had unlawfully invoked a pledge on Videocon D2H shares that were placed as security with it in the event a merger with Dish TV were to fall through. It sought an injunction from the court restraining the allotment of shares to Nityank in the merged Dish TV entity. The court granted the stay which was valid till 9 September. The case has been pending.


Why is SFIO probing Nityank?
The SFIO is investigating companies that made huge cash deposits and withdrawals during and soon after demonetization. The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has asked the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) to probe 57 shell companies on the basis of reports by regional directors of the office of the Registrar of Companies (RoCs). 

A TOI report dated 31 July 2018 stated Nityank (formerly known as Dreamline Manpower Solutions) had come under the scrutiny of the fraud watchdog after it deposited and withdrew large amounts of cash with Yes Bank in the aftermath of demonetisation. 

Though the company did not respond to official queries from ET, sources close to Nityank told ET that the transactions were ""legal"" and the SFIO had been provided relevant explanations.

In a response to emailed queries from ET, Essel group had denied any association with Nityank. “Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures Ltd. is not an Essel Group Company and all the allegations are completely baseless and infructuous,” a spokesperson said in response. Recently, ZEEL said in a regulatory filing that involvement of Essel Group entities in the the SFIO investigation against Nityank was being done only with ""malicious intent"" and ""legal action as advised"" was being initiated in this regard. 

Videocon gave a different picture in court filings. In a letter written to the SFIO on July 2, 2018 and subsequently submitted to the court, Videocon group company, Hindustan Oil Ventures (HOV) has said that Nityank subscribed to its debentures worth Rs. 1,626 crore on behalf of the Essel group as advance payment for the shares that the Subhash Chandra group was buying in the Videocon D2H business.

HOV claimed that Nityank entered into back to back share purchase and ""letter agreements"" at the time the merger was being negotiated with Essel. As per the agreements, Essel and Videocon would nominate a company each to facilitate the transfer of the advance payment. Further, Nityank’s filing with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) show that it had provided security for loans worth approximately Rs. 1,600 crore taken by three Essel group companies — RPW Projects, Pan India Network Infravest and Mumbai WTR —in 2017. It furnished HOV debentures as security for these loans.


The apology
After the group stocks crashed, Chandra issued a dramatic and unusual statement claiming that “negative forces” were trying to sabotage Zee Entertainment’s strategic sale, while acknowledging that he had committed mistakes. He apologised to his bankers, non-banking finance companies and mutual funds. Chandra’s ‘open letter’ did not mention the Nityank issue. Instead, he said he was compelled to apologise to bankers, NBFCs and mutual funds as he had not lived up to their expectations. 

He said wrong bets in the infrastructure sector combined with the meltdown of IL&FS had resulted in “Rs 4,000 crore to Rs 5,000 crore” of losses. The wrong infrastructure bets had left the company with non-performing assets, he admitted.

Chandra admitted that the ballooning debt was also a result of some other decisions, notably the acquisition of Videocon D2H. He termed the acquisition a key error that cost him and his brother Jawahar Goel a “fortune”. 

One reason behind Chandra's open letter apologising to the lenders and seeking their patience was that some of the lenders, who have a pledge on the promoter family stock, had sold about 6.5 million shares in the Friday carnage. 


Finally, the breather
Chandra has reached an agreement with lenders, under which the latter wouldn’t declare an event of default due to the steep fall in share prices. A prolonged meeting between the lenders and the promoters took place over the weekend after the stocks crashed. On Sunday evening, Essel said the lenders had agreed not to trigger “any event of default declared due to the steep fall in price”. “As a result, there will be synergy and co-operation among lenders, leading to a unified approach,” the statement added. Lenders drew comfort from reiteration by the promoters for a speedy resolution through a strategic sale in a time-bound manner, the statement said.


The Jio buzz
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is likely to enter the fray to buy half of promoter Chandra’s stake in ZEEL, according to a Business Standard report based on information from sources. Jio will be pitted against international names such as Amazon, Apple, Tencent, and Alibaba, which have shown interest. Chandra and family along with its advisors met in Mumbai over the Diwali weekend last year and decided to offload up to half of its promoter holding of about 42% in flagship ZEEL as part of a ""strategic review of its businesses in the changing global media landscape"".

The entertainment sector is being revolutionised by convergence and over-the-top (OTT) services and this where Chandra might want to focus in future. In October, ZEEL. became the first Indian entertainment company to take its OTT video service, ZEE5, to over 190 countries.

ZEEL's managing director & CEO Punit Goenka had said the company was looking for global strategic partner to foray into virtual reality, augmented reality, Internet of Things and 3D printing to build a robust platform beyond traditional audio-visual content. The talk of Jio's interest shows that the promoters are now also looking for domestic buyers."
75,2019-01-28,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmark Sensex plunged over 368 points on Monday to close at 35,656 amid across-the-board selling as market sentiment turned volatile ahead of the Union Budget, which is widely believed to have some populist announcements. There was heavy selling pressure on the banking, auto and consumer durables counters. 

Weak global cues in the form of poor industrial output print for China also weighed in on investor sentiment. Nifty tumbled 119 points to end at 10,661. 

Midcaps and smallcaps suffered more than the largecap benchmarks, plunging up to 2 per cent. 


Let’s a look at the key highlights of Monday's session: 


Rs 1.80 lakh crore wiped off
Monday’s mayhem eroded investor wealth by Rs 1.80 lakh crore in a single day. The cumulative market capitalisation of all BSE-listed stocks declined to Rs 1,38,99,677 crore from Rs 1,40,80,491 crore at the end of Friday. 


Zee has a stellar show
With a whopping 16.64 per cent gain, shares of Zee Entertainment closed the day at Rs 372 on BSE. The scrip saw a smart turnaround after the company said it had reached a deal with the lenders on pledged shares and 97 per cent of the lenders have agreed not to revoke shares should the stock fall further. Media reports suggested Reliance Jio has shown interest in buying half of promoter stake in Zee Entertainment. Some global players such as Amazon, Apple, Tencent, Alibaba, AT&T, Singtel, Comcast and Sony Pictures, too, are said to be in the race. 


L&T gains on Q3 show
L&T shares climbed 1.17 per cent to Rs 1,300, buoyed by healthy December quarter numbers that the capital goods major unveiled post market hours on Friday. The company reported Rs 2,042 crore profit for the October-December period over Rs 1,490 crore in Q3 FY18. Many brokerages, including Macquarie, Credit Suisse and Phillip Capital, have expressed faith on the company’s performance. 


More pain for Graphite India, HEG
Shares of HEG closed 20 per cent down at Rs 2,194 and those of Graphite India 9.30 per cent down at Rs 500.85 after having touched 52-week lows at Rs 2,194 and 470, respectively. This was Graphite India’s eighth consecutive fall, while HEG fell for the third straight session. Graphite stocks have been under pressure of late amid concerns related to imports from China and anti-dumping duty. 


Wockhardt cracks 7% on poor Q3 numbers
The pharma firm reported widening of its consolidated net loss to Rs 71.11 crore for December quarter. The company had posted a net loss of Rs 40.76 crore for the corresponding period of the previous financial year. The stock closed 7.04 per cent down at Rs 444. 


Jet shares decline 3%
Extending losses into the second session in a row, shares of Jet Airways (India) closed 3.06 per cent down at Rs 245.40 after the company said it was seeking shareholders’ approval for converting existing debt into shares. In a regulatory filing with NSE, Jet said it would seek consent of shareholders to convert the whole or part of the outstanding loans into shares or convertible instruments or other securities of the company. 


Canara Bank plunges 5%
The public sector lender reported a 152.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) surge in profit for December quarter. Provisions and contingencies fell 26.04 per cent YoY. However, at first glance, the Street appeared dissatisfied with the numbers and the stock plunged 5.23 per cent to close at Rs 240.30 on BSE. 


Banks, financials hit hard
Most bank and financial stocks closed the day with deep cuts. Shares of DHFL (down 11.64 per cent), Indiabulls Ventures (down 9.34 per cent), YES Bank (down 5.46 per cent), ICICI Bank (down 3.82 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (down 3.10 per cent) were among the top laggards. Out of total 10 components of BSE Bankex, only one - City Union Bank (up 0.93 per cent) - closed with gains. In the BSE Finance index, 104 stocks suffered losses and only 13 ended in the green. Both sectoral indices fell up to 2 per cent. 


IT, Teck indices buck the trend
BSE Basic Materials and BSE Healthcare fell 2.09 per cent and 2.08 per cent, respectively, leading the pack of sectoral losers. On the other hand, BSE Teck (up 0.80 per cent) and IT (up 0.42 per cent) indices finished on top despite the selloff, thanks to gains in shares of Zee Entertainment (up 16.64 per cent), Bharti Infratel (up 2.27 per cent), TCS (up 1.71 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 0.97 per cent) and Wipro (up 0.57 per cent).

74,2019-01-28,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Index heavyweights played spoilsport on Dalal Street on Monday, dragging the benchmarks lower by over a per cent lower. This was the second day of fall for the key indices.

Markets shrugged off favourable macro cues in the form of plunging crude oil prices and a strengthening rupee. Other Asian and European peers too slipped ahead of the crucial US-China trade talks and Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

The BSE Sensex shut shop with a loss of 369 points, 1.02 per cent, at 35,657 while the NSE Nifty came off 119 points to settle at 10,661.

Market at a glance:


Who moved the Sensex?
Among Sensex stocks, only seven advanced while 23 slipped. TCS was the top gainer, rising 2 per cent. Coal India, L&T, Power Grid and Asian Paints followed. YES Bank was the top index drag, falling 5.46 per cent. Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Hero MotoCorp and Sun Pharma slipped up to 5.40 per cent.


IL&FS fears still persist
Most of the financial stocks bled on fears of continuing exposure to IL&FS. Even housing finance companies witnessed a similar fate, with Deewan Housing Finance slipping 11.64 per cent. 


Canara profit soared, but stock fell
Canara Bank posted a 152 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 318 crore for the December quarter as against Rs 126 crore reported in the corresponding quarter year ago. However, the stock slipped 5.23 per cent in today's session.


ZEE Entertainment rebounds
The shares of ZEE Entertainment rebounded today after the company said it has reached a deal with lenders on pledged shares. The company said 96-97 per cent of the lenders have agreed not to invoke shares if the shares fall further. After the agreement, the company has not pledged further shares as collateral after Friday’s sharp fall, said CEO Punit Goenka said in an investor call. The stock closed the session 16.64 per cent higher.


Mid, smallcaps have a sob story
Midcaps and smallcaps shed nearly 2 per cent in today's session and underperformed the benchmark Sensex. Midcap index closed 1.84 per cent lower while smallcap index was down 1.99 per cent.


Sectoral view
Basic materials, healthcare and finance each shed over 2 per cent. Only IT and teck managed to close in the green today. 


Factors behind the fall


Weak global markets
Major European bourses fell, mirroring a retreat for Asian stocks as concerns over Chinese growth outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the US government shutdown late last week. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul all losing ground, according to Reuters. 


Crucial US-China trade talk
The crucial US-China trade talks are scheduled to take place later in the week and the investors have assumed cautious positions until any further announcement. 


Financial stocks bleed
Financials and bank stocks plunged the most today as fears of IL&FS default continue to plague market. IB Ventures was the worst drag in the NSE Financials index while all stocks ended in the red in the Nifty private bank index. 


Poor Q3 show
The December quarter earnings failed to impress investors and this acted as one of the major forces behind a dent in investor sentiment. Among key results, HDFC, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv are among top companies expected to report quarterly numbers.

""Market slid below 10,700 mark as uncertainty over global trade negotiation and US Fed policy later this week added volatility. Any progress in US-China trade deal and a dovish view from FOMC meet amid global growth concern may provide respite to the investor’s dilemma. Additionally, weak set of earnings from auto major and selling in banks marked the tone of domestic indices.""

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking
""Domestic benchmarks opened on a negative note with the market breadth in favour of the sellers. A majority of the sector indices were trading in the red while mid-cap and small-cap shares underperformed its larger peer. Market breadth was in the ratio of 1:4 in favor of the sellers and the market ended 1% lower. The rupee appreciated against the dollar as crude prices declined by 1.8 per cent to trade at $60.5 per barrel. The upcoming week will be crucial because of the Budget presentation, US Fed policy meet and the resumption in the US-China trade talks.""

""Global markets sold post comments by the US president that another shutdown is an option if agreement with Democrats is not reached. Indian markets also reacted to this negative cues with all sectoral indices in the red with Nifty Pharma being the biggest loser followed by Bank Nifty. Markets are also worried about the government straying from its fiscal consolidation path in the interim Budget."""
70,2019-01-28,Zee,"Monday blues came back to haunt benchmark stock indices as the Sensex and the Nifty tanked 369 points and 119 points, respectively. 

As many as 36 stocks of the Nifty turned red. Adani Ports plunged over 12.53 per cent, followed by Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 6.51 per cent), Bajaj Finance (down 5.45 per cent), YES Bank (down 5.28 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (down 4.30 per cent).

On the other hand, some buying in Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Larsen & Toubro, TCS and Coal India capped the downside.

Here are key reasons that put pressure on domestic equities on Monday. 


Weak Q3 numbers: Subdued quarterly numbers by select heavyweights dampened sentiment on Monday. Maruti Suzuki on Friday posted its second successive decline in quarterly net profit with a 17.21 per cent fall for the third quarter ended December, also the steepest fall in nearly five years. 

India's largest carmaker said its net profit for Q3 came in at Rs 1,489.3 crore as against Rs 1,799 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.


Financial stocks bleed: ICICI Bank alone shaved off more than 100 points from the Sensex during the late afternoon trade. The scrip was down 4.84 per cent at Rs 339.80 at around 11.45 am. 

India's biggest mortgage lender HDFC, IT major Infosys and largest lender by assets State Bank of India together dragged the Sensex down by more than 100 points. HDFC and Infosys were down 1.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent, respectively, at around the same time. SBI was trading 2.37 per cent down at Rs 278.50. 

The CBI has transferred the investigating officer in the ICICI Bank case as its “discreet inquiry” suggested his role in leaking information related to searches, according to a report by PTI.


FII selling continues: Foreign investors offloaded nearly Rs 5,000 crore so far from the domestic equity markets in January and experts believe this trend will continue in the coming months as well. Prior to that, they had sold shares worth Rs 28,900 crore in October. Their net inflows stood at Rs 5,980.89 crore and Rs 3,143.22 crore in November and December, respectively.


Populist measures: Traders were also concerned with Bloomberg report stating that Indian bonds are pitted against a familiar foe: likely record debt sales by the government to finance populist measures before national elections due by May.


US-China trade talks: Uncertainties over the high-level trade talks between the US and China were another major overhang."

87,2019-01-29,Zee,"Since the valuation gap between midcap and largecap multiples narrow, as it happened in 2018, I do not really 
  

 see a point in venturing into midcaps, Vivek Mavani, Vivek Mavani Financial Services, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is happening in the midcap space? Nifty has not cracked down, there is no problem in the world but the index is down for nine days on the trot now?
We are now seeing the unravelling of a lot of long positions which market participants including the promoters had taken by way of leverage in 2017 and 2018. The theme in the correction this time around is unravelling of leverage both at the investor level as well as the promoter level. 

The liquidity condition is tight as far as NBFCs and the general financial system is concerned. The sentiment is weak because a large number of those midcaps have certainly not kept up with the earnings growth or in terms of delivery of performance in line with the huge expansion of valuation multiples that we have witnessed in the last two-three years. It is a reversion to the mean, in terms of the valuation multiples which are in line with the reset lower rates of growth both from what is being delivered as well as what is expected in future. 


How are you looking at this whole Essel Group issue? What are you telling clients?
As far as the Zee Group is concerned, the largest is Zee Entertainment. From the current price point of view, there is value in the company as also a lot of potential. Promoters do have leverage at the holding company level or at promoter level for some of their other businesses which are not in the public domain from the equity market point of view. But it is very rare for a promoter to come out and write an open letter to all investors as soon as the problem emerged, saying that while there has been some mistakes and they are facing some financial crunch but they are committed to make it all good.


But good intent does not mean that the problem is over!
By no means, the problem is over. The problem will be over when some of their group assets are sold, liquidity realised and the leverage at the group level reduced.


What happens to the stock now?
I would not want to trade on uncertainty except that there has been some assurance by the lenders including the NBFCs that they are not going to be pressing the margin calls and dumping the stock in the market. As long as those repeat episodes do not happen, probably they will stay in a range till the problem gets solved.


Axis Bank results will be out today. Given how bullish a consensus call the Street has on corporate banks right now, are you little worried about what they are going to report today?
 I am not so much worried about what they are going to report today. Going by by at least the level of confidence as far as most PSUs and some of the troubled private banks are concerned, the worst is over as far as the NPA issue is concerned. Now is the time for some of those writebacks of provisions done in the last five years and some by way of recoveries that could happen. 

What I have been hearing and this is a Street rumour that Cobrapost is going to come out with something sensational. Probably some of the market participants could be nervous about if any of the banks are named in that. From the numbers point of view, I am not so much worried about what they will report or the outlook that they are going to give out. This is the first result that the new Axis Bank CEO is going to declare. He will probably lay down the path forward and give us much more clarity in terms of how bad the situation is inside the bank and what are corrective steps going ahead.


How are you playing the divide between midcaps and largecaps?
My preference is for largecaps, namely TCS, Infosys and tech Mahindra in that order. As far as midcaps are concerned, they have had a stellar run by and large through 2018 and today the valuation gap between midcap and largecap IT has narrowed considerably. The growth rates for the midcaps and largecaps do not seem to be much different, The largecaps have been growing in the 15-18% range, barring TCS which has been reporting 23-24% earnings growth in last few quarters. 

Most midcaps also are in that same range but the valuation gap is now much lower. The play on midcaps is only when the valuation gap between midcap valuations and largecap multiples is significant. But when the opportunities narrow, as it happened in 2018, I do not really see a point in venturing into midcaps at this point of time.


Apart from Zee, there was a massive selling in Sterlite Tech amd Max Financials. The view is that every promoter who has leveraged his personal shares to raise capital is going to run into trouble. Do you think that fear is overdone?
As a broad brush generalisation, fear certainly is overdone because not every promoter is in a situation of a financial crunch. Not every company is reporting bad performance so that there could be selloff from even long-term investors based on disappointing performance. Then there is the intent of the promoters. You may doubt a few promoters but you cannot be doubting all of them. If that is the case, then there is no business to be in this markets in the first place. Coming back to the specific examples, Sterlite Technologies from a long term point of view, shows investment merit. The stock has corrected almost 35% from the top and given the growth outlook and the earnings that they have been delivering and are likely to report given their order books and expansion plans, the valuations are reasonable.

About Max Financial, I am not sure because I do not track it closely. So, I will reserve my comments at this point of time. 


What are you recommending from the broader markets?
In terms of high conviction ideas, I will stick with low beta plays both at sectoral level as well as individual stocks. I prefer city gas distribution stocks, namely Mahanagar Gas, Gujarat Gas and the recent listing Adani Gas. 

The second space is an extension of the rural theme plus urban consumption coming back. It is the two-wheeler space. The valuations are fairly compelling. Growth is a question mark in the short term, but medium to long term, I have no issues with valuations in case of Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp.

I am willing to wait it out in that sense so that is the second pocket. For me, the proxy play for the extension of rural theme in terms of tractors is Swaraj Engines and Mahindra Finance which addresses part of rural consumption and tractors. 

I would like to specially mention Sun Pharma. Post all those events, announcements, controversy, etc, and the huge amount of discussion in the last few weeks, the collateral damage in terms of stock price is done with. Unless new negative developments come about, the worst is over from the stock price point of view. I would be a buyer at these levels. A disclaimer is that already on behalf of both for myself and as well as clients, we have positions in all of the stocks mentioned. 


What is your call on OMCs given that there is a higher chance of crude being subdued than staging a rally?
I am actually neutral on OMCs -- neither bullish nor bearish. I do not really see a trade in the OMCs notwithstanding where the crude is going or where the reset for the fuel prices are, because in an election year and maybe for rest of the year immediately post elections, and from the fuel pricing point of view, one is still not sure as to what would be the stand of the government that is number one. And number two is as far as crude price is concerned, although they have been at much lower levels than earlier, one is still not sure. I would just refrain from getting into trade and in any case, there have not been any sharp movements to really find the trade over there.


Friday is the budget day. Do you think something market moving could be announced and is there near term budget trade in that sense?
I do not really see a budget trade per se. Let us accept that I make a big deal out of the budget and get excited but the market has its own mind and the mood and probably 10 days later, it will be forgotten. 

But yes, this being a budget just two-three months before the election. In terms of the minimum income for the poor, although Congress seems to have now got a heads-up, even the current government seems to be mulling something and there could be some announcement over there which could stimulate consumption in the medium term. But beyond that, I do not really see much tinkering in terms of most of the items of the budget whether it is on the taxation side or non-taxation side."

Goenka will be taking over from Nakul Chopra, who completed his one year tenure as chairman of the joint industry body.

It may be recalled that Goenka was the founder chairman of BARC India and played an instrumental role in setting up of the TV Viewership measurement company. It was under his leadership that BARC India established its measurement system.

“It is indeed an honour and a privilege to be re-elected as BARC India Chairman,” Goenka said. “I am honoured to be back as this responsibility has come to me at a time when our industry is undergoing enormous changes... I am hoping that in my tenure, we will be able to take BARC into the next generation of viewership measurement and stay true to its mission of ‘What India Watches'.”

Goenka’s first task will be to roll out the much awaited digital measurement system, Ekam.

“BARC India in the past one year has made enormous strides in the insights and analytics piece...I am glad that I have been a part of this journey. I wish Punit all the best for all the future endeavours,” said Nakul Chopra, the outgoing president.

78,2019-01-29,Zee,"Mumbai: Wealth managers are suggesting that fixed income investors look at schemes with high exposure to AAA-rated paper, liquid and ultra-short term funds and tax-free bonds of PSUs available in the secondary markets.

“Investors are becoming risk-averse after the way events have played out in the past five months,” said Ashish Shanker, head (investment advisory), Motilal Oswal Wealth Management. He advises investors to invest 80 per cent in banking and PSU debt funds with AAA rating and a 20 per cent exposure only to credit risk funds with a three-year time frame.

Shanker recommends Axis Banking and PSU Debt Fund, and IDFC Banking and PSU Debt Fund saying such a portfolio can earn investors a pre-tax return of 8 per cent, and if held for more than three years, they could take advantage of indexation benefit and earn post-tax returns of 7.5 per cent.

For those who do not want any credit risk, tax-free bonds listed in the secondary markets could be a good investment bet. “Investors could get an yield of 6.25-6.35 per cent which works well for those in the highest tax bracket,” said Vikram Dalal, managing director, Synergee Capital. Bonds of NHAI, PFC, REC, Hudco and several other PSUs which are AAA-rated are available in the secondary market.

Wealth managers also say that investors should not act in haste even if one of the schemes they have in their portfolio has an exposure to instruments where the share price of the parent company has fallen, or the parent company’s promoter has pledged a higher holding.

“Do your own math before taking a decision,” said Deepak Chhabria, CEO, Axiom Financial Services.

For instance, if you hold units in a credit risk fund that has a 4 per cent holding in a company whose parent company’s share price has fallen, there is a risk of a rating downgrade which could lead to a write-off. Hypothetically, even if there is a 50 per cent writeoff, the maximum loss on your investment in the scheme is 2 per cent. If you have invested in the scheme less than a year ago, you will have to pay an exit load of 1 per cent.

Added to this, if you are in the high-tax bracket, you will pay short-term capital gains tax. A 30 per cent tax on your gains, plus the exit load, will be higher than the potential loss due to the write-down in the portfolio.

Fixed income investors are a worried lot over the turn of events post the IL&FS crisis since September last year. While some debt fund schemes wrote off their investments in IL&FS after it was downgraded, it did not end there. Last week, some mutual fund schemes marked down 20-25 per cent of their investments in road SPVs of IL&FS after they did not pay interest citing a moratorium by the NCLT N leading to a downgrade by rating agencies.

This was followed by a sharp fall in the price of Zee Entertainment last week, leading to the possibility of a rating downgrade for its various group companies and subsidiaries in which mutual funds hold debt securities."
83,2019-01-29,Zee,"Many investors are concerned about the impact the Essel Group fiasco will have on their mutual fund investments, say mutual fund advisors. Equity mutual fund investors want to know whether the sharp fall in stocks of Essel Group will affect their schemes, while debt mutual fund investors are worried about possible losses if there is a default by these companies, say advisors. 

The Essel Group companies had fallen by 10-33 per cent on Friday as doubts over whether the group would be able to overcome its deep financial difficulties. Essel Group got three months time from lenders and creditors to find a buyer for half the stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises. Lenders also agreed that no default will be declared due to the steep fall in share price of the company.

Mutual fund houses like Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund have individual investments worth more than Rs 1,000 crore in Essel Group companies. Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has the highest exposure of Rs 2,936 crore in the company’s instruments. However, the fund house is confident that the schemes will not be impacted. 

“The price fall happened on Friday, today (Monday) the price has come back. Therefore, the margin calls are also getting sorted out. The NAV dips in debt mutual funds are unlikely. It is just panic in the market. Otherwise, the situation is fine,” says A. Balasubramanian, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. However, Balasubramanian maintained that there is no default. “There is no default. Because there was a price fall on the shares on Friday, people got jittery. But the situation was sorted out when the lenders met the management,” he said.

However, sceptics believe that the issue is far from over. “If there is a situation where the lenders have agreed to give a moratorium, then there is already a default or delay. If it is not immediately recognised, then there is a possibility of NAVs dipping at a future date. Right now we are not clear about how big or if only there will be a default,” says a debt mutual fund manager who does not want to be named. 

Against this backdrop, financial planners and mutual fund advisors believe that investors shouldn’t take any step at the moment. Mutual fund advisors say investors should sit back and let the fund managers do their work. “Investors should wait and not think of shifting or switching. We had IL&FS SPVs and now the Essel Group situation, investors cannot keep switching with every news until it has a big impact,” says Ankur Maheshwari, CEO & Founder, Equiris Wealth Management. On the equity side, Maheshwari believes that volatility is a part of equity investing. “Equity mutual funds will see such situations often where the stock prices of companies fall. There is no need of taking actions on every news,” says Maheshwari.

Mutual fund managers believe that the episode will not be any significant impact on the industry. “I don’t expect an immediate impact on funds and NAVs. The impact, if and when it happens, will depend on the exact terms of loan. Most cases, we might not even see an actual default. It depends on fund to fund, instrument to instrument,” says the debt fund manager. He also adds that “panic at this point is not needed as we may not even face an actual default.”"

80,2019-01-29,Zee,"The effect of a crash in the Zee group companies, including Zee Entertainment and Dish TV shares, was visible in the stocks of companies where promoters have pledged their holdings. Zee Entertainment and Dish TV lost nearly 30 per cent on Friday due to the sale of the pledged promoter shares in Dish TV.

The biggest losers on Monday were the shares of Adani Group companies – Adani Power and Adani Ports and SEZ. Promoter holdings across Adani group companies are pledged. A high debt in the group companies led to panic in the two group company shares, which fell 19 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Shares of Indiabulls group companies – Indiabulls Real Estate and Indiabulls Housing Finance, Reliance ADAG group companies and DHFL reported similar falls. Shares of these companies were down 5 per cent to 12 per cent.



In some cases, the promoters have raised money in the unlisted holding companies through which they hold shares of the listed companies. The underlying collateral is mostly the shares of the listed companies. Any likelihood of the holding company not able to meet its debt obligations may lead to selloff in the counters of the listed companies. For instance, Wadhawan Global Capital, Cyquator and Geetanjali Trading and Investments the holding companies of DHFL, Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints, respectively, have raised money from mutual funds."
79,2019-01-29,Zee,"The stock market fell on Monday as investors — spooked by Essel Group founders’ inability to bring in fresh shares as collateral to make up for the stock price crash last week — turned wary of companies with high promoter share pledges. Sentiment was also jittery ahead of the press meet by Cobrapost, a website known for investigative journalism, on Tuesday. Cobrapost claimed it will reveal “the anatomy of India’s biggest financial scam” and that the scam is of around Rs 33,000 crore.

Sensex ended down 368.84 points, or 1 per cent, at 35,656.70, its lowest level since January 2. Nifty ended down 119 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 10,661.55, its lowest closing since December 11.

The Volatility Index surged 6.6 per cent to 18.9, suggesting traders expect near-term risks to the market. “Monday’s fall was largely related to concern about over-leverage in the system,” said Piyush Garg, CIO at ICICI Securities.

Shares of Adani Group companies came under selling pressure on Monday on worries that the promoters’ share pledge with lenders was high. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone ended as the worst performer on the Nifty index. The stock ended the session with a decline of 12.7 per cent at Rs 327 after falling 20 per cent during the day.

Adani Enterprises ended down 0.7 per cent atRs 136.30 after falling as much as 10 per cent intraday while Adani Power fell as much as 20 per cent intraday before ending down 18.6 per cent at Rs 40.15. Adani Transmission recouped losses to end up 2 per cent, Adani Gas ended 9 per cent lower and Adani Green Energy fell 6.7 per cent.



“Market is catching those stocks where leverage against promoter holding is high,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets & corporate affairs at IIFL. “The fall in Adani Group companies has nothing to do with fundamentals. I expect them to make a comeback as the fundamentals of the companies are strong,” said Bhasin.

Sterlite Technologies, which has 96.7 per cent of promoter holding pledged, ended down 7.8 per cent while Jindal Stainless, another company with high promoter holding pledged, ended down 6.5 per cent. Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power also ended down 5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.

On Friday, Essel Group stocks such as Zee Entertainment and Dish TV plunged between 20 per cent and 30 per cent after a news report alleging links between the Essel Group and Nityank Infrapower, a company being probed by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore after demonetisation. After the initial drop in these shares, the declines steepened on the sale of pledged shares, which market participants believe belonged to the promoter group.

While shares of Zee rose 16.6 per cent and Dish gained 5.5 per cent on Monday after the agreement between Zee promoters and lenders to provide a three-month breather while Zee found a buyer, the market’s attention shifted to other leveraged stocks.

“Zee itself went up because of short covering but stocks with high pledged shares saw selling. While the pledged percentage is high, I don’t believe that the weakness will continue,” said Dharmesh Kant, head of retail research at IndiaNivesh Securities.

Promoters have pledged 45.5 per cent of their 62.3 per cent promoter holding in Adani Ports and pledged 44.4 per cent of their 74.9 per cent holding in Adani Transmission, according to data compiled by ETIG Database. The promoters have pledged 36.7 per cent of their holding in Adani Green Energy and 29 per cent of their holding in Adani Power.

NBFC stocks were also among the big losers in Monday’s trade. Indiabulls Housing Finance fell 6.5 per cent to end the session as the second worst-hit stock on the Nifty. Bajaj Finance’s shares ended down 5.4 per cent ahead of its December quarter result on Tuesday.

Brokers said the focus is expected to shift to the interim Budget on Friday. Market participants will watch out for sharp slippages in fiscal deficit target. The market is expecting a deviation in fiscal deficit target by 20 basis points to 30 basis points beyond the budgeted target of 3.3 per cent for financial year 2018-19.

The RBI policy review is due on February 7. Investors are also waiting for the outcome of the latest policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which is due to conclude on Wednesday."

The opportunity to own the largest broadcaster in a consumer market of 1.3 billion people doesn’t arrive all that often; even more rarely does it come after a single-day 26 per cent rout in the stock.

The special situation has arisen because of Indian infrastructure financier-operator IL&FS Group’s sudden $12.8 billion bankruptcy. Analysts who believed the tremors would reach other shadow-banking entities like Dewan Housing Finance Ltd were half right. Yes, Dewan’s loan disbursements fell 95 per cent from a year earlier in the December quarter amid pressure on the mortgage lender to deleverage. But the shock waves have now spilled beyond finance to reach the glamorous world of television content.

Subhash Chandra, the founder who controls 41 per cent of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, is putting half his shares on the block after making wrong-way leveraged bets in unrelated industries such as infrastructure, a mistake the tycoon acknowledged in an open letter on Friday evening. Although the stake-sale plan has been known for a while, the official explanation so far was that Zee wanted a partner to become a “global media-tech player”. 


Agencies

It’s clear now that the real reason is the debt load of Chandra’s Essel Group. BloombergQuint estimates the burden at Rs 17,000 crore ($2.4 billion) across 87 operating companies as of March 31, 2017. 

The collapse of IL&FS found a mention in Chandra’s mea culpa. The implosion of the highly rated lender raised financing costs for everyone who had borrowed short-term funds to invest in long-term assets such as roads, power stations, waste-management plants, or in the case of drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries’ billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi, apartment complexes and windmills. The collateral for these forays in most instances was shares of their successful, publicly traded operating companies.

But as both Shanghvi and Chandra recently found out, collateral can wear thin very quickly. All it takes is a whistleblower complaint of financial irregularities or a news article insinuating links with a company allegedly dealing in unaccounted-for cash to make the stock price plunge. Strenuous denials or defamation lawsuits can’t quite set things right with creditors left edgy by IL&FS’ defaults, though a weekend meeting with lenders does seem to have bought Chandra time to conclude the sale of his crown jewel.

Zee, where I worked briefly in the 1990s, is a content powerhouse with a 20 per cent share of India’s traditional television viewing market. The network also boasts of 35 per cent Ebitda margins despite heavy investment in Zee5, a fast-growing digital app. There’s no confirmed bidder yet, but according to a report in the Business Standard, Zee may be of interest to Amazon, Apple, Tencent Holdings, AT&T, Singapore Telecommunications, Comcast Corp and Sony Pictures Entertainment.


Agencies

If that weren’t already a long list, Reliance Jio Infocomm, a telecom operator controlled by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, is also likely to join the contest, the article said. If Ambani snags the asset, his triple play of carriage, content and commerce could deal a blow to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’s multibillion-dollar plan to dominate e-tailing in India. 

Demand for digital video in India is exploding as Ambani drives down data prices. With an enterprise value of $4.8 billion, and more cash than debt, Zee has a good chance to take on 21st Century Fox’s local-streaming platform, HotStar, as well as Netflix and Amazon.com’s Prime. 

But a quick deal is critical. Lenders have agreed to a standstill. While that helped the stock recover from Friday’s carnage, lenders’ patience will have a limit. General elections will be held soon; and the opposition Congress party, which has started fancying its chances in the polls, is no fan of Zee Media Corp’s news operations. (Chandra became a member of Parliament with the support of the ruling party in 2016.) 

Media isn’t the only asset in play. The TV mogul has also put a chunk of his road portfolio on the block, though with the beleaguered IL&FS also looking to offload its transport investments, buyers are spoiled for choice. It’ll be easier to deleverage by selling Zee than by disposing of a bunch of highways. If the pressure to come up with liquidity forces Chandra to cede control of his TV empire, then the new owner will have the deadbeat infrastructure financier IL&FS to thank."

93,2019-01-30,Zee,"Last week’s doomsday dash at the Subhash Chandra-controlled Essel Group has put the spotlight on the financial health of the promoters — quite distinct from that of the companies they run.

So far, shareholders, investors and lenders assumed — many a times for convenience — that a company in the pink of health also reflected the strength of the promoters. But after a single-day plunge in the shares of Zee Entertainment and Dish TV brought the group, promoters and investors — mainly mutual funds — to the edge of the cliff, the happy bubble in which all of them existed has been pierced. At least, Monday’s plunge in the share prices of groups where promoters are neck-deep in debt gives the impression that the party is over for now.

At the heart of the problem are the huge loans promoters have taken by pledging a large portion of their shareholdings. Until now, the share pledge of promoters has been just another data point that corporates had to disclose to stock exchanges. Fund managers, investors and analysts paid little attention to the extent of share pledges by promoter groups. Debt mutual funds and NBFCs lent liberally to privately-held structures, which housed shares of company owners and were rated by credit rating agencies. The ratings for these entities are mostly based on the collateral provided.

Like in the case of Zee, many promoters used the borrowed money to fund their other business interests. Some used the proceeds to buy assets abroad, while others ploughed them back into stock market or for dividend stripping. What backfired for Zee was that the infrastructure business did not yield the cash flow it was expecting while promoters had pledged their holdings to the maximum.

So, when the shares crashed and lenders — mutual funds and NBFCs — asked for more money or shares to make up for the lower value of the collateral (shares), promoters were not able to cough up the money. They also managed to roll over the loans until lenders became finicky before the defaults by IL&FS.

Before the fall in the Zee shares on Friday, its market capitalisation was almost Rs 42,000 crore. Lenders gave promoters money partly keeping in mind the market value of the company. So, it was important for the promoters to ensure that the share price was mostly higher.

Zee is a prominent example of what can go wrong to the numerous companies whose promoters have pledged most of their holdings. The point here is whether the promoters are cash-strapped. There are instances where companies with good assets and business do not get the valuation they deserve because of questionable practices by promoters. Unlike in developed markets, minority shareholders — like institutions — in India are too meek to push changes in such companies.

It’s not that promoters are not conscious about share pledging and the impression it has on the market. In various instances, the share pledge data disclosed by companies to stock exchanges do not necessarily reflect the accurate picture. This is because promoters borrow through various structures with shares as collateral.

For instance, a structure where promoters ‘submit’ their shares to lenders through a Power of Attorney is popular. Although companies are required to disclose this to the stock exchanges, very few do it, thereby understating the extent of promoter share pledges .

Cash-flush mutual funds and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) — dominant lenders to promoter groups — have mostly escaped unscathed so far because promoters have mostly managed to top up lenders’ calls for additional margins in the event of share price declines. The risks of lending are much higher for mutual funds than NBFCs because these asset managers channel unit holders’ money to the borrowers. If unit holders decide to pull their money out of a scheme, which has invested in papers such as Essel Group’s, fund houses are left with no option but to ask for their money back, failing which the pledged shares are offloaded in the market.

It’s time mutual funds ruthlessly cut their exposure to promoter entities that have borrowed predominantly with shares as collateral, although it is easier said than done. Investors in debt mutual funds and wealth advisors have become choosy about where to invest after the recent losses in some of these schemes. Lenders have managed to buy time in the case of Zee but they might not be this lucky all the time."

99,2019-01-30,Zee,"If investors on Dalal Street are jittery about share pledges, they have good reasons to be so. India Inc promoters had shares worth Rs 2.50 lakh crore pledged with their lenders at the end of December quarter.

That works out to about 2 per cent of total market capitalisation of BSE500 stocks at current market prices and was higher from Rs 2.40 lakh crore worth of share pledges recorded as of December 31, 2017.

Among Nifty50 companies, promoters of Zee Entertainment had pledged 59.40 per cent of their holdings as of December 2018. It was followed by Adani Ports (45.50 per cent), JSW Steel (43.60 per cent), IndusInd Bank (26.40 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (12.70 per cent) and Asian Paints (11.90 per cent). 



Zee Entertainment, JSW Steel, Sun Pharmaceutical and YES Bank saw promoters increase share pledge levels between September and December quarters.

Zee Entertainment last week hogged limelight after lenders sold some of the pledged shares. 

An elevated level of shares pledging is not considered good as a downturn in market can lead to invocation of such shares, leading to oversupply and severe correction in stock prices, while in extreme cases, it can even trigger a change in a company’s shareholding pattern.

Promoters of 50 BSE500 companies had pledged over 25 per cent of their holdings by the end of December quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed. At the top, promoters of CG Power & Industrial Solutions had pledged 100 per cent of their holdings, whereas those of Sterlite Technologies and Gayatri Projects had pledged over 90 per cent of holdings. 

For a lay investor, share pledging does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is in financial distress. Banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoters’ shares to advance loans.

Among other companies, whose promoters have pledged more than 80 per cent of holdings with their lenders were Jindal Stainless (Hisar), Jindal Stainless, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Power, GMR Infrastructure, Dish TV India and Max Financial Services. 

In the case of Coffee Day Enterprises, Suzlon Energy, Max India, Apollo Hospitals, Reliance Capital and Bajaj Consumer, promoters have pledged between 70-80 per cent of their holdings. 

In a bull market, share pledging may not be that important a factor for investors to consider. But when market sentiment turns risk off, it does. A high level of share pledging is undesirable and may signal a situation of distress. A decline in the level of share pledging may suggests a drop in stress. 

Among BSE500 companies, Eveready Industries, Indiabulls Real Estate, Coffee Day Enterprises, Jain Irrigation, Infibeam Avenues, and Jindal Steel and Power saw promoters increase share pledge levels by 13-45 percentage points in Q3 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.



The extent of pledging is definitely a matter of concern for an investor. Pledging in a capital-intensive company is highly risky. Promoters generally pledge for a mix of both for their personal needs as well as for reinvestment in their businesses. Pledging should always be a matter for concern. In a bull market, no one sees the level of pledging. Technically, promoters only know everything about their companies. Investors should always be wary of promoters’ share pledge levels. Temporary pledging of 10 per cent or so or for the first time is okay, but if it is a habit to pledge shares quarter after quarter, then that is definitely a warning sign, says Hitesh Agrawal, Head of Retail Research, Religare Securities.

Companies like Fortis Healthcare, Suzlon Energy and Advanced Enzyme saw a drop of over 10 percentage points in promoters’ share pledge levels during December quarter.

 “Generally, share pledging cannot be taken as a good sign. Promoters pledge shares either for their personal use or for the company’s needs. So, the objective of pledging is crucial,” said Sanjeev Jain, AVP, Ashika Stock Broking.

In some cases, banks normally ask promoters to pledge their shares as margin in case they are doubtful about the health of their businesses. “Investors need to watch the size and period of holding of such share pledges. Pledging in large volume is not a good sign. In a bad market, lenders may sell the pledged shares if the promoter does not meet the margin shortfall, which may mount pressure on stock price,” Jain said."

107,2019-01-31,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: The Vshaped recovery in the Zee Entertainment stock since last week’s precipitous plunge puts the spotlight on the most precious asset in value investing: Patience.

For investors in India’s largest listed media company, the need to stay put was never so vitally important than at present. The key is to assess the recent rollercoaster ride in its correct context. The fundamentals that drive the operations at Zee are intact. Zee has a viewership market share of 23 per cent in India and a dominant position in regional channels. The earnings trajectory remains strong, with 15-16 per cent growth in Earnings per Share (EPS) anticipated in the two years ending FY20.

An attractive aspect of Zee’s operations is the inherent strength of its business. This is one of the key reasons many analysts continue to be bullish on Zee. Also, after increasing its investments in the Over The Top (OTT) platform Zee5, the company has guided that it is likely to sustain 30 per cent operating profit margins.



Media & Entertainment analyst Rohit Dokania of IDFC Securities in his report on the company notes, “We believe Zee’s fundamentals remain strong and unaffected from group level concerns. We continue to believe that some strategic partner will find Zee a unique asset given its high market share in such a competitive TV broadcast market.

Moreover, such opportunities come rarely. As of now we do not think that the group level concerns will have any impact on the day-to-day functioning of Zee and hence we maintain our earnings estimates and ‘outperformer’ rating on the stock.”

Furthermore, among all the Essel Group companies, Zee Entertainment is the most valuable asset from an acquirer’s standpoint. Unlike other Essel Group companies, Zee has the highest revenue, cash flow from operations, the lowest debt in its capital structure, and most importantly, strong brand equity.

Third, the company is trading at an attractive valuation relative to both global and local peers. According to Bloomberg, currently, Zee is trading at an EV/EBIDTA that is 37 per cent cheaper than the multiples for global media and entertainment companies and about half of what the Indian peers command.

If this discount widens in the coming months, then the company’s stock would become even more attractive.

To be sure, volatility would persist in the short term after Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra said that he is likely to find in the next three months a buyer for half of his stake in Zee. But given Zee’s pivotal role in the overall operations of the Essel Group, investors stand a good chance of stellar rewards for their patience."

106,2019-01-31,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: The Essel Group, led by Subhash Chandra, has embarked upon an ambitious plan of monetising its non-media businesses to deal with the current concerns over repayment to its lenders. According to sources close to the management, in the next six months, the company plans to monetise about Rs 20,000 crore by selling its infrastructure assets.

To be sure, industry experts and analysts aren’t as optimistic as the management about the pace of asset sale. They believe that given the quality of assets and their operations, the group may find it easier to sell its stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises than the infra-related assets.

At the group level, Essel has total debt of Rs 17,174 crore. Out of this, Rs 11,466 crore is the infrarelated debt, which is a major concern and this can further rise in the next one year. This infra-related debt covers three major verticals – power transmission, solar and roads (toll and annuity). Among these three verticals, the roads are expected to generate the highest revenue of Rs1,700 crore annually from FY20.

“Part of the debt is for the underconstruction projects that are expected to become operational only from FY20,” said a source. ""By the time these projects are over, the total infra debt will increase by around 20 per cent to Rs 14,000 crore.""

The power transmission and solar verticals are expected to generate revenues of Rs 750 crore and Rs 730 crore, respectively, from FY20. Typically, these businesses generate nearly 90 per cent EBIDTA, depending on the accounting method.

On asset sales, the group has already entered into an agreement to sell its power transmission assets to Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus (EIYP) fund-backed Sekura Energy for Rs 6,000 crore. It also expects to sell its solar business for Rs 2,200 crore. In the road portfolio, the group has 14 road projects spread across Madhya Pradesh, Maharasthra, Gujarat and a few other states. The group plans to generate about Rs 11,000 -Rs 12,000 crore through the sale of road assets. In all, these assets would fetch around Rs 20,000 crore.

The company will use this amount to reduce its infrastructure-related debt and the remaining would be utilised to reduce the pledged portion of the promoter shares in Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The promoters had pledged their 59 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment to raise money that served as equity funding in their infrastructure-related businesses. The pledged shares on Wednesday’s closing price of Zee Entertainment can be valued at Rs 9,300 crore."

Vedanta
Shares of mining giant Vedanta on Friday tanked 18 per cent after the company reported a 25.54 per cent decline in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.

Most of the brokerages also turned bearish on Vedanta following company’s move to buy Volcan Investments’ stake in Anglo American via subsidiary Cairn India Holdings. Commenting on the development, Sameer Kalra of Target Investing said, “We believe this is negative for Vedanta as the company transfers Rs 1,431 crore cash to group company given that it has net debt level of Rs 19,000 crore even after accounting cash and investment balance of Hindustan Zinc which is Rs 23,333 crore is not usable by the company.” 


DHFL

7,2019-02-03,Zee,"Essel Group said Sunday that it has sealed a formal agreement with its lenders to keep it afloat, under which it gets time till September to deleverage or pare its debt.

The agreement is with those lenders who have taken pledged shares of the group flagship and listed entities, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Dish TV India.

On January 27, the group had confirmed that an understanding with the lenders had been achieved, which was finalised Sunday.

The agreement was not to declare the company a defaulter as it had admitted that it could service the debt only up to December.

""As per the consent, the lenders have agreed that there will not be any event of default declared till September 30, 2019, due to the movement in the stock price of Essel Group's mentioned listed corporate entities,"" the company said in a late evening statement.

""This consent provides the required amount of time for the management to complete the strategic sale process of its key assets without any compromise on the value,"" the statement added.

The management led by promoter Subhash Chandra reassured the lenders that within the time frame a complete resolution will be achieved, leveraging the stake sale process, the company said.

The lenders have showed full co-operation and have agreed to support the management as a team, the statement claimed.

The group of lenders, including banks, mutual funds and non-banking financiers agreed to support the management, it said.

""I am glad that a formal consent with the lenders has been achieved today which seals and justifies their belief and trust in us and the intrinsic value of our assets.

""As one team, we are now positively focused on completing the strategic sale process, with the esteemed support of our lenders. We thank them for their trust, patience and above all for their complete co-operation extended, enabling us to take the next steps towards resolution,"" Chandra was quoted as saying in the statement.

The company, which has high debt, defaulted on some of the payments, which led to the share pledge.

Chandra had on January 25 issued an apology to lenders through a public statement, stating that the company intended to pay back all of its debt, which came on a day when the group shares were puntered on the market plunging between 17 and 30 percent.

He had admitted that his company was in a financial mess, and blamed it on aggressive bets on infra, which has gone out of control since the IL&FS crisis, and acquisition of Videocon's D2H business.

Apologising to lenders, he also alleged that some negative forces were out to sabotage his efforts to raise money through a strategic sale in the flagship company Zee Entertainment Enterprises."
13,2019-02-04,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) clarified on Monday that the promoters’ agreement with the lenders remains unchanged and that there was no need to take permission from the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for this.

ZEE also said that the company has not received any communication from SEBI or from any Mutual Fund Company, pertaining to a decision taken with regards to the moratorium.

The company emphasised that the arrangement agreed with the lenders does not change. “As communicated on February 3, the lenders have agreed that there will not be any event of default declared, due to the movement in the stock price of Essel Group’s listed corporate entities, giving Essel Group the required level of time to complete the strategic sale process of its key assets without any compromise on the value,” the company said.

Board meetings"
9,2019-02-04,Zee,"Zee Entertainment Enterprises chief executive Punit Goenka expects the company’s stake sale to happen sooner than the April deadline it has set for itself. Suitors for the stake are predominantly US players, Goenka tells ET, as he discusses the stake sale process, dealing with a bear cartel and the Essel Group’s deleveraging efforts. Edited excerpts:


Has the Essel Group controversy affected ZEE’s stake sale and what stage is it at?
The strategic sale process is going well. I'm actively in dialogue with all of them (prospective investors) and I'm pretty confident this thing will happen even sooner than the April deadline, at least in terms of the agreements, etc. I have spoken to all of them so the fear that something would have spooked them is unfounded; they understand that the intrinsic value of the asset is very much intact. There is not even an iota of doubt. The two issues (stake sale and developments at Essel Group) are very, very different. From that perspective, they are keen to pursue with the process, and I'm very confident we will get this thing done in the stipulated time.


Who are you in serious talks with?
It is difficult for me to give you names because I'm also bound by confidentiality but they are within the set of names coming up in speculation (names doing the rounds include Sony Pictures and Comcast). Largely, they are global players, predominantly based out of the US. At the forefront are the US companies and let's leave it at that.


Any Indian company in the fray — RIL?
As a publicly listed company, the process is open so anybody can ask for data, details, etc. But no banker has confirmed to me yet that anybody from India has started actively participating in the process. We don't even have an non-disclosure agreement signed with any domestic investor.


Are valuations are being discussed?
Yes, absolutely. But please allow the process to happen. It will not be fair for me to give a range in public today.


Won’t the current situation inhibit your chances of getting a premium in the sale?
I think definitely any prospective buyer will want to look at the situation, and use that as another tool for negotiation. I am still confident that while we may not have the luxury of all the time we wanted, the asset is what the asset is. I'm not selling anything other than assets’ underlying value. We know what our walkaway kind of things are. We are very clear we should be able to derive the right value for the company — maybe not the most premium, but at least the right value.


Will the lenders be willing to extend the window for asset sale?The lenders have agreed that there will not be any event of default declared till September 30 due to the movement in the stock price of Essel Group’s listed corporate entities. This consent provides the required amount of time for the group’s management, to complete the strategic sale process of its key assets without any compromise on the value. We have asked them that putting undue pressure on the company, you are only asking me to then sell it cheap and that's not beneficial to either the lenders or to us. I think they should allow us to run the process and I'm pretty confident they see the value.

Any risk of creating more pledges?
No, we have categorically said no more pledges. Where we are is a standstill and we want to work with that. I'm hearing rumours every day and if I believe in them, by now everybody should have sold and gone. We had an agreement with practically all the lenders, but any situation where price corrects overnight, you will have people thinking of how to exit. We are holding unity; let's see how the coming weeks go.

Have you got a fix on what really happened on January 25?
It was the bear cartel. It was... instigated. I think somebody used that opportunity to play the market and the bears kicked in. We have been complaining to stock exchanges for over the last six months. I don't know if they are doing anything or not, but we truly believe these are not real market conditions, these are created conditions. If you track last five years’ data on ZEE’s open position and it becomes 4x in the last six months, something is wrong. The fundamentals of the businesses are right and for something like this to happen within 10 days of my delivering a stellar result, tells me there’s something fishy here.


Who were the ‘negative forces’ mentioned in chairman Subhash Chandra’s open letter?
We will never come to know. These things don’t happen in the open. I'm not pointing at anybody; I am saying bear cartels are bear cartels. Let’s leave it at that. It's the regulator's job to get into details and figure it out.


What about Essel deleveraging efforts?The stake sale in infra assets is one critical piece. Now Zee also becomes a critical piece as we want to run both parallel to ensure this deleveraging happens as soon as possible. This has to happen in the next six months.


Is there any remote chance of your family ceding control of Zee Entertainment?I have always maintained in jest that if somebody makes me an offer, I can’t refuse. But that’s a hypothetical situation. Let me put it another way. I think today, to run this company, expertise and experience are required; no new entrant into the country can get it overnight. I am confident about what we bring as management to the table. If some partner doesn't value that, I wish them all the best, but I would hate to see a new guy coming to this country and run a great company to the ground. I've not heard from anybody so far that they want control.


There have been reports of Essel’s alleged links with Nityank (being probed for suspicious post demonetisation deposits)...As per our official statement of January 25, we have clarified that Nityank Infrapower & Multiventures is an independent company and does not belong to Essel Group."
8,2019-02-04,Zee,"French packaging group Albéa and US private equity fund Blackstone Group are in advanced negotiations to take a controlling stake in Essel Propack (EPL), India’s largest specialty packaging company, according to three people aware of the development. Amid consolidation in the packaging industry, the parent group is looking to sell assets in order to reduce debt.

Besides the two contenders cited above, Indorama and private equity fund Carlyle have also submitted nonbinding bids but the discussions with Albéa and Blackstone are believed to be progressing, said one of the persons cited above.

Albéa, a global leader in beauty, personal care, oral care, pharmaceutical and food packaging, is owned by French private equity fund PAI Partners. Due diligence is being conducted before binding bids are submitted. Morgan Stanley is advising the EPL promoters.



ET in its August 9 edition was the first to report the company is up for sale. Led by Ashok Goel, the promoters own 57.19 per cent of the company. 

EPL had a market value of Rs 3,381 crore at the Friday close. Buying out the promoters will trigger an open offer for an additional 26 per cent of the company.

EPL, part of the Subhash Chandra-led Essel (Zee) Group, manufactures laminated plastic tubes, extruded laminated plastic tubes, caps and flexible laminates used in packaging of oral care products, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. EPL sells more than 7 billion tubes to over 400 clients globally from 19 global facilities.

“We wish to mention that the company has never commented on transactions by its shareholder(s), and in the absence of verified data available with it considers that such information is speculative,” said Essel Propack chairman and managing director Ashok Goel. “As a policy, the company does not respond to market rumors and speculative news reporting.” He added that the company continues to evaluate various strategic alternatives aimed at enhancing long-term shareholder value, including collaborations.

Carlyle, Blackstone and PAI Partners declined to comment. Albéa, Indorama and Morgan Stanley didn’t respond to queries. Albéa has 38 manufacturing sites globally. Besides India, it has a presence in China and Indonesia. It manufactures tubes and rigid packaging at its Goa and Baddi plants.

Major customers in India include Dabur, Patanjali (oral care); Godrej, Emami, Vicco, Marico (skincare), Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and Piramal (pharmaceuticals), Lakme, Colorbar, Oriflame, Avon, L’Oreal (beauty and cosmetics).


OFFLOADING STAKES
The succession issue is also a trigger for Goel to explore divesting his flagship business, according to people aware of the matter. In the past, he has held informal discussions with PE groups but nothing has fructified so far. In 2015, Essel Propack sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Packaging India (PIPL), valued at Rs 165 crore, to Amcor Flexibles India.

The debt-ridden Essel Group is in the process of selling various assets, including parts of its road and solar portfolio. Subhash Chandra is also looking for a buyer for half his stake in flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

At the group level, Essel has total debt of Rs 17,174 crore. Of this, the infrastructure business accounts for Rs 11,466 crore across three major verticals – power transmission, solar and roads (toll and annuity).

In one of the recent transactions in packaging space, promoters and a PE investor in Manjushree Technopack — India’s largest rigid plastic packaging solution provider— offloaded a majority stake to US PE fund Advent International, valuing the company at Rs 2,300 crore."
11,2019-02-04,Zee,"MUMBAI: Rating company CARE Sunday reduced by a notch the creditworthiness of about Rs 1.2 lakh crore of outstanding securities at home financier Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL), pointing to higher funding costs for para banks that have been buffeted by a series of defaults at infrastructure financier IL&FS.

Bonds, deposits and loans raised by DHFL from banks, mutual funds, insurers and superannuation funds faced the downgrade, with CARE citing DHFL’s shrinking share value and expanding borrowing costs to justify its rating action.

“The revision in the long-term ratings takes into account moderation in financial flexibility of DHFL as evidenced by the sharp reduction in its share price and significant rise in bond spreads,” CARE said in statement late on Sunday.

“While stock prices and credit spreads were negatively affected for NBFCs and HFCs after September 2018, recent media news related to DHFL has further affected market sentiment.”

For instance, CARE revised the rating grade of triple-A to AA+ for nonconvertible debentures and longterm bank loans. Commercial papers, short-term debt securities rated as A1+ have been put under credit watch.

Records showed that 25 mutual fund houses collectively hold DHFL paper worth Rs 8,650 crore as of December 2018. The top holders of the debt securities include UTI MF and Reliance MF.

On an average NBFC funding costs have surged about 150-200 basis points, dealers said. For DHFL bonds, it would be in double digits.“DHFL’s ability to raise resources at competitive rates would be crucial for its profitability and long-term growth prospects going forward,” CARE said.

A news-portal recently charged DHFL with financial mismanagement that allegedly benefitted its promoters, allegations that have been strongly denied by the DHFL management.

Brokerage Credit Suisse said in a report published before the rating action that DHFL is a large borrower from mutual funds, and the aggregate exposure of debt mutual funds to the home financier's securities is Rs 8,500 crore, which amounts to about 0.7% of debt mutual funds' assets under management as of December 2018.

It also said the exposure of some fund houses is larger, at 2-10% of total debt AUM, with some schemes having up to 30% of their AUM invested in DHFL.

The exposure of banks is about Rs 40,000 crore, the Credit Suisse report said. DHFL’s stock has plunged from a high of Rs 691on September 3, 2018, to Rs 110.8 on February 1.

The company has honoured all its debt obligations, to be sure. “DHFL has paid each and every rupee that came up for repayment to date, without any delay,” said a fund manager at a domestic fund house.

“A downgrade of one notch would mean a markdown in the securities in the portfolio by a maximum of 1-1.5%,” said the CEO of one fund house.


CARE cuts DHFL rating
This in turn means the net asset value (NAV) of a scheme that holds a stake as high as 5% in the portfolio could fall by less than 1%. DHFL has recently taken a series of measures to ease liquidity. Private equity firm Blackstone last week bought Aadhar Housing Finance, the affordable housing arm of Wadhawan Global, for about Rs 2,700 crore. It also raised Rs 1,375 crore by selling a portfolio of loans to Oaktree Capital Management.

Of late, a series of events have hit debt schemes in the domestic mutual fund industry. Late January, some mutual fund schemes marked down 20-25% of their investments in road SPVs of IL&FS after they did not pay interest citing a judicial moratorium, leading to rating downgrades. This was followed by a sharp fall in the price of Zee Entertainment shares last week, leading to the possibility of a rating downgrade for its various group companies and subsidiaries in which mutual funds hold debt securities.

Since September, infrastructure financier IL&FS has defaulted on repayments toward bonds and deposits, triggering a crisis among para banks.

“NBFC borrowing costs have already gone up as investors already factored in risk elements. The rating downgrade has come at a later stage relatively,” said Ajay Manglunia, executive vice president at Edelweiss Financial Services. “For mutual funds, the impact may not be any more debilitating as the event was nothing unexpected.”"

26,2019-02-06,Zee,"MUMBAI: Mutual funds have approached the Securities and Exchange Board of India to allow them to alter the terms of Essel Group debenture trust deeds to give the promoters time to bring in a strategic investor instead of having to offload pledged shares as there is a drop in the security cover, said people aware of the matter. The capital market regulator will seek to determine whether the mutual funds are acting in the best interests of the investors while deciding on the matter, they said.

The Subhash Chandra-led group had reached a formal pact with lenders, including MFs and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), to this effect after shares of Zee Entertainment and Dish TV plunged 26% and 33%, respectively, in a single day on January 25. Essel Group had sought time until September end.

That had sparked panic about forced selling by lenders as promoters were unable to provide fresh shares to cover the shortfall in collateral.

Lenders, including mutual funds and NBFCs, had agreed in principle to hold off from selling shares of the companies in the event of a further drop in prices. The promoters have pledged almost 60% of their 42% stake in Zee Entertainment.
The debenture trust deed specifies the equity cover that promoters have to maintain but several market participants questioned the legal sanctity of such an arrangement.

The cover ranges from 1.5 to two times the debt and had fallen below the threshold after stock prices fell.

Fund houses have already sought legal opinion on whether the arrangement with the Essel Group is in line with mutual fund regulations.

“There is a provision that the majority of debenture holders can come together and change the debenture trust deed. We have informally approached Sebi proposing to change the terms and conditions on extending time when there is a drop in security cover. We will also be taking trustee approval for the same,” said a senior executive at a large fund house. “It is the prerogative of the fund manager to take the best call on investment. In the larger interest of investors, mutual funds feel this arrangement is appropriate for the current situation.”


Essel Group said it wasn’t aware of the move. “We are in constant touch with all the mutual fund lenders who have supported us and no such thing has been brought to our knowledge,” a spokesperson said.

Sebi didn’t respond to queries. Some fund houses may not have to alter their debenture trust deeds, they can choose not to call a default, said a lawyer advising a top fund house.

“All mutual funds retain a right to not call an event of default if it will jeopardise (investors)… That clause is there in the debenture trust deed, they are just exercising it,” said the lawyer.

Mutual funds had a total exposure of around Rs 8,000 crore to Essel Group nonconvertible debentures, against which shares have been pledged as collateral, at the end of December.

Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has the largest exposure to Essel Group companies, followed by HDFC Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund."

Zee Entertainment Enterprises had announced in November last year that its promoters, led by Subhash Chandra, planned to sell up to 50 per cent of their equity stake in the company to a strategic partner.

""Our intent has not changed...but if somebody is making an offer (to buy) beyond the 50 per cent stake we will look at it,"" ZEEL MD and CEO Punit Goenka said in an analysts' call.

He was responding to a query on whether the promoters would be looking to sell a higher stake considering their holding has went down to 39.08 per cent following sale of 24.38 million pledged shares.

As on December 31, 2018, promoters held 41.62 per cent stake in ZEEL.

Goenka, however, said, as part of the talks with the potential investors, the promoters had earlier indicated willingness to sell around 20 per cent of their holding.

Responding to another query on the number of potential buyers, Goenka said the figure of ""at least two or more players"" which he had put out in an earlier call with analysts ""still holds"".

Earlier this week, Essel group had sealed a formal agreement with its lenders to keep its companies afloat, under which it gets time till September to deleverage or pare its debt. Rs 13,500 is the loan against shares of all the listed companies of the promoters

Goenka said the group is working on multiple strategies; as and when which fructifies first, all of that equity realisation will go towards payment of this facility of Rs 13,500 crore.

While he did not give an exact timeline for concluding stake sale by the promoters, Goenka said, the company has set a March–April deadline for the sale.

Essel group's promoter entities sold shares worth over Rs 1,050 crore in six listed group firms in open market between January 25 and February 1, 2019, for paying off lenders who were not part of an agreement to prevent declaration of default on loans against pledged shares.

According to multiple regulatory filings by different promoter group entities of Essel group, shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Dish TV, Zee Media Corporation, Siti Networks Ltd and Zee Learn were sold in open market.

Sources said the promoters sold the shares in order to pay off lenders who were not part of the pact announced on January 27, under which 97 per cent of the group's lenders agreed not to classify loans against pledged shares as ""default"".

On January 25, Essel group companies had come under massive selling pressure, plummeting up to 33 per cent, and suffered a combined erosion of Rs 13,352 crore in market valuation.

On January 26, Essel group Chairman Chandra said his company is in a financial mess and has blamed the same for the aggressive bets on infra, which has gone out of control since the IL&FS crisis and also the acquisition of Videocon's D2H business.

Apologising to lenders, Chandra also said some negative forces are out to sabotage his efforts to raise money through a strategic sale in the flagship company Zee Entertainment Enterprises."

38,2019-02-06,Zee,"NEW DELHI: A 30-50 per cent drop in stock value over time is worrisome, but if that happens in a single day, it is insane.

Such flash crash in stocks has not spared even Nifty firms. While companies have promptly come up with clarifications to ease investor fears and address rumours, analysts say usually there is no smoke without fire in stock market.

Most of the stocks that have come under pressure either have high levels of debt, share pledges or have seen deterioration in fundamentals, which have made the market believe in what companies claim are ‘rumours’. 

While it is not easy to quickly verify the authenticity of allegations of financial irregularities, market veterans urge small investors to pick signs of weakness in a company’s fundamentals in early stages and choose stocks wisely. 

“If you understand what you own and have clarity on the rationale for owning it, then there may be no need to get perturbed by a fall in stock price. But if you have bought it on a tip, then your chances are as good (worse off, actually) than the probability in a coin toss,” says Amar Ambani, President & Head of Research, YES Securities.


Season of crashes at peak
DHFL was in the news last week after Cobrapost claimed a Rs 31,000 crore financial scam by promoters. The scrip has lost 43 per cent of its market value in eight sessions till Wednesday.

The promoters have denied any wrongdoing and assured the market that the liquidity situation at the firm remains manageable.

Vedanta saw its worst fall in eight years after subsidiary Cairn India Holdings bought a stake of Rs 1,431 crore in Anglo American from Volcan Investments, which is a family trust of promoter Anil Agarwal, raising corporate governance issue. Moody’s has cut the outlook for the company to ‘negative’, saying the related-party investment was credit negative as the move amounted to helping finance the promoter’s investing options. 

Essel group stocks were in the news over alleged transactions with Nityank Infrapower, a firm being investigated for suspicious deposits after the demonetisation drive in November 2016. The group has denied these allegations. That said, the sharp drop in shares made Zee Chairman Chandra acknowledge that buying D2H from Videocon was a wrong investment decision. He also admitted to making some incorrect bids in the infrastructure space.

The group has reached a formal pact with its lenders, including mutual funds and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), not to sell pledged shares of Zee Entertainment and Dish TV till September. By this time, the group expects to monetise non-media assets and pare debt.

The Zee stock plunged 27 per cent on January 25. Dish TV shares fell 33 per cent. The two scrips are down 41 per cent in last one month. 

Sun Pharma was in the news over the company’s alleged relationship with a promoter-linked real estate firm— Suraksha Realty. In the last week of January, the company said it received two queries from Sebi, but refused to disclose if those were related to the regulator’s investigation over the whistle-blower letter. The scrip has lost one-third of its market value in three months.

RCom shares plunged 48 per cent on Monday after the company said it will file for bankruptcy protection.


What should investors do?
Ambani said the one key lesson he learnt in the market is that when there is relentless fall in a stock, there is usually something wrong.

It is said in market parlance, ""Bhav bhagwan che"" (price is god).

Before investing in stocks, one needs to do some due diligence and not simply rely on tips, media talk and expert recommendations on TV, said Deepak Jasani, Head for Retail Research at HDFC Securities:

Once a stock sees a sharp drop, investors have two choices: They can exit at the first instance of a large negative close or wait for some stability and rebound in the share price to exit.

“Although company managements will keep denying rumours, in most cases, either the stock will face the music for promoters’s ill deeds of the past or relatively honest managements will unfortunately face further downturn due to deteriorating fundamentals caused by a big drop in stock price,” Jasani said.

He says investors should not get impressed by the stature of a businessman or a company. “For investors, who have no time or inclination to track individual stocks, relying on a trusted broker – who has enough track record in good and bad times – along with maintaining stop losses is recommended. In case, one is not able to do this, equity investing through the mutual fund route is the best choice, as the risk through mutual funds is spread among several stocks and the fund managers are expected to unbiasedly review their portfolios at regular intervals,” he said.

Ambani said investors must cultivate a habit to know what they own and why they own it. “Buy what you understand and don't buy if you don’t. There are a hundred potential ideas. A growing company with a clean management is the starting point. Unless you are thorough in your study, always have a margin of safety; i.e. don't buy at expensive valuations which leave no scope for mistakes,” he said.


Sebi orders check on intra-day volatility 
Market regulator Sebi on Tuesday asked stock exchanges to step up surveillance on intra-day trading in the wake of significant volatility in a few stocks. 

A troubled airline, a media conglomerate facing liquidity crunch, a finance company under lens for alleged payment defaults, a pharma major being probed for insider trading and other violations as also a mining-to-infrastructure major are currently under the scanner of BSE and NSE.


What extra can the regulator do?
Kotak Securities does not believe promoters alone can be held responsible for financial impropriety when a purportedly independent board of directors oversees the conduct of the management.

The market regulator, Kotak said, could be compelled to implement stricter standards for directors of companies entrusted with financial propriety.

Besides, the brokerage found prevailing disclosures norms on promoter holdings to be inadequate, as most Indian promoters hold shares through holding companies and not in their own names. Due to this, stock exchanges only report the total number of shares held by holding companies without disclosing the primary entities that hold those shares.

“There could be multiple levels of such holding companies; also, inadequate data on debt or pledged shares of some such holding companies may give an incomplete picture to minority shareholders, who on the other hand will typically hold shares of companies under his/her name,” it said.

Besides, there is a need for additional disclosure on financials and debt positions of promoters in all unlisted entities, where they hold a majority or significant ownership (26 per cent). This may help minority investors better assess the true health of Indian promoter groups,” Kotak report said."

43,2019-02-06,Zee,"New Delhi: Mutual fund houses with an estimated Rs 8,000-crore exposure to Essel Group have asked regulator Sebi to permit them to modify the framework of Subhash Chandra-led Group's debenture trust deeds to give promoters time to rope in strategic investors, officials said.

The Essel Group, on Sunday, sealed a formal agreement with its lenders including mutual funds and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), to get time till September to de-leverage or pare its debt.

The agreement is with those lenders who have taken pledged shares of the group flagship and listed entities, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Dish TV India.

The group, on January 27, had confirmed that an understanding with the lenders had been achieved, which was finalised last Sunday. The agreement was not to declare the company a defaulter as it had admitted that it could service the debt only up to December.

According to officials, several mutual fund houses have approached markets regulator Sebi asking it to revise the 'terms and conditions' of Essel Group's debenture trust deeds.

The move will give the promoters time to bring in a strategic investor rather than the selling pledged shares in case of decline in the prices of the security, they added.

The debenture trust deed is a document made by the company, whereby trustees are appointed to protect the interest of debenture-holders before they are offered for public subscription. Also, it specifies the equity cover that promoters need to maintain.

When contacted, an Essel Group spokesperson said, ""We do not comment on rumours"".

Fund houses are concerned that a potential default by the group's promoters may force them to mark down investments and erode their net asset value.

Mutual funds have a total exposure of about Rs 8,000 crore to Essel Group's debentures, against which shares have been pledged as collateral, at the end of December.

Among the fund houses that have an exposure to the Group include Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund."

34,2019-02-06,Zee,"If you turn out to be a long-term fixed-income investor, which most people in India end up being, then it does 
  
  
  not make sense to be an opportunistic investor in a fixed income category when interest rates are going down, Dhirendra Kumar, CEO, Value Research, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


Are debt mutual funds really in trouble or not, especially post the Essel Group saga?
Yes, some funds can actually potentially land into trouble. They are not in trouble right now. There was a 25% decline in the worth of the collateral that was mortgaged for the lending and that sharp decline in the value of Zee Entertainment stock prices, led to the quick worthlessness of the collateral. That actually forced fund companies because there is no way around it. It is almost like lending against shares and in lending against shares, if the collateral value goes down, the margin calls come and Zee promoters could not really supplement that very quickly. Nobody has a control on that. The more interesting thing that is coming by is the Economic Times report that SEBI is trying to curtail or eliminate loan against shares to promoters. That could lead to a big rejig. I do not know what is the timeframe and most of the moves from SEBI has generally not been very knee-jerk. It is unlikely to cause any disruption given the timeframe. But this is the lesson. 

Here is a large fixed income industry which has come about and it is lending and it is finding avenues trying to enhance their return by getting into territories which might be downright risky and where things can awry. Right now, for investors there is a very simple course. There are many funds in which investors cannot do anything. Fixed majority funds, where investors have to wait it out. Hopefully, things turn out reasonably okay given that under it all, Zee is not worthless. Of course anything which happens sharply in a brief period of time, in one-day decline kind of situations, if fund companies are forced to sell, it will translate into significant losses. Also the collateral may not be good enough. 

Investors need to really worry about where the funds have large exposure -- 5%, 7%. In such instruments, there is a distinct possibility of something not working out nicely, fund companies not being able to wriggle themselves out of a situation and getting investors in a difficult spot. But at the same time, the regulatory preparedness or the kind of enablement done by SEBI is quite nice. Things might go wrong. Things might turn bad but I do not think it will translate into permanent impairment of the asset. It might get take longer and I think from that standpoint, the side pocketing rules will come in very handy in such situations.


That may be the case but despite regulatory nuts and bolts being in place, what should investors keep in mind? A large part of the investor community take these as a proxy to FDs. What is the overall risk that these funds carry?
First and foremost, investors should make sure they understand that this is not FD. This will not guarantee any return and you are entitled to all the return less expenses and that return could be positive and negative too. That is the first thing when it comes to any market linked investment. But at the same time, there are a few things which investors should follow to avoid such situations.

Most investors actually go and chase the best return. But that may be counterproductive in fixed income funds. When you chase the best return, it is delivered by assuming higher risk which may not be visible. Risk visits you infrequently but it translates into impairment of assets and sometimes, loss of principle. So, do not get greedy when you are a conservative investor investing in fixed income; do not stake your capital for the sake of marginally higher return, that is one. 

Then if you end up in such a situation, then do not act in a hurry because many a times, a fund which is taking inordinate risk by having a large exposure, would try and wriggle themselves out of it even if it amounts to taking a marginal loss or bearing the exit load, just in case it applies to your near-term investment. I would say jut be a little careful, do not get greedy, do not chase the best return when it comes to fixed income. That is the only thing which you can do.


Something that investors and viewers always expect from you is drilling it down to specific funds. Where do you think the risk adjusted reward management has been the best?
Funds, when it comes to fixed income investing investors, should err on the side of caution because the difference between a great category and a fairly dull category may not be meaningful, it may not be life changing. Most investors' needs get fulfilled with a liquid fund with an ultra short term bond fund and a short term fund. I find that all the exciting funds, all the interesting funds or funds which actually come on the forefront, end up being disappointing for individual investors if you stay there for longer or for a full market cycle.

If you are a beneficiary of an opportunistic call, then the other side of it is that the returns will moderate and an individual investor is not an active one. So be conservative, stick to the two, three fund categories and that will fulfil most of your needs. I think one should look at the heart of the delivery of fixed income funds, tax efficiency, liquidity and tax efficiency. If you turn out to be a long-term fixed income investor, which most people in India end up being, then it does not make sense to be an opportunistic investor in a fixed income category when interest rates are going down. I will go in for a long fund and as rates are likely to come down, I will shift somewhere else because you are deprived of the tax break that comes by way of a long term holding for three years and more."

While Nifty has sharply clawed back after falling to 10,000 level in the second half of 2018, most key stocks have been witnessing a free fall. 32 out of 50 Nifty stocks and three out of four BSE500 stocks are in the negative. Nearly half of the stocks are down 20 per cent or more.

In fact, some of the Nifty stocks including Zee Entertainment, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Tata Motors and HPCL have more than halved from their 52-week highs.

Other heavyweights such as DHFL and Vodafone Idea have seen over 75 per cent fall.

Only a handful of stocks, mainly Reliance, HDFC Bank and HDFC have led this rise in the index, thanks to their rising weight in Nifty quarter after quarter.



Compare this to the market performance in the nearly two-year period ended January 2018.

In the one year from January 2017 to January 2018 (when Nifty hit 11,000 milestone for the first time), 90 per cent stocks in Nifty and BSE500 gained.

MPC announced cut of 25 bps and changed stance to Neutral that addresses two immediately challenges. One is making liquidity available at cheaper costs specially to Banks who are focused on higher loan growth via retails loans and asset purchase from NBFCs , though this will not mean cheaper loans to NBFCs as banks are aggressively looking to increase market share.

Lenders dumped shares of Anil Ambani group companies they held as collateral after their market value plummeted about Rs 12,600 crore ($1.8 billion) this month, adding to the litany of woes plaguing the Indian billionaire.

Creditors sold a total 5.5 billion shares in four companies -- Reliance Power, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Communications and Reliance Capital -- leading to a 3-to-8 percentage-point reduction in founders’ stakes in these firms, according to filings.

The fragile investor sentiment for the Anil Ambani group was dealt another blow after its wireless unit, Reliance Communications, said last Friday it plans to file for bankruptcy. The selloff spread to other group firms, eroding the value of the shares pledged as collateral. 

IDBI Trusteeship Services, which held Reliance Power shares, said it sold the assets as the borrowers “defaulted on the terms”.


Bloomberg

Reliance Communications has seen its market value drop by more than half this week while shares of Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure have crashed almost 60 per cent each. Reliance Capital has tumbled 34 per cent.

The share pledge problem has also engulfed other Indian companies. Media tycoon Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group signed a pact with its lenders that protects the group’s borrowings against shares from being counted as default until September 30, even if their value erodes. The accord followed the 27 per cent slump in the flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises on January 25."

61,2019-02-09,Zee,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has declined to give its opinion on the plan by mutual funds to give Essel Group’s cash-strapped promoters a breather, said people aware of the matter. The capital market regulator has put the onus on funds holding Essel Group debt securities to do what is best for unit holders.

They had sought Sebi’s informal nod for a plan that would give the Subhash Chandra-led group time to sell assets and repay debt instead of offloading pledged shares as there has been a drop in the security cover. The funds will now amend the debenture trust deeds to allow this.

They had sought Sebi’s informal nod for a plan that would give the Subhash Chandra-led group time to sell assets and repay debt instead of offloading pledged shares as there has been a drop in the security cover. The funds will now amend the debenture trust deeds to allow this.


Debenture Trust Deed Specifics
Mutual funds had approached the regulator to allow them to alter the terms of Essel Group debenture trust deeds to give the promoters time till September to bring in a strategic investor for its media business. 


 The group had reached an agreement with lenders, including mutual funds and nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs), to this effect after shares of Zee Entertainment and Dish TV plunged 26% and 33%, respectively, in a single day on January 25. That followed a news report alleging links between the Essel Group and Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures, a company being investigated by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore after demonetisation.

That slump sparked panic about forced selling by lenders as cashstrapped promoters of Zee were unable to provide fresh shares to cover shortfall in collateral. Lenders, including MFs and NBFCs, had agreed in principle to hold off from selling shares of the companies in event of a further drop in prices. Promoters have pledged almost 60% of their 42% in ZEE.

The debenture trust deed specifies the equity cover that promoters have to maintain with lenders, which hold shares as collateral. The cover ranges from 1.5 to two times the debt. In the case of Zee, the cover had fallen below the threshold after stock prices fell.

Some members of Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) recently briefed Sebi on the issue, said two persons close to the development. “This is a commercial transaction between the borrower and lender. The covenant is only a safety mechanism. If the covenant is breached, it is well within the rights of the money manager to alter the debenture trust deed,” said a senior executive at a large fund house.

Mutual funds had a total exposure of around ₹8,000 crore at the end of December to the Essel Group’s nonconvertible debentures against which shares have been pledged as collateral. Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has the largest exposure to Essel Group companies, followed by HDFC Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton MF and ICICI Prudential MF."

63,2019-02-11,Zee,"There is widespread abhorrence towards Pigs for wallowing in mud, but most do not appreciate that they wallow in mud because they have no sweat glands. However, they are the smartest animal on the earth and cleanest in their natural habitat.

Drawing this analogy about the perception of Pigs, Hong Kong-based broker CLSA, in a note titled “Pigs That Might Fly,” lists 22 stocks in Asia region where valuations are at record low levels due to perception concerns, but offers significant upside if valuation reverts to the mean. Of the 22 stocks, six are from the Indian market including ONGC, Coal India, Bharti Airtel, ACC, ICICI Pru and ZEE Entertainment.

The rationale for ONGC appearing attractive is that the government hiked oil subsidy budget allocation by 22 per cent in the interim budget, which suggests realisation of the company could be much higher than implied by current stock prices. ONGC is one of the cheapest exploration and production companies in the world and as the subsidy overhang subsides, it offers sizable earning improvement.

Coal India, one of the largestcoal producing companies in the world, offers a dividend yield of 9 per cent based on FY20 earnings, the third-highest dividend yield in the Asia ex-Japan region. Coal India stock is available at nine times of FY20 earnings with 70 per cent return on equity.

India’s largest telecom company by revenue and market share Bharti Airtel’s focus on deleveraging due to the stake sale in Bharti Infratel, an initial public offering of African IPO could potentially bring down debt by 24 per cent. CLSA has a price target of Rs 410 on Bharti Airtel, which suggests a 34 per cent upside from the current level. ICICI Pru Life is trading at 40 per cent discount to HDFC Life, therefore narrowing of valuation discount could offer upside for the stock.


Other prominent stocks included in the list are Standard Chartered, Robot maker Fanuc, Singtel, Baidu and Nintendo. CLSA also listed 10 piglet stocks — basically smallcap companies — in the note. However, no Indian company figure in the list."

67,2019-02-13,Zee,"DD Free Dish may run into a dead-end as some of the top broadcasters have decided to pull out their Hindi mass entertainment channels from the free-to-air platform owned by public broadcaster Prasar Bharati.

The move by broadcasters like Star India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) and Viacom18 will affect over 22 million subscribers, who will not be able to watch popular channels such as Zee Anmol, Star Utsav, Rishtey Cineplex, Star Bharat and Sony Pal.

“In one of the rare occasions top four broadcasters have reached a consensus to not show any Hindi general entertainment channel or movie channel on Free Dish. This is to make sure that the existing cable and DTH customers don’t shift to Free Dish,” said a top executive from one of the broadcasters, who did not wish to be identified.

Sources across the four broadcasters have confirmed the development, though none of the broadcasters responded to ET’s queries till press time Tuesday.

Free Dish offers 80 channels, including 23 DD channels, Rajya Sabha TV and Lok Sabha TV. It is a lifetime free service for the consumer, who needs to make a one-time investment in buying the dish and the set-top box. Prasar Bharati earns revenue from selling the slots on the platform to broadcasters.

Prasar Bharati has recently formed a set of guidelines and is conducting auctions for the 54 slots on the platform. It had earned Rs 85 crore in the last auctions held in July 2017, where 11 private TV channels had won the slots.

Many experts feel that the move by the broadcasters will force consumers to go for pay TV service providers and will lead to a major loss of revenue for the pubcaster.

Calls made to Shashi Shekhar Vempati, CEO, Prasar Bharati, did not elicit any response till press time Tuesday.

ET had first reported in September last year that DD Free Dish is becoming a concern for broadcasters and distributors. Multiple broadcasters ET spoke with said that DD Free Dish is totally in contrast with Trai’s tariff order and interconnection regulations, and completely un-addressable. Even Prasar Bharati is not aware of the total number of active subscribers on the platform.

While various estimates peg the current subscriber base of DD Free Dish at 22-25 million, consulting firm Ernst and Young said the number will top 40 million by 2020.

Doordarshan had launched DD Free Dish (earlier DD Direct+) in December 2004 with a bouquet of 33 TV channels. The capacity of the DTH platform was augmented to 59 channels and then to 104 channels in December 2014.

It was the rural reach and growth of DD Free Dish, which made broadcast networks like Star India, ZEE, ESPN, Viacom18 and others to launch their FTA channels on the platform. These networks were initially seeking advertising moolah from clients targeting the middle and lower income viewers. But now Free Dish is available across the country and has grown to a size where it may become a threat to the entire value chain.

Last year, most broadcasters had converted their FTA channels into pay channels to create bundles and packages under the new tariff regime. “There is no level-playing field when it comes to Free Dish. The new tariff order is only for the addressable systems, and Free Dish doesn’t come in its ambit. Moreover, cable and DTH players have been asking us to withdraw channels from Free Dish, and the move will safeguard their interest,” said another broadcaster.

Prasar Bharati has divided channels into five buckets based on their genres and set the reserve price based on the bucket. Hindi general entertainment channels and teleshopping channels, for example, have a reserve price of Rs 15 crore, while Hindi movie channels have a reserve price of Rs 12 crore."

78,2019-02-13,Zee,"Difference between Nifty50 and midcap index is widening and that is not a good sign. Challenges around slowing 
  
  
  economy is really hurting overall market sentiments, Jinesh Gopani, Head - Equities, Axis MF, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:



We were just cribbing how we are completely disconnected from the way global markets are panning out. After three days of fall, we have just seen that touch-and-go moment with 11,100. Is this how we are going to be until the election?

 I think so. Volatility will continue till election. Also, the Nifty is in a very tight range. Unless and until the breakout is healthy, we are going to see markets going up and down 1% and 2%, even if the overall Q3 earnings have been okay. Largecaps have delivered good numbers but midcaps have been okay and hence, the midcap pain still continues. You are seeing the difference between the Nifty50 and midcap index widening which in a way is not a good sign. But the challenges around slowing economy in the second half of this fiscal year, is really hurting overall sentiments of the market. If you see markets are in a very tight range, waiting for some trigger, probably election would be the trigger to look for.


Elections are still three months away. How does one deal with the interim challenges like what will happen to NBFCs and Dewan Housing, the cross connection between ADAG and other banks etc? 
The NBFC challenge continues and till March, we have to be careful because liquidity is tight in the system and we will have to see how NBFCs, especially tier II, tier III, tier IV NBFCs, sustain in this period. Hope we do not see any defaults coming by. At this juncture at least we do not see that way, but things are pretty challenging for them and we have to be very careful in asserting how these NBFCs will really thrive over next 6 to 12 months. 

It is very challenging. To be very frank, there are corporate governance issues which are coming up every now and then and that has further impact on the overall sentiment of the market, especially on the mid and small side. Hope we pass this phase nicely till the election and then after the election, I hope the second half of CY2019 is much better than the first half. 


 What is the outlook from the private banks? The general sense is that given the problems plaguing the NBFC sector, there is going to be a lot of market share gain for some of these private sector retail banks. Do you agree? Is there anything specific you would bet on?
Private sector banks are very well placed even without these issues around NBFC. Having said that, obviously some market share gain will come from these NBFCs who slow down in their business models and obviously 10-15% of the good book or good lending will go to private sector banks. So we are bullish on private sector banks. 

If you see our portfolios, we are heavy on financials and more on the private sector bank side and we really feel it is a 5-10 year story. You have an under penetrated market. Market share gain from PSUs is the theme that is continuing for last 15-20 years and should continue further. Most of these private sector banks are technologically advanced and the critical game lies in being able to service your customer in the best form going forward. They are very well placed given their robust asset quality structure and disciplined ALM management. 


How do you see the market composition changing in terms of the pecking order? After some poor corporate governance standards in Zee or Sun Pharma, do you think that in a market where only 10% of the stocks were going higher, now only 2% or 3% will move up? There could be just 10-15 Nifty stocks and 10-15 midcap stocks!
When things are bad, when times are challenging and the economy slowing down, then on a high growth trajectory all these issues come up. Normally, we would like a broad-based movement in the market for a longer period of time because that is what will pan out in terms of earnings growth, once the GDP clocks back to 7.5-8% in a stable manner. 

To that extent, near term because of this fear psychosis, markets are very tight. Even the FII and domestic net buying figures on the cash side have been abysmally low. At this juncture, it is more about hiding in good names rather than taking big bets on some of the stocks which you would have taken if market was on a full momentum. Frankly it is a challenging time. 

Next two-three months are very critical. We will have to see how we cross this election event, what is the outcome and how much impact it has on economy. It is unclear at this juncture how things will pan out for let us in next five years. It is better to be cautious rather than going all out in the market.


Are you finding opportunities in beaten down spaces like autos just yet? What is the feelers one is getting from Maruti, Eicher across the board really?
Demand is slow. Even when we are doing our channel checks, we are not getting very good signs of demand picking up in a big way. It may take one or two quarters more to return as the sentiment is a bit low. Confidence is slightly on the lower side and hence people might just defer buying vehicles. The general overall slowness in economy is being seen in auto sector in terms of the purchases. It is better to wait for one or two quarters and then see how things really go.


How do you read the Essel Group stocks like Zee Entertainment and Dish TV? 
From a business point of view, media is a good sector to be in and the name which you said is one of the good names and they have been in the market as one of the top players for many years. But I would refrain from answering on this pledged share issue or anything specific to the company due to compliance issues.


What is your outlook on midcaps? 
Midcap numbers have been okay as compared to largecap numbers. I think people would like to wait for some signs of macro improvement and that will come only when one has clarity on the politics and its impact on the economy. The next two-three months are really critical. We will be in tight range and hope we do not go down further.


There is a tone of sadness in your voice. When will that happy tone come back -- three months, six months, one year?
It is not about feeling sad or happy. I will be more realistic given the current scenario and the challenges we are facing as well as the coming election. It is always better to be cautiously optimistic rather than becoming over optimistic. We really do not know how the election mandate will come and what will be its real outcome on the economy. If there is a steady government, then things will chug along, animal spirit will return and momentum will be back in the second half of the year. 

But if there is a change in government, then which government is being formed, how the cabinet is being formed, what are their agenda on the reforms process -- will always create a lot of uncertainty in the near term. Markets do not like uncertainties. Markets like stability and consistency. So it is not about being sad, it is about being realistic."

87,2019-02-19,Zee,"A lot of heat and dust has been generated on the issue of mutual fund lending to promoters. We live in interesting times where sudden changes in markets, risk appetite can throw even the best planners off guard creating challenges that could take months to resolve. Here is a way to think about the whole issue but before that a number of misconceptions need to countered and addressed.

Firstly, funding promoters is a legitimate business activity and cannot be considered something dangerous or illegal. A promoter who has built a successful business and wants to diversify using his personal resources should be given every opportunity to do so. Attempts to curtail that will only harm entrepreneurship and risktaking that is so much a part of free-market, capitalist economies. Investors and regulators are justified in being concerned about the amount of leverage with these promoters and whether mutual funds have enough cover/collateral to get back their money. And there are ways of resolving this. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) can cap the amount of shares a promoter can pledge at say 75 per cent of his total holding. The promoter can be barred from pledging 100 per cent of his holding so that investors don’t get jittery and nervous about the company’s future and the promoter also has some skin in the game.

Secondly, the fear over MFs going down because of risky promoter lending has also been exaggerated. In the past few weeks, fears have arisen over pledged shares of promoters especially those considered risky by market. The sharp plunge in the shares of Zee group companies, including flagship Zee Entertainment, followed by fears of firesale of promoter stake by mutual funds have created a crisis of confidence. MF loans to promoters of Emami Industries and the Anil Ambani group have also come under scrutiny and attack with critics saying that mutual funds should not use investors to provide promoter loans.

To make matters worse, some MFs have done deals with the promoters including the Subhash Chandra-led Essel group, promoters of Zee Entertainment and Anil Ambani, pledging to stand still on invoking the pledges. In the case of both Essel and Mr Ambani, mutual funds have agreed not to invoke the pledge on the shares till September 30, giving the beleaguered promoters more time to sell assets and repay them. This has been attacked strongly but interestingly the Sebi has remained quiet. It examined the Essel-MF transaction but has neither cancelled it nor said it is illegal. The regulator perhaps realises that unitholder interests are at stake and that these are unusual, exceptional times and that mutual funds should be given some time to realise the full value of their investment.

One should take a step back and look at the big picture issue here to understand this. No large institutional borrower is stripped off his company or assets due to default of a few days or even weeks. This simply does not happen. Even the famous (or infamous, depending on your point of view) Reserve Bank of India circular of February 12 gives banks 180 days before dragging the company to the bankruptcy court. There is some logic to this. Obviously, every borrower who misses a payment is not a wilful defaulter or a chor who simply wishes to take the money and run. Many exceptional, unavoidable circumstances come together to trigger such a miss. It could be bureaucratic/ judicial delays, natural calamities or sudden economic downcycles that may cause a buyer to delay payments. The 180 days time has obviously been given so that banks can talk to the borrower, understand his difficulties and work out a solution that will take care of everybody’s interests. Jet Airways is a classic example of this. Things are probably getting a little better for the airline because of banks’ involvement and the desire of the promoter, Naresh Goyal, to settle the issue by compromising with Etihad and the lenders. A desire that has no doubt been accentuated by the prospect of bankruptcy and the consequent loss of his business.

Now, take what the MFs have done with Zee and Mr Ambani. They have given both the promoters time till September to resolve all issues, sell assets and repay them. Till then, they will not invoke the pledge on the shares. The question to keep in mind here is whether the lenders have enough cover and whether the borrowers are continuing to pay interest and principal on the loans. The answer, at least going by public statements, appear to be yes. They have cover and regular payments are being made.

From the MFs point of view, this approach seems logical and correct. Mr Chandra has already announced his intention to sell a partial stake in Zee Entertainment and a process is on. MFs have taken the call that it makes sense to wait a few months before as any preemptive move would only result in losses. If the deal is done by September, they are home and dry. Otherwise they still have the option of selling the shares and recovering their money.

What Sebi, RBI and investors need to keep in mind is the sanctity of the deadlines in these deals. Obviously, it cannot be allowed to run forever. Their effectiveness lies in quick disposal of assets and repayment to the satisfaction of everybody.

MF lending to promoters or corporates is not more riskier than bank lending. MF lending to corporates, even highly rated ones can also go bad and there is a mountain of evidence on how banks have goofed up collateralised lending to companies even with all the due diligence and processes. There is no doubt risk in such lending to promoters. But very case is not the same and every promoter is not looking to decamp without paying. The debate on MF lending to promoters needs to be done in a cool-headed pragmatic way. An activist, approach will not work."

86,2019-02-19,Zee,"MUMBAI: US cable major Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, Atairos, a $4-billion investment company led by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis, and Sony Corp have been shortlisted for talks that could lead to the purchase of a substantial stake in Zee Entertainment, multiple people aware of the situation said.

They are competing with technology giant Apple and Reliance Industries, the only homegrown contender. The shortlist happened in the past 10 days after the submission of non-binding bids by these firms. Comcast and Atairos may team up to form a consortium.

Chinese suitors Tencent and Alibaba, thought to be potentially strong contenders initially, have not yet made any offer.

“The due diligence is ongoing. Most of the negotiations, management meetings are happening offshore. Some of the discussions are more serious while others are waiting in the wings and keeping a close tab,” said an industry official on condition of anonymity.

“The April deadline is on track for now,” said the official. Binding offers are due after that.

A Zee spokesperson said it does not comment on speculation. “As communicated in its official statement, the stake sale process of ZEEL is in steady progress. “Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage, due to confidentiality agreements,” he added. Comcast and Sony declined to comment.

Mails sent to Atairos, Apple and Reliance did not generate a response till press time.

Sources said Sony seems keener to buy out the incumbent promoters upfront. Others such as Comcast, Atairos or an Apple – that lack significant local footprint in the fast growing local television and media entertainment — may initially explore an equal stake with the promoters but buy them out eventually after 3-5 years following the transition, allowing them to piggyback on any future upside as well.

The Zee management feels a foreign buyer, though allowed to own 100% in entertainment and media companies, would want a local partner and management team to run and navigate the complex, multilingual domestic market.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises had in November last year announced its promoters, led by Subhash Chandra, plan to sell up to 50% of stake to a strategic partner in order to deleverage their balance sheet.






Subsequently, the management has indicated it is open to selling over 50% of holdings in the firm as a part of asset monetisation efforts.

Zee shares have lost 23% in the last one year thereby partially impacting Subhash Chandra’s bargaining power to seek significant control premium. The current market cap is Rs 41,924.36 crore ($5.9 billion). The promoters own 41.62% of the company held through onshore and offshore entities. About 84.45% of the onshore stake is pledged with banks and financial institutions.

One of the early entrants into the satellite television space in India, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) has recently started aggressive expansion into different genres. A couple of years ago, it bought the sports business of Zee, housed under Taj Television (Ten Sports brand) for about Rs 2,400 crore. Last year, the company also entered Marathi general entertainment space.

The acquisition of Zee will make a lot of sense for SPN, which has more urban appeal and presence in only Hindi speaking markets. Zee, on the other hand, has a deeper connect with urban as well as regional markets and commands over 20% of overall television viewership.

Top Sony officials including Mike Hopkins, chairman of Sony Pictures Television, and Tony Vinciquerra, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, had visited Subhash Chandra and his family at his residence shortly after Chandra announced his intent to sell half of the promoter holding in Zee to a global strategic investor.

The $84-billion Comcast, led by Brian Roberts, has been a serial buyer and seller of media assets including cable networks, broadband assets, content providers, internet providers and even animation studios since the late 1980s. It, however, lost out on 21st Century Fox after Walt Disney Co trumped their $65 billion bid last year. The company has been scouting for assets in India and other high growth markets.

Phonemaker Apple has been buying niche companies and startups to get access to cutting-edge technology, products and talent to push its own value-added offerings like music, content and entertainment and deepen user engagement. In mid-2017, it explored buying the entire content library of films and music of Eros International, but the billion-dollar valuation became a deal breaker."
91,2019-02-20,Zee,"Two years ago, when Apple chief executive Tim Cook met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India’s message was clear: Tell us what’s needed to promote local manufacturing and we will do it.

The Cupertino, California-based company, though, has since realised that the government won’t tailor rules for one company, and that the PM simply meant ease of doing business. Now, Apple is looking for a Plan B in a country that not only offers volumes but has the potential to be a manufacturing base in the backdrop of US-China trade tensions.

The circumstances are not happy for the phone maker. Already hit by a longer replacement cycle for its phones the world over, Apple has been struggling to sell in India, a market that has a plethora of less expensive, but equally featurerich options, from Chinese players.

Last year, Apple took things into its own hands. Veteran Michel Coulomb got charge of India operations with clear directions to clean up the mess — stop rampant deep discounts that were hurting the brand and leading to price fluctuations, and conjure up a new India strategy.




What followed was high-profile exits, downsizing of distributors, trimming of channels and tighter price control, which led sales to plummet and made 2018 a four-year nadir for the company. Even the new India strategy didn’t quite take off in 2018.

In January, Ashish Chowdhary assumed charge of India operations, but ET’s interaction with key stakeholders still throws up a grim outlook for Apple in 2019.

Industry watchers feel Apple needs a radical change with a two-pronged approach — strengthen music and video services, possibly even through acquisitions, and prepare grounds for making India a manufacturing hub, not just for the domestic market but more importantly, for exports.

“Let me say it in bold words,” says Navkender Singh, associate research director, IDC. “India is not a priority market right now for products sale for Apple, but yes, for manufacturing, it could be a very important one.”

Apple had a 1.2% market share in India at the end of 2018, with sales halving to almost 1.7 million units, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

The iPhone maker made no mention of India while reporting October-December results. But in a response to ET’s queries, which came after repeated reminders over three weeks, Apple said it had a long-term perspective in India, which is already at the heart of its app development programme, through its App Accelerator. “Overall, more than 740,000 jobs in India can be attributed directly to the iOS ecosystem,” it says.

It’s not enough, say insiders and experts, with the brand failing to establish a foothold in the big three areas of device market share, local production and retail presence, with services being close to zero.


A DISSERVICE TO SERVICES
Experts point out that at a time when the worldwide over-the-top (OTT) content market — music and video on demand — has exploded, a handset priced at $1,000 may not find takers in India, but subscription-based content on demand could transcend the price barrier.

“Over the last two to three years, India has evolved into an OTT content delivery-based model, which has seen the entry of a lot of international players as well,” says Prashant Singhal, global head for telecom, media and technology, EY.

Small wonder then, that Apple is among those exploring the acquisition of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), along with US major Comcast and Sony Corp among others as reported by ET.

On a global scale, Apple is a latecomer to this party. The company is expected to release its original content in the latter half of 2019 and, according to a recent announcement, iTunes will now be available on Samsung TV sets, a perfect opportunity in a non-iOS market like India.

It could similarly have priced some niche content higher and announced partnerships across different operating systems. Reports suggest Apple may undercut Netflix.

Gaurav Gandhi, country manager, video, Amazon Prime, says it typically takes two years for a conception to come live on screen. “We have invested significantly in local content and we are working on newer shows in seven new languages,” he adds. In a space where Netflix, Voot, Hotstar, HOOQ and Amazon jostle for room, Apple remains years behind.

The company says Apple Music has made inroads into the Indian music streaming space, with a focus on in-country talent. Earlier this month, it launched Apple Maps navigation for India. The phone maker does not, however, seem to be in a hurry to launch Apple Pay in India at a time when all and sundry — including the likes of Google Pay and WhatsApp — have moved into the surging digital payments market.


PRODUCTION, THE BEST OPTION
The big push, though, is production. Apple is the world’s largest electronics manufacturer and second-largest overall manufacturer after Volkswagen AG. Apple makes almost all of its $200-billion worth of products — iPhones, iPads, laptops and wearables — out of China. To put it in perspective, India’s total exports were about $300 billion in 2017-18.

Industry experts believe India has huge potential as the next manufacturing hub for Apple, especially coupled with China-US geopolitical pressures. However, some believe gains will be symbiotic. “Frankly, this seems to be more of a miss for the Indian government, than the other way round,” says Vivan Sharan, partner, Koan Advisory, a public policy advisory which has Netflix and Amazon as its clients.

Contrary to media reports, Sharan says Apple has not put in any application with the government for company-specific concessions since 2017. “After Cook’s visit, Apple had made a proposal to the government, which became redundant once the Phased Manufacturing Plan came into effect. The company has not placed any fresh proposal in the last two years, to the best of our knowledge,” he adds.

Meanwhile, the India Cellular & Electronics Association has sought a 10-year tax holiday, much like in China and Vietnam, along with change in labour and ewaste laws, to attract global giants. Apple, along with Vivo, Oppo, Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi, is a member of ICEA.

According to a McKinsey study, the move would “fire up” manufacturing, creating a $230-billion industry by 2025 and generating 4.7 million jobs. “This was a huge opportunity for the government but nothing seems to be moving on this front,” adds Sharan.


RETAIL TAILS OFF
Apple began assembling the iPhone SE in 2016 through Wistron in Bengaluru and expanded operations to include the iPhone 6s in 2018. Wistron has applied for the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), notified to attract investments in electronic manufacturing, to invest Rs 5,000 crore over five years and begin manufacturing iPhone 8 too.

However, insiders say it’s still a long way away, given the lack of cutting-edge ecosystem in India.

Plans for a bigger retail presence have also not made much headway, but it might not be Apple’s fault entirely, with the government sitting on its proposal for almost three years.

Three years ago, the clause requiring 30% mandatory local sourcing for foreign players to open single-brand retail stores was relaxed, provided they had state-ofthe-art (the SOTA category) facilities. “Apple, along with other high-tech companies, queued up at the government’s door,” a person in the know of Apple’s application tells ET, not wishing to be identified. “Not a single company has received approval so far.”

Apple is now believed to be planning half a dozen 5,000-sq ft, franchisee-operated Flagship Apple Premium Reseller outlets this year, three each in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, sources tell ET. It’s a piecemeal effort. As Mahesh Uppal, an independent telecom policy analyst, says, “Right now, policymakers are unlikely to take any bold, or let us say significant, decisions since there is an air of uncertainty, which is typical of an election year.”

Another year may just go down in Apple’s not-so-glorious India story by the time the new government comes in and policy-making resumes in full swing."

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 814 crore worth of domestic stocks on Tuesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 1,164 crore, data suggested.


5 Nifty stocks to have physical settlement in advance
Five Nifty stocks – Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Tata Motors, Yes Bank, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises – will move into physical settlement two months in advance, according to a NSE circular. These stocks were scheduled to come under physical settlement from July expiry but the exchange has revised start of physical settlement in these stocks from May expiry onwards.


Gold at 10-month high, oil near 2019 high
Gold prices held at 10-month highs on Wednesday, supported by global slowdown concerns and a weaker dollar, with markets eyeing the release of the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting minutes later in the session. Spot gold was marginally lower at $1,339.61 per ounce as of 0021 GMT, having touched $1,341.78 per ounce in the previous session, its highest level since April 20. US gold futures dipped 0.2 percent to $1,342.6 an ounce. Meanwhile, oil prices hovered near 2019 highs supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but capped by soaring US production and expectations of an economic slowdown. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $55.93 per barrel at 0042 GMT, down 16 cents from their last settlement.


Dena, Central & Allahabad banks may go out of PCA next
Allahabad Bank, Central Bank of India and Dena Bank may be next in line to be taken out of the Reserve Bank of India’s prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, with the government likely to inject more capital into these lenders and hopes of better loan recovery through the insolvency resolution mechanism. The government is expected to provide another Rs 12,500 crore of capital in the current quarter to banks that have capital ratios below the mandatory level. RBI removed Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce from the PCA on January 31.



MACROS 

DA for govt employees hiked by 3%
The union cabinet today approved an additional dearness allowance (DA) of 3 per cent over the existing rate of 9 per cent for government employees and pensioners which will be effective from January 1, 2019. This will cost the government around Rs 9,200 crore per year. The move is expected to benefit more than one crore central government employees and pensioners. 


Oil prices near 2019 highs
Oil prices hovered near 2019 highs on Wednesday, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but capped by soaring US production and expectations of an economic slowdown, Reuters reported. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $55.93 per barrel, down 16 cents from their last settlement, but not far off their 2019 high of $56.33 reached earlier this week.


Fed minutes of Jan meeting to be out today
The minutes from the January Fed meeting will be closely watched following a dovish statement from the central bank at their January policy-setting meeting.


China central bank announces bill swaps
China’s central bank said that it would implement 1-year central bank bill swaps worth 1.5 billion yuan ($222.02 million) on Wednesday to improve the liquidity of banks’ perpetual bonds, and support issuance of the bonds to replenish capital. 


WTO trade indicator declines to 9-year low
Trade tensions, political risks and financial volatility will continue to pressure global trade and the weakness is likely to extend into the first quarter of 2019, the World Trade Organisation said on Tuesday. The global watchdog’s latest World Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI) was at 96.3, the weakest since March 2010 and lower than the baseline value of 100, signalling below-trend expansion into the first quarter. Readings of 100 indicate growth in line with medium-term trends; those greater than 100 suggest above-trend growth, while those less than 100 show below-trend growth.


Cash dole-out, Pulwama may help BJP
The Rs 6,000-per annum cash dole out to each farmer family in basic income support will help swing votes for the ruling BJP, but issues like the stray cattle menace in the electorally crucial Uttar Pradesh are a concern, says a report by Swiss brokerage UBS. It also said that this time, there was no Modi-wave or any wave at all and its field visits did not give enough fodder for it believe that the BJP will return to power after the summer hustings. Foreign brokerage CLSA on the other hand said rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pulwama attack can have a political fallout, depending on how the situation unfolds. 


Errant CEOs to lose hefty payouts
If a bank CEO airbrushes financials to prop up profitability, makes inadequate provisioning of sticky loans or fails to meet regulatory norms of RBI, Sebi or IRDAI, he will no longer be able to leave his job with hefty payouts in the form of bonuses and stock options. New norms being framed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will ensure that such benefits are taken back from the CEO. The RBI is working on a set of rules that would link remuneration of banks CEOs to parameters like balance sheet size of a bank, loan delinquency, profits and governance record. 


Trade talks: US presses China for stable yuan
The US is asking China to keep the value of the yuan stable as part of trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economies, a move aimed at neutralizing any effort by Beijing to devalue its currency to counter American tariffs, reports Bloomberg. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China were going well and suggested he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations, saying March 1 was not a “magical” date. 


Startup definition widened, relief for investors
The government announced a series of changes aimed at freeing investors and entrepreneurs from the so-called angel tax that has roiled India’s startup ecosystem. It raised the exemption threshold and kept investments by listed companies of certain minimum size, venture capital funds and non-residents in startups outside the ambit of the tax. The move is expected to bring relief to 16,000 companies that are registered as startups with the Department of Investment and Internal Trade (DPIIT).


16 states sue Trump over emergency 
Sixteen US states sued President Donald Trump's administration Monday over his decision to declare a national emergency to fund a wall on the southern border with Mexico, saying the move violated the constitution. Trump announced the emergency Friday in order to bypass Congress, which approved only a quarter of the $5.6 billion he wanted for the wall in a spending bill. Should the states prevail, the case could work its way up to the Supreme Court, setting up a precedent-setting showdown on the separation of powers.

93,2019-02-20,Zee,"MUMBAI: Five Nifty stocks – Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Tata Motors, Yes Bank, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises – will move into physical settlement two months in advance, according to a NSE circular.

“...all new expiry month contracts issued in the above securities after expiry of February contracts (i.e. May expiry onwards) shall be physical settled. However, the existing unexpired contracts of expiry months February 2019, March 2019 and April 2019 and new strikes introduced in such contracts would continue to be available for trading till their respective expiry under the cash settlement mode,"" said NSE."
96,2019-02-25,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Zee Entertainment have rebounded over 55 per cent from their 52-week low of Rs 288 hit exactly a month ago, as Dalal Street believes the highly-leveraged company may manage to bring in a strategic partner by the September deadline, in which case it will be able to deter lenders from selling pledged shares.

Analysts see another 20-25 per cent potential upside on the counter.

“We believe chances of Zee’s stake getting sold are high, and this would allay concerns on the pledging front,” say analysts at Nomura.

There are reports that suggest the company is in talks with a few foreign players. While the company said the stake sale process is progressing steadily, it won't comment on speculations. US players Sony and Comcast are among the firms said to be vying for the stake.

Nomura analysts covering Sony and Comcast suggest that a Zee deal could be a strategic fit for both of them. The foreign brokerage noted that Zee has consistently delivered strong profitable growth over last several years, which would mean Sony could leapfrog in terms of profitable growth in India.

Comcast, they analysts said, is struggling for growth in the residential video business and the Zee deal could open up a long-term growth opportunity.

Zee shares came under heavy pressure last month after reports linking the Essel Group to a firm under investigators’ radar for large cash transactions post the 2016 cash ban.

While the company denied any linkage with the firm under investigation for the large cash deposits, the news triggered a selling spree, sending Zee stocks tumbling some 27 per cent on January 25.

The strong selling made a few Zee lenders sell pledged shares in the open market. Zee later secured time till September to strike a deal.

Nomura India said at 20 times FY21 earnings, the Zee stock looks attractive, given its estimate of 18 per cent EPS CAGR over FY19-21F. It has a target of Rs 553 on the stock.

JM Financial in a note said the strategic sale price could be ahead of Zee’s intrinsic value, which it valued at Rs 450 as per its DCF.

But it counted the overhang from a potential sale of pledged shares by lenders, who are not a signatory to the consent agreement and the probability of a domestic telecom major acquiring the company, among the key downside risks. This brokerage has a target price of Rs 550 on the stock.

Zee Chairman Subhash Chandra in an open letter said it was his ‘obsession’ of not walking away from any situation that made him bleed up to Rs 5,000 crore.

“Despite the loss-making projects, we continue to pay interest and principle by borrowing funds against shareholdings in listed companies,” he said. 

By the first week of February, 27.82 crore promoter shares were on pledge, accounting for 25.8 per cent of the outstanding Zee shares and 66.1 per cent of total promoter holding.

JM Financial noted that promoters have pledged additional 3.52 crore shares since January 18. In total, 97 per cent of domestic-owned shares have been pledged by the promoters, the brokerage said on February 5."

102,2019-02-27,Zee,"We are not expecting an immediate bounce but structurally, a broader market performance can be expected, said 
Pankaj Pandey, HoR, ICICIdirect.com, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

The markets have put up a fairly brave face in the light of Indian Air Force bombing terror camps in Pakistan. How do you believe the overall trend is for the markets? Do we have the legs to take this sort of move higher given that the 10,800 mark was maintained?
The prospects of a stable government are far brighter now and which is why we would want to believe that probably there is a chance for a broader market performance. Up till now, the defensives have been largely holding ground this year -- mostly IT, FMCG and pharma. We would expect that since the overall inflation trajectory is going to be a little soft, it will also boost interest rate cut prospects. So, we are expecting another 50 bps rate cut. 

Besides the defensives, we would expect that the infra players will also benefit going forward. Recently, the market breadth has also been quite decent. But probably for the next month or so, we would expect the market to be in a range, probably at 10,800-11,100. So, we are not expecting an immediate bounce but structurally, a broader market performance can be expected.

 Otherwise, macros and earnings have been quite decent and that will support the overall improvement. But the biggest anxiety is elections. If the prospects of a stable government brightens up, we would expect markets to do well.


Are you saying that till the time election verdict is out, markets will not go anywhere? If that was the situation, then why do we have a pre-election rally every time before elections? 
Largely what we have seen in the past three instances has been that in runup to elections, the defensives have done well. Post elections, we have seen a good broader market performance. Last time also, there was decent prospect of a stable government. This time, earlier there was a bit of anxiety and there was an expectation of a hung parliament. If we get a stable government, a broader market performance can be seen post elections. 

We will have to see how things sort of pan out. For the next few days, I would expect market to remain range-bound. But somebody has to look at buying. Buying before elections make better sense because overall macroeconomic setup remains pretty good domestically. Globally things getting slightly better. Overall, that improves the prospects for our market. 


The auto index has underperformed for quite a while. Investor sentiment seems to have been hit. Can we see some demand stability kicking in and valuations improving? Would it make sense to remain in auto space now?
We have a negative view on the overall auto space. While we expect there will be some improvement in overall volume, steel prices are still at higher level and there is a prospect of increasing steel prices. We do not expect margin recovery for the broader auto as overall. Globally, things are still fluid on the auto front. One can look at certain pockets. For example, two-wheelers, which might be a beneficiary of direct income transfer which the government has started doing and there also the valuations are quite reasonable at 13-14 times. That is one pocket people can look at though I do not expect a recovery in auto as a pack.


It seems the Future Retail deal with Amazon is going to be announced next month. Amazon is now seeking a 10% stake in Future Retail which could be worth about Rs 2,000 crore. What would it imply for the Future Group?
We do not have a coverage on the Future Group but overall the way e-commerce guidelines have come up, largely it is positive for domestic players. What we like is something like Trent and ABFRL within the retail space. In both the cases, we are seeing decent margin recovery plus Trent is looking to ramp up the store count to about 30 odd on annual basis compared to 7-8 odd which they were doing earlier. Similarly for ABFRL there is a good margin improvement what we have seen across so these stocks which we like in the overall retail as a space.


How do you see the story of Zee Entertainment shaping up?
We have a negative view on the media space but we think the price decline in Zee is substantial and expect it to happen at six months’ average prices, which is above Rs 500. We would expect the price recovery to pan out. 

But globally, there are enough disruptions happening in media sector and that is why we are slightly sceptical in this space. Except for the radio as a segment, most of the other segments -- print or broadcasting -- look stressed. Besides this, the multiplex as a segment looks pretty attractive to us. We are quite positive on both Inox as well as PVR."

‘India is not for sale.’ Remember the inspirational lines of Subhas Chandra Goel while rejecting Rupert Murdoch’s takeover bid? It’s an extraordinary rags-to-riches story of a high school dropout from Haryana, who went on to pioneer our country’s first satellite Hindi channel Zee TV.

The self-made media tycoon has created massive wealth for shareholders since its IPO in 1993. Today, Zee Entertainment is among the highest revenue grossers in the Indian media industry. The group controls 20 per cent share of India’s traditional television viewing market. But of late everything is not going right for Goel and Zee. He recently penned an emotional letter concerning everyone linked to Zee Entertainment.

Let’s do a reality check on the business.

A plethora of unfortunate events rocked the business. Allegations of Zee’s association with Nityank Infra, which is being probed by the SFIO for demonetisation deposit worth Rs 3,000 crore, selling of pledge shares by lenders, IL&FS debt default leading to a lending squeeze, delay in strategic stake sell in Zee, all have cumulatively resulted in headwinds that have made the company stock tank 40 per cent, before paring some of the losses.

Operationally, Zee’s core business is on a sound footing; the problem lies with its group companies. A classic case of a blue chip firm with little idea to reinvest its high cash flows, resulting in such “di-worsification”. The good part is that there won’t be any further sale of pledge shares by the lenders for a few months; the deadline we believe has been extended beyond April 2019.

Everything now boils down to a stake sale to ensure smooth functioning of the company. Though the management has hinted that the stake sale will happen at a price much higher than the current market price as the strategic investor or set of investors “believe in the intrinsic value of the company,” but we have doubts such a deal can materialise.

Why would someone pay a higher price when you are in a soup? When it’s the last resort for your survival? Rather, you would be squeezed to the core as far valuation or stake sale price is concerned. The bargaining power in such a scenario, as we all know, shifts to the buyer from the seller. Empirical evidence suggests whenever a company has gone into a limbo, the mess gets murkier and resolution often takes a lot of time, which further derails the business.

For most of its life space, Zee shares have traded on an average PE multiple of over 30. Considering its thrust on digital revolution and with at the current PE of 17 times FY20 earnings, valuations definitely looks reasonable. However, as they say, it’s 90 per cent is psychology and 10 per cent knowledge in investing. A stock that may look as a screaming ‘buy’ can be your reason to scream in frustration later. Market pays a premium for certainty in the affairs of a business. What scares us is the consensus bet on a speedy resolution. Almost every shareholder or fund manager we talk to believes a deal is inevitable. What if there’s no deal?

Remember, the lenders will have a limit to their patience. Mr Market has an uncanny habit of ridiculing the majority. Also, it would be prudent to note that the general election is approaching fast. The opposition Congress isn’t a big fan of the Zee Group, as we all know. If the party manages the unthinkable and wrests power at the Centre, things might get really tough for Zee.

Often, it’s way more important to fathom “what can go wrong” rather than a “what would go right” scenario. Playing the role of devil’s advocate here, we feel until we have a strategic stake sale deal, Zee will face a lot of uncertainties, leading to continuous pressure on the stock."

Lending to promoters has been on the rise in India. The estimated value of pledged shares by promoters to various lenders in the current fiscal year is Rs. 1.2 lakh crore, an increase of around 60% over the last year. This indicates significant increase in leverage. Traditionally, promoters can pledge shares to banks as well as NBFCs.

Why do promoters pledge shares? To begin with, promoters (legally, a person with a controlling stake in a company) own most listed companies in India. When promoters need to raise funds, they can easily raise money by selling their shares in the company. However, this typically has a negative impact on the share price in the stock market. So, instead of selling shares, many promoters raise funds by pledging shares to a lender and borrow against them. In 2009, SEBI mandated public disclosure of promoters selling or pledging their shares.

Lending against securities is risky. That is why the Reserve Bank of India places certain restrictions on banks and NBFC’s for loans against shares. The rules relate to margin requirements that need to be maintained, as well as system wide exposure. The Reserve Bank of India actively monitors these loans. This is to maintain the stability of the financial system.

In the event of a market fall, a margin call would be triggered. If the promoters fail to fund the margin call, the creditor would need to sell shares. This can further trigger a decline in the share price, and the creditor may face a loss in this scenario.

This is where innovative structures have surfaced; several debt mutual funds have created structures to lend money to promoters against their equity shares. Debt mutual funds have extended loans to promoters, typically by purchasing bonds issued by the holding company controlled by the promoter.

Mutual Funds have been actively involved in backing promoter loans with shares/operational assets in their search of yields. Equity shares offer quick liquidity than other fixed assets, but they can be risky if the underlying price of the stock suddenly decreases. Usually, the collateral (equity shares) value is substantially higher than the loan amount to guard against any correction in the stock value.

The default by the IL&FS has turned the spotlight on the NBFC sector, as well as financing by pledging of shares. IL&FS Transport Networks, a listed company of the IL&FS Group, has seen its share price decline by 91% from its 52-week high. The promoters of the company had pledged 98% of their holding, which equalled 71.9% of total outstanding shares. IL&FS Transport Networks are among the IL&FS Group companies that have defaulted on debt.

Fears regarding lending against shares by mutual funds using the structure we have highlighted earlier arose when mutual funds sought a standstill agreement with lenders and did not sell pledged shares. It emerged that the holding companies had borrowed funds, pledging shares worth 59% of Zee Entertainment. The figure was 45.7% a year ago, indicating an increase in leverage. Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, among other fund houses, had a large exposure.

The concerns are high for some other companies, too. For example, Reliance Capital’s promoters had pledged 74.5% of their shares as on December 2018. Similarly, Bajaj Consumer Care’s promoters had pledged 70.5% of their holdings.

Pledging of shares is higher among promoters of mid- and small-cap companies, where pledging totals Rs 77,000 crore worth of shares in FY19, which is 62% of the total value of the promoter shares pledged in the same period. So far in 2019, more than Rs 16,000 crore worth of shares has been pledged by the promoters. Debt mutual funds have been active participants.

Because of these risks, SEBI is reportedly considering tightening disclosure norms. Mutual funds are essentially offering a loan against shares when they are buying commercial paper of the holding companies. The regulator is also reportedly considering framing rules for concentration risk as well. While the regulator has given some forbearance in the current crisis, this is a temporary measure we believe not to precipitate a crisis. In the coming months new regulations are likely. While Indian listed companies have made great progress in terms of regulatory driven improvement in transparency and timely disclosures, this event highlights that progress needs to be made in some other areas.

This is an also a near-term overhang on equity markets. We would be wary of investing in shares where promoters have a substantial pledge. This can be a systemic risk as well as outstanding loans against shares to promoters is roughly Rs 2 lakh crore. However, we believe that the right policy response along with liquidity assistance by RBI can prevent a crisis.

6,2019-03-07,Zee,"The strategic stake sale of Zee Entertainment Enterprises will likely be at a premium and may not see any management change post sale, said CLSA.

The foreign brokerage has retained a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 670 as the stock is trading at a 15 per cent discount to 10-year average valuations. 

Zee’s stock has rallied nearly 50 per cent since the January 2019 lows due to a potential strategic stake sale by promoters which will help the Essel Group deleverage. 

""This rally will also reduce the risk of further invocation of pledges by lenders and will help promoters sell a lower stake. Further, a blue sky for minority shareholders would be no change in Zee’s core management team and arm’s length business dealing with new partner,"" said CLSA. 

In a scenario that promoters would look to repay at least 80 per cent of Rs 13,500 crore loan against shares via the strategic stake sale, Essel Group will have to sell at least 20 per cent stake in Zee, said CLSA. However, given that a premium is likely, in case transaction takes place at 20 per cent premium to current market price, promoters could pay off entire loan against shares by selling 25 per cent stake in Zee, it added."

8,2019-03-09,Zee,"Last week, the world’s largest private residential ship docked in Mumbai. Called ‘The World’, it has 165 luxury residences on board, owned by wealthy businessmen from across the world. The owners often spend a part of the year on the ship and others can book the residences during the remaining period. Only housekeeping comes free on the ship run by a Florida-based company flying the flag of The Bahamas.

Of the 165 residences, some are owned by Indian-origin businessmen. The ship travels across the world — the route decided after a vote among the residents — and offers entertainment, sports and a choice of half-a-dozen restaurants. This year, the ship made four stops in India before sailing for Oman. A businessperson, who recently attended a dinner onboard the cruise ship, says there was a palpable interest among the residents about India as a manufacturing hub, and some said they were already buying more from India than from China.


 The Nikkei Purchasing Manager’s Index that indicates the degree of confidence in the manufacturing sector also signals a revival in factory output in India. For February, the PMI was at 54.3 — a 14-month high. It has been going up for three months now.

Not only manufacturing PMI but services PMI too along with overall business confidence index have moved up in the last three months. Predictions are that the indices will go higher as the country enters poll season.

But the question is: can India’s private sector make the most of these tailwinds? And is it in a position to do so? Will this lead to fresh capital investments?

Consider the impact of a significant drop in GDP growth rate. Economic growth for the current financial year touched a six-quarter low of 6.6% in the September-December period, dropping from 8.2% in April-June and 7.1% in July-September.

Ajit Ranade, chief economist at the Aditya Birla Group, told ET Magazine that he is seeing signs of revival of the capital expenditure cycle of companies in India but there are some drags such as a slowdown in China. Businessmen are adept at making the most of a chequered field but only if their businesses are fighting fit. Many marquee names of India Inc are in no shape to start big investments.




Rise & Fall with TidesA crackdown by the Reserve Bank of India on loan defaulters has virtually changed the face of India Inc.

Consider Essar steel, Reliance Communications, Electrosteel Steels, Bhushan Steel and Jaypee Group. All are facing action at the National Company Law Tribunal. ArcelorMittal is also set to take over Essar Steel. Or take Jet Airways, the one-time leader in Indian aviation which is now unable to manage its debt burden of `8,000 crore and contemplating a change in management. Around 23 of its aircraft — nearly a fifth of its fleet — have been grounded by lessors. Or consider Vedanta and its problems with its copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu and its iron ore mining operations in Goa.


 The Chinese slowdown Ranade points to, for instance, may open up opportunities for Indian companies, it is also creating its own share of problems. Some Indian businesses were running on the back of the Chinese boom too.

Tata Motors’ scrip price rose and has now slipped as the performance of JLR, its subsidiary that accounts for the bulk of the automaker’s valuation, has slackened. In market capitalisation, Tata Motors tops the list of the Nifty companies with the biggest drops in the last two years.

R Gopalakrishnan, a former director of Tata Sons and author of several management books since retirement, says the problems of India Inc began with a period of hubris and misjudgment, where meaningless league tables of the ‘richest’ and the ‘biggest’ were bandied about.

“When the tides rose, every ship rose,” says Gopalakrishnan, recalling a 2012 speech by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where he called for the release of “animal spirits” in business. “If you are on the dance floor, you have to keep tapping your feet. But suddenly, the music stopped and the carpet too was pulled out,” says Gopalakrishnan.


 Industrialist Harsh Goenka calls the decade-ago period as one of “adventurism” and says the action following implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is the best thing to have happened to India’s economy. “No promoter thought he would lose his company and many also created hurdles in the process.” Goenka says he expected capacity utilisation in India’s manufacturing sector to hit 85% by this time. (It is around 75% now, according RBI data). He also says businesses are forced to make capital investments when capacity utilisation touches 85% and expects that time to come by the end of this year.


Domino EffectTo make matters worse, the banking and financial sector saw a series of debacles in 2018. It began with the Letter of Credit scam at Punjab National Bank involving jeweller Nirav Modi followed by a default on debt payments by IL&FS, an infrastructure sector-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC), and ending with a housing finance meltdown towards. This year, Chanda Kochhar was sacked as CEO of ICICI Bank over allegations of misdemeanour.

The IL&FS default brought the country’s entire shadowbanking sector to its knees after other NBFCs faced a bank credit squeeze. As a result, short-term lending by NBFCs and mutual funds to companies whose promoters pledged their shares as security against borrowing came under the scanner. The selling of pledged shares by lenders led to a crash in scrip prices of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) as well as companies of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. To induce stability and bring back confidence in the management Subhash Chandra, promoter of ZEEL, and the Wadhawans, promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, promised to induct strategic equity partners in their companies. There are few business groups in the country today that are ready to invest, except probably Gautam Adani-led Adani Enterprises, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.


 Kolkata-based SREI Group, promoted by brothers Hemant and Sunil Kanoria, had to bear the brunt of the IL&FS crisis. The scrip of SREI Infrastructure tanked in the aftermath of the crisis and the group had to abandon its plan to list its equipment finance subsidiary.

“There is no long-term funding available for infrastructure projects or for other greenfield projects. Going forward, banks will not be in a position to indulge in term-lending,” SREI vice-chairman Sunil Kanoria told ET Magazine.

The tried-and-tested model of banks, flush with saving and current account deposits, funding large infrastructure or capacity addition by companies, has outlived its utility. There is no way to go back. Kanoria says that a new form of funding led by institutions, especially the ones in development finance, has to be developed.

It is a view echoed by Sandeep Upadhyay, MD of Centrum Infrastructure Advisory, an investment banking firm. He feels much of India’s infrastructure funding requirement will have to be catered by the likes of foreign sovereign and pension funds since they are better aligned to the sector’s riskreturn profile. “While many of these long term investment funds are evaluating buying out operational assets in India, there is limited interest to invest in greenfield projects. I guess it may take another year or two for these pension funds to cultivate interest in greenfield opportunities.”

Easy availability of credit in the last decade had led to a model where infrastructure projects were running on 75-80% debt funding. Much of the equity too was also debt money borrowed by the parent entity and infused into projects as equity, effectively increasing the debt component.

IL&FS itself was ticked off recently by accounting firm Grant Thornton that was asked to look into the lender’s books. The problem with highly leveraged financing is that there is little buffer left for miscalculations, and this is what afflicted India’s infrastructure and power sector leading to series of bankruptcies.


Not Full SteamSo if we ask: How is the mood inside India Inc and how many are raring to go and take up new opportunities, there are unlikely to be any straightforward answers.

Mining is a key area that brings in heavy investments. In an earlier interview to ET, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that while allocation of natural resources had become more transparent, his group preferred a state-by-state approach as different states acted differently and their risk profiles varied.

A senior banker, who spoke to ET Magazine on condition of anonymity, agrees about the investment cycle restarting only in the third quarter of 2019-20 after a new government is in place. He said there is a fear psychosis, but the IBC, although imperfect, has brought in a sigh of relief.

There are structural issues too that companies needs to sort out amid the Income Tax department and the Enforcement Directorate coming down hard on corporate irregularities. Recognising this problem, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has been asking its members to sign a model code of conduct and business ethics document.




“Many actions of the government have helped. The Mauritius route of bringing in your own money has been virtually plugged. It has become tougher to do shady deals,” says Piruz Khambatta, chairman of Rasna and chairman of CII’s Western Regional Council. Khambatta is someone looking ahead at the election months. Summer is near, and for soft drink maker Rasna, it is an important season.

But every industrialist ET Magazine spoke to prefers to wait out the elections, and hopes for a “stable government” before taking any major decision.

BK Goenka, chairman of Welspun Group and president of Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, feels bold decisions need time to settle down and businesses too need time to adjust to a new paradigm that excludes overleveraging. “If we get a stable government, the next five years can be golden years.”"

9,2019-03-13,Zee,"Mumbai: The Essel Group has put its mutual fund business on the block in its drive to monetise nonmedia businesses amid concerns over debt repayment, said three persons with direct knowledge of the development.

Srei Mutual Fund Asset Management, Avendus Capital and Lodha Ventures Holdings are currently in the race to acquire Essel Mutual Fund, which has Assets Under Management (AUM) worth about Rs 1,428 crore, in a deal estimated to be valued at around Rs 100 crore.

“The deal talks have reached the final stages and are expected to be concluded over the next few weeks,” said one of the persons mentioned above.

ET’s separate email queries to Lodha Ventures and Avendus Capital remained unanswered till the time of going to press. Spokespersons for Essel Group and Srei Mutual Fund Asset Management declined to comment on the story.

In 2016, Essel Finance Wealth Zone Private Ltd (EFWZ), a whollyowned subsidiary of Essel Finance Management LLP, had acquired the entire shareholding of Essel Finance AMC, formerly Peerless Funds Management Company, and Essel MF Trustee Limited formerly Peerless Trust Management Company.

At the group level, Essel has total debt of Rs 17,174 crore and out of this, Rs 11,466 crore is the infra-related debt. This infra-related debt covers three major verticals -- power transmission, solar and roads (toll and annuity).

On January 31, ET had reported that from non-media business, the company plans to monetise about Rs 20,000 crore over the next 6 months by selling its infrastructure assets.

Promoters of Essel Group are already in talks with multiple companies, including Sony Pictures and Comcast, to sell up to 50% of their holding in Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The Subhash Chandra-promoted group has also started working on a plan to monetise its non-media businesses in order to pare debt.

Apart from repaying its infrastructure-related debt, the company is planning to use the funds raised through asset monetisation to reduce the pledged portion of the promoter shares in Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The promoters had pledged their 59% stake in Zee Entertainment to raise money that served as equity funding for the group’s infrastructurerelated businesses.



Last week, in a separate development, Delta Corp announced entering into an agreement to invest $10 million in Jalesh Cruises Mauritius Ltd, an Essel Group company. This transaction is expected to be completed in one or more tranches, on or before June 30.

According to the regulatory filing by Delta Corp, the investment to be made through its subsidiary Gaussian Software will entitle Gaussian Software to subscribe to 10 million equity shares of the Essel Group’s cruise line business Jalesh. This will, in turn, enable the company to hold 25 per cent stake in the Mauritius company.

Jalesh, promoted by Amit Goenka, is planning to acquire cruise ships and operate cruise services to various destinations in India and the Middle East. As part of the arrangement, Delta Corp has acquired the right to be a preferred partner to manage and operate casinos and gaming centres in the cruise liners that will be operated by Jalesh."

16,2019-03-15,Zee,"Ad rates for political advertising have shot up, doubling in some instances, from those paid by other advertisers as India gets ready to vote in a seven-phase general election that starts on April 11. Leading media buying companies and broadcasters said the 2019 election campaign will set a new record for political ad spending, some pegging it at Rs 4,000 crore, up 40% from the 2014 election. The last day of voting is May 19 with counting scheduled for May 23.

“Pre-election ad rates have increased about 100% compared with other corporate advertisers’ rates,” said Shashi Sinha, chief executive of IPG Mediabrands, which represents Coca-Cola and Amazon among others. “While the BJP and Congress are obviously taking the leading in advertising, regional parties have emerged as heavy spenders too. The spends on election advertising could touch Rs 4,000 crore, with the number of parties and contenders having shot up significantly over the previous election season.”



TV ad rates, especially those of news channels, go up at election time, said Ashish Sehgal, chief growth officer, ad revenue, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE). “The viewership of the news genre goes up almost 18-20% during elections and its mainly male viewership,” he said. “A lot of clients who target male viewers also shift to the news genre. During this period, we will see almost 25-30% increase in ad rates and in some cases may be up to 40%.”

Sehgal said there would be an increase in overall rates and political parties will also have to pay those. He didn’t say if political parties would be charged a premium. ZEE has also launched an election package for sponsors at a premium of over 30%.

On polling, counting and government formation days, viewership surges, Sehgal said. “These are the days when rates also go up to as much as Rs 2 lakh per 10 seconds. It’s like T20, airing all day on a news channel.”

Broadcasters will seek to maximise the opportunity for the biggest news event of the year, said a top ad sales executive at a large TV network. “Similar to the festival season, elections are also big for advertising, which comes every five years,” he said. “Political parties that want to reach mass audiences have to pay up. As they will be advertising for just a month or two, we are charging 20-30% more, compared to our regular clients, who advertise with us for the entire year.” Experts said advertisers across genres will need to cut through increased clutter over next 30-45 days to connect with viewers. “Political parties evidently have very deep pockets,” said Vani Gupta, former marketing director, PepsiCo, and cofounder of Benddit, a platform that provides turnkey sales and marketing solutions. “The challenge is before business houses who are jostling for visibility in the same media. This is when advertisers must deliberately pick new age media to get the attention of their consumers and circumnavigate the conventional roadblocks.”

According to a directive by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) grouping, political parties have to pay in advance for ads. “They have to pay a premium, plus in advance, which is a major advantage for broadcasters,” the executive said.

As per tracking firm Centre for Media Studies, the election exercise as a whole will cost a record Rs 50,000 crore ($7 billion) as more than 8,000 candidates contest 543 seats."

23,2019-03-18,Zee,"MUMBAI: It’s not just telecom, but also TV distribution space where Sunil Bharti Mittal has decided to give a tough fight to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio.

As Ambani’ Jio has taken control of the two largest cable operators – Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks — Mittal has initiated talks with Dish TV, to merge his DTH business, housed under Airtel Digital TV, said two people with direct knowledge of the development.

“The talks are at exploratory stage,” said one of the persons. “Idea is to consolidate operations and give a strong fight to Reliance Jio. Together, Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV will be a giant.” If Mittal succeeds, the combined entity will be the world’s largest TV distribution company with over 38 million subscribers and 61% DTH market share in India.

Replying to an ET query, an Airtel spokesperson said, “As a policy, we do not comment on market speculation.”

A Dish TV spokesperson also said that the company “does not comment on market speculations.”




It was in March last year when Dish TV completed merger of Videocon d2h with itself, kick-starting the consolidation in the Indian DTH space, the only market with six (five pay and one free) DTH players.

Airtel, in the past, had tried to sell its DTH business to Tata Sky, but the two parties couldn’t reach an agreement. Later, in December 2017, Airtel sold 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia, the holding company of Airtel Digital TV, to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million (Rs 2,258 crore), valuing the DTH business at Rs 11,300 crore.

Dish TV’s market cap as of March 15 was at Rs 7,263.75 crore, down from the estimated combined valuation of Rs 17,000 crore at the time of merger last year. Tata Sky’s valuation is estimated between Rs 11,000-12,000 crore.

As per Trai report on DTH market, as of September 2018, Dish TV (combined with Videocon d2h) leads with a 37% market share, followed by Tata Sky (27%) and Airtel Digital TV (24%). As of quarter ended December 31st, 2018, Dish TV had 23.6 million subscribers and it reported operating revenue of Rs 1,517.4 crore, and EBIDTA of Rs 517.6 crore. Dish TV’s average revenue per user was at Rs 200.

Promoters own 60.8% stake in the company, while pledged holdings are worth Rs 3,625 crore.

Airtel Digital TV, meanwhile, had 15 million subscribers as of Q3, FY19. Its revenue from the DTH business was at Rs 1,033 crore, while EBITDA and margins were at Rs 382.6 crore and 37%, respectively, during the quarter.

Airtel Digital TV’s ARPU was higher at Rs 231. Interestingly, earlier this month, Jawahar Goel, CMD at Dish TV, and part of the Essel Group promoter family, was given additional responsibility as editor-in-chief of Zee Media Corp, which houses news channels of the Subhash Chandra-promoted ZEE Group.

Subhash Chandra, Goel’s brother and chairman of Essel Group, is already in talks to sell up to half of promoters’ stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises."

Analyst calls

• Kotak Securities has recommended to buy Engineers India with a target price of Rs 153 as they believe EIL stock is trading at cheap valuation at PER 14x FY 2020 core earnings. EIL management reiterated positive outlook on the domestic order inflows driven by brownfield expansion of refineries, set up & integration of petrochemical plants with existing refineries and greenfield refinery expansion- including Maharashtra Refinery. 

 • Morgan Stanley has upgraded the rating of Kotak Mahindra Bank to overweight and raised the target price to ₹1,600 from Rs 1,365. The key factors, according to Morgan Stanley for the upgrade includes return of pricing power at private banks, partly helped by higher rates in wholesale markets and the funding crisis at NBFCs, improving credit risk situation in the corporate/SME segment. 

 • Reliance Securities has maintained its buy recommendation on ACC with a marginally revised target price of Rs 1,720. The brokerage continues to maintain their positive view on ACC owing to its deep penetration in the rural markets and consistent focus on premium products. 

• Geojit has downgraded the rating of Cadila Healthcare to hold with a revised target price of ₹358 based on 18x FY21E EPS. Highly leveraged balance sheet post Heinz India acquisition, which was funded largely through debt, remain a near term concern. 

• ICICI Securities has downgraded the ratings of Sterlite Technologies to hold and cut the target price to ₹230 per share citing pricing pressure. Some rub-off of steep correction in fibre optic cable prices in China and in other geographies may result in some downward revision of prices when they come to renegotiation, said the brokerage.

35,2019-03-26,Zee,"With regards to Nifty, there will always be these technical levels where you could see some amount of correction happening in the stocks
  
  
  , said Abhimanyu Sofat, VP- Research, IIFL, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


While the global concerns remain, markets seem to have stabilised somewhat but back home, we have seen markets tapering off in last three sessions. Would the markets pick up steam once again?
Whatever has happened globally, net-net it is a positive for India. The inversion of the 10-year bond yield curve in the US, is a repeat of a similar situation in December. After that, we saw a rally happening in India after a period of time. So, I do not think concerns about global recession are too worrying for India per se. 

The only thing that the market has already factored in is what will happen in May in terms of elections. Any development that is drastically different from market expectations could spook the market at this particular juncture. 

Globally, FIIs have been pumping in close to around Rs 38,000-crore odd this year. It clearly shows that the momentum in terms of inflows will continue going forward for FIIs for the coming weeks, if not months. That is likely to sustain the market going forward. In terms of flows on the domestic side also, the market improves. The momentum in terms of SIPs, which had come down a bit over the last couple of months, should also come back to the market. We do not think anything has changed structurally in the last couple of days that will change the overall momentum in terms of the broader market.

With regards to Nifty, there will always be these technical levels where you could see some amount of correction happening in the stocks.


Would you be a buyer in Jet Airways? 
As of now, the answer to your question would be no because the challenge which is there in terms of how to run an airline efficiently still has not been answered by Jet. Except for Interglobe Aviation and to some extent Spice Jet, we have not seen any other airline which has been able to run a very low-cost operation in India. Those structural issues remain and we still do not know who will be the new management. As many questions are still left unanswered, I do not think it is a buy. From a momentum perspective, the stock may go up a bit because of the deal which has happened since some people might have contemplated that Jet would cease to exist. From that perspective, there could be a short-term rally but from a structural long-term perspective, I do not think Jet is a good buy right now, It will be very hard for the airline over next couple of months to show reasonably good profit which can lead to good investors coming and buying Jet Airways.


Is it the time for a relook at DLF?
DLF should do well going forward, considering that on both fronts, we believe their rental portfolio is likely to do pretty well going forward. Going forward with this kind of fundraise which they have done, what companies have been talking about in terms of reducing their debt level significantly and hopefully becoming a zero-debt company, looks quite possible going forward. 

The other thing is there is a complete change in terms of how the real estate market is behaving in India. Earlier you had the prelaunch and then over a period of seven-eight years, builders were trying to postpone giving delivery to take advantage of the appreciation happening. Now with GST, RERA and demonetisation, it is in the interest of the builders to give the property to buyers as soon as possible. DLF is announcing that for the new projects they will sell ready-to- move-in flats and that clearly shows that they will have a decent amount of advantage over other companies in NCR. We are quite positive on DLF going forward.


Have you taken a relook at any of these names -- PFC, REC, NTPC?
We find NTPC quite attractive, considering that the margin of safety is quite decent in the stock and from a dividend yield perspective also it looks quite good to us. Going forward, with the changes which have been announced over last couple of weeks, we expect that the some of the challenges that the power sector may be mitigated. Some of the power plants were not getting adequate fuel as they had some issues with regards to financing. Those kind of issues would get sorted out and as a result, for a person who has a defensive kind of a mindset but wants to be in equities, NTPC looks quite a decent stock to own.

ET Now: Considering midcaps have seen a fair amount of revival as well in this March rally, what within midcaps are you liking and if the markets were to decline, what would be on your buy list?

Abhimanyu Sofat: We like stories like Ipca Labs because we believe that the growth rate will be very good for next two years with a CAGR of close of 23%. The growth in the domestic market would be 1.5x of the industry growth. Second, in international market, a lot of the challenges that they are facing with USFDA would get resolved over next three-four quarters. For that reason, we see a pickup in demand from there as well. This is one of the stocks that we really like. 

The other one that we can look at is a Capcite India because there is a big improvement in demand coming in terms of setting up of a new factories all across India. The entire private sector consumption is picking up and as a result of that, we see private infra capex improving. Capacite valuations also are quite cheap at this particular stage. These are the kind of stocks that right now we are quite bullish on.


In media space, there has been a lot of interest in Zee Entertainment with the strategic stake sale likely to culminate soon. How are you looking at Dish TV and the entire Essel Group of stocks? 
In terms of business, Zee business continues to remain quite robust in terms of ad revenue growth. Subscription growth numbers were quite good for last quarter. Obviously after strategic sale, what kind of synergies that bring in will be key trigger for the stock. 

If one right now is holding the stock, one should continue to hold the stock because they have clearly been gaining market share in the market over some of the other players like Sony. It is a good stock to own within the media space. Our preference within the sector would be a Zee as well as something like a Sun TV, where there is likely to be decent growth going forward."

Board meetings
 Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained its buy recommendation on SRF with a target price of ₹2,315 as pick up in specialty chemical business was a strong earnings kicker for the company. In the long run, the company’s leadership in refrigerant gas and significant capital expenditure in specialty chemicals will drive return ratios and other segments like technical textiles and packaging film to continue to generate strong cash flows, said the brokerage. 

• Emkay has initiated coverage on Capacite Infraprojects with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹288 citing strong growth path with attractive valuation. Besides government reforms such as real estate regulatory authority, the company is well-positioned to gain traction driven by impressive execution track with stable margins, lean balance sheet with healthy return ratios, strong management pedigree and asset-light business model said the brokerage. 

• Elara Capital has maintained its buy rating on TCS with a target price of ₹2,400 as the 19.8% PE premium assigned for TCS based on consensus estimates is inadequate. The brokerage expects the margin gap to widen further over FY20 as it expect TCS to improve operating profit margin by 180 bps year-onyear to 28.8%, even as Infosys sees operating profit margin erode by 100 bps year-on-year to 24.2%, said the brokerage. 

• Axis Securities has initiated coverage on Chalet Hotels with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹410. Chalet stems from its unique positioning and efficient asset management strategy such as the industry is coming out of a 10-year lull and we find it prudent to back asset owners in an upcycle – superior operating profit case in point, said the brokerage. 

• Edelweiss has maintained its buy rating on DLF with a target price of ₹237. DLF has successfully completed a qualified institutional placement of ₹3,170 crore involving an issuance of 173 mn shares at ₹183.4 apiece. This paves the way for the balance fund infusion of ₹2,250 crore by promoters as well as conversion of debentures/warrants worth the entire ₹11,250 crore into equity shares, said the brokerage.

Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained its hold rating on Coal India with a target price of Rs 243 as e-auction premium will dip given the inventory buildup in the upcoming summer months. Coal India’s shipments in FY19 surpassed the 600MT mark for the first time ever; the 4.7% YoY increase was broadly in line with our expectation, says brokerage. 

• Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on Godrej Agrovet with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹610 as the company is riding on the back of crop protection and the palm oil business. The diverse nature of of the company’s various businesses de-risks its operations, enabling it to focus on growth, optimise capital efficiency and to maintain its competitive advantage, said the brokerage. 

 • IIFL has maintained its reduce rating on United Spirits with a target price of ₹540 citing moderate sales growth in January-march 2014 quarter. Our industry checks suggest that United Spirits would witness 5% sales growth in 4Q, as the key markets of Maharashtra, Karnataka and UP face demand headwinds, said the brokerage. 

 • ICICI Securities has maintained its buy rating on Kaveri with a target price of ₹598. We note Kaveri has created strong value over the past decade and we remain positive on the medium-term growth outlook, said the brokerage. It expects the company to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 7.6% and 9.4%, respectively over FY18-FY21. 

 • Emkay has maintained its buy rating on Kajaria Ceramics with a target price of ₹628. We expect 12% volume CAGR in FY18-21E and expect OPM to improve to 16.7%/17.2% in FY20/21E vs. 15.4% in FY19E, said the brokerage. Gas prices have come down by 12% in Q4FY19, which should help in margin expansion, it added. 

 • Kotak Securities has initiated coverage on Welspun Corp with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹161, valuing stock at 4.5 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA. Given its strong manufacturing and execution capabilities, strong order backlog coupled with robust bids in the pipeline, we believe, Welspun is better placed compared to its peers, to take advantage of renewed pipe demand globally and in the domestic market, said the brokerage.

Source: Edelweiss Alternative Research"
9,2019-04-03,Zee,"Sony Corp’s bid to buy Subhash Chandra-controlled Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has been derailed on differences over valuation, pushing a rival consortium of US cable major Comcast to the forefront, four persons familiar with the development told ET. Comcast owns NBC Universal, while its partner for the bid, Atairos, is a $4-billion investment company led by former Comcast chief financial officer Michael Angelakis.

Last month, Sony submitted a non-binding term sheet and was seen as a stronger contender, but differences over valuation and structuring scuppered the deal. Sony, sources said, had initially offered a merger of its existing operations with ZEE but was even open to a cash buyout. On February 19, ET was first to report that Sony, Comcast-Atairos and Apple are the contenders Chandra engaged with seriously. Apple is still in the fray but has been lukewarm in its response and is yet to come back with a firm offer.

“It’s pens down for Sony. Zee’s brinkmanship is coming in between and the delta of valuation differences is becoming too much to bridge, among other issues,” said an official who is directly involved. Comcast is believed to be open to incumbent promoters staying on as junior partner with a call option to buy them out entirely in future. A Sony India spokesperson said the company has “no comment at this time.”


TURNING AROUND?
After falling 26% on January 25, the ZEE stock has recovered 35% to close at Rs 418 on Tuesday Moreover, Chandra had also bought time from his lenders, including mutual funds and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), till September to sell assets and repay debt after Zee group shares plunged. The funds will now amend the debenture trust deeds to allow this. The share plunge sparked fears his lenders will start offloading pledged shares as there has been a drop in the underlying security cover.

The promoters have also been selling shares worth Rs 332 crore in recent months to bring down their stake by 3%. According to exchange disclosures, promoter entity Cyquator Media Services relinquished Rs 227 crore of shares between February 13 and March 29, while Essel Corporation sold shares worth Rs 105 crore during March 13-25. Post the share sale, the stake of Cyquator Media Services reduced to 22.8% from 23.36%, while Essel Corporation’s shareholding went down to 3.04% from 3.28%.

The current promoter holding in ZEE is about 36% and market cap Rs 40,157.10 crore. “The rise in Zee stock price will not only reduce risk of further invocation of shares by lenders, but will also help promoters sell a lower part of current 39% holding in Zee to payback the Rs 13,500 crore of loans against shares at the group level,” analysts at CLSA said in a recent note.

Another official added that Sony was demanding exclusivity for bilateral negotiations which Zee promoters were not keen on resulting in a deadlock. Morgan Stanley has been advising Sony. Replying to an ET query, a ZEE spokesperson said it does not comment on any speculation. “ZEE’s stake sale process is in steady progress and in line with the previously communicated timelines. The company is in a steady dialogue with all potential prospective partners. Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage, due to the confidentiality agreements.” In November, Chandra announced he was in the process of selling part of his stake in his crown jewel to deleverage the group’s balance sheet.

A potential deal with Zee — which has 66 television channels across 171 countries — was a big opportunity to scale up for any global media giant looking to expand operations in India. Zee has also entered the over the top space with Zee5. Sony, on the other hand, runs the SonyLiv digital platform, which competes with Netflix, Amazon Prime and Fox’s Hotstar.

Sony’s Indian subsidiary Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) recently started aggressive expansion into different genres.

The $84-billion Comcast, led by Brian Roberts, has been a serial buyer and seller of media assets since the late 1980s.

Kotak Institutional Equities analysts predicted two probable scenarios and upside for investors in both. “Promoters sell less than 25% and retain operating control. Extent of upside hinges on quality of the strategic investor and related party disclosures going forward (if applicable) to comfort minority on arms-length dealings. The other scenario is promoters relinquish control, which triggers an open offer at a significant premium to market price,” they said in a recent note."

Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal are considering competing bids for a stake in a troubled Indian television network, people with knowledge of the matter said, as their telecom carriers race for content in the world’s second-biggest mobile market.

Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. has started due diligence of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and is expected to make a formal proposal soon, one of the people said, asking not to be identified citing confidentiality. Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is also considering a bid, the people said. Deliberations are preliminary and may not lead to a transaction, they said.

A representative for Zee said the company doesn’t comment on speculation though it is in “steady dialogue” with potential partners. Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment.

A successful deal would help the winning bidder add a slew of video services in the scramble for user revenue as the government prepares to auction 5G airwaves this year. Some of the world’s largest telecommunications companies including AT&T Inc., Vodafone Group Plc and KDDI Corp. have been buying film and television production and cable TV assets to bolster earnings as subscribers level off.

Bidding for such assets has accelerated as entertainment providers themselves gather content to offer programming via the Internet and compete with upstarts like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime service.

Zee, the heavily-indebted broadcaster controlled by former rice trader-turned-media mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking a strategic investor to help fend off competition from Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of local TV channels vying to tap India’s booming demand for content.

Zee, which boasts 1.3 billion viewers across 173 countries through its 78 channels and 4,800 movie titles, has previously attracted interest from Sony Corp. and Comcast Corp. but hasn’t found a buyer yet. The television network has offered to sell half of the controlling family’s shares, of which 59 percent is pledged as collateral to lenders.

Jio stormed the market in 2016 with free calls and cheap data and forced some rivals to retreat or merge. Bharti, once No. 1, has been relegated to second position after Vodafone’s local unit combined with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular.


War Chest
While Bharti has been adding some digital services to its portfolio, such as apps for e-books and music, its scale hasn’t matched Jio, which already offers a bouquet of services including Saavn, a music app, television, news and movies.

In February, Bharti revealed plans to raise as much as 320 billion rupees ($4.6 billion) from a rights issue and bond sales to build a war chest as competition with Jio intensifies. Last year, Bharti entered into a content deal with Zee for exclusive videos on Airtel applications.

In a January interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos to Bloomberg Quint, Mittal said Airtel will have to provide subscribers content from the likes of Zee, Netflix and Amazon to get them to use more data and boost revenue.

18,2019-04-05,Zee,"MUMBAI: Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has announced launch of one of the world’s largest quiz program titled ‘Mind Wars’ for school students across India.

To be hosted on a multi-platform ecosystem, Mind Wars will be a quiz contest providing a comprehensive knowledge acceleration program for students from grade 6th to 10th.

The company aims to leverage its multimedia presence to build a property that will span across both, digital and TV and reach out to over 1 crore students from 40,000 schools across 200+ cities of India.

“We at ZEE Entertainment are focused on offering open platforms to our audience that they can benefit from in the long term. With the launch of a thoughtfully curated program Mind Wars, we aim to create the largest knowledge database that students can access throughout the year,” said Punit Misra, CEO - Domestic Broadcast Business at ZEE. “It is our attempt to gamify knowledge and to create knowledge-based alternatives for entertainment for kids in their formative years.”

The launch event in Delhi was followed by a quiz competition for 100+ schools from the capital city, with the quizmaster Kunal Savarkar, CEO, Xpress Minds Edutainment.

Savarkar has also come on board as a consultant to ZEE for this initiative.

“For years, my partner Seema Chari and I wondered how we could get millions of students to become a part of knowledge and quizzing revolution. A chance meeting with the management at ZEE resulted in the creation of this knowledge juggernaut. Thanks to the whole-hearted support of ZEE, our small step is turning into a giant leap.” Savarkar said.

Mind Wars will host a database of more than 10,000 questions across the three content buckets – curriculum, general knowledge and current affairs. While the level of questions is for grade 6th to 10th, the platform will also be developed for higher age groups in its advanced stages.

Mind Wars will offer an open platform for school kids to benchmark them against their peers on a national scale using multi-platform testing formats. The knowledge series will be conducted first by online qualifiers, which will be held online on the ZEE5 app and website. This will be followed by city finale, which will be held across 200+ cities and towns resulting in 200+ winning school teams who will be crowned as ‘City Champions’. Later, state finale will be held across 32 Indian States and Union Territories resulting in 32 winning school teams who will be crowned as ‘State Champions’ finally culminating into national finale, where state champions will compete on national television for the title of Mind Wars Champions India 2019."
17,2019-04-05,Zee,"India’s equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty are like twin sisters gone separate ways – the former is a people’s choice and the latter traders’ favourite. 

It remains a never-ending debate whether Sensex represents the economy better or Nifty. It resurfaced earlier this week, after the 30-share Sensex delivered 17.30 per cent return for the just-ended financial year to outpace the 50-share Nifty’s 14.93 per cent.

This is the second straight financial year that the BSE benchmark managed to be ahead. Prior to this, Nifty outperformed Sensex in 2015-16 and 2016-17. In last 10 financial years, each has managed to outpace the other in five.

In terms of absolute return, long-term data shows both the indices climbed 73 per cent in last five financial years. However, Sensex rallied 277 per cent in last 10, and Nifty 265 per cent.

From Nifty’s base date of November 3, 1995 till April 2 this year, it has advanced 1,064 per cent, while Sensex has grown 1,020 per cent. 


What’s in it for market participants?
Sensex is now around 3.3 times Nifty, having climbed to 38,672 on March 29, 2019 from 32,967 on March 28, 2018. Nifty has moved to 11,623 from 10,113 in the same period.

A rally in the stocks that are common constituents of both indices – Bajaj Finance (up 71 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 54 per cent), Axis Bank (up 52 per cent), ICICI Bank (up 43 per cent) and Tata Consultancy Services (up 40 per cent) – mainly supported them in 2018-19. 

Similarly, a fall in the shares of Tata Motors (down 47 per cent), Vedanta (down 34 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (down 28 per cent) put pressure on both. 

Two other stocks, Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 31 per cent) and Eicher Motors (down 27.50 per cent), proved a drag on Nifty, which Sensex survived as the two are not part of it. Nifty also suffered due to subdued performance of Zee Entertainment (down 23 per cent) and Grasim Industries (down 18.36 per cent) – stocks not part of Sensex.

“Out of the 20 Nifty stocks that are not part of Sensex, 10 fell badly. They belonged to two major segments: oil and gas PSUs and two-wheelers,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory.

This was attributed to volatility in crude oil prices, a slowdown in two-wheeler sales and issues related to share pledging. Other individual stocks suffered due to a generally weak business outlook. “That being the case Nifty’s underperformance may not change significantly in the short term,” Chokkalingam said.


So, which index to follow? 
Sensex, which came into being in 1979, long enjoyed its monopoly as India’s heartbeat index and became synonymous with the domestic equity market till Nifty’s arrival in 1995. The latter gradually won investors’ allegience as NSE’s pioneering futures and options market grew popular and allowed investors to bet on the index. This also helped Nifty gain global acceptance by becoming a true proxy play on Indian equity.

There are claims that most people in the market today follow Nifty, instead of Sensex, as the former represents larger number of industries. “Nifty is widely tracked as it contains 50 stocks. It is a broader index compared with Sensex and gives a better view of the economy,” said AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets. 

The 50-share index accounted for about 54 per cent of the asset under management of India-focussed ETFs at Rs 1,13,827 crore as of February-end 2019, data provided by NSE Indices showed.

BSE MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan recently said Sensex is a picture of changing India and will continue to remain so in the time to come. 

Sensex completed four decades of existence last week. “Over the last 40 years, it has given CAGR of over 17 per cent which is the highest returns for any asset class in India,” Chauhan said.

He insisted his index is a true reflection of India’s growth over all these years. “It is the symbol of India’s aspirations and will continue to guide future generations as it has done in the past. It has incorporated new industries like IT, pharma and banking over these 40 years and shed industries that didn’t do well,” he said.

Mukesh Agarwal, CEO of NSE Indices, says Nifty50’s total return index has delivered 15.8 per cent in last 10 years, which he claims is in alignment with India's nominal GDP growth during the same period at 13 per cent CAGR (FY09 - 19E). This, he claims, validates the fact that the equity market returns are aligned with the long-term income growth trajectory of the economy.

Veteran Dalal Street money manager Saurabh Mukherjea trashes both the indices, saying they are no longer a proxy for India’s economic growth. 

Mukherjea, who recently founded alternative asset management firm Marcellus Investment Managers, says India’s GDP growth (in nominal terms) has averaged at 13 per cent in last 10 year, while Nifty’s annual earnings expansion has been 8 per cent.

He says the increasing disconnect suggests key drivers of the Indian economy have gone missing from the listed space."

22,2019-04-10,Zee,"Investors in some fixed maturity plans ( FMP) of Kotak Mutual Fund that mature between April 8 and May end, will not get their full redemption amount back on maturity. This is because of the delay in recovering money that the schemes have invested in the non-convertible debentures (NCD) of two of Essel group companies, namely Edisons Utility Works Pvt Ltd and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd. When the scheme matures, investors will get redemption proceeds minus the holding in Zee group companies. The balance will come to them as and when the fund house recovers the money from the companies, Kotak AMC said.

 Kotak Mutual Fund has as many as eight FMPs maturing between April 8 and May. In seven of these schemes they will get more than their principal invested, barring one scheme which will pay 0.6 per cent less than the principal invested .

Kotak Mutual Fund holds paper worth Rs 360 crore in two companies of Essel group namely Edisons Utility Works Pvt Ltd and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd.

The fund house has a cover of 1.4 times against these borrowings. The NCDs are backed by equity shares of Zee Entertainment , but on January 26, most of the lenders and mutual funds who had lent money to the Essel group had agreed to not sell the shares to recover the money if there is any default. Lenders have granted time till around September 2019 by which time they expect the company to make a stake sale and pay all its dues. As and when this money comes back from the Essel Group, Kotak Mutual Fund will repay its unitholders. Kotak Mutual Fund will not have to create a side pocket since this is a fixed maturity plan ( FMP) and no fresh money will flow into this scheme."
30,2019-04-11,Zee,"Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund on Thursday defended its move to hold up part of the money in some maturing fixed maturity plans (FMP), as the cash is held up in its exposure to the debt-stressed Zee Group.

The fund house said there are seven other fund houses which are stuck in the Zee Group’s debt crisis. The mutual fund industry has a debt exposure of around Rs 7,000 crore to the Zee Group, said Lakshmi Iyer, Head of Fixed Income at Kotak AMC. 

“The ballpark figure for total outstanding debt is in the region of Rs 13,500 crore. Mutual fund holding in a combination of open-ended and close-ended schemes put together is at close to Rs 7,000 crore,” she told ETNow.

The debt crisis in the Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Group returned to haunt the domestic mutual fund industry after Kotak Mutual Fund announced a delay in full redemption in as many as six of its fixed maturity plans and HDFC Mutual Fund, the country’s largest, said it would roll over one of its FMPs, which is coming up for redemption on April 15.

Investors in six FMPs of Kotak Mutual Fund maturing between April 8 and May end will not be able to redeem all their units due to a delay in recovering money lent by the schemes to two Essel Group companies, Edisons Utility Works and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures, the fund house said on Wednesday.

Industry watchers say more fund houses holding Zee Group debt and facing redemption deadline in the next three months could delay payment. This is the first time investors in FMPs are not getting paid the full amount on maturity and it reflects the crisis facing some of the country’s leading companies saddled with debt and unable to refinance on easier terms due to liquidity pressures.

Of the total Zee Group exposure of the mutual fund industry, around Rs 1,500 crore is in FMPs and the rest in open-ended debt mutual fund schemes. Kotak and HDFC Mutual Fund hold most of the debt in FMPs. It holds Zee shares as collateral against this exposure. 

The fund houses hold collateral in the form of shares of Zee Entertainment. Its shares suffered a severe beating in January leading to breach of top-up covenants. But most fund houses, including Kotak and HDFC, decided against selling shares to recover money and agreed to a stand-still agreement with Zee/ Essel promoters till September 30.

Fund houses have told investors that the promoters of the companies would sell stakes in key companies including Zee Entertainment and repay debt for which they had sought six months.

Iyer said the decision to give time to Zee was in investor interest. “We had the choice to invoke the shares and realise the entire money back for investors. That could have been a possibility. It would not have made headlines, but it may not have protected the interests of unit holders as one would not be 100 per cent certain how much of it I could have recovered from the sale of shares,” she said.

Kotak and HDFC Mutual Fund will not have to create a side pocket since this is a fixed maturity plan (FMP) and no fresh money will flow into this scheme.

Two FMPs of Kotak have matured and the company has returned the principal with some return, minus the exposure to the Zee group. Iyer said the portion of Zee exposure has been retained and will be returned to investors in principal plus accrued interest on or before September 30.

Zee Group has asked for some time allowance to sell the company’s stake, and some part of that money will come to the promoters in the proportion they hold, Iyer said. 

“Of that proceeds, debt will be repaid to us, that is the Rs 13,500 crore of debt that I am talking about. Our share in that is a very small portion, less than 2.5 per cent,” she said.

Zee has time till September 30. “We do not intend to keep anything with us. We have given a time allowance of September 30 and we are very happy to give the money back much before that if that happens,” Iyer said."
32,2019-04-11,Zee,"The Essel group Thursday affirmed its commitment to repay each debtor, a day after two leading mutual funds delayed repayment commitments to investors on their exposure to the Subhash Chandra-led group. 

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company (AMC) and HDFC AMC had Wednesday admitted to redemption pressures in their select fixed income schemes and sought more time for payouts. The fund houses have an exposure of around Rs 8,000 crore to various debt instruments of the group led by Birla Sun Life AMC and HDFC AMC. 

While Kotak Mahindra AMC has reportedly informed the investors of its six schemes that it may not be able to redeem the entire amounts in multiple schemes, while HDFC AMC has rolled over one of its schemes by as many as 380 days. 

""As per the arrangement with the lenders, a resolution for the repayment will be achieved by September 2019. The Essel group is confident to complete the repayment towards each and every lender,"" the group said in a statement late Thursday. 

""We remain committed to achieve the resolution by the mentioned timeline, with a sole objective of saving the loss of public money and the repayment of each and every lender,"" the statement added. 

It can be noted that while going public with his financial troubles, group chairman Chandra had late January assured that he would repay lenders in full. 

Chandra is looking to sell his stake in the group's flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises to repay lenders after borrowings for diversification went awry by halving his stake to 22 percent. 

Most lending by AMCs is against promoter-holdings in Zee, which had seen massive corrections since late January which led to a situation where the lenders should have asked for additional security or sold their holdings. 

To prevent further value erosion, the lenders took the unprecedented, and also controversial, step of giving additional time till September for Zee to sell-off the stake and repay the over Rs 8,000 crore owed to them. 

Media reports said many players like Reliance, Amazon and even Apple among others are reportedly interested in Zee as Chandra is ready to halve his holding to around 22 percent in the group. 

Without naming any group, Chandra had alleged a particular entity is trying to sabotage his plans."

Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee group’s has already affected debt investors of Kotak Mutual Fund, as the money manager has delayed the full redemption of its FMPs. Now, HDFC Mutual Fund has decided to rollover one of its fixed maturity plans that is coming up for redemption on April 15.

According to reports, HDFC FMP 1168D MF scheme is extended by the company by 380 days. 

The mutual fund industry has a debt exposure of Rs 7,500 crore to the Zee or Essel Group. Of this, around Rs 1,500 crore is in fixed maturity plans with the rest in open-ended debt mutual fund schemes. Kotak and HDFC Mutual Fund hold most of the debt in fixed maturity plans.

Last October’s non-banking financial sector crisis sparked by the collapse of IL&FS led to serious liquidity crisis with many firms unable to roll over and refinance short-term debt. Shares of firms with high debt and finance companies with high proportion of short-term debt were hammered on the bourses. The Essel Group’s private unlisted infrastructure companies were among those unable to raise debt and this affected Zee Entertainment shares which collapsed.

29,2019-04-11,Zee,"As the stake sale plan of the struggling Essel group making no headway even after two months, two leading mutual fund houses--Kotak Mahindra AMC and HDFC AMC--Wednesday admitted to redemption pressures in their select fixed income schemes and sought more time for payouts.

Kotak Mahindra AMC has reportedly informed its investors that it may not be able to redeem the entire amounts in multiple schemes, while HDFC AMC has ""rolled over"" one of its schemes by as many as 380 days.

It can be noted that late January, mutual funds and other lenders having an exposure of Rs 13,000 crore to the Essel group, had given time till September for the Subash Chandra-controlled group to complete a planned stake sale in the flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises before they get the payments.

Media reports said many players like Reliance, Amazon and even Apple among others are reportedly interested in Zee as Chandra is ready to halve his holding to around 22 percent in the group.

Most lending by AMCs is against promoter-holdings in Zee, which had seen massive corrections since later January which led to a situation where the lenders should have asked for additional security or sold their holdings.

In a statement, Kotak Mahindra group spokesman Rohit Rao Wednesday said their AMC's three-year fixed maturity plan scheme, which matures in April-May 2019, had invested in non- convertible debentures of Essel group companies--Edisons Utility Works, and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures, etc.

""We are working closely with the Essel group for optimal recovery from Konti & Edisons for the benefit of our unit-holders as we believe such recovery will take place albeit with some delay,"" he said.

In a note to investors, Kotak AMC said ""realization from said investments (in NCDs), will be shared proportionately with the unitholders subsequently"".

""We are working for optimal recovery from Konti and Edisons for the benefit of our unitholders and are hopeful that such recovery will happen albeit with delay,"" the fund house added.

Kotak has an exposure of Rs 372 crore to the Essel group, in a list led by Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC which has over Rs 2,588 crore at stake.

Meanwhile, HDFC Asset Management Company, the second in the list with a Rs 1,152-crore exposure has also announced a roll-over of/extension to its fixed maturity plan scheme 1168D, due on April 15, by 380 days.

""The purpose of rollover/extension is due to the current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning, the yields prevailing in the short maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock in their investments at the current prevailing yields,"" HDFC AMC said Wednesday.

It can be recalled that fund houses' unprecedented move to give Essel group promoter Subhash Chandra the time till September had led to widespread concerns over the sanctity of loan contracts.

Fund houses had justified the move saying this is in the best interest of investors, and that deeming it a default might lead to a steep fall in prices and erode the collateral value, resulting in sub-optimal recovery."

We will have to wait and watch for what the company decides to do with the troubled schemes,” says Puneet Oberoi, Founder, Excellent Investment Adviors. “To begin with, the AMC should come up with the details of the schemes hit and come clear to the investors about their plan,"" he adds.

Kotak Mahindra issued this cryptic statement to ETMutualFunds.com.

“The 3- year FMP scheme, which matures in April-May 2019, has invested in debt securities, money market instruments and government securities. Amongst other investments, the scheme also invested in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued by Edisons Utility Works Pvt Ltd and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd (both are Essel Group companies – secured by equity shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited) and IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (Credit Enhancement by Parent Support Agreement of IL&FS). The three firms are facing headwinds due to company and sectoral-specific issues. We are working closely with the Essel Group for optimal recovery from Konti & Edisons for the benefit of our unit holders and believe that such recovery will take place albeit with some delay. For IL&FS Transportation Networks, Kotak Mutual Fund has made a 100% provision for this investment as the company has been classified in the Red category where recovery is uncertain and will be dependent on the resolution plan achieved by the new board / NCLT.”

Some mutual fund advisors say the development is not entirely a surprise. They were anticipating it since mutual fund houses have collectively decided to give time till September to the beleaguered Zee Group. According to them, many FMPs would falter in the coming six months.

“This was known but not spoken. Mutual funds had given an extension till September, 2019 to the Essel Group and if there is no improvement in the papers till then, we might see many more FMPs faltering,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan, Founder, Prakala Wealth Management. “HDFC Mutual Fund has decided to roll over the hit FMPs by one year but Kotak's strategy is still unknown,” he adds.

Mutual fund advisors believe that absence of clear communication from mutual fund houses is adding to investors’ confusion. “It is definitely an alarming situation as we haven't seen such an event hitting FMPs. However, there is very little that investors or advisors can do at this point. We haven't received any communication about the AMC's plan to resolve the issue as of now, so things are not clear on that front. On the data side, most FMPs that are under threat have an exposure ranging between 5-15 per cent, so that part can default,” says says Ankur Maheshwari, CEO - Equirus Wealth.

Mutual fund advisors ask investors to wait and watch the scenario as there is not many options available to them to salvage the situation at this point. “Investors don't have a lot of things in their hands at this point so they should just wait and watch. Also, I believe that there might be maximum 10 per cent hit in these schemes,” says Chokkalingam Palaniappan, Founder, Prakala Wealth Management.

Ankur Maheshwari also shares the same advice: “Since it is an FMP, investors can't decide to exit. Right now, we will have to look at what Kotak as an AMC plans to do about the entire situations. This is also a drill for other mutual fund houses that might face similar issues in the coming time if the situation with Essel Group doesn't get better, he says."

27,2019-04-11,Zee,"I am not certain that markets can convincingly say the next PM will definitely be Narendra Modi and there will 
  
  
  be continuity, said Dipan Mehta, Founder Director, Elixir Equities, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


Bharti Airtel, along with Warburg Pincus and Singtel, is aiming to buy nearly 61% stake in Dish TV. They have also got a war chest to take on Rel Jio. How do you see this story shaping up?
Whatever the outcome, the consumers will certainly benefit. From a shareholder point of view, it does not make sense to invest in the telecom sector. A bloodbath is still underway. The pricing discipline is a long way away and these companies need to keep on investing in maintaining and upgrading their networks. There is also 5G, which may come into play 18-24 months down the line. In any case, the industry is working on absolutely low return on capital employed.

 Keeping all these factors in mind, it is best to completely avoid the telecom sector. You may have trading rallies from time to time, because of a decent quarter or a market share gain for one or more of the listed companies, but on the whole this is not a sector which is going to create or deliver superior returns to investors going forward. It will be great for consumers but from a shareholder or investor point of view, this sector is a complete avoid. 


For a shareholder what do you have as an option? Latest news is all the FMPs and mutual funds which lent to the Zee Group have got impacted. What should one do now? Book your loss and get out?
We are watching Zee Entertainment very closely and there is just this one event about the entry of a strategic investor. Once there is clarity about who that investor will be and exactly how the company will be managed and how the roles will be shared, you could see revival in the stock price of Zee Entertainment. 

Given the scale of business, the size of the opportunity, the success of their OTT venture and the levels at which the stock is trading at, it certainly is at a very attractive level in terms of price to earnings multiples and risk-returns. 

Once this uncertainty is over and done with and whenever this announcement is made about a stake sale by the promoter, you will see a nice trading bounce. But even at those levels, it may make sense to buy into Zee Entertainment because whoever is going to come in will certainly bring a lot on the table and will add value to the business going forward.

In any case, it is a professionally-run company and there are few such brands and businesses available at these valuations. One needs to watch Zee Entertainment very closely and if you have a little bit of risk appetite, at every correction like this, whenever there is some adverse news, one could look at buying into it and trying to average lower going forward and then maybe increase the holdings once the strategic investor’s name the plan is going forward is known. I am quite positive, not only on the sector as a whole but Zee in particular. 


The elections are here. Do you think the market is stepping into this big event a little bit light and what we have seen in March, may not replicate this month?
If the markets were to remain at these levels, I would say we are entering the election verdict on a bit of a high and that is not always the best case scenario. You want to get into an event with the market correcting so that in case of any adverse news, the fallout is restricted. 

As of now, the NDA victory has been priced into the market and any disappointment could lead to a selloff. I am not particularly happy with the trends that we have seen. Investors are coming into buy at corrections. It could be foreign portfolio investors or domestic investors and the risk- return ratio does not favour investment at this point of time because we have a major event and I am not certain that markets can convincingly say that the next PM will definitely be Narendra Modi and there will be continuity. 

You could easily see a prolonged period of political uncertainty and that could hamper the sentiment in the economy and stocks as well. The view has to be a bit cautious at this point of time. Whichever way the results go, there will be opportunities to buy into stocks at corrections and with a margin of safety.


You only buy after 23rd of May?
Absolutely. We also have an earning season coming up and typically there is a lot of stock-related volatility when earnings are announced and that could also provide opportunities. There will be so much of news flow over the next six weeks or so and for an investor who is more or less fully invested with only 10-15% in cash, it is better to wait and watch and buy once all the uncertainty is out of the way. 

I would say it is better to err on the side of caution then get extremely excited and assume that we will have political certainty and buy on that basis. If something else were to be the outcome, then the effect could be quite severe and then one would have missed the opportunity to buy stocks at a more steeper correction. 


What is the view on the auto sector? What is your outlook on two-wheelers and four-wheelers within auto?
Bad quarterly numbers not just for March but also for June quarter is a given. Not only will you have lower volumes and lower revenue growth, but you will also have negative operating leverage coming into play. That will pressurise the operating profit margins as well. 

There’s a need to brace for big disappointment as far as the auto company results are concerned but these companies are great long-term structural stories and they are available at reasonable valuations at this point of time. If an investor can look beyond six to 12 months or so and buy into these companies, then it is a perfect contrarian play as well and you could easily see the likes of Maruti, Eicher or even TVS Motors up at least double from this price in the three to four years or so. 

At some point of time. the auto volume sales will certainly revive, pent up demand will come into play and as we are seeing, interest rates are also coming down that will trigger more auto sales maybe a few months down the line. Now that insurance- related issues are behind the industry, in three to six months, you will certainly see a revival in auto sales. The base effect will also come into play. Then there is BS-VI also. There could be some buying before the implementation of BS-VI. 

The worst seems to be over for the auto industry in terms of performance as well as stock price and investors could look at opportunities to get into the auto industry. These are great businesses with very high return on investment and companies like Maruti have a very dominant market share and companies like Eicher Motors have a fantastic position within the sector. I would be positively inclined towards the auto industry but look for revival in monthly volumes before taking the plunge.


When and if that correction were to come, what would you buy? Do you buy some more HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries or do you hunt for new earnings?
The overall theme for 2019 will be softer interest rates and we have seen two interest rate cuts and maybe some more also along the way. Once you are convinced that there is political certainty or uncertainty and that gets priced in, then the best stocks to buy would be the interest sensitive stocks starting with the banks and NBFCs. Then you could look at automobile shares. You could look at even real estate and to some extent capital goods because we are definitely seeing an uptick in the capex cycle. 

As far as engineering construction companies are concerned, irrespective of whichever government comes into power, they will continue to give a lot of importance to infrastructure and there is a great demand to create various infrastructure projects. These are the broader themes that one could look at. 

Maybe one could go a little bit easy on consumption because we have the monsoon risk as well and that certainly will impact consumption at various levels -- be it FMCG, appliances, even certain segments of the auto industry. 

It is going to be extremely tricky. In 2019, one needs to navigate through all these scenarios and be a bit cautious. One should go for safer stocks, defensive stocks and not get too ambitious and expect significantly higher return at least for the first half of this year or so. Consider getting more into small, midcap stocks only once the monsoon outcome is known and where the interest rate scenario is and what the global set up is. It is going to be a difficult year. 2018 also has been difficult and my sense is most of 2019 also will be quite tricky from investment perspective. 


The massive buyback in Wipro is coming in. What exactly is your outlook in terms of the overall valuations and how much of a positive sentiment could we see on the back of this buyback?
You see a trading rally based on this news and a kind of floor will be set as far as Wipro stock price is concerned. Going forward, is it going to be a growth-oriented stock? Can it deliver that 15-20% type of compounded returns over three to five years on a longer-term basis? The answer to that is certainly no and that is true for most IT companies -- largecap as well as midcap. 

The underlying industry growth rates are at best, low double digit or maybe high single digit and with the global economy slowing down, they could face headwinds over there. While you will not lose too much money in the sense that IT companies and Wipro in particular will not be great value destroyers, but from this point on, they would be great value creators as well. So, you could have them in part of your portfolio for just trying to protect the capital, IT may not be able to deliver the higher returns. 

In India, if you have lower interest rates, many businesses start to look very attractive. I would be favouring domestic focussed businesses rather than companies like IT at this point of time. There could be a few outliers and you could have a trading bounce in a few select companies which could be a TCS or an Infosys where the earnings momentum is higher than the overall industry, a few select midcap IT companies which have a slightly differentiated business model like say Tata Elxsi or L&T Technology Services or maybe Intellect Design which is more IP oriented. These companies could outperform the sector as a whole and still deliver decent returns. 

Broadly one needs to be careful in software, be extremely selective and look for companies which can have a sustainable high mid-teens or high mid-teens type of earnings trajectory at least for the next one or two years or so."
24,2019-04-11,Zee,"The ripples from the Subhash Chandra-promoted Zee Group’s debt crisis has hit debt investors in some of the country’s leading mutual fund houses with Kotak Mutual Fund delaying full redemption in six of its fixed maturity plans (FMPs). HDFC Mutual Fund, the country’s largest, also announced plans to roll over one of its FMPs that is coming up for redemption on April 15.

Investors in six FMPs of Kotak Mutual Fund maturing between April 8 and May end will not be able to redeem all their units due to delay in recovering money lent by the schemes to two Essel Group companies, Edisons Utility Works Pvt Ltd and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd. Essel Group is owned by Subhash Chandra and comprises private unlisted companies such as Edisons and listed firms such as Zee Entertainment and Dish TV.

More fund houses holding Zee Group debt and facing redemption deadline in the next three months could delay payment, experts said. This is the first time investors in fixed maturity plans are not getting paid the full amount on maturity and reflects the crisis facing some of the country’s leading companies saddled with debt and unable to refinance on easier terms due to liquidity pressures.

Kotak said on Wednesday that investors will get maturity amount minus the value of holding in Essel Group. The balance will come to them as and when the fund house recovers the money from the companies, Kotak AMC said.





EXPOSURE OF Rs 7,500 CRORE
“Essel promoters are working for a resolution through a strategic sale of Zee in a time-bound manner,” Kotak Mutual Fund said in a statement. “The above resolution is likely to be achieved by September 30, 2019 as per communication from Essel promoters. Any realisation from said investments will be shared proportionately with the unit holders subsequently.”

The three firms are facing headwinds due to company and sectoral-specific issues, the statement added. “We are working closely with the Essel Group for optimal recovery from Konti and Edisons for the benefit of our unitholders and believe that such recovery will take place, albeit with some delay.”

HDFC has filed for a rollover, according to a notice from the fund house. “Given the current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning, the yields prevailing in the short maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock in their investments at the current prevailing yields,” the notice said. A spokesperson for HDFC Mutual Fund refused to elaborate.

Kotak and HDFC Mutual Fund will not have to create a side pocket since this is a fixed maturity plan (FMP) and no fresh money will flow into this scheme. “FMP investors have to wait and hope the problem resolves. The probability of the problem resolving is high and you may get your total money and also interest for this period,” says Manoj Nagpal, CEO, Outlook Asia Capital.




A ‘side pocket’ option allows a fund house to separate bad or risky assets from other liquid investments in a debt portfolio which could get impacted by the credit profile of underlying instruments. This creates two schemes — one containing the illiquid paper and the other holding the good ones.

“As per the previously issued official communication, Essel Group has reached at an arrangement with the lenders with a resolution time frame of September 2019. The lenders have unanimously extended support to the group and the same has positively resulted in saving the loss of public money. The arrangement with the lenders has also given the group the required time to realise the right value from the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd…,” an Essel group spokesperson said.

The mutual fund industry has a debt exposure of Rs 7,500 crore to the Zee/Essel Group. Of this, around Rs 1,500 crore is in fixed maturity plans with the rest in open-ended debt mutual fund schemes. Kotak and HDFC Mutual Fund hold most of the debt in fixed maturity plans.

The fund houses hold collateral in the form of shares of Zee Entertainment. Its shares suffered a severe fall in January leading to breach of top-up covenants. But most fund houses, including Kotak and HDFC, decided against selling shares to recover money and agreed to a standstill agreement with Zee/Essel promoters till September 2019. The investors were promised that the promoters would sell stakes in key companies including Zee Entertainment and repay debt for which they had sought six months.

This private deal was severely criticised by industry watchers and corporate governance experts who said that breach of covenant should have immediately led to sale of pledged shares in the market. But the mutual funds had argued that such panic sale would have further collapsed value without giving anything tangible in return.

Last October’s non-banking financial sector crisis sparked by the collapse of Infrastructure Lending and Financial Services (IL&FS) led to serious liquidity crisis with many firms unable to roll over and refinance short-term debt. Shares of firms with high debt and finance companies with high proportion of shortterm debt were hammered on the bourses. The Essel Group’s private unlisted infrastructure companies were among those unable to raise debt and this affected Zee Entertainment shares which collapsed."
23,2019-04-11,Zee,"KOLKATA | NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Singapore Telecommunications, Bharti Airtel and Warburg Pincus are in talks to initially buy the near-61% stake of Zee founder Subhash Chandra’s family in Dish TV, to be followed by an open offer for 26% more, as the Sunil Mittal-led telco tries to bolster its digital TV and home broadband play to fight Jio, people familiar with the matter said.

Thereafter, Bharti Airtel’s digital TV business, housed under Bharti Telemedia, is likely to be hived off and combined with the listed Dish TV through a reverse merger, the people said.

If the deal happens, it will offer much-needed liquidity to the Zee Group promoters, who have pledged 82.05% of their holding in Dish TV and 59% of their stake in Zee Entertainment to lenders. Subhash Chandra is also in talks to sell a substantial stake in Zee Entertainment. The Essel Group’s total debt stands at Rs 17,174 crore, which includes debt of private unlisted companies as well as the listed ones.




“The negotiations (for Dish TV) are around the valuations, with an expected offer at over Rs 50 a share for the promoter stake,” said one of the people mentioned earlier. “Due diligence is on, and the deal is expected to be completed in two months.”

At Rs 50 a share for the 87% stake, including the open offer, the effective payout for the consortium could be roughly $1.15 billion (nearly Rs 8,000 crore).


CONSORTIUM WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON DISH TV’S DEBT
In addition, the Singtel-Bharti Airtel-Warburg Pincus consortium would need to take on Dish TV’s debt, which stood at Rs 3,154 crore (around $451 million) as on March 31, 2018. However,SBICap Securities estimates the debt to have increased to $600 million by December end.

Shares of Dish TV India closed at Rs 37.45, down just over 1%, on the BSE on Wednesday, giving it a market capitalisation of Rs 6,895.50 crore. The Airtel scrip ended 3.3% lower at Rs 340.05.

The shareholding of the three-member consortium in the final merged entity will be more than the maximum 75% promoter stake permitted in a listed company, and the entity will have one year to reduce this holding to the permissible limit.

In response to ET’s queries, Bharti Airtel and Singtel said they don’t comment on rumours and speculation. Warburg Pincus and Dish TV had not replied as of press time.

Bulk of the investments are likely to be made by Singtel and Warburg Pincus to prevent any serious drag on Bharti Airtel’s debt-heavy balance sheet, one of the people said. But Airtel is still likely to end up with a sizeable holding in the merged entity by virtue of its 80% stake in Bharti Telemedia, in which Warburg Pincus holds the balance 20%.

The deal would be Airtel’s reply to rival Jio’s attempts at bolstering its digital TV services and home broadband offerings by buying Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks. Both companies are trying to hook consumers with a triple play of mobile phones, TV distribution and home broadband.

If the Airtel-Dish TV deal fructifies, the combined entity will be the world’s largest TV distribution company with over 38 million subscribers and 61% share of India’s DTH market. In comparison, Jio, after acquiring majority stakes in Hathway and DEN, controls 24 million cable-connected homes of these two companies across 750 cities. This is around 35% of India’s estimated cable industry base of 70 million.

Analysts said since Bharti’s DTH business is urban-centric, it is particularly vulnerable to churn as Jio is widely expected to target metros and 80-to-100-odd top tier-I and II markets once it launches fibre-based superfast home broadband services.

Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities, pegs the “equity valuation of the Dish TV-Bharti Telemedia combined entity at roughly $3.5 billion” and believes there is a strong strategic rationale for Bharti to buy Dish TV.

“A potential merger with Dish would allow Bharti to remain a large player in the digital TV market and optimally hedge its risks, in that, even if it loses subscribers in the urban markets to Jio, it could reduce overall vulnerabilities with Dish TV in the bag as the latter has a high rural sub-base,” Sharma told ET."

The current market price of Zee Entertainment Enterprises is Rs 414.30.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Zee Entertainment Enterprises price can reach the defined target. 


View of the brokerage: We highlight that Zee’s premium valuation has been driven by industry leading ad and subscription growth – a function of viewership market share expansion, which currently is clouded by NTO led disruption. We also believe that NTO implementation, apart from providing consumers a choice, has led to higher power in DPO’s hands in bundling channels. Zee’s absence in base bouquet could be detrimental. Consequent, to revenue estimates, we revise our FY20 earnings downwards by 10.7 per cent. Therefore, we downgrade the stock to HOLD. We introduce FY21 estimates and roll over our valuations, valuing it at 20x FY21E P/E (vs. 25x FY20E) to arrive at a target price of Rs 410."

  money on account of the delay in repayment by the two Essel group companies — Konti and Edison – which are backed by security of shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. This is the first time after 2008 where investors in FMPs — a debt product with a lock-in – are not getting repaid in full on maturity. ET spoke to Nilesh Shah, managing director, and Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer (debt) and head (products) at Kotak Mutual Fund. Edited excerpts:


Banks don’t fund promoters against their shares, while NBFC funding is shrinking. Will mutual funds too be reluctant to do this kind of loan against shares especially after critics have commented mutual funds saying they are behaving more like lenders than investors…


Nilesh Shah: Till today in the 25 plus years history of debt mutual funds, there is no incidence of a mutual fund losing money in loan against share (LAS). Now in an instrument where mutual funds have never lost money, just because there is one restructuring, should mutual fund stop investing? We have to manage risk to generate return. The entrepreneurs of India need risk capital. This was provided by NBFCs to a great extent, insurance companies to some extent and by mutual funds to a much lesser extent. In CY19, there has been five pre-payments or repayments by promoters of companies like Emami, Apollo Hospitals, Bajaj Corporation, Future Retail and Bharat Forge. No doubt we have to learn from the current event and improve our process to safeguard investor interest.


Critics believe, fund houses agreeing to give time to Zee promoters to repay till September 30 is not a good precedence?

Nilesh: This is not a precedence. In last quarter itself, we have taken full prepayment on breach of margin requirement in one of the investments. In the case of Essel Group look at the sequence of events that has happened. On 25th of January, share price of Zee collapsed from Rs 434 to Rs 319. It happened because some lenders sold zee shares on margin call for a small amount. The sharp correction of more than 25 % happened as market was pricing panic selling by other lenders whose margin call got triggered after the crash. 

There was a collective exposure of ~ Rs 13,500 crore by mutual funds, NBFCs and offshore lenders against shares of Zee Entertainment, Dish TV and Essel Infra. Lenders had two choices, either invoke the pledge, sell the shares and recover whatever is there or extend the timeline and give promoter ability to do a strategic stake sale to repay dues in full. We felt that by selling the shares we would have recovered substantially lower money than our dues and converted notional loss to actual loss. 

If we had exercised the option of selling the shares of Zee along with other lenders and realised lower money than our dues then we would have been asked why we sold shares cheap for the benefit of the buyers rather than wait for the strategic sell process and recover full dues. We firmly believe that our unit holders are better protected in terms of recovery of dues with this extension as strategic stake sale normally fetches higher price than market price.


Shouldn’t fund managers consider the quantum of pledge by promoters while valuing a security?

Nilesh: There is certainly learning for us from the Zee episode. Now when we are doing such deals, we are putting caps on how much promoters can borrow in both absolute and/or relative terms through share pledging. This cap is put to ensure that even if the stock price falls by 50-60%, the promoter will have the ability to provide security for margin and doesn’t become overleveraged to repay or get refinance from the market.


In the Zee Episode, don’t you think the rating agencies could have done more since they waited long to downgrade the paper?

Lakshmi: In our opinion the rating agencies have done a fair job. Post IL&FS, they have become extra careful on the rating side. In Zee case, the lenders have provided allowance of time for repayment of dues. There has been a downgrade in the rating by one notch to reflect the current situation which we believe is appropriate.


Do you have the power to change the terms of agreement, like extend it by six months etc…?

Lakshmi: It is very much part of the prerogative of the lender. This change is approved by a majority of lenders to Essel Group Cos, which vouches its appropriateness.


What is your Plan B, if the stake sale deal doesn’t go as planned?

Nilesh: We are reasonably sure about Plan A as we are better secured and better rewarded compared to what we were on Jan 26, 2019. We have taken personal guarantee from promoters as additional security over and above the existing security of Zee shares to safeguard our unit holders’ interest. We have also received a graded upside sharing contingent upon strategic stake sale in Essel Group Cos over and above 11.1% coupon which will be paid up to the repayment. The entire proceeds received from the interest and upside sharing is for the benefit of our unit holders. In case Plan A doesn’t work out by Sept 30, 2019, then we retain the option of selling the shares, enforcing personal guarantee and recovering our dues.


If there is reluctance from fund houses to lend to promoters, do you expect the inter-corporate deposit (ICD) market to get bigger?

Nilesh: I think it is extremely unlikely. The ICD market is unregulated. While it thrived for a while in the pre-2000 era, it ultimately resulted in far bigger defaults. The process of giving loans to promoters against shares being followed by MFs will improve, fund houses will take more precautions. We will demand higher security as well as capping of leverage. Please also remember that we can’t view all the loans against shares from the same point of view. Some of the promoters pledge their shares for institutional borrowings by their companies.


Will the returns of debt mutual funds go down because fund managers will take lower risk due to this episode?

Nilesh: Our job is to optimise riskadjusted return. Debt funds can be broadly classified based on the risk they take. There are funds which manage credit risk to generate return. A minor portion of our assets are in credit risk category. Our total exposure to Zee is less than 0.38% of total debt portfolio. There are funds which manage interest rate risk to generate return. Majority of our money is in funds which manages interest rate risk to generate return.


There are NCDs offering as much as 9-10% returns to investors, while EPFO is also giving 8.65%. Debt funds have been returning lower than this…

Lakshmi: The EPFO invests up to 15% in equities and locks in investors for a long period of time. The debentures that offer 9-10 % now is almost similar to the yield we have on our credit risk funds. Our portfolio quality is more diversified and has higher credit rating.

36,2019-04-15,Zee,"The problem of loan defaults has now begun to affect fixed maturity plans. ET Wealth delves into the issue in order to explain to investors what it means for them.


What is the problem with FMPs?
Some mutual fund companies which had lent to Zee (Essel) Group entities are holding back payments due to investors in their fixed maturity plans (FMP). Several FMPs that are due for maturity are not able to repay the entire amount. This is because of the delay in recovery from the Zee Group. 

Investors in six FMPs of Kotak MF will not be able to redeem the entire maturity value. HDFC Mutual Fund has also informed investors its plan to extend the tenure for one of its FMPs coming up for maturity by another year.


Is my money lost or will it be recovered later?
Investors in affected FMPs of Kotak MF will receive part payment of maturity proceeds for now. They will get the amount equivalent to the value of the other holdings in the FMP (maturity amount minus value of holdings in Zee Group). The remaining amount may be paid if and when the fund house recovers the money from the companies. 

In case of the HDFC MF FMP maturing on 15 April, investors can either agree to extension in maturity date or exit on the prevailing maturity date. For investors who exit, units will be redeemed at applicable NAV on existing maturity date. They will get the amount minus the value of holdings in Zee. Investors who agree to extending maturity date may recover the entire amount, provided the entities repay the debt.


Are all FMPs in trouble?
Apart from Kotak MF and HDFC MF, several other fund companies have exposure to debt instruments of the Zee Group. Of the total exposure of Rs 7,500 crore to the troubled entities, around Rs 1,400 crore is held by FMPs. Most of the FMPs with exposure to Zee Group are from the stables of Kotak MF, HDFC MF, Aditya Birla Sun Life MF and Reliance MF. 

FMPs coming up for maturity are likely to either roll over the maturity date or delay payments to investors. In some schemes, exposure to Zee Group entities is as high as 20% of the scheme corpus. Investors in these schemes will take a hit.

Why are MFs not recovering the money?
Fund houses had lent to the Zee Group entities against the collateral of shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises. When lending against pledged shares, MFs typically enter into covenants with the borrower (issuer of the debt instruments). The issuer agrees to pledge shares worth up to 1.5-2 times the loan value. If there is a sharp drop in price of the shares, the MFs typically ask the borrower to top up the pledged shares to cover the shortfall in margin. If not, they can recover the money by selling the pledged shares. 

In this case, however, most fund houses have not invoked the covenants despite a fall in share price of Zee. They have entered into a standstill agreement with the group promoter till September 2019. By this time, the promoter has promised to sell stake in a few key group companies and repay the debt. Until then, the fund houses have agreed not to invoke the pledge. This is to prevent further drop in share price and avoid hurting sale prospects.

What can I do now?
Investors in closed-ended FMPs cannot exit during the tenure of the scheme. While these are listed on exchanges and are, therefore, tradeable, the trading volumes are very poor. This limits the investor’s ability to exit the scheme at a fair price. 

When faced with default, if the fund house is offering to extend the scheme maturity date, it is better to agree to the rollover. It gives the investor a chance to get back the full amount on maturity. If not, the investor will have to take a haircut on the maturity proceeds. If the fund house is part-paying on maturity, investors have no option but to wait for the fund house to recover the remaining amount.


Does this make FMPs a bad investment?
No, it doesn’t. But it should remind investors of the credit risk prevalent in FMPs, just like any other debt fund. While FMPs do not carry interest rate risk unlike open-ended debt funds, they do carry default risk. If the credit profile of the scheme portfolio is poor, there is a chance of default in some securities. 

Do not blindly invest in an FMP based on any indicative yield suggested by the distributor or adviser either. Higher yield comes at the cost of low-rated or poor quality securities. Being a closed-ended fund, there is no way investors get to know what companies the FMP will invest in at the time of investing. At best, investors may opt for FMPs offered by pedigreed fund houses with a proven track record in managing debt funds."
37,2019-04-16,Zee,"Want to beat the Nifty 50’s returns over the next 12 months? Go contrarian. That’s what the one-year forward Bloomberg consensus target prices of Nifty 50 companies suggest.

According to the consensus, the Nifty will gain 7.2 per cent in a year — is one of the highest anticipated return among major global markets. The quirky part, however, is the stocks that are expected to gain more than 10 per cent have been underperformers over the past six months. These include ONGC, Hindalco, Mahindra & Mahindra, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Zee Entertainment. In addition, the stocks including Reliance Industries, UltraTech, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Bajaj Finserv, which have largely driven the current rally, seem to have reached full potential.




Barring L&T, the other four stocks, which are likely to offer the highest upsides, failed to generate returns in the past six months while the Nifty rose 11.2 per cent during the same period. ONGC has the highest likely upside of 28 per cent in the next 12 months.

Among the index heavyweights, HDFC Bank, ITC, Hindustan Unilever and ICICI, which together have 24 per cent weight in the Nifty, offer an upside of 10.4-12.6 per cent over the next one year.

The top 10 stocks, which have 20 per cent weight in the Nifty, earned 19.7 per cent return in the past six months pushing the index to record levels. Among them, eight stocks now trade above their consensus target prices. Wipro has the maximum downside of 10 per cent followed by Bajaj Auto (8.6 per cent downside) and Bajaj Finserv (10.1 per cent downside) over the next 12 months."

39,2019-04-18,Zee,"MUMBAI: Despite an impressive 21% increase in viewership of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the first two weeks, data suggests news channels are likely to be a more forceful and cost-effective bet this election season for the advertisers looking for a mass reach. 

BARC viewership data sourced from a subscriber showed IPL’s cumulative reach in the 15+ year demographic at 276.4 million (42.5%) in All India and 171.7 million (38.6%) in the Hindi speaking markets (HSM), respectively across 23 Star India channels.

In comparison, the top 20 news channels (five Hindi, three English and top 12 regional language channels) registered a cumulative reach of 291.4 million (44.8%) for All India and 209.2 million (47.1%) for the HSM, respectively. Reach is total number of individuals who viewed the event for at least one minute. The time considered for news channels was between 7 pm and midnight.

While advertising rates for the IPL are at a record Rs 10 lakh per 10-second slot, the same spot on news channels costs a fraction of the amount, which opens up a potential for advertisers, media experts feel.

“News channels are a very costeffective medium during elections,” said Ashish Sehgal, chief growth officer, advertising revenue at Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

“Especially during the general elections, we have seen very high level of engagement, as well as reach and frequency. Also, the audience for IPL and news channels is more or less similar with a high skew towards male viewers.” Sehgal, who also looks after the sales for ZEE Group's news channels, added that news as a genre is still underpriced, making it a “lucrative option” for the advertisers.

A back-of-the envelop calculation suggests that if an advertiser puts the same money on top 20 news channels, the gross impressions (or ratings) generated will be around 41% higher for All India market than the IPL.

While IPL has an advantage of being an annual property that has become a part of marketing budgets of many companies, news channels, have not been able to cash in on elections in comparison to the yield one gets in IPL, Sehgal said.

However, some experts also feel that when it comes to engagement, IPL still is unparalleled.

LV Krishnan, CEO, TAM Media Research, said, “Given the election news presently, there could be some days or limited period of time bands that could have cumulative reach of news channels on a higher level. But, in terms of continuity (time spent) of viewing in a single session, IPL easily scores over news."

Only that adverse events over the past few months are giving small investors an experience contrary to that punch line, thus threatening to throw away those industry gains.

India’s asset management industry came in news last week after two fund houses informed debt investors that they will not be able to clear full maturity amount of maturing fixed maturity plans (FMP) on time due to a debt exposure to the Essel Group, a debt-stressed business group to whom fund houses have granted extra time till September 30, 2019 to repay. 

Participants in two polls conducted by ETMarkets.com on web and social media showed investors felt being taken for a ride by fund houses, whose mandate was to safeguard investor money and grow it.

Some 82 per cent of the respondents felt money managers took investors for granted in entering debt deals with promoter group firms in recent months. 


Do you think #mutualfund houses took investors for granted in entering debt deals with promoter group firms in recent years?&mdash; ETMarkets (@ETMarkets) 1555044866000

Kotak Mutual Fund last week informed its investors that it would not be able to redeem the entire amounts in as many as seven fixed maturity plans (FPMs), two of which matured last week. HDFC Mutual Fund, India’s largest by asset size, offered investors to “roll over” one of its schemes by as many as 380 days.

Both fund houses have exposure to Essel group companies Edisons Utility Works and Konti Infrapower and Multiventures, which have defaulted in debt repayment.

Late January, mutual funds and other lenders having a total exposure of Rs 13,000 crore to the Essel group had given the business group time till September to complete a planned stake sale in the flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises to be able to clear the payments.

In September 2018, liquid funds took a hit after IL&FS group companies defaulted on debt repayment, leading to rating downgrade.

Tarun Birani, Founder & CEO, TBNG Capital Advisors said mutual fund managers should avoid excessive risk to chase return, which can potentially damage investor confidence in the industry.

He said debt fund management needs to pay great attention to risk and liquidity management by avoiding excessive concentration in single promoter and should manage liquidity through tight structures in favour of investors.

In the second survey conducted in the last week of March, 86 per cent of respondents felt Indian fund managers are becoming more of sales managers.


Do you think Indian fund managers are also becoming sales managers?&mdash; ETMarkets (@ETMarkets) 1553588357000
Rachit Chawla, Founder and CEO of independent investment management firm Finway, said mutual funds take annual maintenance charges ranging from 0.5 to 3 per cent from investors to manage their money well.

“It is their responsibility to invest wisely and maintain enough liquidity. Mutual funds went overboard in giving loans to firms through opaque structures. Promoters have used those money to fund other interests, buy assets abroad or plough it back into the stock market,” he alleged.

Chawla said risks around structured lending have gone due to the growth in size of debt mutual fund assets. 

“Fund managers did not put to use good risk management practices or analyses. They took away investors’ money and easily gave it away without due risk management or diversification,” he said."
43,2019-04-22,Zee,"Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra told ET he’s confident of being able to meet the September 30 deadline on repaying lenders. He said Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has five suitors — from India to Japan, Europe and the US. “You might get surprised with the names,” he said in the first interview after his letter to stakeholders acknowledging commercial missteps in the wake of the January stock collapse. He also said that Essel will repay every rupee of the group’s Rs 17,174-crore debt. Edited excerpts:


What is the progress on the stake sale in ZEE? Will it happen within the September 30 deadline agreed upon by the lenders?
When we started the process, Goldman Sachs and LionTree presented the case to about 12-14 suitors in December 2018. From those, we have come down to two potential players. But apart from those two, we now have three new players who have joined the dialogues, who have approached us directly without routing it through the bankers. Big names have been doing the rounds, but at this stage I will not be confirming or denying any names. Now from these five shortlisted players, I sincerely believe that by end of April or first week of May, we should get non-binding term sheets.


‘Not Averse to any Financial Investor’

Lenders have given us time till September 30, and I’m confident that the deal should very well happen by then. Our core objective is to come out clean from this by repaying everyone’s money and that too happily.


Why are these players keen on ZEE?Every shortlisted player has a different reason to deal with us. But the common thread is that all of them want to have a direct access to 1.4 billion people.

Some value our expertise in creating great content at reasonable cost, not just in Indian languages but even in foreign languages, while somebody wants to know more about and enter the Indian market. For them, there is no better platform than ZEE to get deeper insights into Indian people.

Some want to marry content with ecommerce. Everyone has different and unique reasons to get into the deal. Some wish to take complete control, some are fine with 50%, and some are even fine with lesser stake. I hope there is a good and healthy competitive tension between the final two, since that will only yield a higher value.


Do you also have any criteria of your own for selection of the prospective buyer?
Our desire is definitely to choose someone for values rather than for valuations. The player should add value to our stakeholders and help ZEE to grow bigger, globally—a suitor who values India and Indian traditions will certainly be chosen and more so the one who is pure in the overall business approach, without any vested interests.


From the five shortlisted players, are all international, or are there any domestic ones also?
The shortlisted ones range from Japan to India to Europe to the US – including West Coast and East Coast. You might get surprised with the names.


Earlier 
you were looking at strategic partners. Now with the changed scenario, are you also looking at financial investors?
Today, even the PE firms are getting very aggressive. Let’s see how this shapes up. Like I said, our objective is to arrive at a repayment to all lenders, so it really doesn’t matter, as long as the partner is in to add value to the business. While I will not get into the details at this stage, we are not averse to any financial investor.


Is Sony definitely out?
I would maintain the same stance. One really can’t say anything at this stage.


Which other businesses of the Essel Group are on the block?
In case of infra businesses, we are trying to complete the projects and sell the same to get the right value, post which, Essel Infra will remain as a platform, which has been built having a potential to bid a single tender for Rs 30,000 crore. We will then take a final call if we should sell the platform also or not.

Other non-core businesses like Essel Finance and mutual funds will also be sold. I am also looking at selling some of my private properties. I do not feel any shame in selling properties to help me repay the money.


Is there any possibility that if other businesses are sold, the requirement of selling the ZEE stake might not be felt?
No. Even if the other businesses do generate a good sum, we will need to sell some stake in ZEE to be able to cover the debts.


You said people are interested in buying over 50% stake. How flexible are you on this as of now?
It all depends on the respective business preferences of the shortlisted players. It is (more) complicated than it seems and we will collectively arrive at a decision which is best suited for the company and for its stakeholders.


A lot has been written about Essel Group’s current financial situation. How do you see these concerns?
A lot of businesses are under stress across the nation, but I feel Essel Group is different from others. Irrespective of whatever is being written about our companies since January 25 – when the stocks fell – we are not reacting to it. In reality, business is running as usual with the operating companies continuing to show exceptional performance. At ZEE we continue to give double-digit growth and there is no stress. A few projects in the infrastructure business surely faced hindrances. But we have built strong businesses and not taken any favours from any political party.

My sons — Punit and Amit — are performing much better than I used to, which is the biggest gratification for me as a father and founder. Also, our focus continues to be on creating value for our shareholders. So from the outside, you might perceive that the group is under stress, but you speak to our employees, they will vouch for the smooth functioning.


As chairman of the group, how do you plan to steer it out of the current situation?
Over the 90 years of the Essel Group’s journey, this is the third downturn I am seeing — first was in 1967, then in 2008 and now the current one. I firmly believe that because we remained focused, we could overcome from the so-called valleys of death and I am 100% confident that this time also we will emerge as strongly as we did previously.

In the last 50 years alone, we have paid Rs 39,000 crore of interest to the banking system. This was one of the cost items always. Compared to that, the current debt is a much lesser amount.

We have a plan in place. If you look at the sale of assets of our infra business, I believe it will be completed between July and September. With that Rs 15,000-16,000-crore debt of operating companies and Rs 3,000 crore of corporate debt will get cleared off. So overall about Rs 20,000 crore of debt will easily get wiped off. Rest will be taken care of by the stake sale in ZEE.


Is it right to say that it was the debt burden that prompted you to announce intention of selling a stake in ZEE in November 2018?
The basis for the stake sale decision in ZEE was our discussion with a technology company, which showcased its abilities to help us take ZEE to a global level. Of course we were mindful of the debt levels at the promoter level, but addressing that was secondary.

Now let me put it this way. If the IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services) issue would not have happened and the overall NBFC (non-banking finance company) industry wouldn’t have got into the difficult stages, our debt levels probably would have gone unnoticed.

Having said that, we had a clear visibility on the repayment part with our infra and other assets. Also, this doesn’t mean we were stressed as whatever loans against shares we had taken, the same were getting renewed.

However, now is not the time to look at the past and it is important to accept the same. One day suddenly we experienced the drop in the stock price, which nobody could have managed. I am glad that we have by now more or less forgotten those negative forces since we only met positivity after that episode, especially after my open letter and meetings with the lenders.


What prompted you to issue the open letter accepting your commercial mistakes? In hindsight, was it the right move?
On January 25, when our stocks tanked, I, being a Vipassana student, stayed calm in my room and started drafting the letter. The team was surely reluctant, but I said no, I must write what is true and correct. You can accuse me of wrong commercial decisions, but no one can accuse me of keeping someone’s single rupee. People may say anything about me, but I am sure about my commitment and confident to repay each and every lender. That’s why even now I get a sound sleep.


Recently, Kotak AMC blamed exposure to ZEE as the reason for not being able to meet fixed maturity plan (FMP) commitments to investors. Your view?
I am surprised why this Kotak AMC issue came up, despite their confirmation that they will support us till September 2019. They are very much a part of the overall consortium of lenders who have unanimously agreed and have given us time till September. Neither do I understand the reason why that came up, nor do I have any idea about their arrangement with their investors. If they have not paid their investors, I really cannot comment on the same. HDFC on the other hand reinforced the fact that they have earned so much from the group, and if there is a penalty which in case they might face, they will pay it off, valuing our overall business relations. So each banker has a different way of operating. But I will leave it at that.


What do you see as a trend for media, going forward?
Content creation will remain as the basic core for the media business. Content will be platform-agnostic and innovations will continue. Your serials will have some scenes which will have the potential to take you into a virtual reality zone. The screens will become a marketplace eventually, which will have the potential to have ecommerce, medical help, communication, designing, presentations, trial of new clothes onscreen, etc.


What are your views on the merger of Dish TV and Airtel Digital TV?
Dish TV is run by my brother Jawahar. I will not comment on the same.


Any thoughts on the group’s future?
We will speak on the future once the deal is done and lenders are paid in full."

51,2019-04-24,Zee,"By Andy Mukherjee

The grounding of Jet Airways India Ltd., the country’s oldest private-sector carrier, isn’t just bad news for customers and its 23,000 employees. It raises yet again a question that’s puzzled two successive governments and will continue to bedevil whichever party takes power after elections conclude next month: What’s killing capitalism in India?

Jet was born in the early 1990s, when India’s closed Soviet-style planned economy had just started embracing globalization and private enterprise. Back then, few Indians could afford to fly; now the country has the world’s fastest-growing aviation market. An airline that was at one point the industry’s dominant player should theoretically have been able to thrive.

While Jet’s costs were too high compared with those of its no-frills rivals, that issue could have been fixed. The real problem is that Jet founder Naresh Goyal gambled away a perfectly fine — albeit, unprofitable — airline by not injecting equity himself into the cash-strapped business, or stepping aside in time and allowing someone else to do so.

It’s only natural for entrepreneurs to be possessive and irrational, especially when — like Goyal — they’ve been so wildly successful for so long. The bigger conundrum is why providers of outside capital (banks and capital markets) didn’t act as a disciplining force on Goyal and save the business.


Others

Despite Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC taking a 24 percent stake in the airline in 2013, Jet has been slipping deeper into negative equity for seven years. Had India’s state-run banks insisted on a timely and substantial capital infusion, and had they credibly threatened to dilute Goyal’s 51 percent controlling stake by issuing themselves new shares when the inevitable debt default occurred, Jet would now be flying under a new owner.

When Jet’s rival Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. collapsed in 2012, India didn’t have a modern bankruptcy law. Now it does. Even so, in Jet’s case — or in the high-profile $7 billion insolvency of tycoon Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. — creditors didn’t utilize that option. Instead they foolishly relied on entrenched insiders to make things right, thereby hurting their prospect of extracting value.

Banks are now awaiting a white knight. Yet for a new owner to revive the airline after it has stopped flying will necessarily mean very deep haircuts on its $1 billion of net debt. State-run lenders will lose heavily, as will employees. It’s an unnecessary waste of capital and jobs in a country that doesn’t have enough of either.

So what’s to be done? Private investment in India has been weak for years now, first under a Congress Party-led coalition and then under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. There has been no dearth of new rules in this period. But rules-based capitalism cannot flourish in a business landscape so heavily dominated by insiders, who are regularly tapped by all parties for anonymous political donations.

For real change to occur, electoral financing must be overhauled and market forces strengthened so that company founders, at least in capital-intensive industries, aren’t allowed to hang around and become a risk to viability. 

Almost every large business failure in India today involves providers of outside capital — and their agents — giving insiders a free pass to maintain control using other people’s money, destroying value in the process. These agents aren’t just company boards. In the case of the now-bankrupt infrastructure financier-operator IL&FS Group, it was the auditors and credit rating agencies that led even small pension plans like that of the American Embassy School staff in New Delhi into trouble.

Or consider the problems brewing in India’s mutual funds industry, which lent money to media mogul Subhash Chandra against his shareholding in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., a highly profitable television content business that dates back — once again — to the early days of India’s economic liberalization. When Chandra’s leveraged bets on infrastructure ran into liquidity problems, the mutual funds agreed not to sell the Zee shares they held as collateral.

The fund managers now have the chutzpah to tell investors that the net asset value for their maturing plans isn’t available in full — and won’t be until Chandra can find a buyer for Zee. Even more shockingly, the bilateral loans to Chandra, masquerading as bonds, are still rated A. 

Relationship lending is to be expected in a state-dominated banking system prone to rigging by crony capitalists. But relationship-based fund management? That shows the extent to which even the private sector is compromised. Business “promoters,” as they’re known in Indian law, have used a mix of personality cult and proximity to political power to terrorize the ultimate providers of outside capital.

It’s lamentable that after 14 years as a publicly traded firm, operating in a capital-intensive, price-sensitive, competitive, regulated industry, Jet was still allowed to carry on basically as Goyal’s fief. Let the airline’s avoidable collapse serve as a warning for the next government: Don’t go out of the way to rescue Jet, but do save Indian capitalism from insiders."

54,2019-04-24,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty broke their losing streak of three successive sessions with robust gains on Wednesday, thanks to heightened buying across sectors during the second half.

Analysts were not surprised. “This was expected. We were anticipating a sharp swing on either side ahead of Thursday’s F&O expiry,"" said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

Nirav Chheda, derivatives & technical analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities, attributed it to a positive undercurrent in the market. “The market undercurrent is positive. The losses of last three sessions were because of a rising VIX owing to election-related jitters. Now, the volatility has eased and the market played to the tunes of its underlying positive sentiment,"" he said.

That said, the market is likely to remain choppy till the election results are out, he added. 


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Wednesday's session:

Investors richer by Rs 1.42 lakh croreWednesday's gains shot up the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,53,17,138.47 crore from Rs 1,51,74,915.17 crore on Tuesday, making investors richer by Rs 1.42 lakh crore in a single day.


Stocks that saw spurt in OIWith a 71.28 per cent change, UltraTech Cement led the stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest (OI). It was followed by Siemens (59.64 per cent), Equitas Holdings (54.31 per cent), ONGC (51.81 per cent) and Power Grid Corporation (50.58 per cent). 


UltraTech logs healthy gainsAfter three consecutive sessions of losses, shares of UltraTech Cement closed 5.51 per cent higher at Rs 4,435.45 after its standalone profit for March quarter more than doubled to Rs 1,017 crore from Rs 488 crore a year ago. Standalone net sales jumped 18 per cent YoY to Rs 10,334 crore from Rs 8,750 crore. Domestic sales grew 16 per cent for the quarter. 


Tata Elxsi shares fall on Q4 numbersShares of Tata Elxsi declined 2.06 per cent to close at Rs 930.30 after it reported flattish fourth quarter earnings. The company reported 1.42 per cent growth in March quarter net profit at Rs 71.29 crore against Rs 70.29 crore reported for the same quarter last year. 


Tata Motors extends lossShares of Tata Motors fell for the third day in a row, closing 3.33 per cent down at Rs 223.70. The stock has come off 5.17 per cent in last three sessions. Analysts say while the worst seems to be over for the stock, it may see some volatility. ""It appears the worst for Tata Motors have been priced in. But volatility in the stock is something everyone cannot fancy,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corporate Affairs at IIFL. 


ACC declines 3% on Q1 numbersShares of ACC declined 3.07 per cent to close at Rs 1,606.90 a day after the cement maker reported a 38.19 per cent rise in consolidated March quarter profit at Rs 346.02 crore. Even though the numbers were in line, margins disappointed the Street. HSBC has a 'hold' call on the stock with a reduced price target of Rs 1,650. The brokerage highlighted that the Q1 results were not encouraging as the reported Ebitda came below the expectations. It said that margin expansion failed to play out due to misses on realisations, as well as on costs. 


Indiabulls Real Estate surges 10%Indiabulls Real Estate shares surged 10.23 per cent to close at Rs 116.35 ahead of its quarterly earnings and after the company said it is to sell its London property to its promoter for $258.7 million due to Brexit uncertainty. Post market hours, the company reported a 7 per cent drop in March quarter profit at Rs 1,006 crore.


Coromandel shares riseShares of Coromandel International closed 2.33 per cent up at Rs 436.30, a day after it reported a 22.8 per cent jump in March quarter profit at Rs 110 crore.

1,2019-05-03,Zee,"Share pledge levels of select Indian companies hit new highs in March quarter while many others revoked their pledged shares, showing two different shades of health of India Inc.

Data available on BSE showed the total value of shares pledged by promoters stood at Rs 2.25 lakh crore as of April 26, equalling 1.60 per cent of total market capitalisation of the BSE500 stocks. 

Promoters of as many as 2,932 out of 5,126 BSE-listed companies have pledged shares as collaterals for debt. 

While share pledging is common practice among business entities to raise capital for short-term needs, stock investors track share pledge data keenly as they can give a fair idea if a company is walking on thin ice.

High levels of share pledges by promoters are not considered a good sign, as a plunge in the market can impact the stocks and their shareholders. 

In the past, Indian equity investors have taken big hits when sudden fall in share prices triggered margin calls on pledge shares, leading to steep value erosion.

In a falling market, if a stock falls sharply, it may trigger margin calls. In extreme cases, lenders may even invoke pledges and sell the shares in open market, leading to major value erosion. 

In recent times, there have been such instances involving Zee Entertainment, Reliance Infrastructure and Dish TV. Shares of these companies have declined up to 65 per cent year-to-date till April 26.

Analysts say a rise in share pledging sometimes signals serious trouble for a business and investors need to be wary of it. As many as 129 companies on BSE witnessed a rise in share pledging during March quarter.

Companies like JK Tyre & Industries reported a sharp jump in promoter share pledges, which rose to 28.89 per cent at the end of March from nil at December end. Reliance Capital (96.93 per cent against 74.55 per cent QoQ), Reliance Infra (98.34 per cent against 83.59 per cent) and Dish TV (94.6 per cent against 82.05 per cent) also witnessed major spikes in share pledging during the quarter. 

Among other prominent names Sun Pharma (10.97 per cent), Apollo Hospitals (78.13 per cent) and Ajanta Pharma (15.83 per cent) saw a spike in share pledges by promoters during the quarter. 

Ravileela Granites, Sandur Manganese & Iron Ores, Panth Infinity and Tulip Star Hotels saw share pledging by promoters rise by 36-68 percentage points. 



Analysts say while share pledging should not be a major concern under normal circumstances, and also when share pledge levels are small.

Normally, share pledging rises in tight liquidity conditions in a rising interest rate environment. It becomes problematic in a volatile market, particularly if the stock price crashes. This can then force promoters to increase collaterals to lenders by pledging more shares.

Meanwhile, several companies saw promoters revoke pledged shares during the quarter. They included Jubilant FoodWorks (12.61 per cent against 18.37 per cent QoQ), Coffee Day Enterprises (72.32 per cent against 79.36 per cent), Strides Pharma (16.31 per cent against 28.91 per cent) and Granules India (43.4 per cent against 60.35 per cent)



Some 41 companies including MSP Steel, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, IVRCL, Kwality, Modern Dairies, Reliance Naval and Engineering, Alok Industries, Unity Infraprojects and CG Power had the entire promoter holding pledged as of March 31."

""The stake sale process of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd undertaken by Essel Group, is in steady progress and at an advanced stage,"" Essel Group said in a statement.

The group cannot share any additional details at this stage due to confidentiality agreements, it added.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises had announced in November last year that its promoters, led by Subhash Chandra, planned to sell up to 50 per cent of their equity stake in the company to a strategic partner.

On January 25, Essel group companies had come under massive selling pressure, plummeting up to 33 per cent, and suffered a combined erosion of Rs 13,352 crore in market valuation.

On January 26, Essel group Chairman Chandra said that his company is in a financial mess and has blamed the same for the aggressive bets on infra, which has gone out of control since the IL&FS crisis and also the acquisition of Videocon's D2H business."
11,2019-05-07,Zee,"Mumbai: Two companies led by Anil Ambani feature in a list of publicly traded firms with over 95 percent of their promoter shareholding pledged as of March 2019, says a report.

Zee Entertainment and Dish TV, the companies from the Subhash Chandra-led Essel group, have their promoter pledging 66.2 percent and 94.6 percent of the ownership pledged, respectively and lead the chart.

A report by brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities comes amid issues over pledged shareholding of promoters after the NBFC crisis that began with the defualts of IL&FS last September, where massive share price erosions have led to a slew of unprecedented actions, including the financiers being dragged to courts for taking precautionary measures.

Promoters typically raise money for their other businesses by pledging a part of their holdings in listed entities as a security. The Anil Ambani-led Reliance group and Essel group have had the going tough.

The promoters have pledged 98.3 percent of the holding in Reliance Infrastructure and 96.9 percent in Reliance Capital, the report said.

The report, which is based on an analysis of top 500 listed firms on the BSE, said percentage of pledged promoter holdings by value has come down in the March 2019 quarter in comparison to the preceding December quarter.

The percentage of pledged promoter holdings declined to 2.83 percent in March quarter from 2.98 percent in the December 2018 quarter, it said.

Promoters pledged share outstanding stood at Rs 1.95 lakh crore, which is about 1.38 percent of the market capitalisation of the BSE-500 Index as of March, it said, adding of the top-500, promoters of 116 companies have pledged their shares.

The Ambani group entities RInfra and Reliance Capital are among those where promoters have pledged over 95 percent of their holdings, and have the company of CG Power and Industrial and Sterlite Technologies, it said.

Both the Ambani group entities also feature in the list of entities which saw a highest increase in pledged shares during the quarter, and are joined by JK Tyre, Dish TV and VA Tech Wabag for company.

However, one Anil Ambani-led company, the bankrupt Reliance Communications, has seen a decline in the quantum of shares pledged by the promoters during the quarter, the report said, adding Granules India, Strides Pharma, Coffee Day Enterprises and Bajaj Consumer Care also saw a dip.

From the companies that make the 50-share benchmark Nifty, Zee Entertainment leads with the highest pledge at 66.2 percent, followed by Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel at 46.3 percent and Gautam Adani-led Adani Ports & SEZ at 42.3 percent, says the report."

Outstanding promoters pledged shares were Rs 1.95 lakh crore, which is about 1.38 per cent of the total BSE-500 Index's market capitalisation in March 2019.

Promoters of 116 companies pledged their holdings among BSE-500 Index. Six companies had more than 90 per cent of their promoter holdings pledged.

The report said that pledging of shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoter shares.

6,2019-05-07,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Another week has gone by, but NSE barometer Nifty50 has failed to break past the crucial 11,550-11,850 range.

This range has been intact since March end. If one were to go by history, the month of May in election years has been known for wild market swings, suggesting that the index may send out some directional cues sooner than later. 

For now, the index looks rangebound with seven constituents showing a bearish bias, as suggested by the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bearish crossover – a sign of bearish undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible downsides.








These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Tata Steel, Coal India, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Auto, Titan Company, UPL and Zee Entertainment. Among non-Nifty stocks Indiabulls Real Estate, Bank of Maharashtra, Havells India, Zee Media, SJVN, Gujarat State Petronet, Dr Lal Pathlabs and Motilal Oswal Financial Services are among 29 other stocks sending out weak signals.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed there are 20 stocks, mostly smallcaps, which have been showing bullish trends. The list included Uniply Industries, Raymond, Deepak Nitrate, Birla Corporation, Cimmco, Bhansali Engineering and Mold-Tek Technologies.





The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, its sharp fall on Monday to an extent was led by global weakness. “We need to see how the index reacts around the 11,550 mark. A close below this level may confirm an intermediate top, which may pull the index towards 11,350. If we hold the level, we may see a bounceback to fill Monday’s bearish gap between 11,630 and 117,00 levels,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking. 

The technical analyst advised traders to keep positions light in such volatile conditions and avoid undue risk.

“The recent distribution occurred near the upper end of a triangular pattern, but the index tumbled towards the lower end. As per the number of legs, the triangular pattern seems to be nearing completion. This is a high probability area for the next legup to kick in,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst Sharekhan said on Monday.

On Tuesday, the index traded at 11,640.40, up 42.15 points, or 0.36 per cent at the time of writing this copy. 

Understanding MACD

A close look at the stock chart of UPL shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has shown downward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip closed at Rs 944.40 , down 0.57 per cent on NSE."
5,2019-05-07,Zee,"On any correction over the next few days, one should be buying into HUL, Britannia or for that matter Marico where the growth has been about 7% to 8%. Also Maruti and some of the stocks can be accimulated on dips, said Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


How much more to go for ICICI Bank and can we see a further 15% to 20% push coming in anytime soon?
Post the numbers, the sense that we are getting is that the company is on an upcycle on most parameters, particularly given the strong CASA franchise that they have and the kind of growth that we are seeing on the loan book etc. There is a case for another 10%-12% uptick and one will have to watch over the next couple of quarters how the entire slippages pan out. Broadly speaking, the trajectory for ICICI Bank is positive and the market is looking out for companies which are reasonably valued and where clean-up exercises are almost done and hence a strong franchise. We are extremely positive for a while and post the numbers, we put our target price at about Rs 450 which will give you a 10% uptick from current levels.


My only fear is everyone likes ICICI Bank. Everyone is of the view that ICICI Bank will only go one way. This is a stock where the number of buy calls are the highest in Asia! Some would argue that all the good news is in the price?
What you are saying is that sometimes when there is a consensus, when the company disappoints there could be a major underperformance. But the way we look at this is that it is coming out of extended face of underperformance and clean-up exercise. With the way things are looking for the next two to three years and this kind of a CASA franchise and businesses that they have built around the ICICI franchise, whether it is the securities part or AMC insurance, there is going to be a lot of value attached to that. Also, when your loan book is growing, the scope for disappointment looks much less. I agree that consensus is a buy but given the strong growth visibility that we are seeing, we will continue to remain with consensus.


Do you think the slowdown in autos is going to be a prolonged one or would you say that this is temporary and decision-making has got stalled because of liquidity and election, that demand will come back the way it did in 2014?
Clearly the entire market was extremely positive on auto sector and what we have seen over the last about four to five months in terms of the numbers has been quite disappointing. How long this entire difficult phase is going to last is difficult to say but if you have a decent amount of revival in the economy and in the earnings over the next two to three years, then auto being a leading sector would also participate. 

I do not see a reason why there is not going to be a moderate growth. But the growth expectations that people had for Maruti at about 12-14%, looks extremely challenging but 6-10% growth for Maruti and some of the two-wheeler is possible. 

I do not think there is a case for a substantial lull for companies, given the growth revival that we are looking at. On any significant correction in a stock like Maruti or some of the two- wheeler names which have underperformed, one should be looking at accumulating those.


What about Bharti Airtel? Is this a good time to buy into Bharti? The rights issue should help clean the leverage part of the balance sheet.
I definitely think that Bharti is also on a revival path. If you look at the last three quarters, the operating profit per subscriber and the revenue part are seeing a definite amount of revival though because of the competitive intensity, one is not really sure how strong the improvement in ARPU would be over the next two or three quarters. The way we look at this entire space is that you have a Rel Jio which has actually tried to gain the market share and is trying to unlock the value. 

I definitely think that at some point of time they will do a price hike and try to show the operating profit and the ARPU which would also have a major positive impact on some of the incumbent companies and definitely Bharti would do extremely well from that perspective though the timing is something that we are not sure about. 

Also we are seeing a lot of improvement in the wireless business, If they manage to sell off some part of their African business, that would help their balance sheets. Overall, at this point of time, Bharti continues to be a bit of a contrarian bet but is on a revival path.


What is going on with Zee Entertainment? Investors have been very patient on the back of the fact that something very crucial will culminate as part of the strategic stake sale. Why are they just staying put?
The market has been keenly waiting for the outcome of the deal and the fact that it has been delayed means that probably the valuations that the company was looking at, it has not able to convince the investors. Also, though in an election year, typically media stocks do well but the fact that it has been a capital intensive business and particularly the kind of investment which is acquired digital foray etc. would mean that the overall growth would not be that significant.

The entire thing depends on how the company is able to complete this restructuring, getting the new investors and focus on the core media play in India. Overall, it has been a great franchise. The ad revenue growth has been good and we have been liking it for a while. Before taking a long call on that, one should wait for the clarity of the valuations.


How would you approach FMCG because the slowdown is for real? What we thought is going to be restricted to auto, is now being faced by other consumption themes including FMCG. Are we likely to see a rebound after elections?
Clearly the market was expecting a bit of a slowdown because of the kind of commentary that was coming from the management and the extended winter etc. To a certain extent, the market was bracing for a slowdown in terms of volume growth from the FMCG companies. 

Godrej Consumer, to some extent Britannia and Dabur have really disappointed but HUL was pretty much in line, given the high growth rate despite a high base. Typically if these companies, deliver about 5%-7% kind of growth, the market would definitely like it. I do not think there is going to be a significant derating or a correction in these names.

If you see some correction over the next few days because of any reasons, I definitely think that one should be buying into these names whether it is HUL or Britannia or for that matter Marico where the growth has been about 7% to 8%."

In a regulatory filing, the company said it has been informed that ""there are certain rumours floating in the market raising concerns about audit of the financial statements of the company for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.""

""We deny the above rumours floating in the market relating to audit of the financial statements of the company,""Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) said.

It further said, ""We wish to inform that the audit of the standalone and consolidated financial statements for FY 18-19 is very much in progress by M/s Deloitte Haskins & Sells, LLP, the statutory auditors of the company.""

In a separate filing, the company said it was not in a position to provide any comment or clarification regarding the stake sale process by its promoters, Essel Group.

On Tuesday, promoters of Essel Group had said its stake sale process in ZEEL is at an advanced stage.

""Understandably, in accordance with the said intent, the promoters have been in discussions/negotiations with various prospective investors...

13,2019-05-08,Zee,"Mumbai: Shares of Essel group companies slumped as much as 9 per cent on Tuesday amid market talk that the stake sale in Zee Entertainment Enterprises has hit a hurdle.

Zee Entertainment’s shares ended down 5 per cent at Rs 369.20 while Dish TV ended down nearly 9 per cent at Rs 31.80. Zee Learn’s shares ended down 4.6 per cent at Rs 25.05 and Zee Media ended down 3.3 per cent at Rs 13.67.

“The rumour in the market was that there is no deal happening. But this seems more like speculation,” said a head of institutional equities with a domestic brokerage. There were also rumours that shares pledged by promoters were sold by lenders in the market on Tuesday.


In response to an ET query seeking comment on market speculation, an Essel group spokesperson said, “The stake sale process of Zee Entertainment Enterprises is in steady progress and at an advanced stage. Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements. Essel Group does not comment on any market rumours or speculations.”

Promoters had pledged shares of Dish TV India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises with mutual funds and NBFCs to raise funds for their infrastructure venture. However, with the business plan turning sour, the group has struggled to repay lenders, forcing it to reach an agreement with its lenders under which it got time till September 30 to repay. It will be crucial for the group to sell a stake in Zee before the deadline.

As per the latest shareholding pattern, promoters had 66.2 per cent of their stake in Zee Entertainment pledged as of March 31 against 59.4 per cent as of December last year.

Recently, investors in Kotak Mutual Fund’s fixed maturity plans had to forgo a portion of their investments after on account of delay in repayment by two Essel group companies.

In an interview with ET published on April 22, Essel Group Chairman Subhash Chandra said that he is confident of being able to meet the September 30 deadline on repaying lenders. He said Zee Entertainment Enterprises has five suitors-from India to Japan, Europe and the US. “Big names have been doing the rounds, but at this stage I will not be confirming or denying any names. Now from these five shortlisted players, I sincerely believe that by end of April or first week of May, we should get non-binding term sheets,” said Chandra.

Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises had risen 69.5 per cent from the 2019 low of Rs 288.95 on January 25 to touch Rs 489.75 on February 26 — the highest level it has hit in the current calendar year. From that level, the stock has dropped by 24.6 per cent.

Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president, markets and corporate affairs at IIFL said he would prefer Sun TV or digital plays such as Reliance Industries or Bharti Airtel over Zee.

“Mutual funds have been under pressure because of exposure to the group. Investors want to see money on the table before turning positive on these stocks,” said Bhasin."

15,2019-05-08,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Reliance Communications with over 1.71 crore shares changing hands was leading among the most traded stocks on NSE on Wednesday.

Shares of Vodafone Idea (number of shares traded: 0.77 crore), JP Power (number of shares traded: 0.24 crore), Reliance Power (number of shares traded: 0.22 crore), DHFL (number of shares traded: 0.13 crore), Vedanta (number of shares traded: 0.11 crore), PC Jeweller (number of shares traded: 0.08 crore), Tata Motors (number of shares traded: 0.08 crore), YES Bank (number of shares traded: 0.08 crore) and ICICI Bank (number of shares traded: 0.08 crore) also featured among the most traded stocks on the NSE.

RIL was leading the pack of most active stocks in value terms.

It was followed by ICICI Bank (Rs 34.13 crore), HDFC (Rs 25.62 crore), Vedanta (Rs 21.73 crore), Zee Ent. (Rs 18.53 crore), DHFL (Rs 18.36 crore), Tata Motors (Rs 18.04 crore), SBI (Rs 17.08 crore), Vodafone Idea (Rs 16.96 crore) and YES Bank (Rs 15.58 crore).

The NSE Nifty index was trading 66.85 points down at 11,431.05 while the BSE Sensex was down 220.26 points at 38,056.37 around 09:17 am. 

In the Nifty index, Coal India (up 1.07 per cent), GAIL (India) (up 0.90 per cent), Power Grid Corporation of India (up 0.68 per cent), Zee Entertainment Enterprises (up 0.50 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 0.23 per cent) were among the top gainers. 

While Vedanta (down 2.54 per cent), Tata Motors (down 1.39 per cent), Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 1.24 per cent), Reliance Industries (down 1.22 per cent) and State Bank of India (down 1.13 per cent) were the top losers in the index."
16,2019-05-08,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises closed over 9 per cent lower in trade on Wednesday, even as the Essel Group claimed that the stake sale process of Zee Entertainment was at an advanced stage. 

Shares of Zee Entertainment closed 9.72 per cent down at Rs 333.30 on BSE.

In response to an ET query seeking comment on market speculation, an Essel group spokesperson said, “The stake sale process of Zee Entertainment Enterprises is in steady progress and at an advanced stage. Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements. Essel Group does not comment on any market rumours or speculations.” 

Yet the stock extended its recent correction. 

Zee Entertainment Enterprises had announced in November last year that its promoters, led by Subhash Chandra, planned to sell up to 50 per cent of their equity stake in the company to a strategic partner. 

Shares of the company have been in the bearish territory since last Thursday, 2 May, 2019.

Meanwhile, shareholding data showed Zee group is among the firms that lead in share pledges with lenders.

As per a PTI report, Zee Entertainment and Dish TV, the companies from the Subhash Chandra-led Essel group, have their promoter pledging 66.2 per cent and 94.6 per cent of the ownership pledged, respectively. 

From the companies that make the 50-share benchmark Nifty, Zee Entertainment leads with the highest pledge at 66.2 percent 

Promoters typically raise money for their other businesses by pledging a part of their holdings in listed entities as security."
17,2019-05-08,Zee,"Vivek Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor is betting on Bajaj Auto and Hero among two-wheelers and auto ancillaries like Swaraj Engines and JK Tyres. Mavani was in conversation with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 
How are you approaching this market?
Well certainly with caution because the rally that started towards the end of February has been too sharp and too fast for comfort for a lot of market participants. A lot of hope and expectations were hinged on the earnings for the fourth quarter and the outlook going forward and the results so far so barring the largecap IT and few other select pockets, have been more disappointments than pleasant surprises. 

One strong pillar of strength for the markets over the last five years, which had also been one of the leaders, is the consumer space and most consumer companies barring Jyothy Labs will talk about that separately. But leading FMCG companies -- be it HUL, Dabur or a couple of other companies have disappointed both on volume growth as well as on the outlook going forward.

Jyothy Labs is probably the only one where they are not even talking of a slowdown or a recession. The word recession was used in the Hindustan Unilever conference call but yesterday I was on the interaction or the investor meet at Jyothy Labs and they are still guiding at about 14% to 15% growth in the current year with perhaps no price increases. They are expecting double digit volume growth in their businesses with probably equivalent earnings growth margins being maintained. 


You are not buying afresh right now, are you?
One needs to be cautious and especially from the earnings point of view, and not so much about the politics and election, according to me.


Do you also see quite a drastic drop given the global picture right now? Are we heading for quite a critical period now in the next couple of weeks?
We may not see any drastic fall. It is not that the market cannot correct another 5% on the indices and the stocks cannot correct another 10-20%, but I do not think it is happening tomorrow or next week. Probably, it will take a few weeks for that to happen. It is going to be more gradual although I do not lay much emphasis on the election outcome.

Finally, three months or six months later, elections would have been forgotten and we would have probably been again looking at earnings only. But any kind of disappointment from the election outcomes could result in a drastic fall towards the third or fourth week of May. But I see that only as a remote possibility. Markets will find its own course based on the fund flows and earnings subsequently.


What about Titan. If it fails to meet guidance, would it hugely disappoint the street?
Well disappointment yes because the management had guided four quarters ago at growth of about 25%. Post the second quarter, they revised it to about 20-22%. The third quarter, they maintained that 20-22%. Now if that were also not to come about in terms of delivery, then it would be a disappointment. But from a 3 to 5 years’ perspective, the jewellery business can continue its growth rate at about 15-16%, which for Titan is doable. 

So, I would not be so much worried about may be one quarter of miss on earnings based on the guidance. The stock may correct but let us also realise that in the last 12 months, Titan has probably gone up at least 40% while the broad markets have been negative and indices are probably plus or minus 3%-4%. So, Titan has delivered stellar performance and a correction probably is a buying opportunity.


What about Zee, ADAG? 
In all of these story-telling stocks, one needs to wait. If the deal happens, it is good for the promoters and investors in those companies, but to buy on hope of a deal is not right. I am not doubting the intentions of the promoters of Zee or ADAG. All of them have gone on record multiple times in the last few months and have put their businesses on the block in case of Zee, including their flagship company or Zee Entertainment. Even ADAG has repeatedly talked about stake sales in general insurance business and mutual fund business which is listed --Reliance Nippon Asset Management. 

The point is even if they backdoor negotiations are happening, the market certainly is getting impatient, like in case of DHFL. One of the stocks which probably you have missed out is Yes Bank which has also been doing the rounds the last couple of weeks since their disastrous fourth quarter results. A lot of them are already desperate and the stock prices seems to be suggesting that. My suggestion is just stay away for the moment and let the dust settle.


Do you have any top picks within the midcap basket?
As far as the picks are concerned, they do not really change. I continue to be positive on the two-wheeler space. For example, Bajaj Auto and Hero selectively on private banks and that is where Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank figure to a certain extent, may be a Bandhan too. 

The other space is city gas distribution companies. Mahanagar Gas and Gujarat Gas had fairly good results although there was a little disappointment on volumes. But there was no real complaints on the earnings. That is the third space extension of auto in terms of auto ancillaries. I continue to remain positive on some of the companies like Swaraj Engines or a JK Tyres."

Rs 5.61 cr gone in 5 sessionsIn last five sessions of losses, investors have lost nearly Rs 5.61 lakh crore, as the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms dropped to Rs 1,47,47,869.63 crore from Rs 1,53,08,828.49 crore on Friday, April 26.

Besides, the stock also gained after the company told stock exchanges that the stake sale process, undertaken by Essel Group, is at an advanced stage. 

The two developments triggered value buying on the stock, which had fallen for five sessions in a row. The shares of Zee Entertainment closed 7.31 per cent higher at Rs 357.65 on BSE. 

The stock fell 9 per cent lower, the previous day, after Reliance Mutual Fund sold Rs 410 crore worth of shares of the company which its promoters, the Essel Group, had pledged with the asset manager to raise money.

In the absence of any positive trigger, the domestic market failed to break the multi-day losing spell, as it saw strong selling in energy, telecom, metal, oil & gas and power sectors. 

Participants said other than the gloomy global cues, the ongoing elections have added to cautiousness. March quarter earnings have been mixed so far and they have failed to boost market sentiment.

Sensex closed 230 points, or 0.61 per cent, down at 37,558 while Nifty finished at 11,301, down 58 points or 0.51 per cent. In last seven days, both Sensex and Nifty have come off nearly 4 per cent.

Asian Paints down 2%Shares of Asian Paints finished 2.29 per cent lower at Rs 1,355 after the company reported a 1.6 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated profit after minority interest at Rs 473.11 crore, falling short of Rs 595 crore that analysts had projected in an ETNOW poll.

25,2019-05-09,Zee,"HDFC Asset Management, the country’s largest mutual fund house by assets, lightened its largecap holdings and bought additional shares of select midcap and smallcap companies in April, when the benchmark equity indices advanced 1 per cent. 

The money manager more than doubled its holding in select aviation, NBFC, cement and consumer durables plays in April, even as it sold stake in industry leaders Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Asian Paints and ICICI Bank. 

The fund house added more shares in as many as 61 companies, while reduced its holdings in as many as 84. NSE’s Nifty index rose nearly 8 per cent during the January-April period, while Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty Smallcap100 shed up to 2 per cent each.

Brokerage Elara Capital says midcaps continue their underperformance against largecaps. “Relative valuations are plunging towards -1 standard deviation levels, making midcaps very attractive. A negative SD shows the price to equity ratio has slipped to the lower end of average valuations.

Stocks where the top fund manager raised its holding in April included in InterGlobe Aviation, where its holding has gone up to a whooping 1,94,200 shares as of April 30 from 15,600 on March 31. Likewise, it increased stake in Indiabulls Housing Finance (from 99,238 shares to 3,72,605), ACC (from 8,000 to 27,200) and Bajaj Electricals (from 8,65,300 to 24,60,000).

According to Stewart & Mackertich, improved pricing power, lower ATF coupled with rupee appreciation should aid an improvement in profitability of domestic airlines. With the global ban on Boeing 737 Max 8 planes coming into force from March, capacity is not likely to rise at the expected pace, thus demand should outpace supply in the near future. This means the prospects for yields would be encouraging, the brokerage said. 

“We expect IndiGo to outperform, as it has a deep domestic network with over 43 per cent market share, availability of slots, lowest cost structure and a healthy cash balance to fuel the airline,” the brokerage said.

ACC has been demonstrating sustained ability to improve sales volume since Q1CY17, which had remained stagnant through CY11-CY16. While its CY18 volume growth stood at 8.7 per cent YoY, capacity utilisation came in 85 per cent, Ashika Stock Broking said in a report. 

“We expect ACC to deliver improved RoE backed by better pricing and lower operating expenditure,” the brokerage said.

HDFC AMC also developed fancy for select power plays. Data shows the fund house bought over 1 crore additional shares in NTPC and BHEL during the month. It held 35.75 crore shares of NTPC and 2.04 crore shares of BHEL as of April 30, 2019.

Antique Stock Broking prefers utilities firm like NTPC over equipment makers like BHEL. “In the short run, for a year or two, demand in power equipment and projects is unlikely to grow. Policy makers are consolidating and streamlining the existing 68GW of projects under construction. Plus, in the near term, the focus is on making good of the 175GW renewable target. This is visible in subdued order pipeline for BHEL, a state-owned power-equipment manufacturer. However, with commissioning pace of thermal plants are inching up,” it said

Tiles firm Kajaria Ceramics, telecom major Bharti Airtel as well as private sector bank Karur Vysya Bank also drew interest of HDFC AMC, which added 13,000 shares of Kajaria, 43.65 lakh shares of Karur and 16.77 lakh shares of Airtel during the month.

Coal India, Bank of Baroda, Apollo Tyres, GAIL India, Sadbhav Engineering, Bharat Electronics, Tata Steel, Bharat Dynamics, Jagran Prakashan, Chambal Fertiliser, Power Finance Corporation, Firstsource Solution, REC, Redington, REC, Kalpataru Power, KEC International, Axis Bank, Indian Hotel, BPCL, Gabriel India, SBI, Cipla, ITC, ICICI Prudential, Zee Entertainment and HDFC were among other stocks where the fund house raised its stake during the month.

On the other hand, it offloaded more than 13 lakh shares in Infosys, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. It also sold over 50,000 shares in Maruti Suzuki, Adani Enterprises, HPCL, Britannia, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Allahabad Bank, Wipro and NBCC, among others.

Brokerage firm YES Securities recently gave a ‘sell’ rating to Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 5,850. “Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) reported a weak performance in Q4FY19 with Ebidta coming in 8 per cent below expectations,” said YES Securities.

In the Nifty50 pack, shares of companies like Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, Wipro and HCL Technologies surged over 20 per cent in the first four months of 2019, while Hero Moto, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki declined over 10 per cent.

Average asset under management (AUM) of HDFC AMC stood at Rs 3.43 lakh crore as of March 31, 2019. It was followed by ICICI Prudential AMC (Rs 3.21 lakh crore) and SBI Fund Management (Rs 2.84 lakh crore) in terms of AUM."

Analyst calls
• IIFL has maintained reduce rating on Kansai Nerolac Paints with a target price of ₹410. Continued strength in decorative and powder coatings segments is likely to offset weakness in auto coatings and support FY20 growth, the brokerage said. 

• Anand Rathi has upgraded DFM Foods to buy and revised target price higher to ₹361. DFM’s growth momentum will persist, bolstered by its three focus areas: innovative marketing, distribution expansion and introducing products, said Anand Rathi.. The brokerage said it is optimistic on the company with the new products gaining traction and boosting overall growth and profitability. 

• CLSA has maintained sell rating on Vedanta and revised target price to ₹135 from ₹170. The 14-34% rally in zinc and oil prices is benefiting Vedanta as these form 80% of its EBITDA, said CLSA. On the flip side, the slow volume ramp-up in zinc and oil as well as increased costs in Hindustan Zinc are concerns, it added. CLSA believes that concerns of related party transactions and the future use of cash will overshadow earnings outlook. 

• CIMB Securities has maintained add rating on Escorts with a target price of ₹938. The brokerage believes Escorts will continue to outperform in terms of tractor volumes and market share gain. After the recent stock price correction of 17% in April, the stock is looking attractive at 9 times FY21 price-to-earnings considering compounded growth of 14% in earnings per share over FY20-FY21. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Jyothy Laboratories and revised fair value to ₹200 from ₹210. Jyothy Lab's fourth quarter earnings print was weak on all fronts with subdued topline growth and sharp margin decline, off a high base, it said. The company's growth guidance appears ambitious in the backdrop of the current business momentum and demand slowdown suggested by larger players, it added.

36,2019-05-13,Zee,"Mumbai: HDFC Asset Management said it has received two show cause notices from markets regulator The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in relation to the investments of fixed maturity plans of HDFC Mutual Fund in debt instruments of Essel Group companies.

“We are working with the legal advisors and are in the process of responding to the show cause notices,” the company said in a notice to the exchanges on Monday.

Last month, HDFC Mutual Fund had informed investors it plans to extend the tenure for one of its FMPs coming up for maturity by another year, due to its exposure to Essel group companies.

HDFC Mutual Fund was not the only one to be impacted. At the same time, Kotak Mutual Fund said investors in six of its FMPs will not be able to redeem the entire maturity value

On May 2, Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra told ET he is confident of being able to meet the September 30 deadline on repaying lenders. He said Zee Entertainment Enterprises has five suitors — from India to Japan, Europe and the US. He also said that Essel will repay every rupee of the group’s Rs 17,174-crore dent."
37,2019-05-14,Zee,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has queried the legality of the agreement between two mutual funds and Essel Group that gave the conglomerate time till September to repay loans, said a person familiar with the development. This had meant investors in mutual fund schemes weren’t paid in full when they attained maturity.

In separate show-cause notices to HDFC Mutual Fund and Kotak Mutual Fund, the regulator has sought details of the terms of their investments in Essel Group’s debt securities. Essel owns Zee Entertainment and Dish TV.

This would be the first time Sebi has questioned the standstill pact between various fund houses & Essel soon after shares of Zee and Dish plunged in late January. Essel Group’s cash-strapped founders, who had borrowed from lenders including MFs and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) by pledging shares with them, failed to replenish the collateral.

Mutual funds, which didn’t sell the pledged shares at the time as it could have led to a further collapse in their value, gave Essel time till September 30 to repay the money.

As a result, subscribers to the fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of Kotak Mutual and HDFC Mutual weren’t paid in full. That’s why Sebi sent show-cause notices to the two, said the person cited above, although at least nine fund houses could be holding Essel papers in various schemes.

“As per the NCD (nonconvertible debenture) agreement, money has to be paid at the time of maturity. It covers all the obligations,” said the person cited above. “If it’s not paid, then it’s not right. Why then should fund houses have a separate standstill agreement?”

The FMPs — close-ended debt schemes — of HDFC Mutual and Kotak Mutual had invested in Essel Group securities. While the tenure of some of these FMPs ended last month, Essel was unable to repay the funds. Kotak told the FMP investors it would pay the remaining money in September after Essel repaid its loans. HDFC Mutual Fund gave unit holders the option of rolling over investments for another 380 days instead of redeeming at maturity in mid-April.

HDFC Mutual, in a disclosure to stock exchanges, said it had received two show-cause notices in relation to the FMP investments in Essel Group companies.

Sebi has also asked what criteria the funds based their decision on.



“Investments have been made mainly on the strength of the collateral and not on the financials of the company to which the loan has been given,” said the person cited above. “What is the assurance that the part payment which has been held back will happen? What if the fund house fails to exercise the collateral?”

Debt mutual funds and NBFCs lent to privately held structures set up by promoters with shares as collateral. Promoters used the borrowed money to finance other business interests or buy assets abroad. In the case of Zee, the infrastructure businesses that the group entered into incurred losses.

The Essel Group has assured mutual funds and NBFCs that it will repay all the loans the moment it sells stakes in Zee Entertainment before the end of September."

 Otherwise, investors thought that credit risk funds are akin to a ""free lunch"", which will deliver up to 2 percentage points extra without exposing themselves to any volatilities.

 He added that so far, funds have very limited credit risks and hoped that enforced of the securities ""will still give better return to the investors"".

It’s no secret that India’s banking regulator hates having its officials sit on the boards of state-run lenders.

The practice exposes the Reserve Bank of India to all kinds of potential conflicts it would rather avoid. So when the RBI used its special powers to appoint a former deputy governor as a director of Yes Bank Ltd., a non-state lender, it sent a powerful signal: The bank’s troubles run deeper than investors believe, and a cleanup will probably be harder. The eventual solution may be to let the country’s 10th-largest bank by market value get swallowed by a bigger balance sheet.

Yes Bank’s problems started two years ago, when the regulator forced it to disclose that nonperforming loans were $630 million more than the $113 million reported in the company’s audited accounts for the year ended in March 2016. The divergence widened to almost $1 billion a year later.

Last September, the RBI pulled the plug, and refused to approve a further three-year term as chief executive for co-founder Rana Kapoor. Deutsche Bank AG’s former India CEO Ravneet Gill, who recently replaced Kapoor, has decided to make kitchen-sinking of problem loans his first priority. Yes reported its first-ever loss during the March quarter after the new CEO took a $300 million hit to cover for loans that could go bad in the future.

Still, with the old management out and a cleanup guy in place, why would the RBI get involved with Yes now? Its gross nonperforming asset ratio is 3.2 percent, compared with 7.5 percent for State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender by assets.


Bloomberg
A reasonable guess is Yes Bank’s linkages with financial and real-estate firms, two of the businesses facing the biggest funding squeezes in India. Such exposure works out to a sixth of the loan book, based on figures released by the bank.

A fire sale of debt securities held by Yes Bank’s treasury would further push up funding costs for its borrowers — the struggling shadow-lending industry. Before you know it, the financing drought that started with the collapse of IL&FS last September could turn into a full-fledged famine just as a new government is getting sworn in in New Delhi.

That’s not something the central bank can allow on its watch.

The RBI has previously used its special powers to appoint directors in Dhanlaxmi Bank as well as Lakshmi Vilas Bank. Interestingly, Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. wants to merge with Lakshmi Vilas, provided the RBI allows the shadow bank to morph into a deposit-taking institution. It’s reasonable to expect that even Yes Bank will become the target of some sort of special situation investor.


Bloomberg
However, there are uncertainties around how much headway new CEO Gill will make and how soon. His problems literally run from A to Z — from tycoon Anil Ambani to television broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. The bank’s exposure to the former’s crumbling empire alone is $1.85 billion, or half of the bank’s common equity, BloombergQuint reported this month. Ambani’s telecom company is in bankruptcy, while his finance business struggles with a liquidity crunch and credit downgrades. Meanwhile, Yes Bank has a $470 million exposure to Zee’s controlling shareholder, Business Standard reported in January.

Given all this, a long line of willing suitors for Yes is unlikely. Any hookup will probably have to be an arranged marriage, solemnized by the RBI."

The fund house increased exposure to select stocks such as Vodafone Idea, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Avanti Feeds, Bharat Electronics and NBCC, that have plunged 45-72 per cent since January 2018. 

S Naren, ED and CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The market currently is fairly priced. The strategy in such market condition is to adopt a stock-specific approach. There are several pockets of opportunities across sectors and market capitalisations, where scrips are available at attractive valuations.”

Power, auto ancillaries, metal and telecom looks attractive to Naren.

Vodafone Idea recently concluded a Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, which was oversubscribed nearly 1.08 times. Ace Mutual Fund data base showed ICICI Prudential was holding 46 crore Vodafone Idea shares as of April 30 against 8.77 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house subscribed to the rights issue.



Besides, the fund house bought additional shares of IT majors Infosys (1.30 crore) and Tata Consultancy Services (4 lakh). Infosys last month posted a 10.5 per cent rise in consolidated profit for March quarter at Rs 4,078 crore, and gave a guidance for 7.5-9.5 per cent revenue growth in FY 2019-20. 

TCS reported 17.7 per cent year-on-year growth in March quarter net income at Rs 8,126 crore and Rs 6,904 crore profit. The IT major last Friday once again became India’s most valued firm by market valuation, surpassing Reliance Industries. 

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Infosys with a price target of Rs 782 and a ‘buy’ call on TCS with a price target of Rs 2,312.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added shares of auto players Eicher Motors (5,484 shares), TVS Motor (13 lakh) and Mahindra & Mahindra (4.15 lakh). Financial majors Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank also manage to draw the fund house. 

In the power sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 2.83 crore shares of NTPC, followed by Power Finance Corporation (40 lakh), REC (36 lakh) and Adani Power (1.34 lakh). Antique Stock Broking has ‘buy’ rating on NTPC with a price target of Rs 161.

“With improvement in commissioning and commercialisation, NTPC should see an uptick in operational performance. Further, capacity addition in the next five years will sustain the momentum. We foresee 5-6 per cent capacity addition CAGR,” the brokerage said.

The fund manager also bought auto ancillary shares like Apollo Tyre, Exide Batteries, Motherson Sumi Systems and Amara Raja Batteries.

“I will be a little contrarian on auto and auto ancillaries at this point. Although lead indicators suggest a bit of consumption slowdown, two-wheelers should start looking better. I would probably be a buyer on dips starting with two-wheelers and also in some of the auto components and auto ancillaries. There has been a reasonable price correction because of the overall slowdown,” Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, told ETNOW.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 111 companies, and sold in 116 across sectors. The fund house held 552 stocks as of April 30.

51,2019-05-21,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Exit poll projections have given a huge lift to the stock market, helping NSE benchmark Nifty50 to take out its record high of 11,856 early Tuesday.

The positive momentum is restricted to largecaps, as 234 stocks across the market caps look strong on technical charts, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bullish crossover -- a sign of bullish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included DHFL, Ashok Leyland, Adani Ports, L&T Finance, Zee Entertainment and Indiabulls Real Estate, Adani Green BHEL, NBCC and ONGC. ITC, Power Grid, IDBI Bank, Tata Power and Allahabad Bank have also sent out bullish signals on the technical charts, data suggests.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

		}5 stocks that may gain from post-election rally of 5NextPrevPlay SlideshowUpside in the offing20 May, 2019BSE Sensex witnessed its biggest single-day rally since September 10, 2013 after exit polls projected a comfortable victory for the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. Experts said Monday’s rally was just the beginning exit polls hold true.

Karvy Stock Broking lists five stocks that are all set to gain from post-election rally:NextICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 380.40 | Target: Rs 466.50 | Upside: 23%20 May, 2019The bank's asset quality improved with gross NPA declining to 6.7% and net NPA declining to 2.06%; Net Interest Income improved by 27% and Net Interest Margin improved to 3.71%. The bank is on its way to recovery. Underlying loan growth is healthy and the bank is also diversifying its loan book to make it less risky. ROE of the bank should improve significantly in FY20.
NextHDFC Life | CMP: Rs 391.05 | Target: Rs 436.20 | Upside: 12%20 May, 2019It did a successful OFS recently which is encouraging. The Insurance sector will benefit from any rally in equity markets and any decline in bond yields will also benefit the company by improving value of investments. Besides, India is still underpenetrated in terms of Insurance and the sector has significant growth potential. In its most recent quarterly update, APE grew by 15.5% YoY while profits grew 18%. The company trades at a P/EV (Embedded value) of 3.6X.

NextBiocon | CMP: Rs 529.40 | Target: Rs 663.16 | Upside: 25%20 May, 2019It is well poised to benefit from growth in the market for Biosimilars as well as research services (Syngene) and the company is likely to maintain growth momentum. EPS is likely to grow in the range of 15% in FY20.


NextMahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 614.25 | Target: Rs 818.77 | Upside: 33%20 May, 2019Along with rest of the industry, Mahindra and Mahindra faces headwinds in the near term and Q4FY19 results may be subdued. We believe Auto industry is near its trough. We expect that it's new launches will be well received and a near normal monsoon may lead to recovery in tractor sales. The company trades at an attractive valuation of 12X forward PE.

Data showed just three stocks on NSE are signalling a bearish trend so far. They include Infosys, Sonata Software and Kothari Products.

The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

Analysts feel the ongoing rally may lift Nifty to 12,000 mark, if the election outcome is in line with exit poll projections. They see good times ahead for stocks in the broader market.

“The positive development (exit polls) has resulted in a complete gush in many midcaps, which had underperformed significantly over the past few months. Going ahead, traders should focus completely on such propositions from the broader market and should keep a close eye on the poll outcome on Thursday,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.
If the strength is Nifty50 helps it top the 11,856 level on a closing basis, the rally may extend up to 12,100, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. “Strong support can be expected around the 11,720 level, where fresh buying can be considered with a stop loss below 11,590 level on a closing basis,” Mohammad said.

61,2019-05-23,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Thursday's session saw frontline equity indices, Sensex and Nifty, scale fresh record highs before giving up entire gains to close in the negative.

“The market couldn’t sustain its record high for long as the win was largely priced in. Now the focus would return to earnings, crude oil prices and the US-China trade tension,” said Jayant Manglik, President for Retail Distribution at Religare Broking.


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Thursday's session:


HDFC Bank slides 3%Shares of HDFC Bank fell 2.94 per cent to Rs 2,334 after the lender’s board approved share split. In a BSE filing, the company said the board of directors has approved the sub-division of equity shares from one share of the face value of Rs 2 each to two shares of the face value of Rs 1 each. 


Reliance Capital rises 3%Shares of Reliance Capital climbed 2.77 per cent to Rs 131.90, extending the gains into the second consecutive session. In two sessions, the stock has risen over 8 per cent. The company said it would exit the mutual fund business by selling its stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (RNAM) to its joint venture partner Japan's Nippon Life Insurance.


BoB extends gainsShares of Bank of Baroda (BoB) closed 1.03 per cent higher at Rs 127.50, extending gains into the sixth successive session, which has boosted the stock by 18 per cent.

Motilal Oswal has given a ‘buy’ recommendation with a price target of Rs 150.

Brokerages still show faith in the stock. Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,900. Goldman Sachs maintained a neutral view on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,948.

Two closely held firms controlled by Essel promoters have not submitted the customary ‘no-default certificate’ to the rating agency, Acuité, which tracks the debt while the private sector lender is silent on whether the borrowing companies have missed servicing loans.

Besides raising funds through sale of stock-backed debt securities to mutual funds, some of the Essel Group companies have drawn loans from Yes Bank on the back of comfort letters or guarantees from promoters.

Responding to ET’s queries, an Essel Group spokesman said: “Essel Business Excellence and Essel Corporate Resources Pvt Ltd have availed borrowings from Yes Bank and the said accounts were ‘standard’ as on 31/03/2019 and continue to be ‘standard’ as on date.”

When contacted, a Yes Bank spokesman declined to comment on the matter.

A loan account, according to banking parlance, remains ‘standard’ till it gets the tag of non-performing asset (NPA), which happens only if there is non-payment of dues within 90 days from the due date.

(Thus, hypothetically, any borrower which fails to pay loan interest on March 31can technically remain ‘standard’ in the bank’s book till end-June). The Essel official did not elaborate on why ‘no-default certificate’ from the borrowing firms were pending.

Industry sources said Acuité could not obtain the information from Yes, the lending bank. There is no compulsion, however, on the part of Yes (or, any lender) to disclose information to rating agencies — a state of affairs that agencies complain have placed them as well as investors at a disadvantage.

Unlike a default on debenture or bond, which investors come to know immediately, only banks and the Reserve Bank of India are privy to information on delay in loan servicing. A ‘standstill agreement’ between Essel and some of the fund houses (which have subscribed to Essel group’s rated debentures) is under force. However, unlike mutual funds, banks, which have to follow strict prudential guidelines laid down by RBI, are not free to strike such deals with borrowers. In fact, Sebi, after its initial silence on the agreement, has recently questioned the pact which was entered into soon after shares of Subhash Chandra-led Essel Group companies Zee and Dish TV plunged in late January.

Bank term loan facilities of Rs 495 crore to Essel Corporate Resources as well as Rs 400 crore to Essel Business Excellence are under ‘rating watch’. “A non-submission of no-default certificate is a trigger for the rating agency but it does not necessarily mean that the security is in for downgrade.

Agencies, typically, approach lending banks in trying to find out if there is any default. But, there is no regulation that compels banks to share such information to anyone other than RBI. But if there is a downgrade on loans, ratings of Essel debentures could come for examination,” said a senior official at a bond house.

Ratings of the two companies were placed on ‘watch’ after Essel promoters announced their intentions to dilute holding in Zee Entertainment Enterprises, the group flagship. The agency perceives that the financial flexibility of the promoters of Essel Group emanates from their holdings in their listed companies, mainly ZEE Ltd."

62,2019-05-24,Zee,"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) victory in the general elections brought cheer among stocks of business groups which market participants perceive could benefit from the NDA government’s second term.

While Adani Group shares went up in the range of 5-10 per cent intraday, Zee Entertainment shares were up 6 per cent. Market participants said investors perceive these groups could do well once BJP returns to power.

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)’s victory in Tamil Nadu helped Sun TV shares gain to a tune of 5 per cent.

Sun TV is owned by Kalanithi Maran, a cousin of DMK chief MK Stalin. Analysts said Sun TV’s financials have been superior when the DMK is in power.

However, most of the stocks could not sustain the gains on account of broader selling in the markets in the last two hours of trading wherein the Sensex fell over 500 points. Adani Ports and Zee Entertainment were the best performing stocks in the lot as they closed almost 5.4 per cent higher, respectively.

While shares of Heritage Foods witnessed selling pressure initially on account of a setback for the Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh, the stock eventually recovered to close 1.8 per cent higher.

A similar rally was witnessed during the 2014 general elections. For instance, shares of Adani Enterprises surged 252 per cent to Rs 794 apiece between February 2014 and May 2014. Adani Power shares too rallied over 200 per cent during the period, data showed.

Market participants say, triggers like election results provide some boost to the stocks in the short run but investors should consider financials of these companies before taking any investment calls."

66,2019-05-26,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Despite strong volatility, domestic equities logged solid gains during the week gone by as a majority verdict for the Narendra Modi-led NDA infused bullish sentiment in the market. 

Analysts said investors, who were staying away from the market due to uncertainty in the runup to the general election, are coming to the market now.

For the week gone by, headline indices Sensex and Nifty jumped 4 per cent.

The coming week may see more volatility due to the expiry of May series futures & options contracts. Analysts are advising investors to go for contrarian bets as the market may now start reacting to macroeconomic numbers, corporate earnings and global cues.

“When corporate or election results are as per market expectations, it is pointless to act on information that is already known to all. Everything has been already discounted for and, therefore, taking a contrarian bet could be far more profitable than going with the consensus,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote.

Let's take a look at that factors that will influence market mood during the coming week:


F&O contracts expire on Thursday
The market may experience bouts of volatility as the May series futures & options contracts expire on Thursday and participants will roll over their positions to the June series. 


Buzz around Cabinet formation
The new Cabinet is to take shape in the next few days and even if it is too early to expect any policy announcement, the market will keep a close eye on the development.


Flow of foreign money
The flow of foreign portfolio investments will remain an important factor for the market. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net buyers in the market, putting in Rs 2,026.33 crore on Friday, NSE data showed. So far in May, FPIs pulled out Rs 2,093 crore, data available with NSDL showed.


Fourth quarter GDP print
All eyes will be on India's fourth quarter GDP print, expected on Friday. The country's GDP growth slipped to 6.6 per cent in third quarter of FY19. The economy had grown 7.1 per cent in the second quarter and 8.2 per cent in the first quarter, logging 7.6 per cent for the first half.


Fiscal deficit, infra output data
The fiscal deficit numbers and infrastructure output for April will be released on Friday. Both are significant macroeconomic data that can give an idea on the country's economic health.


March quarter earnings
Fourth quarter earnings season is at its end. NTPC, Adani Ports, GAIL, IndiGo, Zee Entertainment, PNB, Sun Pharma, Coal India and Power Grid Corporation are scheduled to come out with their March quarter numbers during the coming week. 


Global macro
Bank of Japan's core CPI, China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI (May), Japan's industrial production data (April) and personal spending and income data of the US for April are among the key global macro numbers scheduled to be released during the coming week.


Technical outlook
Last week, Nifty formed a bullish gap-up candle on the weekly chart, indicating that the bulls are holding a tight grip on the market. However, analysts see downward pressure too. If Nifty trades above 11,859, at least for the first one hour on Monday, it can extend its strength towards 11,955 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."
71,2019-05-27,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has posted a net profit of Rs 292.5 crore for the final quarter of the financial year ended March 31, 2019, a jump of 26.8% over the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

Beating market estimates, ZEE has clocked EBITDA, or operating profit, of Rs Rs 568.3 crore, up 12.3% from Rs 506.2 crore in Q4FY18.

Total revenue for the quarter was up 17% to Rs 2,019.3 crore, compared with Rs 1,725.3 crore in the year-ago period, on the back of strong performance of domestic broadcast, digital and movie businesses.

Despite the new tariff order, ZEE has managed to post a 16% YOY growth in advertising revenues to Rs 1,217.5 crore, while subscription revenues also grew at a modest 3.4% to Rs 565.3 crore during the quarter.

Total expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 1,451 crore, registering a 19% increase, mainly because of a 28.1% increase in the programming cost (883.3 crore) and 23% increase in employee cost (Rs 201.5 crore).

Programming cost was driven primarily by the content cost for ZEE’s video streaming service ZEE5, launch expense of channel in Kerala and movie production and distribution business cost. Advertising and publicity cost for the quarter also grew 46% due to higher marketing costs for ZEE5, TRAI tariff order, and ‘Manikarnika’.

“We have delivered another quarter of strong operating performance which is commendable given the challenges the industry is facing in implementing the TRAI tariff order. As I had indicated earlier, the implementation of this new regulation has led to short-term disruptions, which is understandable given the size of our pay TV market. Based on the initial signs, I do believe that the changes that this regulation will bring in will be positive for us,” Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, ZEE, said.

“...our medium-term growth outlook for the business remains unchanged,” he said. “While advertisers have been circumspect to spend due to the uncertainty caused by the regulation and some moderation in the consumer demand, we believe that this is temporary. The tariff order should settle down on the ground soon and the new government’s primary objective will be to stimulate consumer demand, both of which will inspire confidence in the advertisers. The new subscription regime would be beneficial for all the stakeholders in the value chain.”

For the full fiscal, ZEE’s net profit grew 6% to Rs 1,567.1 crore from Rs 1479.1 crore in the previous fiscal, while EBITDA grew 23.5% to Rs 2,564 crore and EBITDA margin stood at 32.3%.

The board of the company recommended a dividend of Rs 3.50 per equity share for the financial year 2018-19.

68,2019-05-27,Zee,"There is a good chance of a broad-based participation which probably will come and to that extent, increasingly in banks like RBL Bank or City Union Bank, said Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum India, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

Zee Entertainment is slated to come out with its earnings later today and the expectations are that it could be a fairly tempered quarter. We will be closely watching out for any information on strategic stake sale and then you have the TRAI tariff order as well which could be a little bit of a roadblock. What is your expectation?What we have seen in Zee Entertainment in the last couple of months or in fact a couple of quarters is more or less driven by news flow and management stake sale, how it happens and what happens to the SITI’s stake over there. The numbers can be sort of muted in the current environment but the sense here is that probably somebody who wants to get into the entertainment space (we have fairly been bullish on companies like PVR and Inox), something in the multiplex space where the movie content right now is superb and regional movies plus Hollywood movies as well as all your commercial and offbeat movies have their respective audiences. Plus the F&B revenues do very well. 

If somebody wants to get into the entertainment space right now, PVR or Inox though at an expensive valuation, presents a better opportunity than anything like Zee Entertainment where there are a lot of questions which has to be answered by the management and investors would be keen to know about that type of issues rather than seeing the result and getting into the stock. 


Everybody likes ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. Give me something where there is scope for compounding and yet it is not a very popular or a consensus trade.Probably, we were also more into the consensus trade in the last 6-12 months seeing the polarisation of the markets. But after seeing this type of a mandate, there is a good chance of a broad-based participation which probably will come and to that extent, increasingly in banks like RBL Bank or City Union Bank. Of course, this does not trade very cheap. Among PSU banks, SBI remains the classic favourite but that has also run up. 

A RBL Bank probably seems to grow at around 38-40%. Even in a difficult scenario, it probably would grow at say 28-30%. 

Yes Bank does not sound good right now but seven-eight years back, all the right things were probably done. I sense that financials still has a lot of upside. Consensus trades like Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv probably also on a correction would be still growing at say 30-35% if not more.


What is the view on Divi’s Laboratories after the disastrous earnings?Pharma is still one sector we need to look at in a different way. Most of the pharma companies have disappointed or at least just come out of the loop of that bad earnings which it had overall for the last two to three years. We probably like companies like Abbot Laboratories or Sanofi or Pfizer which are into niche segments into India.

In all these MNC companies, the R&D burden is borne by the parent and they have a lot of US pieces regarding their individualities in terms of the market share on the drugs which they sell. We are more comfortable in this niche space rather than getting into the companies which are more or less related to USFDA, not Divi’s Laboratories but a lot of such companies."

Board meetings (FULL LIST)



Analyst calls

 • Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Whirlpool of India and revised target price to ₹1,560 from ₹1,625. Most positives are priced in at current valuations, as key risks such as demand softness, raw material head-winds and rising competition (pricing pressures) prevail, said Jefferies. 

 • CLSA has retained buy rating on Dish TV India and cut target price to ₹60 from ₹70. Dish TV's fourth quarter revenues and Ebitda were below estimates with subscriptions down 5% YoY, hit by delays and disruption in implementing TRAI’s new tariff regime, said CLSA. 

 • Edelweiss Securities has maintained buy rating on Indraprastha Gas with a target price of ₹365. Indraprastha Gas remains a preferred pick among city gas distribution companies due to its robust volume growth outlook and high exposure to priority sectors giving it access to cheaper APM gas, said Edelweiss. The brokerage has estimated an EPS CAGR of 15% with a robust RoE of over 20% over FY19–22. 

 • Nirmal Bang has initiated coverage on Tata Chemicals with a buy rating and target price of ₹749. The recent decision to hive off its consumer business is positive as this transforms Tata Chemicals into a focused chemicals and specialties company, said Nirmal Bang. The growth from nutrition, and silica, will likely gather momentum from FY21 based on new capacity being set up at a cost of ₹5.7 billion, said Nirmal Bang. 

 • Citigroup has downgraded Cummins India to neutral from buy and cut target price to ₹800 from ₹881 after weaker-than-expected fourth quarter result. Export uncertainties are likely to persist through FY20, also reflected in the management guidance of flattish to negative sales growth, said Citi.

5,2019-06-04,Zee,"Any decline in select cement stocks can be an opportunity for fundamental investors to look at the sector and start investing, said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, MOSL, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 


Cement is definitely one segment most are bullish on. Would you recommend buying on declines on such days?Cement has been a sector where a lot of us were positive on the back of expected improvement in financials. Basically, the demand trend was always there. We were positive on the back of the consecutive price hikes that the sector was able to take. Today there is news that there has been a sharp cut in prices, specifically in the southern region. We need to confirm while our channel check suggested that prices have been increased. That is something that we need to try and understand at this point. 

Another factor is there is news that some of the builders and developers have complained to the government about cartelisation among the cement players. Given these news flows, there would be some solution. The underlying business fundamentals continue to remain strong. There are select companies in the sector which we believe are doing well and any such decline can be an opportunity for fundamental investors to look at the sector and start investing. 


What exactly is your take on NBFCs? Would you be fairly stock specific within the basket?NBFCs has been a sector where we had previously seen the entire basket doing well. However, in the last few months post the IL&FS issue, clearly the men have been separated from the boys. The likes of Bajaj Finance which has clearly not got impacted by any of the liquidity issues continue to report very strong numbers. While there are a whole host of other companies which have got impacted either because of exposure to an IL&FS or because of the ALM mismatch and the liquidity squeeze that led to a higher cost of funds. 

It is clearly a selective bet on the entire NBFC space. We would be a bit cautious not going over the board given that although the Q4 numbers were in line to marginally better for the entire pack. The sector could remain under pressure going by the commentaries, after the quarterly numbers. It is clearly a very selective space. Only a few stocks in the sector that should do well.


From the energy basket, some of the stocks have seen recent spikes in trade. Is there anything that is catching your eye?If you see the energy basket, we had seen how volatile crude has been throughout the year and in one quarter we see inventory gains and in the other quarter, we see inventory losses. Despite that, because of that impact we had seen some of the oil marketing companies correcting a lot. 

From the lows, some of them have now picked up but we believe that the OMCs provide a good opportunity from a long-term investment perspective. There was a huge derating once in the past when the government had restarted the subsidy sharing thing, but that did not continue because oil prices stabilised and now are cooling off. So, that is a space where we see a good valuation comfort. Some of the companies are offering a good cash flow over the next two years.

Indian Oil is our preferred pick in the OMC pack. Bulk of the capex is now behind they do also provide a good dividend yield which forms a base or support for the stock price. From here on, performance should improve given that the crude oil price are mostly like stabilising at current levels.


What about some of the other rate sensitives -- auto, real estate? Are you tracking any of those pockets on the back of whether we might see a move on the policy front?Yes, the rate cut expectation got a little bit more after the GDP numbers came in on Friday and in the last two days, a lot of that got factored in some of the auto and real estate names. It has been one of the worst periods for the entire auto pack. So we do not see any recovery in the auto volume numbers any time soon. 

However, some of the companies’ valuations have become attractive from a longer term perspective. From that angle, Maruti looks good to us from a long-term investment perspective. One can gradually look at some of the two-wheeler names, basically on back of expectation. Any reform policy which the government will fast track to kickstart the rural economy. should benefit some of the two-wheeler names as well.


What are your views on Zee Entertainment? The deadline is fast approaching the management is talking about two players?Yes, with regards to Zee we have seen that while the underlying core business performance has been pretty strong, the stock has been reacting to the news developments with regards to the promoter stake sale. There have been market news about two players or the management. The promoter is talking about two players and in between, we heard that Sony is doing a due diligence. If at all, they were to able to execute one of these deals, the likes of a global giant media giant like Sony will be taken very positively. 


What is the outlook when it comes to IT?The IT results have been pretty good in line with expectations on the overall Q4 numbers. There have been some issues with regards to how the growth can pan out. Some of the companies have definitely lowered the growth guidance on the lower end of the guidance band. The issue has been on the margins front, the cost pressures that they have been unable to take care of, But despite that, the overall performance has been much better on a year on year basis. Companies like TCS, Infy they have reported good earnings growth and that is what the market has rewarded. 

Going forward, based on the commentaries, growth seems to be pretty steady; cost pressures in terms of the outsourcing cost, visa cost which has gone up will take some time and to that extent we could see some decline in margins on a year-on-year basis which would keep the profitability under check and to that extent of bearing the cost of any movement in rupee which could benefit companies like TCS which trades at a fair valuation and hence we have a neutral rating.

However, companies like Infy where we are seeing the earnings growth catch up with TCS, the rerating is continuing and that is where we believe that a decent upside could be and that is our preferred pick in the IT pack."

8,2019-06-08,Zee,"Domestic equity investors took money off the table for the week ended June 7, sending benchmark equity indices down for the first time in four weeks. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty kicked off the truncated week on a positive note after Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched Rs 1 lakh crore in May 2019 as compared to Rs 94,016 crore in the year-ago period.

Markets participants ignored CSO data which showed that economic growth slowed to a 5-year low of 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, pushing India behind China, due to a poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

However, sentiments got dampened after a private weather forecaster Skymet Weather said the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. Also, lack of a comment from RBI on the on-going NBFC crisis overshadowed the 25 bps rate cut and change in stance.

However, some buying on Friday capped the downside.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Markets started the holiday trimmed week on a positive note. The momentum was triggered by weakness in crude oil prices and hopes of RBI cutting rates in the bi-monthly policy. But the momentum was short-lived and markets traded lower after RBI cut repo rates by 25 bps and changed stance to accommodative from neutral that came mostly in expected lines. No further comments by RBI regarding the on-going NBFC funding crisis was taken as a surprise by the market that added to the negativity.”

As a result, the BSE Sensex closed 98.30 points, or 0.25 per cent down at 39,615.90 on June 7 against 39714.20 on May 31. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index closed 52.15 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 11,870.65.

13,2019-06-11,Zee,"Things have started improving both at Axis and ICICI and even at Yes Bank. I would not get too perturbed with the rating downgrades which are coming now, says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Chairman, Inditrade Capital, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts: 

Do you think the polarised nature of move in the largecap space will continue?It has been continuing for quite some time. If you see what is happening – the largecap stocks have generally been doing well, whereas midcap and smallcaps have actually been beaten out of shape and this has been continued for a consistently long period of time. 

Even in a largecap universe, there is a section of stocks which are attracting all the attention and liquidity whereas a large portion of the market is being neglected. There are reasons for it and the reason predominately has to do with the sector and its fortune as things stand today. If you look at the automobile sector, there are concerns and the sector has been beaten down. Banking is doing yo-yo. Today the banking stocks are moving up but by and large, it has also been under pressure. Pharma is not the market favourite at this stage. 

Focus has continuously been on the darlings of the market which is the HDFC twins, Bajaj twins SBI and Reliance. There is a significant amount of liquidity available in the market both domestic as well as international. To a great extent, that is keeping the market buoyant.


Banks would be selective and one of the key things to watch out for. How are you reading into these downgrades that 
are coming in for some of these names. DHFL of course, got a derating earlier; there was a downgrade in ICICI as well as Axis Bank earlier. Now, we are getting news flow that Moody has placed Yes Bank’s rating under review for downgrade. How do you read into these downgrades?I would like to say it is too little too late. These rating changes should have come at least one year or at least six months back. As things stand today, we believe that things have started improving -- be it Yes Bank, ICICI Bank or Axis Bank or even DHFL. At this stage, the downgrade is a matter of academic interest. The market will react to this kind of negative rating coming in but the reality is, they have been wise after the event. The event when they had the problems is past them and they are now on the path to recovery. Yes Bank will take quite some time before they are back to where they were or even close to the kind of performance they had shown earlier. They will have definitely challenges in raising funds from the market either equity or debt. 

Axis and Yes Bank also are having their share of challenges but definitely things have started improving both at Axis and ICICI and also at Yes Bank. I would not get too perturbed with the rating downgrades which are coming now. 


What do you make of the entire situation on DHFL? Part payment was done over the weekend. They got Rs 800 crore from Blackstone and paid another tranche which was due to NCD investors yesterday. Would you say that it is best to completely avoid the stock now?Unless you are really somebody with a strong heart and an aggressive investor, it is better to avoid. But having said that, I like to point out that they have been trying to do all the right things. They have sold their subsidiary and associate companies like Aadhar Housing Finance for which they got payment from Blackstone. They have also sold Avanse which is education loan company and Warburg is supposed to be paying for that very soon. 

So all this liquidity is coming back in the group. Liquidity is going to be distributed between DHFL as well as the promoters. They will have a good amount to settle with the debtors, which they are trying to do. Also remember they are looking at the change in management kind of a scenario where they are working on getting new investors in DHFL itself. 

The problem probably will get resolved within a period of time. There is some more pain, and probably there will be some more of this kind of uncertainties coming because there is a regulatory approval process post the transaction also. That sometimes takes an unusually long time which probably should be, considering the circumstances but that is reality. 

We have to be prepared for a tough ride if you are holding on to DHFL or planning to buy DHFL but at the end of the day, if you are an aggressive investor, there is no harm in buying DHFL at these beaten down values. You will have a changed management, you will have a functioning company with most of the debts getting cleared very soon.


What is your perspective on some of these deal stocks that are going around,? You mentioned DHFL but there is a Zee which is looking out to do a deal as is Dish TV. A lot of other companies are looking to sell some of their non-core assets. Should investors chase this deal market?Absolutely, I am very clear the investors should definitely look at both Zee and Dish TV. Fundamentally, there is absolutely nothing wrong with Zee. In fact, they have been increasing their market share and if you leave aside the sports bouquet which they do not have, in the general entertainment space, they are emerging as leaders, ahead of Star and the combined TRPs also have improved and they are shade behind Star there which has a massive sports bouquet. 

If you look at the performance, that has also been improving continuously. The OTT is a little bit of uncertain at this stage and there are some concerns as to how much money they will be spending on OTT, but leaving that aside, the company has been performing very well. 

The problem lies with the promoters and their other businesses and that is the reason why they need to do a deal and they need to bring in either a strategic investor or maybe a financial investor if they can. That will augur well for the shareholders of Zee Entertainment and there is absolutely no harm in looking at buying into Zee TV at current levels. It has been beaten down and definitely there is an opportunity of value buying here. 

I would say the same thing about Dish. Again there is a transaction in the offing. One does not know with certainty whether the transaction will happen in the manner it is being talked about but if it does happen, a consolidation on that side of the business also will strengthen both the involved players and they would be in a better position to take on competition as a combined entity rather than Dish and Bharti’s direct to home (DTH) business alone. 

It is good for the shareholders of both the entities if the transaction happens, the sooner the transaction happens the better it is and today they are available at a significantly discounted valuation or an attractive valuation and it is definitely worth buying for an aggressive investor. 


What do you make of the insurance sector? Are a lot more deals likely in this sector?Absolutely. This is one sector in BFSI which has been chugging along pretty well. All three listed life insurance players had corrected a bit from where they were but the fact remains that they are looking attractive at current valuation and we expect all three to do well going forward. If somebody has to take a pick, I would probably recommend SBI Life and even the non-insurance players which is ICICI Lombard. This sector also is doing reasonably well. 

As far as Exide is concerned, this was bound to happen at some point of time. They had this 100% life insurance business within the company and at some point of time, they were supposed to bring in a strategic partner to run and scale up the business and that is pretty much what is I believe on the cards. It augurs well for the life insurance business and does augur for Exide standalone as well. 

Exide standalone has been doing pretty well and the opportunity with the electric vehicles coming in on the battery segment is significantly increasing. Exide definitely has the expertise but they probably need to ramp up their capital for starting the additional lines to cater to that demand and at this point of time, some kind of disinvestment from insurance business will provide that capital.


As far as insurance goes, do you think it is at least a high growth area versus some of the other sectors?Absolutely. We all know about the insurance under-penetration story as far as India is concerned and that has got demonstrated on ground by the kind of growth rate private insurance companies have depicted over the last 5-10 years. 

It is a great space even today. The kind of growth which one envisages in this sector particularly the life insurance space is humongous and Exide has been doing pretty well otherwise as well.


Within capital goods and utilities, how would you narrow down the slightly safer bets or the more concrete bets that you see?I am still a little sceptical about the real estate pack. A lot of reforms have taken place in the past 12-18 months. They had the demonetisation, they had the RERA, they had the IndAS -- the new accounting standard and of course, GST. Things are yet to settle down fully as far as this space is concerned. If I have to get into the real estate space, I will stick to the leaders and the relatively debt-free or companies with a lower debt. 

In the Mumbai market, Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties will be my favourites. In the southern markets, Sobha can be looked at definitely. Otherwise, I would like to be cautious on real estate. 

As far as capital goods and infrastructure sectors are concerned, there are a lot of expectations about things improving in the near future. There are people who are talking about green shoots being visible but I will still be a little cautious. There are enough headwinds in the economy. We will have to see how things move, how the monsoon develops and of course, the global trade war headwinds are really uncertain at this stage. So I will be a little cautious. 

If I have to bet on this sector I will probably go for the safe bets. Siemens definitely looks good, the performance has been improving and of course, I will go for the tried and tested Larsen & Toubro. At current valuation, both Siemens and L&T look good."

16,2019-06-13,Zee,"The 19th century had many lessons for the corporate world; the most fascinating was possibly the disruption caused by alternating current.

Factories belonging to a number to flourishing businesses were not designed for AC electricity, and they chose not to revamp their facilities as it was painful and costly. The result: these companies would soon go out of business.

The ones which took the pain and remodelled their facilities quickly not only survived but also became dominant players of their industries.

Morgan Stanley’s India head Ridham Desai shared this anecdote during an interaction with ETNOW to stress why investors need to constantly look for companies that are adapting faster to changing business dynamics. They are the ones that hold value, he said.

Desai calls them Corporate 2.0.

“Companies which are not changing their business models will lose in this environment, and investors need to be very careful while picking such stocks,” Desai said.

The Dalal Street veteran says things like robotics, artificial intelligence are creating the same situation for today’s businesses what AC current had done to 19th Century companies.

Change is key to success in business. “Companies that are transforming as per the need of the environment, as well as consumer behaviour, will only survive in this age of disruptions,” said Desai.

The impact of changing business environment is already visible in sectors like auto, IT, media and FMCG, among others. The external environment and tighter regulations are slowing down auto companies and they now need to quickly upgrade to the reality of electric vehicles.

“Most businesses adapting to new technologies in different parts of their businesses; some are adopting new tech in production , some in distribution. In broadcast entertainment with content digitization and streaming, digital media are the obvious areas of rapid change. But even in these areas, changes take years, sometimes decades. It is not always easy to pick the winners. The losers are far easier to identify. Rapid change in an industry sometimes throws up completely new beneficiaries,” said Abhishek Basumullick, Kolkata-based value investor and Chief Investment Advisor, Intelsense Capital. 

The IT industry is being forced to adapt to an environment of digitisation and robotics, while FMCG firms are being forced to change product mix to cater to a more health-conscious consumer.

“The IT sector is seeing a lot of disruptions, adaptation to new technology. Companies have adjusted their business models, accordingly,” says Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.

The brokerage is today mildly bullish on the IT services space.

“Within the IT services space, large-caps will give you 8-12 per cent return per annum but we will have to be a little more careful about the midcaps. The risk-reward will be higher, because the base of these companies are smaller, the risk they have taken and the niche areas they want to get into are limited. In case something goes wrong or the managements are not able to adapt to changing requirements, the smaller players could come under pressure,” said Jasani.

Traditional cable distribution businesses are being challenged by digital distributors like OTT platforms and live streaming apps, while in the content consumption space itself, the demand is changing fast.

“Investors need to look at business models on a case to case basis and understand the impact of new technologies on their businesses,” said Basumallick.

Media consumption on mobile internet has gone up from 9.4 minutes daily in 2013 to 54 minutes this year. It is expected to be the highest across mediums, with consumers likely to spend 79 minutes a day by 2021, says media agency Zenith.

Reliance Industries’ telecom arm Jio, Bharti Airtel, Zee Entertainment, Eros Media and Vodafone Idea are all getting into the live streaming businesses.

“Visionary entrepreneurs change their strategies with changing economy and business dynamics. I see Reliance Industries as one such company that has changed its business models from a pure-play energy player to retail, media and internet-telephony,” says G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research and Advisory."

19,2019-06-13,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities had a seesaw session on Thursday, amid weak global cues and stock-specific adverse news.

A sharp rise in crude oil prices following attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz and rupee's fall against the dollar weighed on investor sentiment.

Sensex pared most losses to end marginally lower by 15 points, on support from HDFC twins, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank. Nifty ended eight points higher at 11,914.

Here is a lowdown on major highlights of Thursday's session:


236 stocks hit 52-week lows
As many as 236 stocks, including YES Bank, Bayer Cropscience, Biocon, Lupin, Jaiprakash Associates and Central Bank of India, hit 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, Titan, Tata Consultancy Services, Sobha, PNC Infratech, City Union Bank and Atul were among 44 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


222 stocks hit lower circuits
Manpasand Beverages, Reliance Communications, Eros International Media, Omkar Speciality Chemicals and Mohota Industries were among 222 stocks that hit lower circuits on BSE. Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Indiabulls Integrated Services, Uniply Industries and GPT Infraprojects were among 106 stocks that hit upper circuits. 


176 stocks signal fall

YES Bank plunges 13%
Shares of YES Bank closed 12.96 down at Rs 117.20, extending losses into the second session in a row, after foreign brokerage UBS cut its target price on the stock to Rs 90 from Rs 170 earlier, a drop of 47 per cent. The brokerage expects more asset-quality pressure, given the bank’s higher exposure to stressed companies and lower recognition of these loans as gross non-performing loans. 


IndusInd slips over 5% 
Shares of IndusInd Bank fell 4.96 per cent to close at Rs 1,490.05 after UBS downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’, cutting price target to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,700.

Shares of Reliance Home Finance tanked 11.73 per cent to Rs 15.05 while those of Reliance Capital settled 3.54 per cent lower at Rs 84.40 after auditor Price Waterhouse & Co (PwC) informed the ministry of corporate affairs about certain alleged irregularities in the books of accounts of the two AGAG group firms. Reliance Capital rejected PwC observations, saying they were ‘completely baseless and unjustified’.


DHFL cracks 10%
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) closed 9.75 per cent down at Rs 84.25 amid reports that the promoters were in talks with private equity firms and are expecting to raise $1 billion (about Rs 6,900 crore) by selling nearly 50 per cent of their holdings.

23,2019-06-17,Zee,"Smart money, a term used for capital controlled by institutional investors, market mavens, and other financial professionals and which supposedly chase smart stocks, has taken a heavy beating on Dalal Street since January 2019.

And small investors who blindly follow institutional investors and investing icons to pick stocks, too, have taken a big knock, as some of the stocks, known to be institutional favourites, have been downgraded by brokerages and credit rating agencies, triggering sharp drop in share prices.

Data showed that institutional investors, including both foreign and domestic money managers, held in excess of 35 per cent in 142 companies on NSE as of March 31. As many as 80 of these stocks destroyed up to 80 per cent of wealth year-to-date. 

Some of the names on the list included Yes Bank, Zee Entertainment, Manpasand Beverages and Reliance Infrastructure, which have declined 15-80 per cent between January 1 and June 13 this year amid concerns over corporate governance issues, accounting irregularities, fund diversion and bad management decisions.

Ajay Jaiswal, President – Strategies & Head of Research at Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management said, “Companies which underperformed due to issues like corporate governance and misappropriation of funds do not come up. I always advise clients to exit such companies and take a position in better ones.”

“Institutional holdings do not certify that it is a good company. It can be just one of the criteria while buying a stock, as one can safely assume that some research has been before institutional investors took a position on it,” says AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets.

Analysts have since turned cautious on stocks like Yes Bank and Zee Entertainment despite healthy institutional holdings. 

On Monday, Yes Bank shares hovered near its five-year low of Rs 115 after UBS cut its price target to Rs 90 from Rs 170 last week. Moody’s has placed the bank’s rating under review for a downgrade, which has also weighed on the counter. The stock, once an FII darling, is down 36 per cent year to date and 65 per cent in last one year. Prior to that, the scrip had advanced over 265 per cent between June 2013 and June 2018. 

Likewise, Zee Entertainment, which had advanced over 150 per cent during 2013-18, is down 37 per cent in last one year. Institutional investors held 56 per cent stake in the company as of March 2019, according to corporate database Ace Equity.

Manpasand Beverages shares witnessed severe selling pressure in the recent past after some of the company’s officials were taken into judicial custody following a search by the Commissioner of Central GST and Customs. The stock is down 61 per cent so far this year.

For those who got stuck with investments in Yes Bank and Zee Entertainment, Prabhakar has a word of advice.

 “Zee has a good business, but the promoter has a problem. As long as he does not exit and a good buyer does not emerge, I don’t think we are going to see anything interesting on this counter. In the case of Yes Bank, we would like to wait and watch how the new management handles the situation. The ongoing pain will not go anytime soon. There is enough time to buy the Yes Bank stock.”

Among other institutional favourite stocks, Jain Irrigation, CG Power, Arvind, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Apollo Tyres, Page Industries, M&M, Karur Vysya Bank, Religare Enterprises, M&M Financial Services have also declined in double digits since January this year. 



On the other hand, stocks like Info Edge, Just Dial, Manappuram Finance, DCB Bank, Axis Bank, Satin Creditcare Network, Sobha, Kajara Ceramics and Ujjivan Financial Services have rallied between 20-55 per cent since January 1. 

“Most of the time, the risk-reward ratio of a stock turns positive after an institutional investment, as they do their own research before picking a stock. However, one should do homework before buying such stocks. It is often difficult for small investors to do stock research on their own,” said Jaiswal.

Institutional investors, including foreign players as well fund houses, together have poured in over Rs 65,000 crore in Indian equities on a year-to-date basis. 

VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said FPI flows have increased in recent time after the NDA government received a massive mandate. Going forward, FPI flows are expected to continue in the light of the selloff in global bond market triggered by fears of a global economic slowdown.”

Prabhakar is bullish on companies like Avenue Supermarts, Federal Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. He said HDFC is the best bet in NBFC space and HDFC Bank can be a good buy on correction."

26,2019-06-18,Zee,"MUMBAI: The Essel Group is in talks to sell its solar energy portfolio and US-based luxury wellness destination YO1 Centre, as part of ongoing efforts at the Subhash Chandra-led conglomerate to raise money to reduce debt.

Essel Infraprojects, people in the know said, is in an advanced stage of talks with the Adani Group’s renewable energy company, Adani Green Energy, to sell part of its 300 megawatt of operational solar energy portfolio for around Rs 3,000 crore.

This is not the first time the group is trying to sell the solar assets. The Essel Group, which had put its infrastructure business on the block early last year, had entered into an agreement with private equity investor Actis to sell the entire solar energy portfolio of 685 MW of installed and under-construction projects for around Rs 4,700 crore. The deal, however, got scrapped earlier this year.

“After the deal with Actis fell through, the company decided to offer the solar portfolio in piecemeal. Talks with the Adani Group is for part of the operational portfolio of over 300 MW,” one of the people said “(The) Essel Group does not comment on any speculations,” a spokesperson said. “The stake sale process of the group’s infra assets is in (an) advanced stage. Any additional details cannot be shared due to confidentiality agreements,” the sokesperson added.




The Adani Group did not respond to an email seeking comment till press time Monday. Adani Green Energy is one of the largest renewable energy players in India with a capacity of 2.9 gigawatt of Solar and 1.7 GW of wind energy portfolio.

YOGA Centre: Chandra's pet project
The Essel Group has also initiated the process to sell YO1 Centre, its US-based luxury wellness destination and among the pet projects of chairman Chandra, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The 1,310-acre property, located in the Catskill Mountains of Monticello, New York, was inaugurated last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi through videoconference on World Yoga Day.

“The Essel Group is ready to sell YO1Centre and we are expecting it to generate around $250-300 million,” said one of the people. On this, the Essel Group spokesperson said, “The group is constantly exploring and evaluating strategic partnership opportunities to enhance the offerings of the wellness centre.”

Chandra had bought the erstwhile Kutsher’s Country Club, once an all-inclusive getaway for the Jewsish community, in 2014 for $8.18 million and had decided to convert it into a $250 million yoga centre for wealthy New Yorkers. While the initial plan was to open YO1in 2016, it took the group three years.

Finally, on June 21, 2018, the centre was inaugurated. Chandra had expected it to generate $100 million in annual revenue by third year of operation. The 131-room resort currently offers 50 therapy rooms for six customised ayurvedic ‘pathways to wellness’, starting $599 per night. The debt-laden Essel Group is planning to generate Rs 20,000 crore by selling its infrastructure business, including roads, power transmission and solar energy assets to trim its and promoters’ debt. Chandra is also in talks with potential buyers to sell up to 50% of promoters’ holding in Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

Lenders have given Chandra time till September 30 to repay debt. In an earlier interaction, Chandra had told ET that he was confident of meeting the September 30 deadline. “Our core objective is to come out clean from this by repaying everyone’s money and that too happily,” he had said."
27,2019-06-18,Zee,"HDFC Mutual Fund has decided to buy Rs 500 crore worth of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of the Essel Group from the debt schemes that have exposure to these securities.

The fund house, in a disclosure to stock exchanges late Monday evening, said it will repay investors in fixed maturity plans (FMPs) that hold Essel-issued securities and are due for maturity until September. The move removes uncertainty among investors, who were concerned that they might not get back their entire investments in case the Subhash Chandra-controlled group failed to sell some of its assets and repay lenders before September.

Late January, asset managers including HDFC MF had agreed not to sell shares of Zee Entertainment they held as collateral and gave time to Essel until September to repay debts. Mutual funds collectively held Rs 7,000 crore worth of Essel papers. HDFC Mutual Fund had exposure to Edison Infrapower and Sprit Infrapower in its portfolio.

“This liquidity arrangement shall only apply in case of FMP schemes (having an exposure to the NCDs issued by the Essel Group), which have either already matured in the month of April, 2019 and/or will mature until the standstill arrangement entered into by the company with Essel Group is in force,” the asset manager said in a statement to the exchanges.

In April, when some FMPs of Kotak and HDFC mutual funds came up for maturity, HDFC had rolled over one of its FMP by 380 days, while Kotak Mutual Fund repaid investors minus their holdings in Essel Group companies. The move did not go down well with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which questioned the legal standing of the agreement between mutual funds and Essel.

Earlier this month, the capital market regulator sent legal notices to Milind Barve, managing director of HDFC Mutual Fund, some top officials and HDFC Trustee Co for extending the maturity of its FMP because of Essel Group’s inability to repay. In May, Sebi had issued separate show cause notices to HDFC Mutual Fund and Kotak Mutual Fund seeking details of the terms of their investments in Essel Group’s debt securities.

While at least eight fund houses hold Essel papers in various schemes, Sebi sent show cause notices to two fund houses because their FMPs came up for maturity."

32,2019-06-24,Zee,"After the initial euphoria over the return of the BJP government, the equity market is looking uncertain again. There are several reasons why investors are shorn of confidence. The domestic economy is facing a consumption slowdown. NBFCs are reeling under a liquidity squeeze, forcing many to scale back operations. Market breadth remains very narrow.The trade war between an increasingly bellicose US and an equally unyielding China threatens to escalate further. Crude oil prices remain vulnerable to tensions erupting afresh in the Middle East. Bond markets across the globe have been flashing warning signs in recent months.Yet, there are some positive signs too. Domestic inflation remains low and interest rates are on the decline. With several conflicting indicators and mixed trends, investors can’t be faulted for their diffidence.How should investors navigate this maze of information which can help them make better investment decisions? Firstly, it is critical that investors interpret this news flow correctly. ET Wealth identified six critical signals that are defining the market sentiment. In the pages ahead, we examine each of these trends in detail and interpret the same for readers. Hopefully, this will help them take timely decisions to adjust their investment portfolios to improve their returns.Market breadth continues to be narrowIn the past year or so, only a handful of stocks have actually gone up, while the broader market has been listless. The market breadth, which is the ratio of stocks that are advancing or declining, has turned decidedly negative in the past three months. The ratio of advances-to-declines on the NSE has dropped from 1.08 in March to 0.59 in June. So, more stocks are losing value than seeing an uptick.More stocks declining than advancingThe market breadth has further narrowed in the past few months.

Experts say this is an outcome of a highly polarised corporate earnings growth. “Only a handful of companies are delivering double-digit earnings growth sustainably. Money is chasing this select set of stocks,” says Kunj Bansal, CIO and Partner, Acepro Advisors. When the market breadth narrows, the markets typically gravitate towards this creamy top layer of ‘quality’ stocks.5 scrips gave 97% of BSE 100 gains in a yearWhen the breadth narrows, markets gravitate towards quality stocks.

Analysts expect this phenomenon to continue for some time. The corporate showing in the coming months will give a clearer picture. The festival season will be in full swing and the impact of government spending during the election season will seep through by then. Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert, feels broader market participation is not expected in next few months. “I doubt the market will react positively to announcements in the Budget. Investors are more likely to wait for green shoots to be clearly visible.”Mid-cap valuations revert to discountWhen Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, mid-caps were trading at a significant discount to large-caps. But Modi’s election sparked a multi-year uptick in mid-caps. Expectations of faster growth in mid-caps on the back of a business-friendly government sent valuations soaring to stratospheric levels. However, with earnings not keeping pace with the rise in stock prices, the sentiment has now soured against midcaps. With frontline indices delivering healthy return on the back of a select few bellwether stocks, the valuation differential to mid-cap index is now reverting to near pre-2014 levels. The Nifty Midcap 100 index now trades at a PE of 31.5 compared to 61 barely a year ago. With this sharp correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has now become attractive, say experts. Many are suggesting that investors use this window to hike mid-cap exposure.Mid-cap valuation premium almost erodedAfter the correction, the overheated mid-cap segment has become more attractive.

The PE multiples of several mid-cap stocks have slid sharply. However, investors should not jump in because the mid-cap segment remains vulnerable to the slowdown and any liquidity crunch in the system. As the market focus shifts back to earnings growth and economic realities, any disappointments will push share prices further down.Valuations of some mid-caps have declined sharplyDespite the correction, some mid-caps are still not cheap.     Company Current PE 1 year ago PE   Indian Hotels Co  61.1 156.2   Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail  51.7 90.9   Jubilant Foodworks  54.2 85.4   Dilip Buildcon  30.3 57.4   Quess Corp  35.3 58.7   Bharat Forge  20.0 43.1   Godrej Agrovet  29.2 50.3   Sterlite Technologies  13.3 33.3   Sun TV Network  15.0 33.6   Escorts  14.7 32.6 Experts say that investors should stick to quality mid-caps. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital insists the valuations in mid-caps seem cheap on a relative basis. “These were overvalued earlier, and have not really become cheap now. Good quality mid-caps are still expensive,” he says. Sankaran Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, insists that investors should only take exposure to mid-caps through the SIP route with a longer investing horizon.Consumption demand is moderatingFor years, India’s consumption story powered the economy even when private investment flagged or global demand waned. In recent months, however, this consumption engine has developed a snag. Weak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a slowdown in demand. “Even structural trends are subject to cycles and there is little doubt that consumption is now showing signs of strain,” says Vetri Subramaniam, Group President & Head-Equity, UTI Mutual Fund. Automobile sales have steadily dwindled since October 2018. Nearly all major carmakers have revised sales projections downward citing weak consumer demand. Vehicle makers are cutting back production to clear the piling inventory at dealers. There is also a visible slump in demand for discretionary items like refrigerators, washing machines and other appliances. Even low-ticket essentials like toothpaste, shampoo and hair oil are reporting weak volumes.Consumer stocks have had a tough time on the bourses. However, barring a few exceptions, valuations have not softened much from earlier levels. On the contrary, several consumer stocks have seen multiples expand. Britannia Industries, Dabur India, Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Voltas, Havells India and Titan Company are now significantly more expensive than before. Most consumer stocks will be vulnerable if earnings growth does not match up to market expectations.Many consumer stocks have tankedWeak consumption metrics across sectors indicate a demand slowdown.      Company CMP (Rs) PE  1 year price change (%)   Zee Entertainment Enterprises   338  20.7 -39.72   Mahindra & Mahindra   624  24.2 -31.61   Hero MotoCorp   2,648  15.6 -27.83   Maruti Suzuki India   6,582  26.5 -26.82   Page Industries   20,039  56.7 -25.36   TVS Motor Company   458  32.5 -22.98   United Spirits   539  59.5 -19.07   Godrej Consumer Products   658  28.7 -15.01   Avenue Supermarts   1,298  253.9 -14.67   Tata Power Company   65  8.0 -14.16 The ongoing monsoon will play a key role in how the consumption story pans out. An abundant monsoon is a crucial driver of rural sentiment and discretionary consumption. A week’s delay in onset of rains in the country lends no relief. Further, the India Meteorological Department has suggested that the strong El Nino weather pattern, which will keep rains muted, will likely only fade by August. This doesn’t bode well for consumer discretionary stocks, as lower disposable incomes will keep demand for high-value items subdued. Says Gupta, “Much of the slack is actually pent-up demand that is bound to come through in the coming months. But things could get worse before improving.”NBFCs facing severe liquidity crunchExperts say the consumption slowdown has been precipitated by tight liquidity conditions— particularly the cash crunch that has crippled NBFCs. With banks and mutual funds refraining from lending money to many such shadow banks since the IL&FS blowout, these have had to scale down their operations. This has shackled growth as NBFCs accounted for nearly a quarter of the credit growth in the past financial year. Much of this lending was for purchase of vehicles, appliances and other items. The revival of consumption partly hinges on the time it takes for liquidity conditions to normalise going ahead.NBFCs are now reworking their business models to tide over the liquidity crunch. The central bank has also proposed norms that will introduce liquidity buffers for NBFCs. As part of the new rules, NBFCs may have to set aside 60% of their net cash flows in government securities starting next year and gradually step it up in a phased manner. This is to ensure that the lenders have enough liquidity to fall back on in case of liquidity stress. But analysts point out these tougher norms could further crimp NBFCs that do not have a well-managed asset-liability situation. “The financially better placed NBFCs with strong sponsor support and well-established positioning in the ecosystem may be able to withstand it better than others,” says Jinay Gala, Senior Analyst, India Ratings and Research.Shares of several NBFCs have taken quite a beating over the past year. The fear of a contagion has led many to dump NBFC shares. Equity mutual funds have also cut their NBFC exposure sharply in recent months. Analysts suggest that investors should stick to NBFCs with strong parentage and healthy asset-liability positions.Several NBFC shares have taken a beatingFear of a contagion from IL&FS episode has led many to dump NBFC shares.

Other analysts, such as Gupta, suggest investors stay away from NBFCs for now. “Several NBFCs have very opaque structures. These firms have a problem and we don’t know the full extent of it yet.”Deleveraging by Indian companies continuesIn the last few years, several highly indebted firms had consciously embarked on reducing their debt burden. India Inc continues on this deleveraging trend. For the third straight year in 2018-19, domestic companies’ net debt-equity ratio showed improvement. In 2013-14, 61 BSE200 index companies had a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one, while 24 firms exhibited leverage in excess of three times. According to latest available data for these companies, 57 companies have a debt-to-equity ratio higher than one and only 20 companies reported a ratio higher than three. Further, the solvency position of these companies has also improved. Bansal argues, “The deleveraging exercise will separate the men from the boys. Stronger names will emerge leaner and fitter.”Many companies deleveraged in recent yearsThe solvency positions of these companies have also improved.

Data as on 17 JuneMajor corporations including Reliance Industries and Tata Group have also kickstarted a deleveraging exercise. RIL has partially reduced its debt by transferring Jio’s fibre and telecom tower assets and liabilities to two Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). The conglomerate is also planning stake sales in its refining and telecom businesses. Tata Steel, which accounts for nearly 90% of the Tata Group’s debt, plans to bring down its Rs 1 lakh crore debt burden to Rs 70,000 crore over the next few years. This process of deleveraging will improve profitability, but will take some time to seep through, reckon analysts. Gupta asserts, “Deleveraging is a lengthy process. It is best to stay away from highly leveraged companies even if they take steps to repair the balance sheet.”Inverted yield curve indicates recessionIn recent months, a prominent indicator of economic health has been flashing red across countries. The yields on long-term bonds are now lower than on short-term bonds. The yield is the return an investor gets on a bond. Typically, investors demand higher yields from longer-term bonds to compensate for the higher risk of keeping their money tied up for a longer period. But when yields on shorter term bonds rise above longer term bonds, it signals that the bond market is expecting trouble ahead. Such yield inversions have preceded several recessions in the past. The recent inversion in the US yield curve is the first since 2007, when the subprime crisis sent the economy into recession.Some nations are witnessing an inverted yield curveCountries not showing inversion now have done so in the recent past.     Country 2 year bond yield (%) 10 year bond yield (%)   Lebanon 11.88 11.04   Mexico 7.86 7.64   Canada 1.38 1.43   Japan -0.21 -0.13   Czech Republic 1.45 1.54   South Korea 1.49 1.60   Taiwan 0.49 0.70   United States 1.87 2.11   Singapore 1.70 1.96   Philippines 4.94 5.23   Norway 1.10 1.41 Apart from the US, several countries are witnessing the inverted yield curve. The phenomenon is not limited to developed countries. Even developing economies like Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Philippines have all flashed red at some point. Indian bond markets have not ventured into this territory yet. Also, experts maintain that the yield curve inversion is merely a transient phase and bond yields should normalise in the coming months."

35,2019-06-25,Zee,"The economy is on a downtrend and perhaps now there is an acceptance also on the authority side that there is a problem and we need to solve this, says Daljeet Singh Kohli, Fund Manager, Valentis Advisors. Excerpts from his interview with ETNOW.



There was a strong move today in the markets. Would you say this is a pre-budget rally? We are just 10 days away really from the Union Budget but we all know that the elbow room is pretty tight for the finance minister.Today’s move is technical in nature. At some point, you would see some buying emerging. I guess the market has turned very volatile in the last 15 days. Every day for half an hour, it appears as if all the bulls are on the way and over the next half an hour, all the bears are there. So it is very volatile, very difficult to trade. It is good that we do not have to trade. We are happy, we just have to watch it. 

We are still maintaining that the market will remain range-bound till the budget unless we see any stimulus package or any kind of announcements which revives economic growth. Problem is that the economy is actually on a downtrend and perhaps now there is an acceptance also on the authority side, that there is a problem and we need to solve this. 

The issue is whether they are just going to leave it that point after recognising the issue. Sometimes it is not necessary that you only have to do things where you need to spend a lot of money. You can actually give hints to the market, you can give some policy announcements which may play out over a period of time. Markets take cues from that. Right now, the spirit has to be revived. I think there is a lot which authorities can do. I do not believe that we do not have financial elbow room to do much. We can do many things beyond that also. So, we are expecting something to happen there and if that does not happen, then we will be in very difficult times. We are expecting that on July 5, there would be a good breakout move.

ET Now: What is your take on cement and what within cement, looks like a good buying opportunity now?
Daljeet Singh Kohli: We are quite positive and in fact we have increased our weightages to a couple of cement stocks in the two-three months when the rally had just started and it is giving good returns. We continue to maintain a positive view on the larger ones which have actually PAN India presence and where the EBITDA per tonne is likely to increase much faster than the other peers. 

The basic criteria to select the stocks is EBITDA per tonne which will depend upon two things. a) The pricing power or capability of the company to take the price hikes which will again is a factor of the region where they are. We are seeing how they maintained good price hikes in two-three months and some of it has been rolled back. The north again is seeing some pick up there and it is again maintaining good price hike.

So, depending upon these two-three factors we select the stock. We are positive on the sector as a whole also and right now, we are carrying three or four stocks in these sectors in our portfolio.


Given what we are seeing on the move today, and as you do not trade, it is a very short term kind of perspective. On a day like today, you are seeing buying coming in at lower levels or slightly more in the high beta names opposed to other days when markets have just seemed incredibly quiet and cautious on any kind of news flow. 
Either way, we are stuck in a range. At this point, what would be your call going forward? Would you be looking at cyclicals, consumption? Which are the pockets of the market that you are looking at?
Pockets of the market that are of interest to us is infrastructure. We have actually taken positions in that and we want to increase it there because we feel there is some likelihood of private capex coming in mainly because in last so many years, nothing has happened. Therefore, if there is anything positive in the budget, that will give a big boost and we might see a large number of announcements coming in. 

That sector will be of interest to us. We already have the largest infrastructure company in our portfolio. Then the other pocket of interest is speciality chemicals which has some kind of tailwind to it, mainly because of many of the issues with China are beneficial to us. Our companies have developed themselves into those global kind of players who can actually match the requirements of the global buyers.

Earlier people were not looking at India because our companies were very small and lacked credibility. Those issues are now over and in the next 3-4 years, we can build on that. 

Our companies in speciality chemicals, agrochemicals can play out very well. Those are the ones which we will continue to back and probably keep on adding. Cement, private sector banks are the other themes that we will continue.


What about pharmaceuticals? Is there merit in looking at any of the pharma names?Pharma is a very stock-specific story because it is a very heterogeneous sector. Each company is different. They all have different strategies to play regions wise, therapy wise, You have to be very careful about choosing the company. 

The FDA issues will always remain because the more these companies try to gain market share in their country, the stricter they would be and compliance will is going to be tougher from here. We should not assume that anyway there is going to be a let up from FDA side.

The only thing they can do is all our companies have to gear up to meet those requirements. Again, it will depend on the promoters and the company background. What kind of importance do they give to compliance issues? As of now we have not added any pharma stock in the portfolio but we are looking at some of them very positively.

Valuation wise, they have become attractive. We need to see how from here onwards, how they build up on incremental sales or the new product pipeline like speciality chemicals. There are a lot of hopes on the speciality pipeline from many of these companies. Let those numbers play out for one or two quarters. It is time to look at pharma from now onwards.


What your outlook on Zee Entertainment? I will not be able to speak anything on the specific stock because of compliance reasons.


How are you looking at the auto sector? , A lot of issues seem to be plaguing it. Wat is it that you like within the space?We are waiting for the numbers to play out for maybe one or two more months. The gut feeling is that probably we are coming to an end to this bad phase and probably things will start improving in the next few months. But we will have to see those numbers. 

When we talk to some of the distributors, some are very pessimistic whereas some others are still hopeful and they feel that probably there is too much negativity going on but things are not as bad as what is being made out."

6,2019-07-03,Zee,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Wednesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 14.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

HSBC has maintained buy rating on Havells India and raised the target price to Rs 850 from Rs 775, implying a PE ratio of 45 times the FY21 estimated earnings. Improved access and availability of electricity and strong government impetus on housing underpin a promising outlook for Havells, said HSBC. Havells intends to more than double R&D investment rate to 2 per cent of sales from 0.8 per cent currently, said HSBC. Shares of Havells India ended up 0.35 per cent at Rs 790.20 on Tuesday.


Nomura has maintained buy rating on Zee Entertainment Enterprises with a target price of Rs 522. The brokerage values Zee Entertainment based on 25 times PE ratio on FY21. Nomura said it is factoring in 12 per cent /11 per cent advertisement/subscription growth in FY20 but it expects near term growth to remain weak. Improvement in the balance sheet parameters after the promoter stake sale will be important to alleviate the concerns, it said. Shares of Zee Entertainment ended down 0.74 per cent at Rs 356.20 on Tuesday.


Edelweiss has maintained high conviction buy rating on its top stock pick, ICICI Bank, and raised the target price to Rs 585 from Rs 493. As per Edelweiss, the new management is shifting focus to customer profitability at operating level, decentralising decision making and single-mindedly focusing on more than 20 per cent core profit growth. A focused approach, structural changes and cyclical tailwinds ensure a sustainable franchise, the brokerage said. Shares of ICICI Bank ended down 0.42 per cent at Rs 436.80 on Tuesday.

CLSA has maintained buy rating on ITC with a target price of Rs 365. The mediumterm outlook for GST collections is relatively better as ‘invoice matching’ based return system will be rolled out in the second half of FY20, said CLSA. However, until that happens and the GST growth trajectory improves, concerns rise on the ITC stock, which faces uncertainty due to a potential rise in cess that has not seen a change in the past two years, said CLSA. Shares of ITC ended down 0.4 per cent at Rs 273.75 on Tuesday.

Nomura has maintained reduce rating on CEAT and lowered target price to Rs 817 from Rs 980. CEAT is a play on consumer-focused tyre segments such as passenger vehicles/two-wheelers but competition is rising in the two-wheeler segment, said Nomura. The stock is currently trading at 7.5 times FY21 EV-Ebitda, which is expensive under a scenario of deteriorating ROCEs and flattish earnings over FY19-21, said Nomura. Shares of CEAT ended down 1.31 per cent at Rs 914.75."

9,2019-07-04,Zee,"MUMBAI: US cable major Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, and Atairos, a $4-billion investment company led by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis, is looking to team up with PE fund Blackstone and James Murdoch’s family office Lupa Systems to bid for Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), said people in the know.

The consortium is currently involved in due diligence even as Facebook, the world’s largest social media platform, has sent feelers to explore a potential deal. Both sides have engaged in management meetings but the talks are very preliminary in nature and might not translate into a deal, warned the sources mentioned above.

ET was the first to report in its February 19 edition about Comcast and Atairos teaming up for the Subhash Chandra flagship. Subsequently, Lupa and Blackstone joined the grouping.


Others
While Comcast will be leading the consortium, Murdoch is expected to act as the local partner on the ground and take up a small stake. Lupa also cannot have more than 9-10% stake in ZEE, as part of a non-compete agreement with the Walt Disney Company after Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox (including Star India) to Disney.

“The India team of Lupa are ex-Star… so they have local experience and are aware of the local regulations and market dynamics. They are acting as the catalyst to stitch it all together,” said an official privy to the ongoing discussions.

The key issue will be control, and the exact quantum of stake.


VALUATION MISMATCH KEY POTENTIAL DEAL-BREAKER
While the ZEE promoters want to stay on to run the business, the potential buyers are keen to take control after triggering an open offer or get a definitive path to control, even if ZEE’s managing director Punit Goenka stays on in an executive role initially. At current prices, half the promoters stake would fetch Rs 6,603 crore. The promoters, however, have been seeking significant premium. The valuation mismatch remains a key potential deal-breaker.

“We are progressing well and with political uncertainty behind us, we hope to sign a binary agreement by July,” Goenka had told analysts after the company’s last quarterly results. As per the management, the deal with a potential financial buyer is expected to be consummated earlier than with a strategic buyer as the latter has to be approved by CCI, which, as per management, will take 30-45 days from the date of the binding agreement.

Mails sent to Comcast, Blackstone, Facebook and Atairos did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.

A ZEE spokesperson said that the stake sale is at an advanced stage and any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to “confidentiality agreements”. Essel Group is confident to close the deal well within the purview of the timelines agreed with the lenders,” he added.

The deal will give a breather to Chandra, whose Essel Group is facing severe debt crisis. Chandra had, last year, announced his plans to sell half of the promoters’ then 41% stake in the company.

It has been trying to sell businesses and assets across various verticals — power transmission, roads, renewables — to reduce group leverage of Rs 13,000 crore. The promoters had recently struck a deal for three of their 12 road projects with Canada’s CDPQ that will help them raise funds worth Rs 3,500 crore. They have also been in discussions with Adani for its solar parks and with Bharti for merging their DTH businesses.

Last November, ZEE announced that its promoters, led by Chandra, plan to sell up to 50% stake to a strategic partner in order to deleverage their balance sheet. Subsequently, the management has indicated it is open to selling over 50% of holdings in the firm as part of the asset monetisation efforts.

As per March 2019 disclosures, the promoters own 38.2% of the company, of which 66.18% is pledged with mutual funds, insurers and other financial institutions. However, analysts say it is currently down to 36.7%.

Essel Group owes Rs 7,000 crore to mutual funds and a stake sale has to happen before September 2019 to avoid default.

The $84-billion Comcast, led by Brian Roberts, has been a serial buyer and seller of media assets including cable networks, broadband assets, content providers, internet providers and even animation studios since the late 1980s. It, however, lost out on 21st Century Fox after Walt Disney Co trumped their $65-billion bid last year. The company has been scouting for assets in India and other high-growth markets. ZEE gives them the much-needed India launchpad, said media analysts.

Interestingly, Blackstone bought out Essel Propack from Subhash Chandra’s brother Ashok Goel earlier this year."

18,2019-07-10,Zee,"The market has corrected significantly post the budget and after that correction, there is very little to cheer and move the market up from here, says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Chairman, Inditrade Capital. Excerpts from interview with ETNOW.


Do you expect things to weaken from here or remain in some kind of a narrow sluggish zone?We are very clearly in a sluggish zone. The market has corrected significantly post the budget and after that correction, there is very little to cheer and move the market up from here. The only things which will be able to push the market up would the corporate results. On the other hand, we are not expecting any great fireworks from the companies as well. It is a matter of sideways movement with sluggish undertones for the market for the next fortnight. We will probably remain in a range. Nobody is expecting good results from most of the sectors. Some global news flow can change the contours of the market but that is not visible yet at this stage.


Even though the IndiGo CEO is saying that the daily functioning is same as ever, the stock has been greatly affected. What do you make of this entire mess and more importantly, what does it really mean for investors in the stock?It is a very unfortunate thing to happen. This is kind of a star airline. They have built the airline from ground up, performed incredibly well and they are examples of how to run an airline. It is unfortunate that this is happening at this particular point in time when the opportunities of scaling up the business for them are significant with Jet getting out of business. That’s all I would say as far as this episode is concerned. But it is definitely unfortunate for the shareholders. Yes, the CEO has come out and said that it is not going to affect the functioning of the airline, and to at an extent, that is correct but definitely it will have an impact and the impact will be far-reaching as far as shareholders are concerned and as far as IndiGo is concerned. 

We will have to wait and watch. It is too early to pass a judgement either way and the nervousness displayed by the shareholders is to an extent justified. Aviation is a very delicate and very challenging business. In this business, if you destabilise either internally or externally, there are chances of things getting derailed. Aviation as a space we like at this stage but under these circumstances, the share we will like an investor to buy will be SpiceJet not IndiGo. 


How you are looking at the overall media space? We have forgotten what is going on with Zee Entertainment but that does not mean that investors are not waiting for some sort of deal to actually culminate. Today Dish TV is under a bit of pressure but when do you think we will hear some sort of an announcement on the stake sale front? The Street will like to see a strategic investor with long-term interest in media as well as Indian markets coming in. That will be the ideal scenario. If the price offered by them for the shareholding is at a significant premium to the current market price, that will be the icing on the cake. The way I look at it, the share price will definitely move up and we have been bullish on Zee for quite some time. The turmoil which we have been seeing has to do with the promoters borrowing and their involvement in other businesses. 

Fundamentally, Zee is a strong business. They have been performing very well. They have probably become the leader in the non-sports general entertainment segment (GEC) and that is quite commendable. Overall the ad revenue growth has been reasonable under these circumstances. The only point of concern has been they are spending on the OTT platform. 

One does not know how things will pan out there and how much more money needs to be put in to make it a viable competitor for the biggies -- Netflix, Amazon and Hotstar. That is the grey area. But the coming of a strategic investor will definitely be a significant boost for the counter. In any case, even if a financial investor comes, that the counter will see an upward movement in the near term.


You are not terribly inspired by earnings this time. Are there any specific names that you would be closely eyeing? What would you look to buy at lower levels?There are a few counters and few specific stocks in the financial space which we have been tracking and which we like. In the entire housing finance space, we like Can Fin Homes that has got a pretty retail book and a solid book at that. Also there is corporate action in terms of Can Bank exiting the stock and the strategic investor or a financial investor coming in that is a likely event. All this makes this stock an interesting buy at current stage. 

As far as the PSU banking space is concerned, we like State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda. The recapitalisation of funds which the banks will receive will definitely give a boost to their growth. We estimate that about 30% to 40% of the amount will be used for growth capital and that can change the tone of the business as far as these better capitalised and better managed banks. 

On the private sector banking and NBFC space, we like Bajaj Finance. There has been correction and there has been some concern about the earnings for the quarter on the back of slowdown in demand but fundamentally, if somebody is looking at long term, the quality of earnings is fabulous. They can buy Bajaj Finance at current levels or taking the opportunity of some correction which may happen post the announcement of results. In private banking space, Axis Bank and Federal Bank look good and those can be considered at current levels.


What would you want to hear from Infosys in terms of the management commentary? Also what is your assessment of TCS? When it comes to a heavyweight like this, with valuations looking good, a steady management, earnings growth on track for the long haul -- does TCS remain one of the favourites within the space?I completely agree with the assessment on TCS. There is fundamentally nothing wrong in TCS’s earnings. Everybody expected BFSI to slow down and it has slowed down, may be slightly more than what the market expected. But look at the digital earnings. About one-third of the total business is now digital and they have demonstrated about 40% plus growth in digital and that is the new age business. It is quite commendable the way TCS has pivoted their business in these directions. It is a good story. At such a large scale, you will have some disappointments if you calculate on percentage terms in quarter on quarter basis. But if you want a fundamentally strong sound safe technology bet, TCS is definitely going to remain in our recommended list. 

As far as Infosys is concerned, we will have to carefully watch the results and how they have been pivoting their business -- their BFSI and US earnings -- and also the margin they come up with. We will have to watch the position of the bench because we believe that by and large the bench is exhausted and we will have to see how they have utilised the manpower as far as Infosys is concerned.


Some amount of buying is coming in Sun Pharma in the last couple of sessions and also in some of the other pharma names as well. Is that a trend that you are seeing any merit in?We have been turning bullish on some of the select pharma names for the last three-four months. Sun probably has seen the worst but I will still not go and buy Sun, I will wait. If I have to buy a largecap pharma, probably I will go to Dr Reddy’s. The sign there is pretty promising and their foray into China, the way the business is developing in China is very promising. Apart from that, they have done the right things in terms of their pricing strategy in the US as well as the regulatory remedial actions. 

Overall we believe a target of around Rs 3,100 is achievable within a period of 6 to 12 months as far as Dr Reddy’s is concerned. In the midcap and the other pharma universe, we like Jubilant Pharma and we believe that the specialty pharma basket which they are developing is quite promising as well as the valuation post the US FDA warning. We also believe that the warning probably will not get escalated any further and there is a merit in buying Jubilant Pharma at current levels.


How are you looking at the dynamics for the auto sector because one cannot deny that for nearly a year now, the volume growth has been impacted and sales have been in the slow lane. Maruti is now trading at 5800, Tata Motors Rs 150, Bajaj Auto as well has been under pressure of late, a little bit better in comparison to the others. What is the view on autos? Do you prefer two-wheelers or four-wheelers or any recommendations?You can call this a perfect storm. There is a huge concern on the flowing down of demand. There is also no visibility as to when the demand pickup will happen once again. Juxtapose this against the regulatory and the government position, the government probably is pushing very hard on EVs while the industry is battling this massive slowdown and also in some cases conversion into a better kind of a vehicles there. The government is pushing for a launch of EVs at a very short notice. So, there is a perfect storm as far as automobile sector is concerned. It is better to stay away for sometime rather than plunge into this space. 

I have been maintaining my reasonably bullish view on Maruti as well as Bajaj Auto but at this stage, looking at the determination of the government to move to EVs as early as possible and also looking at continuing slowdown in demand, I am a bit sceptical and I will refrain from buying or recommending a buy in auto."

26,2019-07-15,Zee,"Mumbai: Amazon Prime Video and ZEE5, the over-the-top (OTT) service from Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), are in talks for a partnership, two people with direct knowledge of the development said, in what could be a first of its kind deal in the Indian OTT landscape.

“The two are currently negotiating a platform deal. It may take a month for both the parties to reach an agreement. The discussions are currently around structure of the deal and different models are being explored,” one of the people said.




If the deal goes through, Amazon will add over 1 lakh hours of local content from ZEE across Hindi and other regional languages. Depending on the contours of the deal, ZEE5 could be added or bundled with subscription to Amazon’s Prime service.

The discussions also revolve around whether ZEE5 content should be made available as an in-app or app-in-app format and what the revenue sharing model should be, the second person in the know said.

“ZEE5 is looking to expand its subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) business with the deal,” the person said.

While Amazon India’s spokesperson said the company has “nothing to announce”, ZEE5 did not respond to ET’s email till press time on Sunday.

Prime Video and ZEE5 have signed deals with telecom operators, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone, in the past for distribution, where the OTT subscriptions have been complimentary with various post-paid or prepaid plans. A deal of such magnitude, however, has not been stitched in the OTT space in India.

In the United States, Amazon has an optional add-on service called Prime Video Channels, which lets Prime subscribers add more channels for an additional monthly fee. These channels include HBO, Showtime, CBS and more.

There has been talk that Amazon might launch Prime Video Channels in India too, and that ZEE5 could be the first service on the platform.

While there are great content makers, content-making capability is only one part of the business, said a top executive of a leading video streaming service.

“Acquiring and retaining a customer and running an app is a completely different ball game altogether. Many people are now discovering that it is good to focus on content and partner with other players for distribution. Also, it is not sustainable to have 30-40 OTT services in a market. Economically too, these kind of partnerships are better for the consumer,” he said.

The move, experts say, has come at a time when the Indian video streaming space is witnessing hyper competition with over 35 video OTT services vying for consumer wallets and time.

This has already resulted in some interesting permutations.

In October last year, Hotstar signed a similar deal with Southeast Asian streaming service HOOQ, which allowed the Star India-owned service to offer movies and TV series of studios including Warner Bros, Sony Pictures, and producers including Lionsgate and Miramax.

Similarly, Times Internet-owned MX Player offers content from Sony LIV, Arre, Bangla OTT service Hoichoi and a host of live channels."

32,2019-07-17,Zee,"MUMBAI: Singapore-based First Degree Global Asset Management is said to have signed a binding agreement to buy two financial services firms owned by Essel Group promoter Subhash Chandra, two people with direct knowledge of the deal told ET.

The asset manager is likely to buy 100 percent equity in Essel Finance Business Loans Ltd and Essel Finance Home Loans Ltd. The deals are likely valued at Rs 150 crore.

A letter of intent has been signed between the buyer and the sellers, one of the persons cited above told ET.

First Degree did not reply to ET’s queries.

An Essel spokesperson for financial services companies confirmed the matter, saying that Essel Finance Business Loans has applied to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for change in shareholding.

It will soon apply to the National Housing Bank for the housing company.

First Degree would be retaining the existing management in both companies.

Essel Finance Business Loans has a loan book size of Rs 350 crore versus borrowings of Rs 260 crore. The housing finance company has a Rs 41-crore loan book.

These companies have drawn credit lines from lenders such as Catholic Syrian, AU Small Finance, RBL and larger non-banking finance companies. Individual banks could not be contacted immediately for comments. 

First Degree Global Asset Management Pte is registered under the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

On July 4, ET reported that US cable major Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, and Atairos, a $4-billion investment company led by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis, was looking to team up with PE fund Blackstone and James Murdoch’s family office Lupa Systems to bid for Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

At least 11 mutual funds — HDFC, Aditya Birla Sun Life and ICICI Prudential among them — have an exposure of about Rs 6,600 crore to the Essel Group’s debt securities.

In April, Group chairman Chandra said he was confident of meeting the September 30 repayment deadline.

The deal will give a breather to Chandra, whose Essel Group is facing a severe debt crisis. Chandra had, last year, announced plans to sell half of the promoters’ then 41% stake in the company.

It has been trying to sell businesses and assets across various verticals — power transmission, roads, renewables — to reduce group leverage of Rs 13,000 crore. The promoters had recently struck a deal for three of their 12 road projects with Canada’s CDPQ that will help raise funds worth Rs 3,500 crore. The Group has also been in discussions with the Adani Group for its solar parks and with Bharti for merging their DTH businesses.

Last November, Zee announced that its promoters, led by Chandra, plan to sell up to 50% stake to a strategic partner in order to deleverage their balance sheet. Subsequently, the management has indicated it is open to selling over 50% of holdings in the firm as part of the asset monetisation efforts."

Netflix Inc., whose shares plunged after it reported the worst drop in U.S. users since 2011, is looking for new subscriber growth in India, a rapidly expanding streaming market. Trouble is, so are a raft of ambitious local players with cut-rate programming packages.

Already wrestling with global giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Amazon.com Inc., Netflix now also contends with broadcasters and Bollywood powerhouses allied with billionaire-backed wireless carriers, who are luring users with free offers or as low as 40 cents a month. That tactic has put them directly in the India growth path of the world’s largest paid online streaming service.

The intense competition could derail Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’s goal of 100 million customers in India -- almost 25 times Netflix’s estimated subscriber base there this year. The world’s second-most populous country is a priority for the streaming service, which is effectively blocked in China. The second-quarter loss of 130,000 users in the U.S., reported Wednesday, makes winning in India all the more pressing.

Netflix shares fell 10%, the most in three years, to close at $325.21 in New York trading Thursday. That knocked more than $16.3 billion off its market value.

With a growing number of smartphones and a surge in the use of broadband, India has become a battleground for streaming services. Cisco Systems Inc. has estimated the country will have 829 million smartphone users by 2022, from a projected half a billion this year.

“We are seeing a nice, steady increase in engagement with Indian viewers that we think we can build on,” Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “Growth in that country is a marathon. We’re in it for the long haul.”

India’s video-on-demand market could grow to $5 billion by 2023 from $500 million last year, estimates researcher Boston Consulting Group. Paying subscribers will probably rise to as many as 50 million, while users of advertising-supported video-on-demand will reach 600 million, BCG predicts.

Netflix has amassed more than 150 million subscribers worldwide, giving it the largest paid customer base. The U.S., Brazil and Canada are three of its largest markets, while Australia is the company’s biggest success story in the Asia-Pacific region. India differs from most of these markets, however, in its population’s sensitivity to price.

The Los Gatos, California-based firm has responded to competition in India by offering a mobile-only service at less than half the typical subscription price, and by raising spending on local content faster than in any other market.

While it’s still lagging behind Amazon Prime and Disney’s Hotstar, the price cuts are helping it outpace the growth of its biggest rivals, while raising questions about sustainability and margins. Hotstar built its base by streaming cricket matches that are wildly popular in the former British colony.

Netflix will probably almost triple subscribers in India this year to 4.1 million, within striking distance of Amazon Prime’s 4.4 million, according to estimates by researcher IHS Markit. That’s faster than Amazon or Hotstar Premium, two of Netflix’s biggest competitors. Some other estimates put Netflix’s base in India at between 1 million and 2 million. The company doesn’t provide data for individual markets.

“Netflix is in a land grab to capture as many subscribers as possible, whatever the price,” said Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. “The less they charge, the more cash they are likely to burn.”

The company spooked investors on Wednesday with a report that it lost subscribers in the U.S. and signed up only 2.8 million internationally in the three months ended June, roughly half its own prediction.

It also reported its 20th quarter of negative free cash flow as it spends on adding content and replacing series and films being pulled from its platforms by competitors like Disney.

While Netflix is speeding up its investment, Indian rivals including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and Balaji Telefilms Ltd. are betting on bundling their content with mobile phone services. The TV network and Bollywood producer are allying with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio wireless service and Bharti Airtel Ltd., two of the country’s three biggest carriers, to offer decades of content to subscribers.

Free Access
Zee, parent of the country’s largest private broadcast network, offers movies, exclusive TV content and more than 90 live channels on its ZEE5 platform with content across 12 languages for as little as 70 cents a month. Partial access to the platform is free to subscribers of mobile phone carrier Bharti Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Mittal. Users of Airtel’s plans priced at $7.25-a-month or more get full access to ZEE5 free.

Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which elbowed its way into the country’s mobile phone business three years ago with free calling and low-priced data services, has jumped into film and TV streaming, including a tie-up with Balaji Telefilms.

Sunil Lulla, chief executive officer of Balaji Telefilms, said the company’s service ALTBalaji is focused on producing exclusive content in Hindi, the country’s most-used language.

Netflix’s global rival Amazon is also counting on India for growth and is prepared to take time to draw users.

“We have a very long-term view for India, with a billion film-crazy people,” said Gaurav Gandhi, director and head of business for Amazon Prime Video, India. “In the next four to five years, there will be more screens connected to the internet and we are looking at distributing across all platforms with personalized and quality video content at affordable prices.”

Pricing will also be crucial for Netflix. After introducing a promotional offer of about $3.65 a month for mobile-only users, Netflix decided to make the lower price permanent as “an opportunity to broaden access to the service,” Greg Peters, chief product officer, said Wednesday.


Torrent Downloads
“Pricing is going to be the biggest challenge,” said Hanish Bhatia, senior analyst at Counterpoint. “Indian users have not accepted the idea of paying for content yet. Two to three years back, everybody relied on torrent,” the free protocol that lets users share and download films and TV shows without paying for them, Bhatia said.

Netflix didn’t disclose how much it’s spending on local content in India. It did announce the addition of five series, two of which are being produced by superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma.

“Netflix wants to have one big original, almost like a new Bollywood movie, coming out every month,” said Mihir Shah, vice president (India) at Media Partners Asia, a consulting firm. “In India, people pay for Bollywood. Netflix is hoping that if people are willing to pay $10 to watch a movie together as a family, they will also subscribe.”"
35,2019-07-21,Zee,"Benchmark equity indices Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the week in the red amid profit booking by foreign investors, mixed earnings and concerns over a slowdown in the economy. 

The 30-share Sensex declined 1.03 per cent for the week to end at 38,337 on July 19 against 38,736 on July 12. Likewise, 50-share Nifty declined 1.15 per cent to 11,419.

Going by the buzz on the Street, here are the five factors that are likely to chart market direction in the coming week.


June quarter results: More than 200 companies including Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Larsen & Toubro will announce their financial results for the quarter ended June 2019 during the coming week.

Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints, Apollo Tricoat Tubes, Can Fin Homes, Coromandel International, Mastek, Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor, United Spirits, Everest Industries, HDFC Life Insurance Company, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services and NIIT Technologies are among the other players that will report their numbers during the week

The market will also react to RIL’s June quarter earnings, which came on Friday post market hours. The oil-to-telecom behemoth posted a 6.8 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for the quarter on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

The company's consolidated net profit (attributed to the owners of the company) rose to Rs 10,104 crore, against Rs 9,459 crore reported during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.


FII inflows: Foreign institutional investors have offloaded shares worth nearly Rs 7,700 crore in July so far against an inflow of over Rs 30,000 crore during April-June. Any more selloff by FIIs during the week may further dampen market sentiment. The government has refused to provide any relief to overseas investors from the higher tax surcharge announced in the Union Budget.


F&O expiry: The upcoming week may witness more volatility as market participants will adjust their F&O positions as July series contracts expire on July 25. 


Global cues: On the global front, market participants would watch key macroeconomic data from the US starting from Redbook, Existing Home Sales on July 23, Durable Goods Orders, Jobless Claims, Fed Balance Sheet, Money Supply on July 25 and GDP and Baker-Hughes Rig Count on July 26.


Monsoon: The slowing economy concerns were further heightened as consumer good sales in rural areas have slowed down amid delayed monsoon rains. “The major crop and agri producing belt have seen rain deficit and it is posing another concern for the economy. Along with that, we are already seeing a rise in inflation for the last few months,” said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

Cumulative rainfall stood at 15.8 per cent below normal till July 17 with weekly rainfall 19.8 per cent below normal."
39,2019-07-22,Zee,"Mumbai: Analysts expect Zee Entertainment Enterprises to post profit growth of around 12.2-17.6 per cent on Tuesday, on the back of modest growth in ad revenues.

Investors will focus on promoter stake sale, and cash generation by the company.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects Zee to post a 16. 1 per cent rise in adjusted profits on the back of 12.3 per cent rise in net sales.

Kotak said it expects 7 per cent growth in advertisement revenues due to broad-based weakness in ad spend environment in line with the slowdown in the consumption space, sharp 85-90 per cent drop in viewership (and corresponding drop in advertising) of Zee Anmol and Zee Anmol Cinema post withdrawal from the DD Freedish platform.

Kotak expects strong 25 per cent growth in domestic subscription revenue driven by benefits of implementation of TRAI's tariff order.

“We expect EBITDA margin to be broadly flat on as headwinds on advertising front would be partly offset by subscription tailwinds,” Kotak analysts said.

Investor focus will be on progress around promoter stake sale, and cash generation in FY2019, they added.

Edelweiss expects 17.6 per cent rise in Zee’s adjusted profits on the back of 8.9 per cent rise in net sales.

“We estimate the advertisement revenue growth to be 5 per cent YoY (base of 19 per cent). Subscription growth is expected to be strong double-digit led by strong performance in regional markets and increased realisation with effect of the new tariff regime,’ Edelweiss’ analysts added.

Analysts in an ET NOW poll had estimated a Rs 368 crore profit for the quarter.

Total revenue for the quarter rose 13.3 per cent to Rs 2,008.10 crore driven by domestic broadcast and digital businesses. Domestic subscription revenues rose 46.7 per cent and domestic advertising revenue were up 4.2 per cent.

Ebitda margin came in at 32.9 per cent for the June quarter.

Domestic advertising growth was considerably lower than the growth in past quarters.

“This was primarily on account of the decision to convert two leading FTA channels to pay, which significantly impacted the ad growth for the quarter. Additionally, the implementation of the new tariff order in the previous quarter negatively impacted reach and viewership of most entertainment channels, leading to a temporary shift in some of the ad spends from entertainment to sports,"" the company said.

The company believes that the underlying demand for advertising remained strong and was confident that spends would come back as the tariff order settles down and the festive season kicks in.

Managing Director and CEO Punit Goenka said the company has witnessed a strong uptake of channels across markets, which is reflected in the 47 per cent growth of our domestic subscription revenue. He showed confidence that the new tariff regime is going to be beneficial for all the stakeholders and will greatly improve the consumer experience."

Analysts in an ET NOW poll had estimated a Rs 368 crore profit for the quarter. 

Here are the top five takeaways from Zee numbers:


What boosted total income?
The company reported 15.51 per cent year-on-year jump in total income at Rs 2,112.03 crore for the quarter under review against Rs 1,821.78 crore reported for the same period last year. A 3.55 per cent and 37 per cent YoY rise in advertisement revenue and subscription revenue boosted total income in Q1FY20.


Stake sale plan

In June 2019, Brickwork Ratings India revised rating outlook of company's listed preference shares from 'BWR AAA (Outlook: Credit Watch with Developing Implications)' to 'BWR AAA (Outlook: Credit watch with Negative Implications)'. “The said revision inter alia factored in a delay in the stake sale plan announced by the promoters in November 2018 along with volatility in share price, deteriorating and weakening credit profile and weakening financial flexibility at the group including its infrastructure segment,” Zee said in a release.


EPS slides sharply

48,2019-07-23,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty suffered losses for the fourth consecutive session on Tuesday, as investors stayed away in the absence of any major domestic and global triggers.

The market extended the consolidation process as concerns over liquidity crunch, the tax surcharge on the super-rich and economic slowdown persisted.

""The consolidation extended as concern over liquidity and banks’ increasing exposure to risky assets continued to weigh on sentiment. The absence of a major domestic catalyst, expensive valuation and uninspiring earnings further hit investor sentiment,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Ajay Arora, director, product innovation at Netflix, said that India subscribers watch more on their mobiles than subscribers anywhere else in the world. ""We believe this new plan will make Netflix even more accessible and better suit people who like to watch on their smartphones and tablets - both on the go and at home,"" he added.

Netflix rival Hotstar's subscription plans start at Rs 199 per month while Amazon Prime Video, which is part of Amazon's Prime subscription, is priced at Rs 129 per month. Zee Entertainment's ZEE5 is available at Rs 99 per month while ALTBalaji, the video streaming service of Reliance-backed Balaji Telefilms is priced at Rs 100 for three months. Times Internet-owned MX Player is currently available on a free ad-supported model. 

The latest mobile only plan will also enable users to download shows but will not offer the cast functionality 

The company said that almost half of Netflix India users downloaded at least one film or episode-in- series in June 2019.

It added that more people in India sign up on the mobile than anywhere else in the world. 

""The numbers of films watched per month/per member in India has grown 50 percent since January 2018,"" it added.

49,2019-07-24,Zee,"MUMBAI: Promoters of the Indian media and entertainment company Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) have received one binding agreement for purchase of stake in the company, ZEE managing director Punit Goenka told ET.

After announcing strong financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal ended June 30, 2019, where the profit after tax has zoomed in by 63 per cent to Rs 530.6 crore,Goenka added that the stake sale process is in an advanced stage, with the decision to be announced in “a few days”.

“One binding offer has been received and we are expecting to receive another offer in a couple of days. A decision will be made once both deals are evaluated. We will make announcement in a few days,” Goenka said.

He added that if the second offer does not come, the company will go ahead with the offer on the table.

While Goenka refused to share any more details, people close to development said that a large South Indian TV broadcasting network and a global hedge fund have also shown interest in ZEE. ET first reported on July 4 that Atairos, a $4-billion investment company led by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis, is looking to team up with PE fund Blackstone and James Murdoch’s family office Lupa Systems to bid for ZEE.

ET in its February 19 edition had reported about Comcast-Atairos teaming up for the Subhash Chandra flagship. Subsequently, Lupa and Blackstone joined the group.

One of the persons stated that the consortium was expected to pick up between 21-25 per cent stake, keeping Subhash Chandra as the single largest shareholder. “There might be a chance of an open offer, but it is not mandatory,” he said.

The deal could be signed at Rs 430-450 per share, he added.

A binding offer refers to an offer made by a bidder to acquire a target company after the due diligence phase of a sale process is complete. This offer constitutes a formal contract between the bidder and seller if the seller accepts the bidder’s terms.

The deal will give a breather to Chandra, whose Essel Group is facing severe debt crisis. Chandra had, last year, announced his plans to sell half of promoters then 41 per cent stake in the company.

As per June 2019, disclosures, the promoters own 35.79 per cent of the company of which 63.98 per cent are pledged.

ZEE had entered into an agreement with the lenders, where more than 90 per cent of lenders have given the company time till September to sell stake and agreed not to invoke pledges till then.

ZEE is one of the largest television broadcasting companies of India, which owns 66 television channels across 171 countries, reaching over 1.3 billion people globally.

60,2019-07-25,Zee,"KOLKATA: A plan by Bharti Airtel, Warburg Pincus and Singapore Telecommunications to collectively buy the promoter stake of Zee founder Subhash Chandra’s family in Dish TV India has hit an air pocket following a sharp fall in the DTH operator’s stock price since April, people familiar with the matter said.

Dish TV’s owners are said to be unwilling to sell the 57.52% promoter stake below Rs 45 a share against Rs 30-35 offered by the Airtel-Warburg-Singtel combine.

At Rs 35 a share, Dish TV India’s promoters would receive roughly Rs 3,707 crore from the consortium, well below the Rs 4,766 crore they stand to pocket if the deal is struck at Rs 45 a share.

“The buyout talks have got stalled over valuations with the sharp fall in the company’s stock price and both sides refusing to budge from their bargaining positions,” a top executive privy to the talks told ET.

“Disagreement over valuations could delay a potential Dish-Airtel transaction, amid the sharp correction in Dish TV India’s stock price,” said Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICap Securities.

Dish TV India shares closed at Rs 32.20 on the BSE on Thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of Rs 5,928.84 crore. The stock has lost 20% from Rs 40.2 on April 16. Bharti Airtel shares ended 0.27% lower at Rs 337.85.



Talks, which started in March-April, may have stalled also because Zee supremo and Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra hopes to close the sale of its substantial stake in Zee Entertainment before the Dish TV deal, the people said. A group of mutual funds holding Zee/Essel Group debt that faced redemption has reportedly set a July 31 deadline for the promoters to conclude a stake sale, failing which they would sell Zee Entertainment shares that they have as collateral.

Zee has said it is close to finalising a deal within the deadline. Zee Group promoters have pledged about 64% of their 35.79% stake in Zee Entertainment and almost 95% of their holding in Dish TV India to lenders.

The Essel Group’s total debt stands at Rs 17,174 crore, which includes the debt of private unlisted companies and listed ones.

However, another person said a delay in the deal could adversely impact Dish TV’s promoters as they run the risk of their stake getting diluted if lenders start selling the pledged shares owing to their inability to clear dues.

A potential Airtel-Dish TV deal would create the world’s largest TV distribution company with about 40 million subscribers and over 60% share of India’s DTH turf. Analysts said it would be a robust response from Airtel to counter Reliance Jio Infocomm’s aggressive overtures in digital TV services and home broadband.

The Airtel-Dish TV talks came after Jio bought majority stakes in Hathway Cable & Datacom and DEN Networks, effectively gaining control over some 24 million cablelinked homes across about 750 cities.

57,2019-07-25,Zee,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 21.50 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

JM Financial has upgraded HDFC Life Insurance Company to buy with a target price of Rs 550. HDFC Life reported a strong start to FY20 with NBV growth of 2 times YoY in the June quarter and post-overrun margins of 30 per cent – the highest in the industry. HDFC Life – with strong growth and better margins – would continue to generate superior operating RoEVs of 22 per cent into FY21, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 1.9 per cent at Rs 499.15 on Wednesday.


ICICIdirect has upgraded Zee Entertainment Enterprises to buy from hold with a target price of Rs 425. Signing of binding term sheet for stake sale with one of the bidder is a key positive, said ICICIdirect. On the other hand, steep and aggressive spending in content (largely to enhance Zee5 offering), is also a necessary evil that is likely to keep free cash flow generation modest, said ICICIdirect. The stock ended up 5.1 per cent at Rs 379.25 on Wednesday.


Edelweiss has downgraded Just Dial to hold and revised target price to Rs 740 from Rs 680. The brokerage had turned positive on Just Dial after fourth quarter of FY18 due to an uptick in its operating metrics, cash flow and unearned revenue growth, as well as attractive valuation. The stock has rallied 69 per cent since, said Edelweiss. While key operating matrices remain strong, the weak macroeconomy and high valuation warrant cautious, said Edelweiss. The stock ended down 2.6 per cent at Rs 708.75 on Wednesday.

Jefferies has maintained buy rating on Kajaria Ceramics and revised target price to Rs 720 from Rs 730. The company's sales in the first quarter at Rs 700 crore was led by robust volume growth of 10 per cent, amidst weak offtake, said Jefferies. Tightening industry compliance, strong product mix and distribution, place Kajaria in a sweet spot, said Jefferies. The full benefits of NGT ban and softening gas prices year-on-year are expected to be witnessed in FY20, said Jefferies. The stock ended down 8.3 per cent at Rs 468.50 on Wednesday.

CLSA has maintained outperform rating on Torrent Pharmaceuticals but cut target price to Rs 1,690 from Rs 1,800. Torrent's June quarter results were operationally in-line but higher other income drove the profit beat, said CLSA. The US outlook hinges on US FDA classification of key plant Indrad, which is expected over the next month, said CLSA. An OAI status could result in flat US growth for FY20-21, the brokerage said. CLSA has retained rating based on Torrent's strong India positioning. The stock ended up 9.4 per cent at Rs 1606.6 on Wednesday."

63,2019-07-30,Zee,"Mumbai: A consortium led by US cable major Comcast and comprising Atairos, Blackstone and James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems submitted a binding offer late Monday to buy out Subhash Chandra from Zee Entertainment, said people aware of the development.

Sources close to Zee, however, said they had not received any bid till late Monday evening. Last week, Zee Entertainment managing director Punit Goenka had told ET that the company had received one binding agreement for purchase of stake and was expecting another in the following days. He, however, did not disclose the identity of the bidders. Goenka had earlier said that he was expecting to sign a binding agreement by July-end.

The second bid that Goenka was talking about, one of the people said, was a financial one from a Singapore-based hedge fund, Broad Peak. This could not be independently verified.

ET, in its July 4 edition, had reported that the Comcast consortium was closing in on the Zee buy.


Mails sent to Comcast and Atairos did not elicit a response till press time Monday, while Lupa’s India head, Nitin Kukreja, declined to comment. Blackstone couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. The promoters own 35.79 per cent of the company, of which 63.98 per cent has been pledged with MFs and other financial institutions. At current market price, the promoters’ stake is worth Rs 13,315 crore (around $1.92 billion) though most observers expect a 15-20 per cent control premium over the market value. The transaction, if accepted, will also likely trigger an open offer for an additional 26 per cent stake. The Zee stock has been very volatile — in the past year, it had moved between Rs 540.40 and Rs 288.95.

On Monday, Zee shares closed 4.1 per cent lower at Rs 387.35 on the BSE.

While Comcast will be leading the consortium, James Murdoch, who previously controlled Star India, is expected to act as the local partner on the ground and take up a small stake. Lupa also cannot have a more than 9-10 per cent stake in the company, as part of a noncompete agreement with Walt Disney Company after Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox (including Star India) to Disney. Atairos is a $4-billion investment company led by former Comcast CFO Michael Angelakis. Blackstone is the world’s largest PE fund. Recently, it bought Essel Propack from Ashok Agarwal, Subhas Chandra’s brother.

The Zee promoters need approval from their board and lenders before finalising any agreement. The deal will give a breather to Chandra, whose Essel Group is facing a severe debt crisis. Chandra had last year announced plans to sell half the promoters’ stake, then 41 per cent, in the company.

The Essel Group has been trying to sell businesses and assets across various verticals — power transmission, roads, renewables, etc — to reduce group debt of Rs 13,000 crore. It has also been in discussions with the Adani Group for solar parks and with Bharti Airtel for merging the DTH business.

The Essel Group owes Rs 7,000 crore to mutual funds and a stake sale has to happen before September 2019 to avoid a default on payment.

The $84-billion Comcast, led by Brian Roberts, has been a serial buyer and seller of media assets including cable networks, broadband assets, content providers, internet providers and even animation studios since the late 1980s. The company, however, lost out on 21st Century Fox after Walt Disney trumped its $65-billion bid last year. It has been scouting for assets in India and other highgrowth markets. Zee gives it the much-needed India launchpad, said media analysts."

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
66,2019-07-30,Zee,"When there is high pessimism in markets, one can either stay put or shift a part of the investments into schemes that follow value investing. The key to this approach is spotting companies that are either attractive in comparison with historical valuation or with respect to their peers. 

It makes sense to be with such firms since in the long-term, they tend do well as the Street recognises the merits of having positive financial ratios in their favour. One of the schemes, which follows this strategy, is Tata Equity PE. The scheme follows an effective strategy of investing in stocks which trade (trailing) cheaper than the valuation of the Sensex at the time of entry. 

Close to 70 per cent of the scheme’s portfolio is constructed based on this criterion. This is one of the reasons why the scheme has been a consistent performer in almost all market cycles. This is more evident especially in the long-term cycles of markets. 

The scheme has given 12 per cent and 14.5 per cent returns in the past 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively, while its peers in the category have given 9 per cent and 13 per cent returns, respectively, over the same periods. 

In the past six months, the scheme has invested in firms which have sound business model but are trading at cheap valuation. They are available at cheap valuation not because of lack of growth in earnings but largely due to broad pessimistic sentiment in the market. A few of these companies are Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Jubilant Foodworks.

Expert Take

Amit Singh, CEO, Investica
The strategy this fund follows is to invest in stocks that have a rolling 12-month P/E less than that of the Sensex. Such a strategy is especially useful during rising markets. With this investment objective, the fund has managed to beat the benchmark as well as category if we look at 5-year, 7-year or 10-year performance."

67,2019-07-31,Zee,"After two nights of deliberations, promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises seem to be leaning towards the binding agreement from a financial investor for a partial stake sale as the transaction moves towards closure, say two people close to the development.

The brass of the Essel Group, which owns Zee, have been deliberating the pros and cons of both offers. The deal is expected to close at 17-20 per cent premium over the last sixmonth average market value.

Zee has received two offers for the proposed stake sale — a binding one from a financial investor for a partial stake and second non-binding one from a consortium led by US cable major Comcast and also comprising independent fund Atairos, Blackstone and James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems, for a controlling stake, including option for an open offer for an additional 26 per cent.

A global media baron has played an instrumental role in stitching up the deal for the controlling play. “The offer from the consortium would have led to Chandra ceding control of Zee, whereas the binding agreement from the financial investor will allow him and Punit (Goenka, managing director and chief executive of Zee) to be in control. Naturally, they are favouring the offer from the financial investor,” said one of the persons.

The identity of the financial investor could not be independently verified till press time. The other person added that the Zee promoters will most likely announce their final decision on Wednesday.


A Zee spokesperson declined to share details of the offers, but added that the Essel Group has reached at “a very advanced stage” of the overall stake sale process of Zee.

Last week, Goenka had told ET that the company had received one binding agreement for purchase of stake and was expecting another in the following days.

While he did not disclose the identity of the bidders, he had maintained that he was expecting to sign a binding agreement by July-end.

Promoters own 35.79 per cent in Zee as of June 2019, of which 63.98 per cent has been pledged with mutual funds and other financial institutions. At current market price, the promoters’ stake is worth Rs 13,103 crore (around $1.9 billion).

Zee promoters will, however, have to take approval from their board and lenders before finalising any agreement.

The deal will give a breather to Chandra, whose Essel Group is facing a severe debt crisis. Chandra had last year announced plans to sell half the promoters’ stake, then 41 per cent, in the company."

69,2019-07-31,Zee,"We expect some bounce back in the second half but structurally, some of the sectors like auto might do slightly better in the near term. We do not expect a broad-based performance overall from the markets going forward, says Pankaj Pandey, Head Research, ICICIdirect.com. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Among other things, the bleak sentiment in the markets is being attributed to the disappointing earnings picture so far. Have you read into the quality of earnings that we have seen and do you believe it will continue to remain a drag into the coming quarters?On the contrary, we believe the earnings have been largely in line with our expectations. In this particular quarter, we were expecting a good bounce back from corporate banks and pharma as a pack. Up till now, the results are largely on expected lines. The differences as a pack was expected to do a higher single digit or lower double digit growth. Something like paints have been on slightly positive territory. 

The entire commodity as a pack -- be it oil and gas or metals -- are expected to deliver softer set of numbers, which is what has been panning out. Going forward, the anchor driver for earnings will be banking and we expect some bounce back in sectors like pharma going forward. 

Lastly, the defensive as a pack will continue to keep delivering the kind of numbers that we have seen in this particular quarter. Overall, we have a Nifty EPS of about 765 and so the market is trading somewhere about 14 times which we believe is quite attractive. We expect some bounce back in the second half but structurally, some of the sectors like auto might do slightly better in the near term. The structural concerns remain and so we do not expect a broad-based performance overall from the markets going forward.


What is your view on Axis Bank numbers? The retail growth is quite impressive, whereas the international book has degrown in a big way. That’s why the overall numbers are looking slightly softer and one of the other concerns was that the slippages were quite high compared to what we had seen in the previous quarters. Overall, book below (BB), has been steady. 

Wherever we are expecting an improvement, especially on the retail side, that has panned out for most of the corporate banks. The numbers have been slightly lower but the positive bias is going to continue in this stock. Corporate banks are one of the best bets going forward given the overall market conditions.


What is your take on Hero Moto? In the conference call, the management said the capex guidance could be revised lower and they are cautious yet hopeful of a recovery in the festive season. Largely what the management is saying is that H2 is going to be better than H1 which we believe in because this particular year, there are about 75 auspicious days, mostly in the second half compared to 45 days last year. So, definitely there are a lot more auspicious days which could drive the demand. 

Another factor that can help the industry is, you have got about 2 crore vehicles which are more than 15 years old. Of that, about 1.5 crore are in two-wheelers and 31 lakh in four-wheelers. If the government comes up with the scrappage policy, that could revive the near term sentiments but the overall structural challenge for the industry still remains whether you look at Bajaj Auto or Hero. 

The capex guidance is quite weak and the challenge could lie in the probability of a disruption which is happening or about to happen. Somewhere down the line, you would expect companies to do more capex, and which again will have an impact on their free cash flows. So, near term things can sort of improve a bit but overall structural concerns remain despite the fact that a lot of these stocks are now quite attractive from a valuation perspective.


Zee Entertainment will probably see a deal coming about. What is the signal for the company going forward that all of the volatility is now perhaps going to be behind?Looking at the good set of numbers, we had upgraded the stock to buy. So, about 20 times is what we had given on a forward basis. If you get a financial investor then we would not expect further rerating of the stock, given that largely in last six months, prices are around the current levels and which is why you would not see much of a significant upside. But in case you get a strategic investor, there is a possibility of multiples going up to say 25 times and that might open up a possibility of another Rs 100 to the overall price. That will depend on the kind of deal which gets announced today but in case you get a financial investor, what the news is probably suggesting is that the upside could be limited from current levels."

73,2019-07-31,Zee,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."
74,2019-07-31,Zee,"Mumbai: Oppenheimer Funds are set to pick up a minority stake of around 11% at around Rs 400/share in Zee Entertainment, ending months of negotiations, said sources aware of the development. 

The Oppenheimer offer is believed to be better than the Comcast led consortium's offer of Rs 350/share, they add. 

On Wednesday mid day, the Zee Entertainment was trading at Rs 361/share. 

An announcement is expected later today. 

The promoters of Zee prefer a financial partner since the trade will be faster and they retain control of their flagship. 

""The issue is if this solution will solve the liquidity problem that the Essel Group is facing. Also it's interesting that a public market focussed fund will pay a premium to market price,"" said an official.

Mails sent to See spokesperson did not generate an immediate response. 

Oppenheimer could not be contacted immediately. 

The promoters led by Subhas Chandra owns 35. 79% of Zee Entertainment of which 64% is pledged to financial institutions. Essel Group owes Rs 7000 crore to mutual funds and need to sell a stake by September to avoid a default.

Founded by Leon Levy, Oppenheimer Funds is among the largest asset management firms globally managing $213 billion of assets as on end 2018."
75,2019-07-31,Zee,"Mumbai: The promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) will sell an 11% stake in the media company to US-based financial investor Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for a consideration of Rs 4,224 crore. The move, spurning an offer by a Comcast-led group, follows a nine-month search for a buyer as the parent Essel Group seeks to reduce debt by selling assets. The promoters are confident of selling a further 9% stake in ZEE by the September 30 deadline for debt repayments. 

The fund, which is registered with the US Securities & Exchange Commission, has been a financial investor in ZEE since 2002 and currently owns a 7.7% stake in the company.

ET reported July 31 that the ZEE promoters were leaning toward the binding offer from a financial investor. The other offer, a nonbinding one, had come from a consortium led by US cable major Comcast that also included James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems, private equity fund Blackstone and independent fund Atairos.

“We have reached an agreement to sell up to 11% equity for a consideration of Rs 4,224 crore in ZEE, based on how many shares we are able to deliver to them,” said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive of ZEE. “It’s a straightforward transaction of pure shares that they will buy from the promoter family.”

Justin Leverenz, portfolio manager at Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, said, “The Fund in its usual business practice has been investing in the Indian markets for many years and has been a financial investor in ZEE for 17 years. This additional financial investment underscores our continued confidence in management’s ability to deliver long-term growth and financial returns. The sound fundamentals of ZEE make this a highly compelling transaction for investors in the fund.” 

The promoters will now take the offer to the lenders. “The shares are with the lenders and I will now ask them to place those shares in the escrow. Once the escrow agent confirms the share transfer, Oppenheimer will remit the money,” Goenka said, elaborating on the next course of action.

The stake sale is part of the ongoing deleveraging process by the Essel Group, which owns ZEE, to repay lenders by September end. The proceeds will mostly go toward paying for debt raised from mutual funds at the promoter level, rather than the banks, which have exposure to the Essel Group’s infrastructure unit. ET reported earlier that along with ZEE, Essel Group is also in the process of divesting some of its non-media assets, including the solar energy and roads portfolios.

“Through the sale of non-media assets, this deal and some more sale we should be comfortable to pay off the entire debt,” Goenka said. “We started out with the intention of selling 20% stake in ZEE and 9% is still on the table. There are people who are approaching us and engaging with us. Now the floor price is set. I am confident of selling that too and repaying all the lenders by September 30.”

On favouring a financial investor over the consortium, Goenka said that the offer from the latter, which came in late Monday night, was a nonbinding one. “It was not matching to the timeline. We have to repay lenders by September 30 and the process wouldn’t have completed by then,” he said.

ET reported February 19 on Comcast and Atairos teaming up with Lupa Systems and Blackstone for Subhash Chandra’s flagship company. It was then reported that the consortium was bidding for a 21-25% stake, with the option of holding a subsequent open offer.

Goenka declined to give details of the offer by the Comcast-led consortium but said it didn’t involve a total buyout.

Ajay Bodke, CEO and Chief Portfolio Manager at stock broking firm Prabhudas Lilladher, said that this is an encouraging beginning but the group needs to expedite the sale of other non-media assets to deleverage substantially.

“It is a welcome start by the promoters who have been steadfastly assuring all the lenders since the last six months that they will repay their entire liabilities. They will need to expedite sale of other assets like roads, solar, finance, mutual funds etc as indicated previously by September 2019 and have indicated that they are in advanced stage of negotiations for the same,” he said.

Chandra, chairman and founder of the Essel Group, had initially said in November last year that he intended to sell half of the promoters’ then 41% stake in ZEE to a strategic partner. Essel had also appointed Goldman Sachs Securities as investment banker and US and Europe-based LionTree as an international strategic advisor for this exercise.

However, ZEE’s shares fell 26% on January 25, marking its largest single-day drop after media reports alleging links between the group and Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures, a company that is under the scrutiny of investigative authorities for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore during or after demonetisation. The Essel Group and ZEE denied any link with Nityank.

Later, the promoters reached an agreement with lenders, including mutual funds, which allowed them to repay loans by September 30. The debt-laden Essel Group is planning to generate Rs 20,000 crore by selling its infrastructure business, including roads, power transmission and solar energy assets to trim company’s and promoters’ debt.

Chandra had told ET earlier that he’s confident of meeting the September 30 deadline. “Our core objective is to come out clean from this by repaying everyone’s money and that too happily,” he had said.

The proceeds of the ZEE stake sale will mostly go to mutual funds."
5,2019-08-01,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Zee Entertainment dropped 4 per cent in Thursday’s trade even as Rs 4,224 crore deal by promoters to sell 11 per cent stake in the company to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for nearly Rs 400 per share was at a 10 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 361.50 for the stock.

Investors seemed a bit disappointed as the company choose a financial investor over a strategic investor.

In an interview to ET NOW, Punit Goenka, MD & CEO accepted that his company felt the deadline pressure to an extent. 

""It was this reason we chose financial investor because else we could not meet our deadline with the lenders. It does not really impact as it will be business as usual for the company . We will continue our growth trajectory as we have projected and all plans whether it be on the broadcast business or Zee5 will continue to roll out as planned.”

Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, which has been a financial investor in Zee since 2002, now holds 17.7 per cent stake in the media firm.

While analysts said the development is positive, a few believe it would only partially ease the pledging overhang.

“While this deal addresses concerns over promoter loans pledged against Zee shares to some extent, sale of remaining assets remains critical for investor confidence and will likely be monitored closely. We believe further re-rating will also depend on improvement in the working capital,” Nomura India said.

The Zee promoters, who intended to sell 20 per cent stake in the company expects to complete the 9 per cent stake sales by the September 30 deadline.

 “The risk of a majority stake sale resulting in a cessation of Punit Goenka-led management team has also gone away. The team has delivered strong performance over the last 7-8 years, with cost-effective content creation and market share gains,” said Emkay Global in a note.

The brokerage, however, feels that the transaction only partially removes the pledge overhang as the deal comes with no lock-in period.

CLSA has a target of Rs 515 on the stock. It feels that stake sale will allay near-term concerns. Management continuity will be the key, it said. Nomura India has a target of Rs 522 on the stock. Emkay has a sell rating on the stock.

The shares of the company closed 4.08 per cent lower at Rs 346.70 on BSE."

“It is a welcome start by the promoters, who have been assuring lenders for the past six months that they will repay all liabilities. They will need to expedite sale of other assets such as roads, solar, finance, mutual funds, etc, as indicated previously, by September. They have indicated that they are in advanced negotiations for the same,” he said.

ET had reported February 19 on Comcast and Atairos teaming up with Lupa Systems and Blackstone for Subhash Chandra’s flagship company. It was then reported that the consortium was bidding for a 21-25 per cent stake, with the option of a subsequent open offer.

Goenka declined to give details of the offer by the Comcast-led consortium but said it didn’t involve a total buyout.

Chandra, chairman and founder of the Essel Group, had said in November last year that he intended to sell half of the promoters’ then-41 per cent stake in Zee to a strategic partner. Essel had also appointed Goldman Sachs Securities as investment banker and US and Europe-based LionTree as an international strategic adviser for this exercise. However, Zee’s shares fell 26 per cent on January 25, marking its largest single-day drop after media reports alleging links between the group and Nityank Infrapower & Multiventures, a company that is under the scrutiny of investigative authorities for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore during or after demonetisation. The Essel Group and Zee denied any link with Nityank.

Later, the promoters reached an agreement with the lenders, including mutual funds, which allowed them to repay loans by September 30. The debt-laden Essel Group is planning to generate Rs 20,000 crore by selling its infrastructure business, including roads, power transmission and solar energy assets to trim company’s and promoters’ debt.

Chandra had told ET earlier that he’s confident of meeting the September 30 deadline. “Our core objective is to come out clean from this by repaying everyone’s money, and that too happily,” he had said. The proceeds of the Zee stake sale will mostly go to mutual funds.

“This transaction doesn’t affect banks or bank loans at all. Our lending is more to the infra company which has to sell assets and repay us,” said a banker, referring to Essel Infraprojects Ltd. The Essel Group’s infrastructure-related debt is estimated at nearly Rs 11,500 crore. The company has started divesting some of its assets, such as solar and some road projects.

“We believe the company may be left with more than Rs 1,000 crore of equity valuation from their infra business,” said the banker cited above."
2,2019-08-01,Zee,"Mumbai: Mutual funds holding Zee Entertainment shares as collateral for loans given to Essel Group promoters are likely to stake claim to the Rs 4,224 crore the company will raise by selling 11 per cent in its media unit to Invesco Oppenheimer.

Proceeds from the stake sale amount to 50-55 per cent of the money owed to mutual funds (MFs). The group has unofficially told MFs holding the pledged shares that it could offload a further 10 per cent to another investor in August to repay the balance of what it owes, said three people familiar with the matter.

The Essel Group didn’t respond to ET’s mailed queries.

Various MF debt schemes — Aditya Birla, ICICI Prudential, SBI, Kotak, Franklin Templeton and HDFC — have exposure of more than Rs 7,500 crore to Essel securities. They hold shares of group entities, such as Zee, Dish TV and Essel Infrastructure, as collateral. Three fund houses — ICICI Prudential, SBI and Kotak — hold Zee shares as the collateral, while the rest hold shares of Dish and unlisted Essel Infra or a mix of the two.


It is not clear whether the group will split the stake sale proceeds on a pro rata basis to repay lenders. “If the waterfall mechanism is applied, MFs holding Zee shares should be repaid first,” said a senior MF industry official. In a waterfall mechanism, highertiered creditors receive interest and principal payments before the lowertiered ones do.

Another official of a fund house that has lent to Essel said there is no conflict because the group has committed to pay the rest of the money it owed funds before September 30.

“If all the money is being returned before the deadline, there is no dispute regarding the payment schedule,” said the official, downplaying the possibility of a dispute.

“Given that they have raised only about Rs 4,200 crore, it’s only a partial resolution before the deadline,” said a senior executive of a fund with exposure to Zee. “The relief here is they are moving in the right direction.”"
3,2019-08-01,Zee,"After burning the midnight oil for many nights, Punit Goenka, chief executive of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, finally signed a deal to sell a stake in the company at 2.15 pm on Wednesday. A relieved Goenka sat down with Gaurav Laghate and Vinod Mahanta to discuss the deal structure, promoters’ debt situation and Zee’s way forward. Edited excerpts:

How is the deal structured?It’s a straightforward deal, wherein they will buy 11% of the equity for a consideration of Rs 4,224 crore, based on how many shares we are able to deliver to them. There is no quasi-equity, no convertible debt, it’s a pure transaction of shares that they will buy from the promoter family.


Will this deal solve debt issues?Total debt after some pledge invocation and share sale is at approximately Rs 11,000 crore at the promoter level. This deal solves a lion’s share of that problem. We have also closed deals for solar and roads portfolio. There will not be any further need for loans as through these non-media assets and some more stake sale at Zee, we should be comfortable to pay off the entire debt. We started out with intent to sell 20%, and 9% is still on the table. Several people have approached us to explore a deal. The good part is people are engaging with us, despite our saying that the floor is set now.


Will all money be used for repayment?
Yes, 100%.


How does it go forward with lenders?Shares are with the lenders. I have not discussed with them yet. I have to now ask them to place those shares in the escrow. Once the escrow agent confirms to Invesco Oppenheimer that I have received X number of shares as per your contract, please remit the money, they will do the settlement. We have started informing the lenders about the contours of the deal.


Will you be able to revoke all pledges ?
No, some pledges will remain. But I’m confident lenders will support us as this money will be received in August, well before deadline. They have supported our intent of wanting to pay and this is the biggest testimony of our intent.


Are you happy with the current deal?
I will not say I’m unhappy with the deal. Even at this price, given how the market is, to get a financial investor to pay you a premium, imagine what the real asset value is. The financial investor is also seeing that he will make something out of it — that’s why he is giving me a premium. I’m happy they have chosen to repose their faith in us as they will be the single largest shareholder.


Why was the Comcast-led consortium’s offer not entertained?
Their timelines were not matching our deadlines. For example, it was a nonbinding offer and then they talked about certain conditions, which get fulfilled on September 30. So, regulatory approval would start then. I have no leeway with lenders to negotiate the September deadline. I can’t share offer details, but a buyout was never in the discussion.


How many interested parties did you meet in last eight-and-a-half months?
We travelled to Los Angeles, New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore. My Emirates status has gone up from Gold to Platinum (laughs).


What were the biggest challenges?
First, the January 25 event (Zee shares fell 26% after media reports alleging links between the group and Nityank Infrapower & Multiventures, a company that is under the scrutiny of investigative authorities for deposits of over Rs 3,000 crore during or after demonetisation) was a big hurdle, followed by the general elections. But after that, literally in the past two months we have stitched the deal.


Was James Murdoch architect of the Comcast-led consortium offer?
(Smiles) James and I have known each other since he was running Star India. I must have reached out to him in May. We may have spoken many times. But it didn’t work out, unfortunately.


How big a distraction was this deal?
Last couple of weeks, 40-50% of my time was spent on this. But given the spectacular results we have delivered in the last quarter, I must say, contrary to belief, I didn’t spend most my time on the deal."

8,2019-08-01,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Strong across-the-board selling caused domestic equity indices Sensex and Nifty to end with deep cuts on Thursday.

The market kept reeling under pressure with no respite from global as well as domestic headwinds. While weak global sentiment and a fall in the rupee against the dollar were seen as the immediate reason for the selloff, fundamentally, concerns over a weakening economy, poor earnings and the tax setback in Budget lingered. 

“Pain is substantial as the impact of Budget on investor sentiment still continues. Moreover, subdued quarterly earnings and clear signs of an economic slowdown are serious concerns,"" said G Chokkalingam, Founder & Managing Director at Equinomics Research and Advisory.

At one point during the day, Sensex was down 787 points, but it pared losses to eventually end at 37,018, down 463 points or 1.23 per cent. Nifty closed the day at 10,980, down 138 points, or 1.24 per cent. Expiry of weekly derivative contracts caused the sharp volatility. 

Sensex and Nifty have come off 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, from their all-time highs, hit early June, 2019.

Here is a lowdown on key highlights of Thursday's session:

Shares of Zee Entertainment dropped 4.08 per cent to close at Rs 346.70 even as Rs 4,224 crore deal by promoters to sell 11 per cent stake in the company to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for nearly Rs 400 per share was at a 10 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 361.50 for the stock. 


Auto stocks fall on slump in sales



Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) reported a 33.5 per cent decline in total sales at 1,09,264 units in July. The company had sold 1,64,369 in July last year. However, shares of the company closed 1.86 per cent higher at Rs 5,574.10.

9,2019-08-02,Zee,"Mumbai: Shares of one of India’s largest media and entertainment companies Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) fell close to 4 per cent (Rs 347.3) on Thursday as investors were disappointed that the parent opted to sell a stake in the company to a financial investor.

Essel Group sold 11 per cent additional stake to US-based Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for Rs 4,220 crore. The fund already held over 7 per cent stake in the company.

While analysts said that given the tight deadline — September this year — for repayment of debt, it made sense for the company to opt for stake sale to an already existing investor, savvy investors have been keen on cashing in on any appreciation in the company's share price with the entry of a strategic investor.

There are two main reasons for this. First, a strategic investor deal would have brought in higher funds than what the company got through this deal with Oppenheimer.


Second, the Street believed that part of the funds generated from sale of stake to a strategic investor would have come in handy in strengthening the company's presence in a highly competitive India’s streaming platforms segment.

With this deal, it seems that the company’s immediate focus is to secure funds to repay debt and not to improve its foothold in new media platforms. The coming of a financial investor does not offer any clarity on these fronts. In the absence of these factors, the deal has elicited lukewarm response from the Street.

Another aspect that investors have reservations with is the attractiveness of the company’s non-media assets, given their sectoral challenges.

At the group level, as of January 31 this year, Essel has total debt of close Rs 17,174 crore. Of this, Rs 11,466 crore is infra-related debt. This infra-related debt covers three major verticals — power transmission, solar and roads (toll and annuity).

Investors doubt whether the company can generate Rs 20,000 crore by selling these assets. So, it seems the company may sell further stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises. “With infra asset sale unlikely to close in two months, a further 8-18 per cent stake sale in Zee is likely. While the current deal allays near-term concerns, a further stake sale could expose promoters to the risk of losing control,” said CLSA in a note.

The stake sale to Invesco Oppenheimer Fund reduces 38 per cent of its loan against share obligation of Rs 11,000 crore which the Street perceives as just not enough to allay any concern related to the company’s ability to reduce its pledging considerably. A Citi report points out, “The announced deal is far from sufficient and very different from what was envisaged earlier in the year.”

Analysts believe that in the absence of a strategic investor, there’s not much room for an upside in the company’s stock in the near term. A lot would depend on how the promoters would further secure funds to reduce their remaining pledging obligations."
10,2019-08-03,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices dropped over 2 per cent this week, as trade war concerns came back to haunt global equities. The escalating war of words between the US and China, US Fed’s not-so-dovish rate guidance and intensifying foreign outflow from India dragged domestic stocks lower for the fourth week in a row. Domestic earnings too disappointed.

The silver lining for the week was the Friday’s strong rebound on back of reports that the PMO was looking to tweak recent market unfriendly announcements. Besides, investors seem to have stopped reacting much to weak corporate numbers, Maruti’s case in mind, suggesting the weak numbers are in the price. 

For the week, Nifty settled at 10,997, down 286 points or 2.54 per cent. Sensex fell 764 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 37,118.22.


Here are a few stocks which buzz the most all through the week:

Coffee Day Enterprises: The scrip nose-dived 49 per cent for the week to end at Rs 99.90 after VG Siddhartha allegedly committed suicide and left a letter to the company’s board members that suggested he was under severe pressure from one of the private equity partners to buyback shares. Coffee Day board announced its new interim chairman and delayed its quarterly earnings.


Indiabulls Housing Finance: Falling for four out of five sessions, the scrip lost 21.41 per cent of its value in a week after BJP Leader Subramanian Swamy sent a letter to PM Modi, accusing the group of a fruad worth Rs 1 lakh crore. The company, however, has denied any wrongdoing. The scrip settled at Rs 490.55 on Friday. 


Zee Entertainment: The scrip fell 15.46 per cent to Rs 341.50 even as Rs 4,224 crore deal by promoters to sell 11 per cent stake in the company to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for nearly Rs 400 per share was at a 10 per cent premium to prevailing prices. Investors seemed a bit disappointed as the company chose a financial investor over a strategic investor.


YES Bank: Shares of this private lender fell 8.12 per cent to Rs 88.30. A foreign investor in the Indian property market has alleged in a complaint to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that Yes Bank and realty group HDIL have moved funds to evergreen loans.


Vodafone Idea: The scrip plunged 31.78 per cent for the week to Rs 6.31, thanks to a 26.81 plunge it witnessed on Monday in a reaction to Rs 4,873.9 crore loss it reported for June quarter. The telecom operator’s revenue fell dropped below rival Reliance Jio’s for the first time, as some subscribers left and others moved to lower tariff plans.


Jet Airways: After falling for three consecutive sessions, shares of Jet Airways made a comeback, rising 5 per cent each on Thursday and Friday to cut weekly losses to 5.51 per cent. At least four investors have shown interest in the assets of the airline and there were reports that lenders to the defunct airline may extend Saturday deadline for submitting expressions of interest for stake sale.


Ruchi Soya: This stock has now rallied for eight consecutive sessions after the NCLT recently cleared the Rs 4,350-crore bid by yoga-exponent Ramdev-run Patanjali Ayurved to take over the edible oil player. Surging 26.57 per cent for the week, the scrip settled at Rs 5.05 on Friday.


Maruti Suzuki: The automaker cut weekly losses by rising in the last two sessions of the week. The scrip fell 2 per cent for the week to Rs 5,692.4. India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki reported a 27.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit at Rs 1,435.50 crore for the June quarter on weak volumes and higher depreciation expenses."
11,2019-08-05,Zee,"BENGALURU: Homegrown e-commerce company Flipkart, owned by US retailing giant Walmart, is revamping its app to get the next 100-200 million Indians to transact on its platform.

The rejig, which includes a regional language interface, video streaming, and feeds to make itself more social, indicates a strategy shift to expand to a larger local and social engagement-led platform from a pure ecommerce destination.

The changes will entail launching the app in Hindi to drive adoption, introducing video content in collaboration with Over The Top (OTT) media services, and launching feeds for product-related content marketing.

“With this, the shop (the Flipkart app) itself will completely change,” said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Group CEO, Flipkart. “Our focus at Flipkart has been to tap the growing middle class, sub-30 year old, value customers across smaller towns and cities, and we believe the way to do that is to replicate a customer’s offline shopping experience on the app,” he said.

Flipkart said it has collaborated with several content platforms to offer a curated range of movies, shows and entertainment series called ‘Flipkart Videos’, which it will look to monetise through ads.

“While we are starting with partnerships, in the next six months, we will have a broader video play. We believe that our customers shouldn’t pay extra for premium content,” Krishnamurthy said.

Targeting the next 100 million users is largely pegged as the next phase of growth for e-commerce firms, given that only 50 million of the Indian Internet economy’s half a billion users have ever transacted online. In that context, content is seen as the gateway to commerce. Other initiatives include financial inclusion, driving affordability, strengthening technology and engineering stack to ensure better search, enabling voice as a medium to interact, and most importantly, expand selection.

In a bid to keep customers hooked on to the platform from a commerce perspective, the company is also launching ‘Flipkart Ideas’, which will work with brands and influencers to produce content on several topics including health, wellness, fitness, cooking, and photography.

Last month, Netflix unveiled its cheapest plan for smartphones and tablets priced at Rs 199 a month. Other players in this space include Zee Entertainment’s ZEE5, Reliance backed ALTBalaji, and Times Internet-owned MX Player."
13,2019-08-06,Zee,"Mumbai: A highly competitive video streaming space, with over 35 broadcasters, has made India a peculiar market for over-the-top players.

As everyone tries to grab eyeballs, interesting partnerships are being forged or explored. Times Internetowned MX Player already has content tie-ups with Sony Liv, Arré and Hoichoi, while Disney India-owned Hotstar has an in-app partnership with Reliance Jio Infocomm and a content tie-up with Hooq.

Similarly, telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are aggressively seeking tie-ups, offering live television channels as well as free or discounted subscriptions of OTT services, such as Amazon Prime Video.

The latest to jump on the bandwagon is ZEE5, the video streaming service by Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Balaji Telefilms’ Alt Balaji. The two are partnering for content syndication as well as coproduction.

However, the larger question is — are these partnerships good business strategy or just a survival tactic?

Many in the industry feel multiple business models are evolving and being tested in India, which is ahead of some developed countries in terms of number of consumers as well as players. “A majority of Indian broadcasters have their own OTT service today, something which US-based broadcasters are following now. However, this has led to a situation of multiple services, which is confusing the consumer,” said a top executive of a leading OTT service. “For many players, it is very costly, as you can’t acquire too many customers on your own. Content cost is already high and if subscriber acquisition costs also jump up, it will become unviable for many.”



Many media experts say India is witnessing new distribution alliances for OTT content. “The logic is very clear; it is to manage profitability. But will it last in the long term? I don’t know,” said a partner at a big consulting firm.

2017 saw the first burst of big money deployed behind Indian content on OTT. In fact, since the launch of Jio, the number of players has also gone up exponentially. From 2012, when there were just nine OTT players in India, the number today is over 35, with broadcasters, telcos, international and regional players, as well as independent content companies.

Large Indian broadcasters are already following a unique hybrid model of ad-supported catch-up content, premium content and live sports behind pay walls. Global OTTs such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which are investing heavily in Indian content, have also started looking at partnerships and India-only plans.

Netflix just announced a cheaper, mobile-only, monthly plan.

But the most interesting play is from telcos. While Airtel and Vodafone Idea tried their hand at original content, they quickly realised they didn’t have to; it was better to follow the aggregator model. Today, these telcos are aggregating content across multiple platforms and providing a payment interface.

They are also leveraging access to other OTTs as a differentiating factor to drive consumer retention and acquisition.

Ashish Pherwani, partner, media and entertainment, at EY India said today over 200 million Indians consume content through telco bundles. “I expect that to grow to over 375 million by 2021. The telcos will be the new multisystem operators and provide content at wholesale rates to end consumers,” Pherwani said."

One of them stated that now that partial stake sale in the Essel Group-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) is done, promoters are focused on completing Dish TV merger.

“The talks were on hold because Essel Group promoters were busy with ZEE stake sale. Now that it is done, the three parties gave come back to the table to stitch the deal,” one of the persons said.

Second person added that it is deal of a complex structure. “Various options are being worked out, which are tax neutral. Lawyers and advisers at all three ends are working on various options,” the person said.

ET was first to report on March 18 that Mittal had initiated talks with the Essel Group promoters to merge the DTH operations. The move came after Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio took controlling stake in two of the largest multi-system operators- DEN Networks and Hathway Cable & Datacom.

Indian tycoon Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group is in advanced talks to sell some toll road projects to an arm of the country’s sovereign wealth fund for about $350 million, according to people familiar with the matter.

The assets that National Investment & Infrastructure Fund is planning to buy are four toll roads that are in operations and two in construction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The parties expect to reach an agreement as soon as September, the people said.

Deliberations are ongoing and may not result in a deal, the people said. Essel Group confirmed that the sale plan has reached a ""very advanced stage"" without revealing the buyer, its representative said in response to a Bloomberg query. NIIF doesn’t comment on market speculation, its spokeswoman said.

Canada’s Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec dropped its plans to buy three road projects from Essel, Mint reported in July, citing unidentified people.

Chandra and his Essel Group have been selling assets to pare debt of about 110 billion rupees ($1.6 billion). Last week, the tycoon sold 11% stake in his flaghip Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, India’s largest publicly-traded television network, to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for 42 billion rupees. That would still leave Essel short of 68 billion rupees as it races to meet its goal of repaying all lenders by September.

NIIF, which manages more than $3 billion of assets, counts Temasek Holdings Pte, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan among its investors, according to its website."

20,2019-08-07,Zee,"Mumbai: Bharti Airtel’s direct-to-home (DTH) arm Airtel Digital TV, private equity firm Warburg Pincus and Essel Group-owned Dish TV have reached an agreement on merging the two businesses and a formal announcement is expected in four-six weeks, two people with direct knowledge of the development told ET.

With the partial stake sale in Essel Group-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) having been decided, the promoters are focused on completing Dish TV’s merger with Airtel Digital TV. The Essel Group’s promoters are selling assets to repay debt. They own a 57.52% stake in Dish TV— almost 95% of this is pledged with lenders.

“The talks were on hold because Essel Group promoters were busy with the ZEE stake sale,” one of the persons said. “Now that it is done, the three parties have come back to the table to stitch the deal.”

ET understands that three options are being discussed—an overall merger, a revenue merger and a deal that involves part cash, part merger.

A revenue merger is generally where two service lines are merged to form one division. In this case, if the companies decide to go for revenue merger, both businesses will run together as a single unit with respective shareholders.

“Various tax-neutral options are being worked upon as we speak,” said one of the persons. “Lawyers and advisors from all three companies are working on the deal.”

An Essel Group spokesperson declined to comment stating that the company “does not comment on any speculations.” Airtel and Warburg Pincus didn’t respond to queries.

ET was the first to report on March 18 that Bharti chairman Sunil Mittal had initiated talks with the Essel Group promoters to merge the DTH operations. The move had come after Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio took a controlling stake in two of the country’s largest multi-system operators--DEN Networks and Hathway Cable & Datacom.

Together, Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV will create the world’s largest TV distribution company with close to 40 million subscribers and over 62% share of India’s DTH market.

India had a total 72.44 million net active DTH subscribers at the end of March, according to the latest Telecom Regulatory Authority of India report. Out of this, Dish TV (combined with Videocon d2h) leads with a 40% market share, followed by Tata Sky (25%) and Airtel Digital TV (22%).

Dish TV completed its takeover of Videocon d2h in March last year, kicking off consolidation in the Indian DTH space, which has six players—five pay and one free.

Airtel, in the past, had tried to sell its DTH business to Tata Sky, but the two parties couldn’t reach an agreement. Later, in December 2017, Airtel sold a 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia, the holding company of Airtel Digital TV, to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million, valuing the DTH business at ₹11,300 crore.

Dish TV’s market cap on August 6 was ₹4,299.33 crore, down from the estimated combined valuation of ₹17,000 crore at the time of merger with Videocon d2h last year. Tata Sky’s valuation is estimated at ₹11,000-12,000 crore. In the quarter ended June, Dish TV had 23.9 million subscribers with operating revenue at ₹926.3 crore and ebidta at ₹536 crore.

Airtel Digital TV had 16.03 million subscribers at the end of June. Revenue from the DTH business was ₹738.9 crore, while ebitda and margins were at₹526.3 crore and 71.2%, respectively, during the quarter."

30,2019-08-13,Zee,"Mumbai: Invesco Oppenheimer, the US-based financial investor which has entered into a share purchase agreement with the promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), said Tuesday that the fund has full confidence in the company.

Justin Leverenz, Portfolio Manager of the Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, said that their analysis gives them “confidence that the underlying businesses at ZEE remain structurally sound, and offer an opportunity for meaningful growth over the years to come.”

The statement from Invesco Oppnheimer has come after the stock price of ZEE witnessed continuous drop.

The fund had signed a deal on July 31st with ZEE promoters to acquire an additional 11% stake in the company for a consideration of around Rs 4,224 crore (Rs 400 per share), giving a premium of over 10%. However, ZEE’s stock continued to decline and closed at Rs 327.40 apiece on Tuesday.

Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund has been an investor in ZEE for well over a decade and already own 7.7% stake in the company.

“Essentially, we are financial investors with an established track record for bottom-up, fundamental investing, and a history of investing in India since the Fund’s inception in late 1996,” Leverenz said.

He added that the fund believes in (ZEE’s) management's ability to achieve growth and deliver good financial returns to the shareholders. 

“We are working closely with the Essel Group to complete all the conditions prescribed in the share purchase agreement dated July 31st for the purchase of an 11% stake in ZEE (including obtaining the necessary approvals), and are targeting to close the deal as soon as practicably possible,” Leverenz added."
27,2019-08-13,Zee,"MUMBAI: Mukesh Ambani on Monday unveiled the plans for his fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service, JioFiber, wrapped with a host of goodies like lifetime-free voice calls and plans that offer free high-end TV sets and set-top boxes.

Ambani shared his ideas at the 42nd annual general meeting of Reliance Industries. He has bundled JioFiber with subscriptions to leading premium video streaming services and intends to introduce a disruptive concept for watching new movies. “Premium JioFiber customers will be able to watch movies in their living rooms the same day these movies are released in theatres,” he announced.

The commercial launch of the service is set for September 5 and the monthly plans start from Rs 700 and go up to Rs 10,000.

While JioFiber has shown a promising proposition, experts feel it will not disrupt the media industry the way Jio had disrupted the telecom sector. 

“Pricing (of JioFiber) is attractive but not jaw-dropping and hence, all other broadband players will not have to shut shop tomorrow,” said Rohit Dokania, senior vice-president for research at IDFC Securities. He, however, added that one has to wait and see what is being offered in the Rs 700 plan.

“It is possible that Viacom18 bouquet of pay channels, including Colors, could be bundled free of cost in the basic fibre plan. This seems generally good for broadcasters as they will get another content re-distributor. But we need to keep an eye on the terms of content-sharing agreement and they shouldn’t be dilutive versus existing contracts. We continue to have an outperformer rating on Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) and Sun TV Network,” Dokania said.

Prior to the launch, there were concerns that JioFiber will bundle TV services with broadband, which will affect the subscription revenues of channels. Such fears are nullified now.

Rajiv Sharma, co-head of institutional research at SBICAP Securities, said that JioFiber not bundling broadband plan with TV services is positive news for TV broadcasters. 

“I don’t see any value destruction in TV service. Having said that, there is a strategy of acquiring subscribers through hardware, which will put pressure on DTH players like Airtel and Tata Sky,” he said.

Direct-to-home (DTH) players might be hit as their premium subscribers, who are also paying separately for the broadband services, could be lured away by the combination of high-speed broadband, free unlimited calls and TV services at a comparatively cheaper price.

“Premium DTH players like Tata Sky and Airtel will have a lot to worry as they both have TV and broadband business at a relatively higher price. They may see an exodus. It won’t be very negative for Dish TV though, which has 65% of subscribers in the non-Urban areas,” said a top executive of a DTH company.

However, it is the multiplexes, which might see a loss of confidence from the shareholders’ end because of negative sentiments, feel some experts. “First-day-first-show movie release seems too ambitious as theatres demand an eight-week exclusive window. We will have to see how Jio will circumvent this issue. So, sentimentally, the announcement is negative for PVR and Inox Leisure, but we are not worried yet,” Dokania said.

INOX Leisure said in a statement that producers, distributors and multiplex owners in India have mutually agreed to an exclusive theatrical window of 8 weeks, between the theatrical release of a movie, and release on any other platform. This exclusive theatrical window is a model that is followed internationally, in order to ensure the robust financial viability of all the segments of the sector, and has been replicated in India.

Meanwhile, the announcement showed a little drift from Jio’s strategy stated earlier in terms of content creation. “Clearly, they are not going to focus on content creation themselves, but will go for content partnerships,” Sharma of SBICAP Securities said.

29,2019-08-13,Zee,"MUMBAI: Indian media and entertainment company Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has launched a new initiative ‘Embark’ for the capability development of its front line managers.

The programme, designed by the KPMG Learning Academy, has been undertaken with a belief that front line managers are the linchpin between the broad strategies of management and their on-ground execution.

Embark in its entirety will up skill 450 managers across the organisation and will provide more than 25,000 hours of training.

The company said it is one of the most ambitious capability building exercises undertaken by ZEE and one of the largest learning and development program in the media and entertainment industry.

Based on behavioural, technical and digital skills, the program will be executed in four key phases that will empower, create and institutionalise the learning journey for a seamless transition of employees into their new managerial roles. Spanning seven months, the participants would go through multiple interventions inclusive of case studies, skill-drills, role-play, webinars and e-reads across touch-points to help build their managerial capabilities.

“Managers are culture carriers, performance multipliers, risk mitigators and brand custodians of any company. With Embark, we aim to offer a holistic learning program for our front line managers that will empower them with an innovative and advanced working style and technical expertise,” said Animesh Kumar, Chief People Officer, ZEE.

“With the demand on organisations to constantly renew themselves, they can no longer adopt a short-term approach to building capability. As a business and a strategic imperative, we believe that organisations in the M&E industry must incorporate new-age and holistic learning designs that act as catalysts to enable them to build the right capabilities,” said Girish Menon, Partner & Head – Media & Entertainment, KPMG in India."

36,2019-08-17,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the red, following mixed macroeconomic data amid fears of a global economic slowdown. 

The 30-share Sensex shed 231 points, or 0.62 per cent, to end at 37,350 for the week ended August 16. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty lost 61.85 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 11,047.

The market kicked off the week on a bleak note on Tuesday as sentiment got hit after government data showed that India’s factory output growth, as measured by IIP, slowed down for the second straight month to 2 per cent in June compared with 7 per cent in June, 2018 and 3.1 per cent in May, 2019. 

However, the market pared some of the losses in the remaining two days of trade amid hope of a stimulus package for the economy from the government. Investors also took comfort as India’s retail inflation based on CPI eased to 3.15 per cent in July, 2019 from 3.18 per cent in June, 2019 and 4.17 per cent in July, 2018. WPI inflation also eased to a multi-year low of 1.08 per cent in the month of July, on account of cheaper fuel and food items. 

Meanwhile, trade deficit, the gap between imports and exports, narrowed to $13.43 billion in July from $18.63 billion a year ago, helped by a lower oil import bill.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week.

Maruti Suzuki shares slipped around 2 per cent to Rs 5,975 from Rs 6,100.

40,2019-08-20,Zee,"Mumbai: Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group will repay about Rs 2,600 crore to mutual funds this week out of Rs 4,200 crore it raised by selling 11 per cent in Zee Entertainment to global fund Invesco Oppenheimer. Those fund houses from which the Essel promoters borrowed with Zee shares as collateral will receive this tranche of the payment, said a person familiar with the matter.

Nonbanking finance companies will get Rs 1,100 crore out of the stake sale proceeds. Essel needs to repay mutual funds another Rs 3,700 crore before September 30, failing which the latter could sell the shares in the open market to recover money.


About six fund houses have an exposure of nearly Rs 6,300 crore with shares of Essel Group entities such as Zee, Dish TV and Essel Infrastructure as collateral.

Essel’s cash-strapped promoters had entered into an agreement with mutual funds getting time till September 30 to repay debt. This agreement prevented mutual funds from selling shares of group entities that were held as collateral. The agreement also affected payouts in the fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of Kotak Mahindra AMC and HDFC AMC.

Investors in six fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of Kotak AMC maturing between April 8 and May 31 did not get back their entire money on account of delay in repayment by Essel. HDFC Mutual Fund gave unitholders the option to roll over investments for another 380 days instead of redeeming at maturity in mid-April.

Aditya Birla MF has the highest exposure worth Rs 2,500 crore. Others that hold Essel securities are HDFC Mutual, SBI Mutual, ICICI Prudential, Kotak and Franklin Templeton. The Essel group had agreed to seal the stake sale deal before July 31 and return the proceeds by September. “Details cannot be shared due to confidentiality,” said an Essel Group spokesperson.

“Essel repayment would be a major sentiment booster for the entire mutual fund industry which was struggling after loss of confidence following a few defaults,” said the chief investment officer of a leading mutual fund. “There was uncertainty over the payments to AMCs even after the stake sale in Zee Entertainment.”

Mutual fund officials said it would be critical for Essel Group to repay the rest before September 30. In July, the group had unofficially told mutual funds holding the pledged shares that it could offload a further 10% in Zee to another investor in August to repay the balance of what it owes them. At Monday’s closing price of Rs 348, a stake sale of 10% in Zee would fetch about Rs 3,400 crore.

Earlier, HDFC Mutual Fund had bought non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Essel Group worth Rs 500 crore from the debt schemes having exposure to these securities. The fund house had said it would repay investors in fixed maturity plans (FMPs), which hold Essel securities and will mature till September."

Aiming to reduce cost of capital for businesses, the government has removed the requirement that listed companies, NBFCs and HFCs maintain a debenture redemption reserve (DRR). These companies will now be exempt from creating a DRR — pegged at 25% of the face value of debentures, whether public issues or private placements — under the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules. For unlisted companies, DRR requirement has been reduced from 25% to 10%. This is expected to alleviate the liquidity crunch that NBFCs have been facing since one year. 


Direct tax panel suggests lower taxes

It is understood to have suggested changes to the tax brackets, in what could lead to significant relief for the middle and upper middle class; a rate of 25% for both domestic as well as foreign companies, which face 40% tax now; and a concept of negotiated settlement via mediation that’s popular overseas.


Zee set to repay MF money

NBFCs will get Rs 1,100 crore. Six fund houses have Rs 6,300 crore exposure to Essel Group entities, whose cash-strapped promoters had entered an agreement with mutual funds buying time till September 30 to repay debt.


Fresh trouble brewing for NBFCs
In further trouble for NBFCs, their loan growth slipped into the negative territory with a nearly 2 per cent de-growth in June quarter, shows an analysis by Credit Suisse. This was attributed to a moderation in vehicle loans. Wholesale loans have started to deteriorate and as much as 10-11% of these have turned NPAs at some NBFCs.

46,2019-08-22,Zee,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."

44,2019-08-22,Zee,"Mumbai: FMCG major Nestle India is likely to be included in the benchmark Nifty index from October following the revision in criteria for inclusion of stocks in the Nifty indices, said brokerages. Zee Entertainment Enterprises or Indiabulls Housing Finance are likely to be excluded from the index.

Shares of Nestle India rallied to record high on hope of inclusion in the upcoming review of the index before ending up 5.6 per cent at Rs 12,635 on the BSE on Wednesday.

The index is reconstituted semi-annually considering six months data ending January and July. The changes, if any, are generally implemented from the first working day of the derivatives series of April and October. Four weeks’ notice is given to market participants in case of any replacement.

Under the revised criteria, which was announced on Tuesday, stocks which are permitted to trade on the NSE platform but are not listed on NSE will also be considered for inclusion in the indices.

Considering this parameter, along with the other considerations, Nestle India is most likely to replace Indiabulls Housing Finance from the Nifty 50, said brokerage ICICIdirect. Nestle India is likely to have a weightage of nearly 1 per cent in the index after inclusion, the brokerage said.

The retail brokerage expects Indiabulls Housing to be excluded to make way for Nestle in the benchmark index.

Yes Bank is also another probable candidate for exclusion from the index, said ICICIdirect.

“The six-month average free float MCAP (market capitalisation) for Indiabulls Housing Finance is lower than Yes Bank and it is likely to be removed from the Nifty 50,” said ICICIdirect.

However, Edelweiss believes that Zee Entertainment Enterprises is likely to exit the Nifty while Nestle is likely to be included.

The inclusion of Nestle is likely to entail buying worth Rs 11crore in the stock; while Zee Entertainment may see selling to the tune of $56 million, the brokerage said."

49,2019-08-29,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel Group has reached an agreement to sell 205 MW of operating solar assets of Essel Green Energy and Essel Infraprojects at an enterprise value of Rs 1,300 crore to Adani Group.

The solar assets, located in Punjab, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, will be acquired by Adani Green Energy. The assets have long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with various state electricity distribution companies, Essel Group said. The average remaining PPA life for the portfolio is around 22 years.

ET had reported on August 9 that Essel Group is in the final leg of negotiations with Adani Group to sell part of its operational solar assets and an announcement was expected this month. Essel Group’s solar energy portfolio consists of 685 MW of installed and under-construction projects. The company said it is also in talks to sell the remaining 480 MW assets.

The Adani deal is part of the divestment process of the Essel Group promoters to reduce debt and repay its lenders by September 30. The company has a debt of over Rs 11,000 crore. Last month, it announced the sale of 11% in Zee Entertainment Enterprises to financial investor Invesco Oppenheimer Fund for Rs 4,224 crore.

In an earlier interaction, Essel Group chairman Chandra had told ET that he’s confident of meeting the September 30 deadline that the lenders have set.

“Our asset divestment process is well within the purview of the agreed timelines with our esteemed lenders,” an Essel Group spokesperson said. “The sale of the solar assets to Adani Green Energy is yet another positive step taken in this direction. We have maintained a constant process of identifying the right potential partner for the sale of our precious infra assets and we are extremely glad to sign the agreement with Adani Green Energy.”

For Adani Green, this will be the first brownfield acquisition of operating assets. “The acquisition strengthens our position as one of India’s premier renewable power producers, with a total portfolio of around 5.5 GW, of which approximately 2.5 GW is operational, and the remaining is to be operationalised over the next two years,” Adani Green Energy chief executive Jayant Parimal said.

“It expands our footprint in states where we already have a presence, and with our strong operational expertise, will deliver significant value for our shareholders. We remain focused on opportunities that help us create value for shareholders, as well as facilitate the growth of environment-friendly green power in India,” Parimal said.

Essel Group promoters are also in talks to sell six of its 14 road projects to National Investment & Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) for around Rs 2,500 crore. These include four operational and two under-construction toll roads.

The company had earlier sold two transmission assets — Darbhanga-Motihari Transmission and NRSS XXXI (B) Transmission — to an Edelweiss fund for close to Rs 2,000 crore."
50,2019-08-30,Zee,"MUMBAI: Television and print media companies have started noticing improvement in volumes and are hoping for a robust revival in the coming festive quarter after a weak first quarter of 2019 in terms of advertising revenues.

Though the first half of 2019 (January to July) was weaker in terms of spends compared with the previous year, data sourced from TAM AdEx clearly shows an uptake in the April-June quarter over the preceding quarter.

The ad volumes for both television and print media were up by 10% and 8%, respectively, as per the latest data.

Education, services, auto, retail and personal accessories were top spenders on print media during the second quarter, while on TV, personal care, food & beverages, services, household products and hair care were the top categories, TAM AdEx data shows.


Initial bookings for the festival season have cheered ad sales executives.

Print and TV — the two largest mediums — corner over 66% of the total advertising pie. As per the revised forecast by Madison Media Group, advertisers are expected to spend ₹69,073 crore overall in 2019, of which almost ₹46,500 crore will be on TV and print media .

Various experts 
ET spoke with said that festive season accounts for almost 35-40% of annual advertising budgets and this year should not be any different.

“There is no doubt in my mind that we will see a spike in ad spends in the festive season. This is the time when brands will invest to maximise the opportunity with the festival-related demand growth. We are already seeing some increase across key categories. Some new launches in auto category are also there,” said Anand Chakravarthy, MD, India at Essence, GroupM’s data and measurement-driven media agency. “So despite the consumer sentiment so far, there will be jump in ad spends across TV, print and digital media.”

While the first two quarters have been slow for various reasons, there are clear signs of revival across sectors, said one of them.

Sivakumar Sundaram, president – revenue, at Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd (BCCL), which also publishes ET, said that he is hopeful of a good festive season. “I am very optimistic looking at the initial bookings. Festive period will set the pace and a momentum will be built on the positivity.”

He added that there was a slowdown visible in the large categories in the first quarter and a perceived slowdown in the economy, but given the recent stimulus through additional credit expansion to PSBs, liquidity support to HFCs as well as reduced interest rates for housing, vehicle and other retail loans on account of directly linking repo rates to interest rates, are all measures which would boost the economy, and stimulate demand and consumption this festival season.

“Overall, the demand for peak festival days is as strong as last year. Sectors like travel and tourism, airlines, FMCG, retail are already spending money on print,” Sundaram added In the television industry, experts are expecting spending to pick up during the festival season.

“With stability post new tariff order (NTO), wherein TV homes have increased (as per IRS survey) and consumer spending sentiment at its peak – specially during the festivals – coupled with the government taking necessary steps to boost economy, an upsurge in consumption across both urban and rural India is a certainty,” said Ashish Sehgal, chief growth officer – Advertising Revenue, Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

He added that ad volumes are “well poised” to showcase healthy growth by the end of this year.

Experts say that sunrise categories this festive season will be - online consumer services and gadgets, and clothing. Also, auto sector (both two-wheelers and four-wheelers) is expected to show a bump during the festival (with price reduction expected).

“With blessed rainfall and government initiatives, FMCG and consumer durables will revive its growth, especially in rural India as we progress towards the end of this year. All in all, cheers to a positive and healthy outlook,” Sehgal said."
51,2019-08-30,Zee,"It is preferable to avoid the four-wheeler space at least for the next two quarters while the two-wheeler segment is slightly better off, says Prasanth Prabhakaran, Jt MD & CEO, Yes Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How are you looking at the prospects for RIL, that stock is bucking the trend within the entire energy basket. Do you believe the Jio plans, Aramco deal could steer the stock even further from the 1250 levels?If you take pure management commentary, it sounds like a brilliant investment in the time to come in. I would like the same to be translated into action. If he has talked about the fact that he is going to be divesting money and reduce debt as far as the overall company is concerned, it is a brilliant move from any side because it is time to be conservative. Cash is going to be king at this point of time and balance sheets which are debt ridden and interest payments which are to the tune of around 45-50% of the overall balance sheets, are going to have stressful times ahead. 

If he manages to do the things that he has committed including listing of both the retail portion of it to raise money to end up paring debt off, it is a brilliant move. I would like it to happen. Let me end up putting this way, I am sceptical because in the market, it is not the right time either globally or on the Indian side, where they can manage to raise money easily. 


There are expectations that after the measures to deal with the overall economic slowdown have been announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman, RBI’s surplus transfer could happen for the beleaguered real estate space as well, given the fact that they are struggling with the overall liquidity issues. What is it that you would like to hear on this front?The only ones in the real estate basket that we have had in our kitty are the pure large ones that is the Godrej Properties from our side. The other one was Purvankara, which was largely involved in the affordable home segment which was in vogue as far as the market and as far as the government expenditure and support is concerned. 

These are the only two that we have had and both of them have done extremely well even in these tough markets that have gone by. We would prefer sticking to these and avoid the mid level ones or the ones which have had question mark as far as management is concerned or high debt on their books. It is not going to be easy getting the sector out of the problem. The only way out is to take the half finished projects and give it to the better ones for completing those, so that the clients are able to get out of this mess that has been created in the real estate space. 


What is the expectation when it comes to the auto space? Can we expect some sort of a pickup next month?In the last 15 days, I had the opportunity of meeting two of the largest dealers. The outlook from them has not been very great, they are talking about an extended bad run continuing for the next six months. 

On top of that they talk about at least 30 days inventory that is there on their books. Traditionally, such a large inventory is on their books, it also bleeds them as far as interest rate payments are concerned. Closures have started for most of the auto dealerships and a lot of surrenders have happened. It is still tough times as far as the four-wheeler segment is concerned. It is preferable to avoid that space at least for the next two quarters.

The two-wheeler segment is slightly better off. It has fluctuations but thankfully because of good monsoons, you might just have rural demand that might pickup in the times to come. 


What your outlook is when it comes to Zee Entertainment, the Essel Group? Some more headway is being made with respect to their debt reduction with Adani Green. How has that story played out post the deal with Oppenheimer?It is an important account which is there for most of the mutual funds as far as the banks are concerned. You also have to understand the history of the other units which were also looking out for stake sale. Just because it did not happen on time, most of these units have gone including Jet or other players which had tried selling off at the right time and if they had done it, life would have been a lot more simpler. 

It is finally the difference between what do you end up saying and what do you finally deliver which will make a difference. I would prefer that the entire stake sale happens and the money comes in and some amount of debt get reduced or some amount of commitments that you have given to the mutual funds get met as far as Zee is concerned. 

Till it happens, I would still have a sceptical view. I am not one of those who will want to punt in a market which is already muddy by nature at this point of time."

A small rival of Netflix Inc. in India plans to ramp up production of low-cost web shows in order to turn profitable.

ALT Digital Media Entertainment Ltd. aims to produce about 60 new web shows through a joint venture over the next two years, helping it to break even at the net income level. That would add to the 42 shows already owned by the company, which is the online-streaming unit of Balaji Telefilms Ltd.

“We are a pure-paying model right now, but once we reach that threshold of around 100 originals, we may think on advertising,” Nachiket Pantvaidya, ALT Digital’s chief executive officer, said in an interview at his office in Mumbai last week.

Digital subscribers in India are expected to increase to about 1.1 billion in 2030 from 528 million in 2018, according to KPMG India Pvt. Streaming sales in Asia’s third-biggest economy are estimated to more than triple to Rs 62,100 crore ($8.7 billion) in the five years to March 2024, according to a report the accounting firm published last month.

While much smaller than Netflix, Balaji is about 25% owned by Reliance Industries Ltd., the giant conglomerate controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani. And India’s lower and middle income digital consumers prefer regional content, according to KPMG, which may favor local providers with that demographic.

“I think one has to cater to either the classes or the masses; trying to have both the pies will lead to a confused strategy and may not work well,” said Pantvaidya, who serves as chief operating officer at Balaji Telefilms in addition to running ALT Digital.

While Netflix and other major players cater primarily to urban subscribers with high-cost global productions, ALT Digital’s ALTBalaji service is focused mainly on Hindi-language shows, targeting people between 20 and 40 years old who live in India’s 30 largest cities. Netflix has four monthly plans in India ranging from Rs 199 to Rs 799. ALTBalaji offers a three-month subscription for Rs 100 and a 12-month plan for Rs 300.

ALTBalaji expects its revenue to nearly double this fiscal year to about Rs 80 crore. Profitability should be helped by the fact that Balaji Telefilms will fund most of its planned production expenses. ALTBalaji and its partner Zee5, an online-streaming platform of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., aim to spend about Rs 250 crore over the next two years.

“We are committed to providing content for the masses, and only 5% of what we want to produce will be super-premium shows with an expensive star cast,” Pantvaidya said."

7,2019-09-06,Zee,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has stepped up its vigil on domestic asset management companies (AMCs) as mutual funds have emerged as the preferred investment route for a large number of retail investors.

In FY19, the regulator shot off 47 warning letters to various MFs — a steep rise from 17 in FY18 and 27 in FY17, data accessed through a Right to Information (RTI) application showed.

Charging excessive fees and commissions along with nonadherence to sectoral limits in debt funds and borrowing for purposes other than what’s allowed under MF regulations are some of the main reasons for issuing the letters, Sebi said in response to a query.

In some cases, Sebi has resorted to further legal proceedings, depending on the gravity of the violation. The development comes as mutual funds are currently facing regulatory heat for some of its investment practices, especially in the debt segment. Sebi is also said to have initiated adjudication proceedings against at least two AMCs.

“FY19 wasn’t a smooth year for mutual funds as fund houses faced pressure both from the regulator and unit holders,” said a leading fund manager working with a domestic AMC. “The challenges were also unique like in the case of Zee Entertainment where some of the funds were forced to enter into a standstill agreement with debtors.” Investors in many schemes took a mark-to-market loss due to the holdings in IL&FS and some of its subsidiary companies, DHFL and Sintex.

The fund manager said that the regulator has worked proactively and has plugged most of the gaps that were being exploited by the AMCs. For instance, one of the major violations by the fund houses, according to the RTI, was that investors belonging to T-15 cities and locations outside India were categorized as B-15 and distributors were being paid higher commissions.

Commission paid to a distributor for an investor based out of Thane or Noida were being charged at B-15 rates even though these areas should have been considered as part of Mumbai and Delhi. This promoted Sebi to revisit the commission framework and first change it to B-30 and subsequently directed fund houses to charge the additional 30 bps applicable on B-30 cities only on retail AUMs.

The regulator has also clamped down on the conflict of interest between fund houses and banks. In some cases, it was observed that mutual funds were parking short-term deposits in banks which were investors in the scheme. “AMCs failed to incorporate appropriate checks and balances to ensure that banks do not subsequently invest in the said schemes,” Sebi said in the RTI response.

There have been instances where AMCs have borrowed for purposes other than those allowed under the mutual fund regulations. “At times, the borrowing has been for larger interest of the AMC and not the unitholder, which the regulator wants to crack down,” said the CEO of a domestic fund house.


Sebi warnings more than doubleThe regulator has found instances of close-ended schemes, investing assets which had a maturity beyond the maturity of the scheme, thereby resulting in loss to the scheme due to premature liquidation. “This is not in the best interest of investors, as they could suffer a loss,” said a fund manager. Sebi has, however, declined to provide data on the warning letters received by each fund house.

Debt mutual funds have received warnings from Sebi for violations, including not valuing the investments as per regulations, non-adherence to the sectoral limits resulting in concentration of risks. “This happened due to redemption pressures where the AMC is unable to sell the illiquid or troubled security, thereby leading to an increase in its percentage in the portfolio,” said a debt fund manager.

The problems for debt funds started late last year when infrastructure conglomerate IL&FS defaulted on its debt obligations. It was followed by liquidity crunch in the debt papers of Deewan Housing Finance in September 2018 which adversely impacted investor sentiment in corporate bond market."

9,2019-09-07,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group has repaid more than half its debt to mutual funds and non-banking finance companies, said a person familiar with the matter.

Last month, the Essel Group had raised ₹4,200 crore by selling an 11% stake in Zee Entertainment to global fund Invesco Oppenheimer.

Nearly ₹3,700 crore has been transferred to mutual funds and NBFCs on Friday, said the person.

An Essel Group spokesperson declined to comment.

About half a dozen fund houses have a total exposure of nearly ₹6,300 crore to the group, with shares of companies such as Zee, Dish TV and Essel Infrastructure as collateral.

Essel’s promoters had entered into an agreement with mutual funds, getting time till September 30 to repay debt. This agreement prevented the funds from selling the shares held as collateral. The agreement had affected pay-outs in the fixed maturity plans of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company and HDFC AMC. Aditya Birla MF has the highest exposure worth ₹2,500 crore. Others that hold Essel securities are HDFC Mutual, SBI Mutual, ICICI Prudential, Kotak and Franklin Templeton."
10,2019-09-07,Zee,"MUMBAI: As the domestic stock market is going through its worst downturn in recent times, with all sectors submerged, one has managed to hold its head above water – the IT (information technology) services sector.

BSE IT and BSE Teck indices are up 3.83 per cent and 2.89 per cent, respectively, since the end of June, while all other sectoral indices logged losses in the same period, and the 30-share Sensex shed 6.12 per cent.

“The key reason is IT is seen as a defensive sector,” said Gaurav Dua, senior vice-president and head of capital market strategy & investments at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“Though the quarter one results were not great, the commentary on the growth wasn’t bad at all. Infosys actually upgraded its guidance. The rupee is also helping,” said Dua.

“It is a hedge against falling market, and a declining rupee helps boost revenues,” he added. Dua is overweight the IT pack. 

A depreciating rupee translates into higher revenues in rupee terms for the export-focused software companies.

The rupee has shed 3.68 per cent since end of June, and 2.96 per cent since the end of 2018, and is the third-worst currency in Asia after South Korean won, and Chinese yuan.

A weak reading of the GDP data coupled with selling from foreign institutional investors in the equity markets have weight on the Indian unit.

Overseas investors offloaded stocks worth a net of Rs 5,920 crore in the domestic market in August even after the government rolled back enhanced tax surcharge on FPIs. In July, they had pulled out a net of Rs 2,985.88 crore from Indian stocks.

Apart from these, a relentlessly strengthening dollar and US-China trade war fears have also contributed to the rupee’s fall.

“While domestic demand –oriented are facing the heat from the slowdown in the economy, IT stands in majestic isolation, as it is almost entirely not linked to the Indian economy,” said Ajay Bodke, CEO and Chief Portfolio Manager (PMS) at Prabhudas Lilladher.

“During times of heightened risk aversion towards domestic –oriented sectors, Its emerges as a safe haven for investors. A falling rupee acts a tailwind for Indian IT companies,” said Bodke.

The IT sector revenue growth in June quarter was 8.5 per cent YoY , compared with 8.6 per cent a year ago. The June quarter growth was contributed by Tier-1 IT at 8.5 per cent YoY (fastest in 5 quarters) and Tier-2 IT at 8.9 per cent YoY (slowest in 8 quarters). 

While HCL Technologies and Infosys outperformed, tier-2 IT companies disappointed, HDFC Securities pointed out.
Infosys’ operating profit for the quarter came in at 20.5 per cent, which was less than March quarter's 23.7 per cent and year-ago quarter's 21.4 per cent. But the management is hopeful that it will meet its 21-23 per cent full year guidance.

However, the country’s second-largest software services exporter increased FY20 revenue growth guidance to 8.5-10 per cent in constant currency terms from 7-5-9.5 per cent. Revenue growth in dollar terms rose 2.3 per cent to $3,131 million sequentially and 10.6 per cent on a yearly basis. In constant currency terms, revenue rose 2.8 per cent QoQ and 12.4 per cent YoY.

 “We have reviewed the performance and outlook of large global enterprises (top clients of Indian IT) which indicates that near term growth will be modest (lower discretionary spend),” HDFC Securities said in a August 27 note.

“We have also run margin sensitivity on onsite cost/INR and analysed the onsite supply scenario (increasing H-1B challenges), which indicates that higher offshoring is only a partial offset,” it added.

However, the outperformance in the BSE IT pack was polarized. Only seven of 57 stocks in the index logged gains since the end of June. These companies were NIIT Technologies, Infosys, Cerebra Integrated Technologies, Genesys International Corporation, HCL Technologies, Hexaware Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services.

Of the 29 stocks in the BSE Teck index, software exporters stole the show. Infosys, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, TV Today Network, HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Bharti Airtel were the only ones that registered gains in the same period."
13,2019-09-10,Zee,"Essel Group has made a partial repayment of over Rs 2,300 crore to some mutual fund houses. The group, widely referred as Zee Group, owed Rs 6,500 crore to six mutual fund houses. 

Earlier in the year, mutual funds and other lenders had entered into a ‘standstill’ agreement with promoters of Essel Group to give them time till September to repay their dues. The agreement met with widespread criticism from investors. Even Sebi frowned upon the unilateral agreement made by fund houses with certain promoters.

In April this year, investors in six fixed maturity plans (FMPs) of Kotak Mutual Fund maturing between April 8 and May 31 did not get back their entire money on account of delay in repayment by Essel. HDFC Mutual Fund gave unitholders the option to roll over or extend the maturity by 380 days instead of redeeming at maturity in mid-April.

 Aditya Birla Mutual Fund received the highest sum of Rs 760 crore out of the total Rs 2,500 crore due.

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund received Rs 435 crore, 60 per cent of the total outstanding amount. Their recovery was the highest in terms of percentage of the outstanding sum.

HDFC Mutual Fund received Rs 580 crore out of Rs 1,200 crore due and Kotak Mutual Fund received Rs 599 crore, including interest payments.

Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group raised Rs 4,200 crore by selling 11 per cent in Zee Entertainment to global fund Invesco Oppenheimer last month. It was expected that Zee will pay around Rs 2,600 crore to mutual funds out of this money."
11,2019-09-10,Zee,"For the past five years, earnings growth has missed consensus estimates of analysts. Even this year, it seems the situation may not change much. A key factor which requires consideration is valuation of the broad benchmark indices. Today, the Nifty 50 index is trading at price to earnings (P/E) multiple of 27 times. This is still an 11 per cent premium to the valuation three years ago, and 28.7 per cent to the valuation five years ago. This shows that the Nifty P/E does not adequately reflect the climate of economic slowdown.

In such a situation, it is important to follow the tenet of value investing. Among schemes, which follow this approach and have performed well is Invesco India Contra Fund. In the past five-year and 10-year periods, the scheme has given 10.6 per cent and 13.3 per cent returns, respectively, while its peers in the category have given average returns of 7.6 per cent and 11.9 per cent over the same periods.

One of the factors which has helped maintain its performance even in the short term is clear focus of the scheme’s fund managers Amit Ganatra and Taher Badshah to stick to either sector leaders or the second best in an industry even in the mid cap category. This focus has paid off even in the highly bearish phase of markets. In the past six months, the fund managers have clearly enhanced focus on such stocks.

Expert Take
Vishal Dhawan, CFP, Plan Ahead Wealth AdvisorsTypically, we see very few schemes which follow value investing in true sense. The fund has been buying value stocks and holding them till the value plays out. The fund managers follow this rule carefully. They have no preference for market capitalisation. For investors looking to supplement their portfolio with a value or contra style, this scheme is a good choice."

“The group is confident of completing the balance sale of 2.3% stake over the next few days,” the Essel Group, which is selling assets to pare debt, said in a statement on Tuesday. “The group is working towards timely completion of operational formalities in order to conclude the entire transaction at the earliest.”

The Essel Group promoters, who owe lenders, including mutual funds, more than Rs 11,000 crore, have time till September 30 to repay debt. The money from the stake sale will directly go to lenders. The promoters are also selling infrastructure and solar power assets to raise money to pay off debt.

On July 31, Essel Group promoters signed an agreement with Inveso Oppenheimer to sell up to 11% stake in ZEE for Rs 4,224 crore. It completed the sale of the first tranche of shares to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund on Tuesday.

Zee managing director Punit Goenka had told ET that through the sale of ZEE and of non-media assets, promoters should be comfortable to pay off the entire debt.

Last month, Essel Group reached an agreement with the Adani Group to sell 205 MW of operating solar assets for Rs 1,300 crore. The company had said that it was also in talks to sell the remaining 480 MW of power projects.

The promoters are in talks to sell six of its 14 road projects to National Investment & Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) for around Rs 2,500 crore. These include four operational and two under-construction toll roads.

The company had earlier sold two transmission assets — Darbhanga-Motihari Transmission and NRSS XXXI (B) Transmission — to an Edelweiss fund for close to Rs 2,000 crore. It is also in talks with former Flipkart cofounder Sachin Bansal to sell the Essel Mutual Funds business.

Six mutual fund houses — Aditya Birla MF, HDFC Mutual, SBI Mutual, ICICI Prudential, Franklin Templeton and Kotak — have a total exposure of close to Rs 6,300 crore to the shares of Essel Group entities including ZEE, Dish TV and Essel Infrastructure.

While Goenka had stated that if needed, promoters could sell a further 9% stake in ZEE, the current agreements and deals were set to fetch more than Rs 10,000 crore of proceeds.

The NSE Nifty50 index was trading 29.90 points up at 11,032.95, while the 30-share BSE Sensex was up 120.53 points at 37,265.98 around 10:15 am.

20,2019-09-11,Zee,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest money manager by assets, was busy buying select banks, PSU and infrastructure stocks all through August, even as BSE Sensex slid marginally by 0.40 per cent.

The fund house increased exposure to YES Bank, ITC, NHPC, Coal India and SBI; stocks that have plunged between 7 per cent and 65 per cent since January 2019. It added 1.59 crore shares of Bharat Electronics whose share price has rallied nearly 25 per cent so far this calendar. BSE benchmark Sensex is up just 2.46 per cent year to date.

“Indian equities are offering good value,” Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC Asset Management, told ETNow. “When largecaps start offering good value, you are unlikely to get it wrong, because these are big businesses with low leverage. Corporate leverage in India has come down,” he said.

Ace Mutual Fund database showed HDFC AMC held 6.02 crore shares of YES Bank as of August 31 against 2.57 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house sees value in the private sector lender.

“Most of the businesses, which were in deep pain have either been sold or are in a state where they do not really matter. They are doing reasonably well and things are okay,” he said.

The fund house bought 71.50 lakh additional shares in oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries.

Analysts have turned upbeat on the prospects of RIL stock after its telecom arm Reliance Jio this past week rolled out its broadband offering JioFiber across 1,600 cities.

“This is disruptive. The consumers targeted use data in a big way,” said Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director at KR Choksey Investment Managers. He expects the stock to double in three years.

HDFC AMC also added shares of banking majors ICICI Bank (30 lakh shares), Axis Bank (21.67 lakh) and HDFC Bank (17.51 lakh) besides doing a fair bit of buying on the counters of DCB Bank (16.61 lakh), RBL Bank (7.50 lakh) and Federal Bank (7.59 lakh).

Saravana Kumar, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund, says retail-focused private lenders with strong balance sheets should do well going forward. “These banks will also corner some market shares from NBFCs and PSUs,” he said.

Jain’s team at HDFC Mutual Fund also bought over 10 lakh shares each in Avenue Supermarts, Tata Steel, Delta Corp, BPCL, Bajaj Electricals and Indian Hotels.

Inox Fluorochemicals, Pidilite Industries, Piramal Enterprises, SRF and Sterling and Wilson were among the fund house’s fresh buys, while it completely exited Havells India and Shree Cement.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 122 companies and offloaded shares of 33 across sectors. It held 314 stocks as of August 31, 2019.

Among the stocks in which the fund house offloaded between 1 lakh to 2.50 crore shares during the month were BHEL, SAIL, Reliance Nippon Life Asset, NIIT Technologies, Tata Chemicals, Shriram Transport Finance, Just Dial, Bharti Airtel, Ambuja Cement, Elecon Engineering, Zee Entertainment, Rites, Wonderla Holidays, Solar Industries, S Chand and IndiaMART InterMESH.

It also sold more than 1 lakh shares of auto majors including Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp. India this August recorded the steepest drop in auto sales ever since the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had started collating monthly wholesale vehicle sales data in 1997-98.

Jain of HDFC Asset Management said he sold auto stocks mainly due to valuations. “The prices have come down, but multiples have not come down because earnings will also de-grow sharply. First investment has to revive, salaries have to go up and only then can we make a case for a sustained revival in consumer discretionary,” he said."

YES Bank creates ripples
YES Bank advanced over 13 per cent for the week amid stake sale rumours in the market.

28,2019-09-19,Zee,"MUMBAI: A Delhi High Court-appointed arbitrator has asked Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra not to sell his unpledged stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) till next month in an ongoing dispute with Indiabulls Housing Finance over default in repayment of loans worth Rs 200 crore.

The order, passed by Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed (Retd) on August 28, restrains Chandra from selling, directly or indirectly, shares of ZEE till October 16, the date of the next hearing. The order exempts ZEE shares already pledged with nonbanking finance companies and mutual funds but is likely to complicate matters for these lenders as they seek to recover their money.

Essel Group has certain claims against Indiabulls Housing Finance and likewise Indiabulls Housing Finance also has certain claims against Essel Group, said an Essel Group spokesperson.

“The mentioned stay issued by the Hon’ble Arbitrator has not been received by Essel Group as yet. The same will be reviewed by Essel Group once received, before making any further comments”, he added.

Emails sent to Indiabulls Group did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.

“Considering the totality of circumstances at this stage and to balance and protect the rights of the parties, I feel that it would be appropriate to pass an order restraining the respondent (Subhash Chandra) from creating any third party rights, selling, encumbering, alienating, transferring or disposing of in any manner whatsoever any of the assets/properties mentioned by the respondent in the affidavit which has been filed,” the order stated.

“It would also be necessary to pass an order restraining the respondent from directly or indirectly divesting his shareholding, if any, in ZEEL (Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd). However, this would relate only to shares which are not pledged or encumbered with mutual funds/banks/NBFCs or other financial institutions and in which no third party rights had been created prior to the deed of guarantee dated 05.12.2018,” it said.

The Essel Group, which owns ZEE, had reached an agreement in January under which the lenders agreed not to sell the Zee Entertainment shares pledged with them till September 30 and gave Essel time to find a buyer for a portion of Chandra’s stake.

Earlier this month, the Essel Group transferred Rs 4,000 crore to lenders after selling 11 per cent of the promoter stake in ZEE to Invesco-Oppenheimer. The group was also in discussions with other buyers to sell another 7-8 per cent stake and repay the lenders in full.

That process may get complicated now with the arbitrator’s order. The promoter stake in ZEE is now reduced to 25 per cent after the deal with Invesco-Oppenheimer, of which 52 per cent is pledged. The deal with mutual funds and other lenders stipulates that Essel repay all loans by the end of this month. Since the unpledged shares of ZEE can’t be sold, Essel will have to work with prospective buyers and lenders on finding a solution that satisfies everybody. One of the possibilities include lenders getting repaid and removing the pledge, thereby enabling buyers to get unencumbered shares. The promoters can then bring down the debt though their stake becomes even smaller in the company. The Essel Group’s 25 per cent stake is now worth Rs 8,051 crore while the debt with mutual funds and other lenders is more than Rs 5,000 crore.

Indiabulls had moved the Delhi High Court in December 2018 after Essel promoter firms defaulted on repayment of loans."

Essel Group sold 11 per cent in its media unit, Zee Entertainment, to Invesco Oppenheimer for Rs 4,224 crore and repaid Rs 2,300 crore to six mutual fund houses.

Yes Bank tanked over 15 per cent after a Moody’s report said Altico Capital’s default was credit negative for the bank. 

Sensex closed the day at 36,093, down 470 points or 1.3 per cent. Nifty, though defended 10,700, but crashed 136 points to 10,704. 

“Continuous selling by FIIs and uncertainty over future trajectory of Fed rate cut dampened investor sentiment. Slowdown in direct tax collection and rise in oil prices will limit government’s space for stimulus measures which will continue to act as a downside risk to the market,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Yes Bank tanksShares of YES Bank tanked over 15 per cent after Moody’s said Altico Capital’s default was credit negative for the banks with significant exposure to the real estate sector.

Vodafone Idea jumps 12%Telecom major Vodafone Idea soared 12 per cent to Rs 5.44 on BSE after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India issued a discussion paper on deferring the implementation of the zero interconnect usage charges (IUC) regime. The regime was slated to kick in from January 2020, and if implemented, could mean a loss of revenue for the company. Bharti Airtel shares also rose 0.6 per cent to Rs 337.70 on BSE.

38,2019-09-20,Zee,"The debt woes of Essel Group promoters may worsen as mutual funds squabble among themselves on whether to give more time to Subhash Chandra’s private firms to repay debt.

With 11 days to go for Essel promoters to redeem the pledge on shares of Zee Entertainment by repaying loans to mutual funds and nonbanking finance companies, some mutual funds are against granting more time. Zee Entertainment is part of the Chandra-led Essel Group, and its shares have been pledged by the promoters to raise money for the group’s infrastructure projects.

ET spoke to various mutual funds on the issue. While some big players are willing to grant Essel promoters three more months to repay, a few others are against offering any leeway.

Top executives of the Essel Group are said to have told mutual fund officials about their inability to meet the deadline, and sought more time to repay.

The group is in talks with some investors to sell additional stake in Zee and negotiations are on over pricing and other issues, said a personal aware of the discussions.

An Essel Group spokesperson said the conglomerate is in constant dialogue with the consortium of lenders and that the overall asset divestment approach is in steady progress with the group focussed on the repayment process.

“All decisions taken in this process so far have been in the interest of lenders and have only been implemented after their consent. The group will continue to follow this approach with a sheer focus on repayment. The group also continues to actively work on further divestments, including its non-media assets,” the spokesperson said.

Essel Group promoters had struck a standstill agreement with mutual funds and NBFCs in January after a precipitous fall in Zee shares. After failing to top up shares given as collateral, the promoters had promised to repay lenders by September 30.



Last month, Essel sold 11 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment to Invesco Oppenheimer for Rs 4,224 crore. The proceeds were used to repay Rs 2,300 crore to six mutual funds —Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential, SBI Mutual and Kotak Mutual. The Essel Group is keen to settle the remaining debt of about Rs 2,300 crore by September 30.

“Some MFs want to give more time to the Essel Group as it has genuinely made efforts to repay, so that the group can sell its stake in Zee at a better valuation,” said a person aware of the matter.

It is believed that some fund houses such as Kotak and HDFC are not agreeable to an extension and want the debt to be repaid before the deadline. However, another fund house with a large exposure is ready to grant an extension. Talks are on among the funds and a decision is likely soon, sources said.

Spokespersons of all the six mutual funds declined to comment.


SEBI’S TOUGH STANCE
The fears of some of the MFs could also be due to the tough stance taken by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on the issue of standstill agreements.

The regulator had issued notices to HDFC Asset Management and Kotak Mutual Fund a few months ago for extending the maturity of their FMPs owing to Essel’s financial difficulties."

Indian media giant Essel Group, run by industry mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking an extension to repay debt in order to avoid creditors liquidating its shares.

The company faces a month-end debt repayment deadline. If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans. The case highlights broader risks that borrowings backed by stock pose to the equity market. There’s a lot at stake with share-backed loans currently at about 1.9 trillion rupees ($26.5 billion).

Essel Group’s Chandra is seeking to sell assets ranging from a stake in the nation’s most valuable publicly traded TV network to roads. Shares of his Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. have plummeted to the lowest level in five years.

“We have certainly discussed the point pertaining to the extension as well, purely in the interest of deriving the right value for the precious assets,” said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer at Zee Enterprises in an emailed response, “The lenders have noted our view and have been extremely supportive.”

The media tycoon’s challenge is the first of what could be a string of tests this year for beleaguered business titans from Anil Ambani to the founders of the Emami Group. They have raised funds to expand their empires by pledging equity stakes in their firms and the clock is ticking as repayment dates loom.


Risks Mount
“Not everybody is going to come out of this alive,” said Jayanth R Varma, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, referring to the founder’s funding predicament. “I can’t imagine that all the groups that are in trouble today will be able to sort out their mess.”

Chandra has already sold $614 million of its Zee Entertainment Stake to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund and has agreed to sell his solar power projects for $182 million to Adani Green Energy Ltd. The Essel Group has begun paying back creditors, including about half of the 3.95 billion rupees ($55.7 million) it owes Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co., Harsha Upadhyay, chief investment officer for the asset management firm said in an interview.


Broader Concerns
Shares of publicly traded firms with a large portion of equity pledged as collateral risk abrupt declines should lenders move to recover their dues. For instance, Chandra’s Zee Entertainment lost $1.6 billion in market capitalization in a single day on fears that creditors would offload shares. For Anil Ambani’s Reliance group, the sale of shares held as collateral reduced the market capitalization of its companies by nearly 55% in just four days, the group said in a filing earlier this year.


Meanwhile, Reliance Capital, part of Anil Ambani’s group, was downgraded to default grade at Care Ratings Ltd. last week after a delay in coupon payments on some of the lender’s debt. The company said in a statement that the delay was caused by a technical glitch in an exchange filing. A spokesman for Reliance group said that Reliance Power Ltd. and Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. have signed inter-creditor agreements with their lenders and that Reliance Infrastructure “aims to be zero debt” in 2020.

A spokesman for Emami Ltd. declined to comment.

Should Essel group clear its debt hurdles, equity investors will still need to keep a close eye on the progress other conglomerates make in slashing debt, as companies’ credit quality endures the longest streak of deterioration since 2014.

“Stocks are getting decimated on their market cap, some company founders have realized their error and are liquidating assets,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president at IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Prudent risk management is the order of the day.”"

53,2019-09-24,Zee,"Mumbai: Mutual funds have started selling pledged shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), rejecting the promoter’s plea for an extension of the repayment deadline. ZEE shares slumped 10 per cent on Monday to close at Rs 272 despite a stellar broader market rally as SBI Funds Management sold shares worth Rs 200 crore. Funds like ICICI Prudential and Kotak Asset Management are also believed to be on the verge of offloading the shares ahead of the repayment deadline of September 30.

When contacted, an Essel Group spokesperson confirmed the sale of ZEE shares by some of the lenders. “Essel Group confirms that the lenders, which had not agreed to grant the extension, have exited by selling the pledged shares of ZEEL. The other lenders that value the assets have agreed in principle to grant more time to the group,” he added. An email sent to Kotak, ICICI Prudential and SBI Funds Management did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.

Essel Group promoter Subhash Chandra met finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday to brief her on the developments. ZEE shares have fallen for six consecutive days, losing nearly 22 per cent since September 16.



The lenders to Essel Group, comprising mostly mutual funds and nonbanking finance companies, agreed in January this year to give the group time till September 30 this year to find a strategic or financial investor in ZEE and repay their loans worth nearly Rs 9,500 crore. Essel agreed to sell 11 per cent of promoters’ stake in ZEE to Invesco Oppenheimer in July and managed to repay Rs 4,200 crore.

Mutual fund officials said their debt now is worth Rs 2,300 crore. Essel Group sought extra time last month after it became clear it will not be able to conclude another deal by the end of the week.

The debt crisis at the group worsened after the Delhi HC-appointed arbitrator asked the promoters not to sell or create third-party rights on their unpledged stake in ZEE till October 16. The order came in an ongoing dispute with Indiabulls Housing Finance over default in repayment of loans worth Rs 200 crore. After the Invesco Oppenheimer deal, promoters hold about 25 per cent in ZEE, of which 52 per cent is pledged. That stake is now worth Rs 6,533 crore."

61,2019-09-25,Zee,"Mumbai: HDFC Asset Management, Franklin Templeton and Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund are likely to give more time to the promoters of Essel Group to repay outstanding loans as they believe the current price of the Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) stock makes it unattractive for the owners to sell and pay back investors, two people aware of the development told ET.

The stock, which lost 10 per cent Monday despite a broader market rally, witnessed delivery-based transactions of 18.6 million shares, totalling about Rs 520 crore. Capital International was reportedly among the buyers of the stock Tuesday, while SBI Funds Management and Kotak Mutual Fund were among the sellers of the pledged equity, the two market participants said.

Officials at the mutual funds concerned and Zee could not be immediately reached for their comments.



Effects of the latest stock sales by the two mutual funds were, in part, offset by the reported decision of the three other institutional investors to give the Essel promoters time beyond the September 30 repayment deadline. The Zee stock was the second-most active on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Tuesday by way of value, and featured among the top five gainers on the benchmark Nifty.

Shares of Zee, which fell 22 per cent in a week through Monday, gained 3 per cent to close at Rs 279 on the NSE. More than Rs 1,700 crore worth of Zee stock was traded on the bourse Tuesday, making it the second most-traded scrip after Reliance Industries.

Top Essel executives are said to have told mutual fund officials that the company may not be able to meet the September 30 deadline and that they would need more time to repay. The group is in talks with some investors to sell additional stake in Zee, but negotiations are still on over valuations, a person aware of the discussions said.

Mutual fund officials said their outstanding debt is now worth Rs 2,300 crore, ET reported September 24. Essel Group sought extra time last month after it became clear that it will not be able to conclude the strategic sale of a chunk of promoter-owned shares before the September 30 payment deadline."

In an earlier development, Subhash Chandra-led Essel Group on September 10 said it has part-completed its promoter stake sale in flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises, and is working on more divestments to pay off the Rs 13,000 crore owed to lenders.

Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have darkened the outlook for developing Asia, with the region expected to grow slower than previously predicted this year and next, the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday.

Growth in the region was 5.9 per cent in 2018.

72,2019-09-25,Zee,"Mumbai: The Subhash Chandra-led Essel Group on Wednesday said mutual funds from which it has borrowed money have ""unanimously"" decided to grant it more time for repayments.

In a statement that comes amid media reports of a few fund houses selling their holdings in the company ahead of the September 30 deadline, the group did not specify the mutual funds which have supported it, or the amount due.

The fund houses had an outstanding of over Rs 11,000 crore from Essel Group and had done the unprecedented in granting it more time to repay even in the face of massive corrections in the share prices of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, their core security.

""Lenders have unanimously agreed to extend the timeline, enabling the Group to optimize the value output from the sale of its assets,"" a statement from the group said.

""The mentioned extension of the timeline was requested purely in the interest deriving the right value of the precious assets of the Group,"" it added.

Promoters had borrowed the money for other businesses including infrastructure, roads and power, by pledging their holdings of ZEEL. A majority of these bets went awry and the liquidity crisis created by the collapse of IL&FS made it difficult to refinance the debt.

Simultaneously, bears mauled the ZEEL scrip as well, triggering a piquant situation where the value of security held by the lenders went down. In the face of the troubles, and with a view to protect the value, nearly the dozen MFs decided to give Essel more time.

The sell-off in the ZEEL shares was termed as sabotage by the promoters.

According to recent media reports, the MF houses were divided over the issue of granting more time to Chandra. Another report also named Kotak Mutual Fund as having sold stakes in the company recently.

It can be noted that till now, the promoters have sold their ZEEL holdings in two tranches to raise over Rs 4,000 crore. They have also signed a deal with Adani Energy to sell solar assets for Rs 1,300 crore.

According to reports, the Essel Group has made some part payments to its creditors as the money from the stake sales started flowing in.

The ZEEL scrip closed 2.65 per cent down at Rs 271.90 a piece on the BSE on Wednesday as against a 1.29 per cent correction in the benchmark."

81,2019-09-26,Zee,"Mumbai: India’s capital markets regulator Thursday said that mutual funds can’t enter into any kind of ‘standstill agreement’ with their borrowers, reiterating the primacy of existing rules for financial market entities a day after Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group said some funds agreed to further extend the repayment deadline for its outstanding debt.

“It is not there in any of the regulations. We have made our position clear,” Ajay Tyagi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said on the sidelines of an industry event in Mumbai. “Entities have to follow the regulations that are there. There is no confusion on that.”

Essel and the lenders, led by mutual funds including Birla Sunlife, HDFC, Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential, SBI and Kotak, had first entered into standstill agreements late January. The deal gave the media group, which owns Zee Entertainment and Dish TV, time until September 30 to repay debt to the funds. The deals were made after the promoters failed to bring in additional collateral in the aftermath of pronounced declines in both Zee and Dish TV shares.


First Voiced Criticism in May

Essel Group has managed to repay about Rs 2,600 crore to mutual funds by selling 11 per cent in Zee to Invesco Oppenheimer for Rs 4,224 crore. It was expected to settle the remaining debt of about Rs 2,300 crore by September 30. But talks ended in a deadlock after the stock crashed.

Birla Sunlife Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and HDFC Asset Management are the funds to which Essel owes money. Earlier this week, SBI Funds Management and Kotak Mutual Fund sold Zee shares in the open market.



Mailed queries to Birla Sunlife, Franklin, ICICI Prudential and HDFC, seeking their reaction to Tyagi’s latest remarks, remained unanswered.

“If it (standstill agreement) is not prohibited, it is allowed in common law. It is a fundamental part of fund management to assess the situation and take a call,” said Sandeep Parekh, founder, Finsec Law Advisors. “It should be a fund manager’s discretion to decide whether it is in the best interest of investors.”

Sebi had first voiced its criticism against standstill agreements in May. The regulator had sent legal notices to HDFC Mutual and Kotak Mutual after their Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) holding Essel group papers came up for maturity.

Earlier this week, Sebi in a circular said any extension to the maturity of money market or debt securities ought to be treated as default.


PROMOTERS VS CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS

Tyagi said the regulator is also reexamining the concept of ‘company promoters’ vis-a-vis ‘controlling shareholders’.

“The concept of ‘promoters’ has been prevalent in India for a long period of time. Globally, rather than promoters, the concept of ‘controlling shareholders’ is more prevalent,” he said on Thursday. “Keeping in mind the changing realities of the global and Indian markets, we are examining the relevance of the concept of a promoter in today’s times along with whether any changes to Sebi regulations are warranted in this regard.""

The Sebi chief also said the regulator will consider a proposal to reduce the time taken for rights share issues to around a month. At present, the rights issue process takes 55-58 days from the time a company decides to launch the offer.

Tyagi said that Sebi is also in the process of taking steps to strengthen the framework for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) in areas such as standardisation of the private placement memorandum and benchmarking framework for performance disclosures.

On a cumulative basis, investments made by AIFs stood at Rs 1.1 lakh crore in March 2019, compared with Rs 7,300 crore in March 2015, Sebi data showed."

78,2019-09-26,Zee,"September derivative series was mostly positive for investors of F&O stocks, those which are traded in the futures and options segment of NSE. Out of the 161 stocks that trade in the F&O segment, over 40 surged in double digits in cash market while as many as 117 ended with gains. 

IDBI Bank was the biggest gainer in the pack, jumping 41 per cent in the September series. Bharat Petroleum (up 31 per cent), Page Industries (up 25 per cent), Siemens (up 23 per cent) and Kajaria Ceramics (up 21 per cent) were among the top five gainers for this period, AceEquity data showed. 

The September F&O series was marked by some big steps from the government to boost the economy, including a corporate tax rate cut bonanza, plans to merge PSU banks and setting up of a panel to identify projects for a Rs 100 lakh crore infrastructure plan. 

The corporate tax cut gave a fillip to market sentiments and propelled Sensex 3,000 points in just two sessions, while Nifty climbed 1,000 points. 

During the series, weak macro-economic numbers and global geopolitical tensions capped the gains in a volatile market. Overall, Nifty climbed 490 points, or 4.5 per cent, while Sensex grew 1,500 points, or 4.2 per cent. Nifty Bank climbed 2,280 points, or 8.3 per cent, during the September series. 

Analysts are positive about market prospects going forward. “Under-ownership of stocks is telling me that we are in for the best time in next 18 months. Yes, there will be volatility till the middle of October. After October, you will see the best equity rally ever,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities told ETNow. 

Bhasin’s top picks include PNB, Bank of Baroda, IDFC First Bank and Federal Bank from the banking sector and Ambuja Cement and UltraTech from the infrastructure segment. He is also bullish on GAIL and IGL from the energy sector. 

Analysts also expect a jump in earnings. “The corporate tax cut is a welcome move. Going forward, we may see a jump in earnings for Q3 and Q4. We are very positive after looking at the things that happened in last one week,” said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. 


Biggest losers in Sept series
Debt-ridden Zee Entertainment was the biggest loser in the September series, falling 25 per cent. Canara Bank (down 13 per cent), Dish TV (down 12 per cent) and Strides Pharma (down 10.5 per cent) were other stocks that dived in double digits. 

Over 40 stocks ended in the red during the series. Most of them are from sectors like IT, realty, pharma and infrastructure. Analysts have advised investors to look at IT stocks, as the delta shifted to capex-driven businesses. 

“Foreign and domestic mutual funds held IT as bellwether to ride the tide when we were at 10,700 (on Nifty). At 11,700, the equation has changed. We are ‘underweight’ IT now. You will see smart money move out of the sector to segments where there is more delta,” said Bhasin.

Global brokerage UBS has also turned ‘underweight’ on the IT sector."

74,2019-09-26,Zee,"Mumbai: Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group on Wednesday said its lenders have unanimously agreed to extend the timeline for making pending payments. The extension will enable the group to optimise the value output from sale of its assets, it said.

The announcement has come at a time when some of the mutual funds started dumping Zee Entertainment shares which were pledged with them by the Essel Group as collateral against the loans.

Zee’s stock declined 2.7 per cent to close at Rs 271.9 on the BSE Wednesday.

Early this week, SBI Funds Management and Kotak Mutual Fund sold Zee shares in the open market. Birla Sunlife Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and HDFC Asset Management are the other fund houses the Essel Group owes money to — nearly Rs 2,000 crore.

“The timeline was requested purely in the interest of deriving the right value of the precious assets of the group,” the Essel Group said in a statement. The group has promised the lenders to repay their loans by further divestments, including its non-media assets.


Essel Group Gets More Time

The lenders to the group, comprising mostly mutual funds and NBFCs , agreed in January to give it time till September 30 to find a strategic or financial investor in Zee and repay their loans worth nearly Rs 9,500 crore. Essel sold 11 per cent of promoters’ stake in Zee to Invesco-Oppenheimer in July, and managed to repay Rs 4,500 crore.

87,2019-09-27,Zee,"By Ronojoy Mazumdar and Nupur Acharya

India’s top mutual funds risk running afoul of the country’s securities regulator for granting more time to media mogul Subhash Chandra for repaying nearly a billion dollars in debt.

Shares of the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. have steadied since hitting a five-year low Monday after the group said the money managers had agreed to extend the repayment timelines on obligations due by September-end.

What’s unclear is how the extension will be looked at by the regulator, who in June invalidated pacts between funds and their borrowers. On Thursday, Chairman Ajay Tyagi reiterated the watchdog’s stance, saying “there is no confusion” and that all market participants must adhere to the rules.

Chandra’s Essel Group has repaid 44.50 billion rupees ($628 million) after selling stake in Zee to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund and divesting solar farms and other non-media assets. The sales still leaves a large repayment gap for the conglomerate.

The first extension, known as standstill agreement on sale of the group’s shares pledged as collateral, was granted after Zee’s shares tumbled as much as 37% in a single day in January amid worries about the group’s debt, increasing the risk of default.

Some of India’s biggest asset managers, including Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co. and HDFC Asset Management Co., hold shares of Zee as collateral against dues owed by Essel Group.

A spokesman for Essel declined to comment. Representatives for Birla and HDFC mutual funds didn’t respond to email and phone calls seeking comments.

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 37.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

. Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on 
Sterlite Technologies with a target price of Rs 296. Acquisition of 80 per cent stake in IDS Group will help Sterlite build capabilities in the fast growing data centre design space, which it can cross-sell, and will be EPS-accretive from the first year itself, the brokerage said. Edelweiss believes the acquisition’s success hinges on institutionalisation of know-how and retention of top management. The stock ended up 3.4 per cent at Rs 161.40 on Thursday.


• Morgan Stanley has retained overweight rating on 
InterGlobe Aviation and revised target price to Rs 2261 from Rs 2060. The brokerage has retained overweight rating on due to rising international mix, rising share of NEOs and healthy fare environment in India. On the pricing side, the brokerage sees yields starting to rise, and the recent correction in crude and appreciation in the rupee also stand to help IndiGo. The stock ended up 3.8 per cent at Rs 1871 on Thursday.


• Kotak Institutional Equities has retained sell rating on 
Bharat Petroleum Corporation with a fair value of Rs 385. The brokerage sees limited upside after the sharp outperformance against other OMCs which effectively prices in potential rerating of valuation multiple from strategic privatisation; any further upside will be contingent on improvement in earnings that may take time to percolate. A nonstrategic transaction like ONGC-HPCL may lead to de-rating of the stock, said KIE. The stock ended up 3.3 per cent at Rs 479.95 on Thursday.

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on 
Zee Entertainment Enterprises and cut target price to Rs 450 from Rs 515. With Indian media in a worse advertising slowdown than in 2009, the brokerage has slashed its FY20-FY22 ad revenue forecast by 5 per cent. CLSA has cut its valuation multiple but has retained buy rating due to Zee's growing business and compelling valuation. The stock ended up 5.4 per cent at Rs 286.70 on Thursday.

• Antique Stock Broking has maintained buy rating on 
Indian Hume Pipe Co. with a target price of Rs 399. Indian Hume Pipe is a leader in the water supply industry with a track record built up over the past ninety two years, said Antique. Speedier implementation of smart cities would add impetus to order inflows, said Antique. Allocation of Rs 22,400 crore in the Union Budget towards drinking water and sanitation including Swachh Bharat Abhiyan augurs well for the order book with a number of water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes being implemented, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 0.25 per cent at Rs 282.20 on Thursday."

15,2019-10-03,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Nearly three-fourths of BSE100 stocks advanced in September, as the index put behind losses of three straight months to climb 4 per cent in a month thanks to the corporate tax cut.

The rate cut lifted investor sentiment on Dalal Street and triggered short covering in the oversold stocks. As many as 22 stocks from the BSE100 basket soared in double digits, led by BPCL, which surged 32 per cent. Siemens, Bajaj twins, IndianOil, TVS Motor and Page Industries were among the top gainers.

“The surge was largely because the market was oversold. After the corporate tax cut announcement, the market’s uptick was swift and the largecaps outperformed. The market-cap of large companies has gone up more than those of smaller companies, largely because of F&O positions. Earlier, there were huge short positions from FIIs,” said Sahil Kapoor, Chief Market Strategist and Associate Director, Edelweiss.

HDFC Bank was the biggest gainer in terms of market cap (m-cap), which saw addition of Rs 71,000 crore in September. Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra and Reliance Industries were the next biggest m-cap gainers, adding about Rs 40,000 crore each.

Indiabulls Housing Finance and YES Bank were the top losers in September, down 44 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. Other BSE100 stocks that lost value in double digits percentage points included REC, Glenmark Pharma, Zee Entertainment and Piramal Enterprises, among others.

Vikas Khemani, Founder, Carnelian Capital Advisors, said a bull run has started in largecaps. The rise in BSE100 index in September was “in reaction to the corporate tax cut which changed the equity landscape and the economic growth landscape. This is a game-changing event that has taken place,” he said.

Thanks to the tax cut, foreign investors poured in a net Rs 7,548 crore in Indian equities in September, according to NSDL data. This is a break from July and August, when the overseas portfolio investors were net sellers in the market.

Analysts said the Q2 earnings season, starting with TCS numbers on October 10, will be ‘interesting’ as companies will adjust tax provisions to the new rates.

“We would see an effect of the tax cut because they would have paid an advance tax last quarter as per the old tax rates. So I think there will be some writebacks,” Kapoor said.

He said the operational performance would not change a lot, because there was no reversal in the real economy for the whole of September quarter. India’s GDP growth came down to hit a six-year-low in June quarter. Consumer-facing sectors have been going through a slowdown. Some experts expect an imminent revival in auto sales.

“Auto, though they don’t get a lot of benefits from the tax cut, may see a revival in demand. So they will also be in focus,” Kapoor said.

Khemani said he expects a market rally not just for the coming months, but for years. He is ‘overweight’ on financial and consumption stocks.

“Playing this event (rate cut), BFSI continues to be a key sector, specifically private banks, where the impact will be much larger. We are also trying to play the reversal in a few infrastructure and capital goods companies as a second derivative. That will be a very important area to watch,” Kapoor said."

27,2019-10-05,Zee,"MUMBAI: The stock market fell about 1.2% on Friday, extending losses to the fifth straight day, after the rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fell short of investor expectations. Continued selling by foreign funds in October so far has raised concerns that the optimism around corporate tax cuts last month could be waning, adding to uncertainty about the health of the country’s financial sector.

The Sensex declined 1.14%, or 433.56 points, to close at 37,673.31, while the Nifty fell 1.23%, or 139.25 points, to 11,174.75. For the week, both indices plunged around 3% each, posting their biggest weekly decline since May 12. Non-state lenders — Kotak Mahindra, ICICI and HDFC Bank — led the sell-off midway through the trading session after the RBI, in its policy meeting, cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and slashed its FY20 gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to 6.1% from 6.9%.


FPIs Extend Selling Spree
The market had expected the central bank to cut interest rates by at least 35 basis points. A basis point is 0.01percentage point.


“Given the continued slowdown in economic parameters, low inflation and 35 basis point rate cut earlier (in the August policy), investors were expecting more than 25 bps rate cut again this time,” said Rajat Rajgarhia, managing director, institutional equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Continued worries over asset quality and FII (foreign institutional investor) outflows have weakened the market sentiment.”

The BSE Mid-Cap index fell 0.94% while the BSE Small-Cap index declined 0.79%.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 682.93 crore on Friday, extending their total sales tally to Rs 3,330 crore in October so far. In September, they were buyers to the tune of Rs 6,500 crore thanks to the corporate tax rate cuts.

The market euphoria triggered by the tax cuts on September 20 appears to have fizzled out with worries about the asset quality of select banks and nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs) as well as the economic slowdown taking precedence. Some market watchers have raised concerns over the impact of the move on the country’s fiscal deficit.

“After a kneejerk positive reaction to corporate tax cuts late last month, investors in stocks seem to have retrained their focus back on weak growth prospects ahead, both globally and domestically,” said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist of ING. “We don’t see RBI easing as a positive here and indeed, this was evident today (in the stock market reaction).”

After the Sensex rallied 3,000 points in two days after the tax cut announcement, the benchmark index has corrected nearly 983 points since September 23.

Purchases by domestic institutions have averted a sharper slide in the market. After buying shares worth Rs 11,079 crore in September, they have pumped Rs 1,930 crore into stocks in October so far.

Many investors have felt that the central bank needs to step up monetary easing to supplement the government’s efforts to revive the economy. While the extent of the rate cut on Friday disappointed the markets, optimists are relieved that the guidance suggests the RBI is open to further rate cuts. Most economists are betting on a rate cut of another 25 basis points in the RBI’s policy meeting in December.

“Lower rates are a necessary condition for the economy to pick up, even if no longer sufficient,” said a Credit Suisse note after the RBI’s policy action.

On Friday, Zee Entertainment was the top loser on the Nifty, with the stock sliding 6.4% to Rs 235.40 after Morgan Stanley cut its target price to Rs 248 from Rs 370. The brokerage said it expects the uncertainty to continue as the promoter debt issue lingers."
28,2019-10-05,Zee,"Mr Market dried up in the last days of the week gone by; hand in hand with the global bourses, which cracked 2-3 per cent this week. The bulls are trying hard to get their mojo back with vigour, as the government goes all out to turn around the economy as RBI acts as a catalyst for such as turnaround. This market downturn is a usual correction of the rally witnessed following corporate tax cut. As such, Nifty50 correcting to 11,000-11,100 levels should be considered normal.

For the first time, the market has witnessed a frenzy in the IPO segment: while the IRCTC issue was oversubscribed around 112 times, the retail portion saw 15 times oversubscription.

This means retailers are still not convinced about the future prospects of the economy. Nonetheless, this indicates that a bigger bull market is ahead of us, because unless retail investors turn super bullish, a top cannot be formed.

The government machinery is working overnight to raise funds to finance growth, which seems quite logical given the hit it has taken from the corporate tax cut. BPCL, which is known as one of the crown jewels of the government, is up for grabs. A decade ago, IBP with a large chain of petrol pumps was divested for double the amount than the prevailing price by the government.

And as Mark Twain has said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Markets are trying to draw a similar analogy that BPCL would also command a hefty premium. Therefore, we are seeing stock price surge relentlessly.


Event of the week
The YES Bank and ZEE Entertainment sagas still continue to unfold, where promoters’ pledged shares are being sold off by lenders in the open market. This has created a great buying opportunity for risk takers.

Fortis Healthcare’s lenders too invoked and sold massive pledged shares, but since the underlying business is quite decent, buyers came in at Rs 110-115 and the price reverted to normal valuation at around Rs 140. Risk takers out there may consider buying ZEE Entertainment selectively in smaller quantities in a staggered manner with the understanding that it can still go down further, but eventually revert to mean over the medium term.


Technical Outlook
Nifty50 moved lower near its 50-60 per cent retracement levels, which should act as good consolidation levels. After a sharp rally of 1,000 points, a swift correction is but natural. However, timewise correction might last a little longer and can test the patience of the bulls in the short term. ‘Buying on dips’ those stocks which are trading above their 200 EMAs would now be a safer strategy for traders.



Expectation for the week
The broader market, including the local bourses, will await Fed’s policy decision, which will set the tone for the markets for next few weeks, depending majorly on the Fed Chair’s comments and rate reduction, if any.

Back home, vibrancy is slowly getting visible at ground level in terms of some pickup retail sales of consumer durables and automobiles. Auto numbers improved slightly in September on a month-on-month basis, they continue to be ugly on a year-on-year basis. As the government is going to announce a voluntary vehicle scrappage policy any time this month, the auto sector can witness stability in stock prices going ahead.

Investors should accumulate quality stocks selectively at lower levels. Nifty50 closed 2.93 per cent down for the week at 11,174."
29,2019-10-05,Zee,"A little over 90% of the promoters’ shareholding has been pledged, directly or indirectly, with domestic and international lenders and no new pledges have been created, said Punit Goenka, MD and CEO of ZEE, Saturday. 

The promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) are now left with around 22% stake in the company. Goenka spoke to investors after disclosures from Russian investor VTB Capital and Essel Group regarding the encumbrance on 10.7% stake in ZEE, in compliance with a circular issued by Sebi. He said none of ZEE’s shares was pledged to VTB Capital in the structured arrangement inked in September 2017 and that the loan amount was always included in the loan against shares disclosed to the market. 

Goenka said that after the sale of 8.7% stake to investor Invesco Oppenheimer and recent sell-off by some lenders, the promoters now owned around 22% in the company. “No additional debt or pledge is created by the promoters,” Goenka told investors, clarifying the maturity period of this loan was a little over a year."
42,2019-10-07,Zee,"You would be better off deploying your money over the next few months, rather than all at once, says Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Shenoy is bullish on auto and good quality financials.

How convinced are you about the prospects of Zee?The interesting thing about Zee is the asset itself. Zee Entertainment is actually solid. It used to be one of the few profit-making companies in the media space that consistently has been able to maintain and perhaps even grow market share. The problem in the company is just the leverage and the promoters. The fear is only that Subhash Chandra will no longer be able to own a significant part of the company. If you take that away, Zee is actually in a fairly good shape. 

The only other small concern here is that Zee does not have any debt. They have actually given money as loan to some of these promoter entities that are being part of the defaulting gang of companies of the Essel Group that have been in trouble with mutual funds and in their borrowings. If Zee were to give more money to these companies, then that would be a dangerous sign for Zee itself. 

But otherwise, the prospects of the company is sound and in the next six months, we should see more of their assets getting sold at promoter level and some of the debt coming down. However, I expect some more sales in the next two or three months by some entities that continue to hold the debt, which perhaps for regulatory reasons or otherwise, will want to sell the stake even if it depresses the price. The market is going to be volatile but if you are a long-term player, and I think if the company can be sequestered beyond the holding of Subhash Chandra, then it is a pretty good company. I am just torn here because I do not know whether the company will be the same without the promoter in the saddle.


When the corporate tax cut was announced, the market ran up almost 8.5% in two trading sessions. Many were sitting there with a missed out kind of feeling. They were already sitting on a pile of cash which they continue to do so because since then the market has been that shaky. Should one buy stocks right now? If yes, then what would you recommend?It is better to spread your investment over a period rather than just get in at one point in time. Even now, we are looking at debt issues in the market and another round of debt damage is going to come and hurt our markets -- be it in October or November or December. Nobody can say, but it is going to come and hurt markets and in the longer term, you would be better off deploying your money over the next few months, rather than all at once.

There is always going to be feelings of being left out and not participating when the tax cut happened but now that markets are back to about the same level as they were before the tax cut for a lot of stocks, it is useful to continue to purchase those stocks. 

We are still quite positive on auto. The cycle is going to bottom out at some point. The numbers already look good in September from a registration’s perspective. The first few days of October also looked encouraging. I believe in the longer term, we will see much recovery in the auto cycle. It may take a month. A base effect will start from next January onwards which will make the numbers look good.

If you are looking at 10-year investment, I do not think India is in any way saturated when it comes to four-wheelers or two-wheelers. They continue to be good plays. Among financials, we are looking at the NBFCs and saying there are some outright winners. There are some outright losers. You can make that out in the stock prices as well and I am just saying stick with the outright winners because in the finance field, once your reputation takes a hit, it is always the other people that will win, at least in the medium term. It may be better to stick with the people who have untarnished reputation compared to anyone who has had issues with corporate governance or with rumours of court cases and so on.


Don’t you think markets are overreacting to every negative news? Some of the news flow that markets are reacting to may not have such a big impact. Are these classical signs of very high risk aversion?Quite true. In fact, markets always go through this phase after a shock of some sort, in this case the IL&FS and the DHFL shocks of last year and earlier this year. That translated to shocks in a number of other NBFCs as well even if they have reasonably good cash balances in stocks like YES Bank or in others, where the fear is not really of promoters having forcibly sold their shares but also in the fundamental stability of a very large institutions. 

I do not think that in all of these cases, it is useful to just say across the board that everybody is in bad shape or everybody is a fraud. We have had situations where things have been bad. The PMC Cooperative Bank issue was quiet bad and perhaps not well handled by RBI. There was a panic situation in a bank that has more than Rs 11,000 crore in deposits, the size of Equitas or Ujjivan Small Finance Bank.

I feel, perhaps we need the authorities to deal with this kind of a panic situation with a little more sensitivity and as investors and commentators, we also need to look at the situation with a little bit less alarmist attitude because there will always be certain things wrong with certain companies, but not all the time this is going to be a dramatic situation. 

To give an example, we are staring at a deferred tax asset potential loss of more than Rs 4,000 crore in some of the best banks in the country simply because to avail the lower tax rates, they will have to write off Rs 4,000 crore odd and this, even HDFC Bank will have to do if it has to avail of a 22% tax rate. But the situation is not so bad that everybody should go around shorting HDFC Bank because I am sure there will be some kind of forbearance given by RBI to stretch this across quarters and that it is not really a physical hit in accounting entry. Therefore, it can be taken over time. But in the current situation, any news like this can be blown up out of proportion. 

So I think you are right that the market is taking literally everything on its chin even when it does not have to. We have seen these situations in the past. Hopefully, they do not last us more than a few months and we will be back to normal within a few months. But it needs a lot of patience and a lot of action from both the authorities and market players.


What are you making of some of the pharma news today? Glenmark and Auro Pharma got whacked today. There just seems to be no end to the bad news in pharma. Although we have been quite heavily invested and we have actually taken a few losses this year and walked out of some of the scrips, I still feel that in some specific cases, there continues to be a lot of interest. 

Look at Abbot or Sanofi, they continue to do well whereas most of the Indian generic players or pharma companies that are exporting are in bad shape. One reason for that is also due to perhaps overtures by the USFDA and by President Trump that indicate that there will be some measures, if not now, then a little bit later, to perhaps reduce the profitability of such firms or reduce their potential for growth. 

Apart from that, local corporates, in some cases have governance issues, in some cases regulatory issues are popping up. Right now, I am not confident enough to tell anybody else to participate in pharma. Let us wait for a more favourable news timeframe and then take a call."
37,2019-10-07,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices edged lower on Monday, erasing initial gains, tracking muted trading in other Asian markets.

A fall in crude oil prices and encouraging unemployment data in the US failed to lift sentiment. 

At 9.30 am, the 30-share Sensex was trading 70 points lower at 37,600 level the NSE barometer Nifty was down 30 points at 11,140. Nifty Bank took a pause, rising 0.5 per cent. The index had fallen over 5 per cent last week. 

Broader indices were flat-to-positive, with the Nifty Midcap largely flat and the Nifty Smallcap ticking 0.3 per cent up. 

Among Nifty stocks, YES Bank was up 7 per cent, followed by HDFC Bank that inched up 1 per cent.

Shares of Zee Entertainment plunged 8 per cent while Bharat Petroleum saw profit booking, falling 5 per cent. Bharat Petroleum had been on a winning streak recently, climbing about 40 per cent in 10 sessions. 

Overall, 28 Nifty50 stocks advanced and 21 declined. Among sectors, Auto and Media were in the red, the rest were in the green on NSE. 

Asian shares fell after rising marginally in the early trade. The fall was seen even as the drop in US unemployment rate, the lowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world's largest economy.

There were some concerns over stalled US-North Korea talks. North Korea said on Sunday there was no way the United States would bring alternative plans for their stalled nuclear talks to a meeting proposed by Stockholm in two weeks after weekend negotiations in Sweden broke down. The working-level talks between US and North Korean envoys were broken off on Saturday."
41,2019-10-07,Zee,"The regulatory hammer hit big pharma hard on Monday, with Glenmark Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma taking a big knock. The first plunged 9 per cent, and the second 19 per cent following warnings from USFDA. 

YES Bank surged on reports of progress in capital raising plans. Zee Entertainment rebounded and ended with gains despite reports that the promoters have pledged more shares. 

The 30-share Sensex extended its losing streak into sixth session, closing 141 points down at 37,531. NSE barometer Nifty fell 50 points to 11,126. 

“By pushing Nifty below the 11,140 mark, the bears have disturbed the bullish momentum. Based on the same, Nifty looks headed for 11,050 and 10,850 levels. On the higher side, the 11,240 level would be a key hurdle for the index,” said Shrikant S Chouhan, Senior Vice-President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities. 

Here is a lowdown on the key movers and shakers of Friday’s session:


YES Bank shares surge
YES Bank climbed 8 per cent to Rs 45.60 on reports that top PE investors and three tech firms are showing interest in the lender’s capital raising plan. Private equity funds TPG, The Carlyle Group and Farallon Capital are said to be looking to buy a stake in the lender. The bank is also in talks with Microsoft Corporation and two other tech firms. 



Aurobindo Pharma plunges
Share price of Aurobindo Pharma tanked 19 per cent to Rs 458.50 on BSE after the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) issued seven observations on its Unit 7 manufacturing facility. “We believe none of the observations are related to data integrity. The company is confident of addressing these issues within the stipulated timeline,” the management said. 


Glenmark Pharma hit hard
Glenmark Pharma was also hit by the USFDA warning and hit a 52-week low. The stock dived over 9 per cent to Rs 286.30 after USFDA issued a 'Warning Letter' on its Baddi facility. Earlier, the US regulator had classified the Baddi facility as 'Official Action Indicated'. 



Zee stages strong rebound
Shares of Zee Entertainment staged a strong rebound during the session. After plunging as much as 14 per cent in intraday trade, the stock ended the day 6 per cent higher at Rs 251.50. In an investor call, the company said 90 per cent of promoter shares have been pledged against debt. 



Banks pause losing streak
Nifty Bank took a break and ended in the green, pausing five day losing streak thanks to the gains in YES Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. However, most of the index’s constituent stocks ended in the red, with Bank of Baroda down 2 per cent and IndusInd Bank down 1.6 per cent. 



Other pharma stocks hit too
Nifty Pharma index ended the day as the biggest sectoral loser on NSE thanks to the plunge in Glenmark and Aurobindo Pharma shares. The index shed 3.35 per cent. Of its 10 constituent stocks, eight closed in the red. Divi’s Lab and Dr Reddy ended with gains. 



Smallcaps underperform
Following their headline peers, the broader market also ended in the red. Nifty Midcap pared 0.3 per cent while Nifty Smallcap index fell 1.25 per cent. NCC was the biggest loser in Nifty Smallcap index, down 9 per cent. DHFL shed 7 per cent. 



15 stocks turn overbought
As many as 15 stocks entered the ‘overbought’ territory in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The momentum oscillator measures speed and change in price movement. If a stock crosses 70 on the index, it is generally considered overbought. 


Most active stocks
YES Bank was once again the most active stock in value and volume terms on NSE. Over 35 crore shares changed hands in transactions worth Rs 1,598 crore. Axis Bank and BPCL were next most active stocks in value terms. Vodafone Idea and Zee Entertainment came in second and third most traded security on in volume terms."

31,2019-10-07,Zee,"The promoters of Zee want to repay debt in the next three months to quell uncertainty surrounding the business, said Zee Entertainment Enterprises MD Punit Goenka. Though 90% of promoter shares in the media company are pledged directly or indirectly, Goenka doesn’t forsee any threat of losing control of the family jewel. In an exclusive interview with ET’s Gaurav Laghate and Vinod Mahanta, Goenka talks about the VTB deal, repayment plan and possible future stake sale. Edited excerpts:


Zee shares have been sliding due to promoter debt issue. What’s the latest debt situation?Let's dial back. In January 2019, the total loan against shares and some other securities was about Rs 13,500 crore. Today, that debt stands at Rs 7,000 crore. Almost half of that has been repaid by us or by the markets — whatever you want to call it.

The current situation is such that after having sold the 205 MW of solar energy assets, we realised about Rs 1,300 crore of enterprise value. We are in active dialogue for the balance 480 MW of solar assets, which are in advanced stages and should give us some significant enterprise value plus some equity realisation as well which will go towards this Rs 7,000 crore. Apart from this, we have some binding documents on a few of our road assets. That is an active dialogue right now, and we are nearing completion.

For the 205 MW, which was sold, the money should be received in this quarter. So, that also will help and within the timeline these three things will take place. We should be able to achieve the objective of getting out of this entire debt position.


Just over 90% of promoters’ shares are pledged — directly or indirectly. Is there a chance of losing control or a hostile takeover?A hostile takeover in our country is very unlikely. Unless all lenders and VTB Capital (Russian company) put together take any action, it's unlikely. This company's true value comes from the fact that we run it the way we run it. From that perspective, any prospective buyer or investor who will come in — whether strategic or financial — will see that value and would want us to be a part of it.

The other thing I keep saying is that it's our passion that drives this business, and not the percentage that we own. The percentages can keep going down or up and we can rebuild it over a period of time. I'm pretty confident that even in this situation, we should be left with at least half of the 22%.


There have been questions regarding disclosure of the VTB transaction...That Rs 13,500 crore in January included the VTB loan even at that time and the Rs 7,000 crore includes the VTB loans even today. About VTB, we always clearly stated that this is a loan against share/promoters’ liabilities. At that point, there was no need for us to disclose the encumbrance on that loan, because even today, the encumbrance is on the shares of the holding company and not on the shares of Zee directly. But after the new Sebi circular that came, this had to be disclosed, and both VTB and we jointly made the disclosure.


Now what is the arrangement with the current lenders and who all have agreed on a standstill agreement?
Predominantly, everybody has agreed — all mutual funds, NBFCs — have agreed to the extension till March 2020.


Can you share the timeline of future loan repayments?There are multiple due dates for the domestic loans. The next due date is April 2020 and the last one is, I think, in June 2021. But we don't want to wait till then. We want to sort out the problem within the next three months itself and get the whole thing resolved.

Currently, uncertainties are unnecessarily driving the whole situation and nobody is talking about the strong performance that the company is delivering. We are in the silent period so can’t talk about numbers, but we have been beating the market on all metrics. In two weeks, the results will reflect that. The crown jewel is being protected from that point of view.


At what stage is the Invesco Oppenheimer deal? We believe 2.3% stake is yet to be sold.So, the total deal was for up to 11% shares, out of which 8.7% got completed, while 2.3% is remaining. Because of the silent period, it was delayed further. We will engage with them as soon as the silent period is over.


Will there be any changes in the terms because the deal was done at ?400 per share and now the share stands at Rs 236?Even when the final transaction took place with Oppenheimer, the share price had come off significantly. They still honoured the sale at Rs 400 per share for the 8.7% stake. While I can't guarantee what they will do now, we are in dialogue with them and they have said let’s finish the silent period, come out with your results and we will re-engage as to how to close the remaining 2.3%.


Will there be any talks with VTB on extending the loan period?
VTB’s loan is due only one year from now and we are already engaging with them to see how we can restructure that further. VTB has been a long-term partner; they have worked with many promoters in this country and outside. They will look at this as an opportunity to create value for themselves and by virtue of that, create value for us also.


Are you still open to selling majority stake?We were open to selling majority stake when the strategic players were in dialogue. Our objective is to solve the problem. The stakeholder interest has been prime in our view and will remain prime till this whole problem is solved.


With share price coming down, have any strategic buyers reached out to you?Yes, absolutely, they have. They have approached us, but I can't engage till the silent period is over. What I can say is that there is interest and it’s the subset of the same people who were in talks earlier. This has happened in the last week or so.


How much are you willing to divest to a strategic investor?
We will be willing to sell 10-11%. Of course, they are free to buy from the market if they want to buy more.


Do you see any hidden hand in the constant shorting of the Zee stock?It’s a bear market and short-sellers are driving the market. This is not just in my scrip; the same is happening with multiple scrips. That's where I feel that nobody is valuing the intrinsic value of the asset. It's the overhang that’s driving this entire stock market. But, I guess, it’s an opportunity for them and they are cashing in on it.


As Essel group chairman Subhash Chandra is barred from selling his unpledged stake in Zee till next month in an ongoing dispute with Indiabulls, will that in any way impact on-going or future transactions?
It is only restricted to Dr Subhash Chandra. What the judgement says is that Dr Chandra’s personal assets, which are not encumbered, he cannot sell. That has no impact on any deal that we are doing.


At what stage is the Dish-Airtel Digital TV merger deal?
All options are being worked upon including media and non-media assets, whatever it takes.


But isn’t it a merger deal? That means there won’t be any money coming in…Money may not come in, but if that merger takes place, it will unlock the value of the company.

It is a Rs 2,000 crore Ebitda business and the stock price is at Rs 16-17 per share. It is bizarre."
30,2019-10-07,Zee,"The promoters of media company Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) want to repay their outstanding debt in the next three months — ahead of staggered deadlines running into 2021 — to ensure that the uncertainty surrounding the repayments doesn’t linger and affect the core business, managing director Punit Goenka told ET in an interview.

“The next due date is April 2020, and the last one is in June 2021,” Goenka told ET, referring to the separate deadlines for repaying lenders to which promoters have pledged their shares. “But we don't want to wait until then.”

The promoters of the Essel Group, which owns ZEE, have been selling assets to meet debt obligations. Over the past few weeks, the promoters have sold a part of their stake in ZEE (to Invesco Oppenheimer) and 205 MW of solar energy portfolio (to Adani Group) to reduce debt.

“In January 2019, the total loan against shares and other securities was about Rs 13,500 crore,” Goenka said. “Today, that debt stands at Rs 7,000 crore. ”

Goenka added that the promoters are open to selling 10-11% stake to strategic investors. ZEE now has a market value of about Rs 22,750 crore.

ZEE shares have dropped nearly 47% in 2019, with worried investors selling the stock on mounting concerns that lenders may redeem the pledged securities. However, the plunge in ZEE’s share price has brought back strategic investors to the discussion table."

43,2019-10-08,Zee,"ET Intelligence Group: After gains of 6.3 per cent over the past two trading sessions, Zee Entertainment Enterprises poses a poser to potential investors: What next?

Investors, of course, must balance Zee’s compelling value proposition, and the uncertainty around the share pledge or outstanding loans at India’s leading listed media entity.

The next six months are vital at Zee. There are two possibilities, and even if one is managed, investors stand to gain. The first is Zee's promoters further reducing their stake. The second is the sale of non-media assets.

After repaying a part of its total debt of Rs 13,500 crore, Zee’s present debt stands at Rs 7,000 crore. Of the total debt of Rs 7,000 crore, Zee has to make an immediate repayment of Rs 5,000 crore in the next six months.

Analysts believe Zee’s promoters might reduce their stake to meet the deadline instead of selling the group's non-media assets and cutting a profitable deal.



This is because the group’s nonmedia assets largely comprise infrastructure projects (toll road projects) for which there is low appetite in market. As opposed to this, Zee Entertainment, which has 22-23 per cent viewership's share of India's television industry, is a sound asset as its business model is intact.

They believe that even though in either case the company's stock maybe re-rated, further reduction in promoters' stake would result in higher re-rating, given its greater probability.

The other draw-card pertains to business valuations. On a one-year forward basis, the company is trading at a PE of 12.19. This is at a 50 per cent discount to the company's past 15-year average multiple of 24.43. The current reading of P/E is close to two standard deviations below mean, which is an exceptional event. It offered similar valuations only during the global financial crisis.

The rock-bottom valuations mean that investors have very little to lose. So, buy on dips would be the strategy with the Zee stock."

55,2019-10-11,Zee,"MUMBAI: Top broadcasters are reducing the a la carte price of each of their flagship general entertainment channels to Rs 12 per month from Rs 19 as a festive offer even as the sector regulator is reviewing its new tariff order.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) on Friday dropped the MRP of six of its GECs – Zee TV, Zee Marathi, Zee Bangla, Zee Telugu, Zee Kannada and Zee Sarthak — to Rs 12 per month for every individual channel as part of a ‘Festive Bonanza Offer’.

Rivals Star India introduced similar promotional offer for its 16 a la carte channels including channels like Star Plus, Maa TV, Star Jalsha, Vijay, Asianet and Hungama TV.

Viacom18 and Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), too, are set to reduce the MRP of their flagship GECs to Rs 12 by Monday, multiple industry insiders told ET.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had set a price cap of Rs 19 per month for channels if broadcasters wanted the channel to be part of a bouquet as part of its new tariff order that came into effect on February 1.

The tariff order was one of the biggest changes in the Indian broadcasting history, allowing consumers to choose their favourite TV channels and pay only for what they like to watch.

However, after the complaints from consumers about increase in monthly cable bills and other issues, Trai issued a consultation paper on August 16 wherein, among other issues, it sought response from stakeholders on whether the price cap of Rs 19 per month should be relooked at.

About its festive offer, a ZEE spokesperson said, “This offer will be valid through the festive season, (after which) we will evaluate the consumer response and take steps accordingly.”"

56,2019-10-12,Zee,"Defensives and corporate banks have been frontrunners this far and we have seen that outperformance in the recent rally as well, Rahul Shah of Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.
How are you assessing the markets fundamental especially now that the earnings season is officially started, TCS and Infosys delivered their numbers. Next week, we are expecting big boy Reliance, HUL, Zee Entertainment, etc. So, what is it that you are expecting?
Two, three trends have been very clear in the market. The market is just focussed on the few stocks and it is more concerned about those stocks’ numbers. So starting with TCS and Infosys, the numbers are slightly better than what the Street was estimating, For IndusInd Bank, again, the numbers were good enough. 

So, going forward, there are certain things one needs to look at in the financial space. Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance are the other names which you would like to see. In last six to eight months, we have seen corporate banks doing quite well, be it Axis or ICICI Bank. So I feel this is the focus list for next week.



There was a lot of negative news flow in the week gone by—Glenmark Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla as well on Friday. Can you help us understand how this US FDA’s negative news flow is likely to shape up going forward? 
If you look at it, there are observation issues since last two, two-and-a-half years and we have been seeing the entire pharma space underperforming. Till the time the issues are not resolved, I do not think the stocks will outperform. We have seen latgecaps like Lupin, Sun Pharma underperforming in a big way. Then we saw Aurobindo and Glenmark last week hitting their 52-week lows. So, I think this will continue for a while. 

Till the times earnings come up, till the time these issues are not sorted, they will still underperform, while a few others will outperform. Biocon looks interesting from here in terms of valuations and in beaten down space in the large cap name I think Sun Pharma looks attractive with the valuations what it trades at. So, I think the downside in both these two stocks looks limited. So, there could be some decent upside in both the stocks from current levels.



Reliance Industries is likely to come out next week. There is HUL as well which is one of the biggest names from the consumption space. What can we expect this time around as far as the Nifty Q2 performance is concerned?

It looks like the numbers will be good. I think they have been doing quite well in the last two quarters. They are bang on their targets and slightly above what their own commentary. So I think instead of results, more important thing is the guidance, what people would be looking for is the prospective. Secondly, for HUL, the volume growth is the most important thing. Somewhere, we have seen the stock has appreciated quite well in the last few sessions and valuations obviously are expensive. But I think if you look at the consumer names like Unilever, Nestle—we have seen PE multiples have always been revalued and they have gone higher and higher. 

For Reliance, the most important thing is how the Jio is going to be in the new regime of the costing structure in the telecom space. 


Which stocks would you like to talk about, which are the ones you are tracking closely?

I think defensives and corporate banks are in the front seat and we have seen that outperformance in recent rally as well. So, among defensive stocks, I like HDFC Life and HUL are at the top of my mind. So, I think these two stocks look quite interesting. And, among corporate banks, I think ICICI has been the leader and has done quite well."

ZEEL: VTB Capital, an arm of the Russian financial services house VTB Group says it has enforced certain securities rights granted to the lenders to the promoters of Zee Entertainment in order to protect the interest of the lenders


YES Bank, Fortis Healthcare: The private sector lender offloaded 6.56 per cent stake in leading hospital chain Fortis Healthcare for a little over Rs 645 crore through an open market transaction.


HUL: FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported a 21.18 per cent rise in standalone net profit to Rs 1,848 crore for the quarter ended on September 30, 2019, mainly driven by home care, and beauty and personal care verticals.


Jet Airways: An ongoing probe against Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal has revealed that the grounded carrier entered into illegal agreements with related offshore parties based in tax havens at rates way above market prices, causing losses to the airline as well as the national exchequer.


HDIL: The arrested HDIL promoters allegedly siphoned off funds from PMC Bank via overdraft facilities and the money was “disguised” as loan accounts, an EOW probe found.


Indiabulls Housing Finance: Moody's has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s corporate family rating and the home financier’s foreign-currency senior secured rating to B2 from Ba2. Meanwhile, the NBFC will consult Sebi about its eligibility to buy back shares given the regulations on the ideal capital structure.


Wipro: Analysts tracking the IT major have estimated a 3-4 per cent drop in sequential profit due to lower other income. They see revenue rising 1-2 per cent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms, much in line with the company’s 0-2 per cent revenue guidance for the quarter. Margins may see some pressure due to wage hikes, they said.


Adani Gas: French energy giant Total will buy 37.4 per cent stake in Adani Gas, marking another big-ticket entry of a global major in India’s energy market after Shell and BP which are already in India, and Reliance Industries Ltd’s talks for a possible sale of 20 per cent of its core oil-to-chemicals division to Saudi Aramco.


Adani Transmission: The company has signed a share purchase agreement and completed the acquisition of the WRSS XXI (A) Transco Ltd, incorporated by REC Transmission Projects Company.


Lakshmi Vilas Bank: The Reserve Bank has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 1 crore on Lakshmi Vilas Bank and Rs 75 lakh on Syndicate Bank for violating asset classification and fraud detection norms.


M&M: Mahindra’s truck and bus division, which achieved cash break-even for a quarter last financial year, is expected to slip back into the red in FY20, in step with the steep decline in the sales of commercial vehicles in the country.


RIL: The joint venture of RIL and BP can sell natural gas from its KG deep sea project to its affiliates without violating the terms of its production sharing contract with the government, BP group CEO Bob Dudley has said.


Andhra Bank: The state-run lender will cut the marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) by 10 basis points across tenors from Tuesday.


Canara Bank: The public sector lender said it will cut deposit rates by 0.25 percentage points with effect from October 15, 2019.


India Grid InvIT Fund, IRB InvIT Fund and IndInfravit: Banks will now be allowed to lend to InvITs or infrastructure investment trusts. The sanctioning of these loans, however, would be subject to tighter parameters of scrutiny such as having board-approved policies on exposures, compliance with prescribed leverage ratios and tighter underwriting norms for SPV-linked funds.

72,2019-10-16,Zee,"Indian media conglomerate Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) has registered a strong growth in regional markets, which has helped the company strengthen its position against its rivals in the market including Star India, in the overall TV share across India (entertainment, excluding sports and news genres). 

Talking to ET’s Gaurav Laghate, Punit Misra, chief executive of Domestic Broadcast Business at ZEE, who completed three years at the company last week, speaks about the company’s obsession for eyeballs and winning market share. Edited excerpts...


Q. How do you see the performance of ZEE’s network channels pre and post the new tariff order?PM: Today, ZEE is clearly the largest entertainment network with a market share of 18.5% in the first half of the fiscal. This journey started in the first quarter of FY'18, when we further strengthened our position as a leader. Today, despite the acquisition that happened in one of our competition (Star India’s merger with Disney), which did give them additional 300 basis points of share, we are still ahead in H1 FY'20 (excluding sports). That's what we are focused on and that's an obsession for us.


Q. How did you manage this growth?PM: The starting point for us is always to talk about our market share journey. Basically, it's all about winning eyeballs market by market. If you break down the entire business, the most valuable thing that people are investing in us is the time they spend with us. And more reach and more time spent means more market share. If you go back three years, we were at 15.7% market share, while the then market leader (Star India) was at 19.3%. This January, we were at 20.2%. So, market after market, we are focusing on winning share. While we continue to be leaders in Marathi, the jump in overall has come on the back of Tamil growing from sub 10% to 20%, Kannada from 22% to 35%, Bengali from 36% to 45%, Malayalam zero to 9.6% (channel was launched last year). So, each of these is where the additional growth is coming from.


Q. You were a late entrant in the Kerala market. How satisfied are you with the performance?PM: Zee Keralam is the second most successful GEC launch in the last 10 years. Kerala accounts for 4% of the total national market, and if you look at just general entertainment channels, it's about 2%. But if I get 25% of that market share, that's half a percentage point of national share, which is not small.

This was a market where we've gone in with well-established incumbents for over 26 years. And we were the fifth player. It's not even been a year and we have almost got a double-digit market share (over 9.6%). We gained significant share from the market leader (Asianet). And what went into it was thrilling because most of our South Indian businesses were built on the back of non-fiction, while this one, we went in with a very strong fiction design. Non-fiction has its positives, but it also has challenges of high cost and that it comes in and goes. Fiction is tougher as you're trying to wean audiences away when they haven't even experienced your platform, forget the story. So it's actually a much tougher stance. But we took that stance because of our belief and deep consumer understanding of the market. I can tell you it's not a small state, people in UP think of it as a small state, but it is not.


Q. What was the biggest challenge in Kerala?PM: We knew of the perception that we don't belong here. Which is why the numbers are even more heartening because we overcame that. I would say it was a perception, I don't think we should deny that. For us to come in, with fiction, which is so rooted in that culture, with characters and stories and tracks, and the visual look, which is so unique and rooted there, that our fiction started to cut ice. Non-fiction in that sense is actually perhaps more universal, consumer insight driven. And that's why you see some of these brands travel easily across markets. Fiction, however, has a lot more local aspect to it and that's why we are really very happy. For me personally, it is the first time I've been involved in a GEC launch from scratch. And I feel good about what happened here.


Q. Zee Kannada was trailing behind Colors Kannada. How did you turn that around?
PM: In the Kannada market, we were at 23% market share in March 2017, the market leader there at that time was at 34%. Now, on the back of fiction, we are at 35% market share, while the then market leader is at 24%. Our fiction share in the market, which was at 26%, has grown to 38%. So the learning for me has been, to deeply understand the cultural nuances of the consumers, translate the observations into insights, insights into stories and characters. Easy to articulate, but it is a labour of love. We started working on a new strategy which was focused on deep consumer understanding & insights. And we've seen how that's translated even on an existing platform, where we were perpetually number two or three for over 10 years – to move from 23% to 35%, in less than a year.


Q. So which all channels or markets you see not performing at present?PM: Telugu is the only market where we have lost a bit of share, but our bigger challenge is &TV and we need to create a place for it. I think the challenge in Hindi GECs is that every channel has to have a place for its own unique differentiator, which is how we are building each of our regional channels. Hindi has one challenge, that it is not one culture that you are addressing.


Q. What about Zee Anmol, which you converted from free to pay. Will distribution revenue compensate for drop in viewership?PM: Anmol has a place for itself. It is for people who are not buying into the full bouquet. In our country, there are consumers across the socio-economic spectrum. Those who are price sensitive can get access to quality content, which might be one year or two years old, but for them, it's new. In that sense, it seems like the equivalent of a sachet. We hope that as people experience it, and as they move up the value chain, they will then progress the ZEE brand. That's why it has reason to exist. It will have its challenges on how much consumption is happening on it. But that's fine.


Q. Overall, are you happy with the network’s performance?PM: We're playing a mix. That's the power of managing a portfolio. I look into a portfolio that will always have ups and down. It's just that you have to play the whole piano well, so that the collective still keeps getting better. That's why we spoke the language of network shares. Last year, 80% of our business grew share. For me, that's the metric I look at. Yes, there was 20%, which either was flat or lost share."

71,2019-10-16,Zee,"Zee Entertainment (ZEEL) is expected to post healthy growth in net profit when it reports its September quarter results on Thursday, but the same is likely to be capped by a muted advertisement growth.

ICICI Direct expects revenue for the company to be at Rs 2,103.2 crore, up 6.4 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and 4.7 per cent sequentially. Profit for the quarter is likely to rise 23.4 per cent on YoY basis to Rs 477.1 crore but fall 10.1 per cent sequentially, according to the brokerage.

“Subscription growth for the quarter is expected to be strong given the positive
impact of NTO (new tariff order) implementation. However, advertisement growth will be muted given the overall weak ad environment,” it said.The brokerage expects Zee Entertainment to report 24 per cent YoY rise in domestic subscription growth at Rs 631 crore while overall subscription is expected to grow 17.6 per cent YoY to Rs 715 crore.

Domestic advertisement is expected to be muted, up 3 per cent YoY at Rs 1,187 crore. We expect EBITDA margins to decline 170 bps at 32.5 per cent, given the OTT ramp up and higher overall content spending, said ICICIdirect.

Edelweiss Securities sees reduction in corporate tax rate benefiting Zee. It pegs profit for Q2 at Rs 498 crore, up 24.7 per cent YoY and 3 per cent sequentially.
“We anticipate advertisement revenue growth to be subdued in Q2FY20, weighed down by cutback in ad spends by advertisers (FMCG in particular), overall slowdown in the ad environment and full impact of the withdrawal from FTA platform,” said the broker.It expects subscription revenue to grow on account of steady market share gains and tailwind from NTO. Overall, Edelweiss expects the revenue to grow 5 per cent YoY to Rs 2,076 crore, with ad revenue and subscription revenue growing at 2 per cent and 24 per cent YoY, respectively.

82,2019-10-17,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) missed analyst estimates when it reported a profit of Rs 413 crore for the September quarter. The company blamed a non-payment on Inter-corporate Deposit (ICD) for missing those estimates.

The company’s OTT platform clocked its peak user count in September as the platform was populated with 23 original shows and movies in 5 languages during the quarter.


Here are the top takeaways from ZEEL’s Q2 show:

Programming costs rise, ad costs declineProgramming cost for the quarter increased by 23.4 per cent YoY to Rs 896 crore. This increase was primarily driven by content cost for ZEE5 and higher movie amortization costs for Hindi and regional channel portfolio. Meanwhile, advertising, publicity and other expenses at Rs 320.6 crore were down by 20.9 per cent YoY. The decline in ad spends is due to lower marketing spends by ZEE5 during the quarter.


Profit misses estimatesProfit of the company missed estimates due to a one-time-loss on account of provisions for delays in payment from Inter-corporate Deposit (ICD). The company is supposed to receive Rs 170.62 crore.

Analysts had projected profit at Rs 481 crore, which it missed by Rs 68 crore.


ZEE5 user base at 9 millionZEE5, the OTT platform from the media house, recorded peak daily active user base of 8.9 million in September. The users watched an average of 120 minutes of content on the platform in September 2019. The platform launched 23 original shows and movies in 5 languages during the quarter.


International business slows downDuring the quarter, ZEEL's international business revenue was Rs 208 crore. The advertising
and subscription revenues declined 4 per cent YoY and 21.5 per cent YoY, respectively. The advertisement revenue was at Rs 55.7 crore and subscription revenue was at Rs 77.6 crore. Other sales and services revenue was at Rs 74.9 crore in the quarter.


All-India viewership steadyDuring the quarter, ZEE television network had an all-India viewership share of 18.4 per cent. “While we have maintained our viewership share in the Hindi GEC segment, the network continues to strengthen its position the Hindi movie cluster and regional portfolio,” said the company."

Separately, the company had a fixed deposit with a bank of Rs 20,000 lakhs. During the quarter under review, the bank has prematurely, unilaterally adjusted the amount of the fixed deposit, which was maturing on 10 September 2019, against the dues of certain related parties.

Subsequently, these related parties have reimbursed the amounts to the company to the tune of Rs 13,330 lakhs before September 30 2019 and Rs 6,670 lakhs after the quarter end.

83,2019-10-18,Zee,"Mumbai: Strong operating performance and likely divestments of an education business and a part of the promoters’ stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) should help the cashstrapped owners of India’s biggest listed media company repay Rs 7,000 crore of outstanding debt, which is due in six months.


In the quarter ended September 30, the company posted a net profit of Rs 412.09 crore, up 6.7 per cent from Rs 386.10 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Also, net revenues were up 7.7 per cent to Rs 2,190.13 crore, compared with Rs 2,034.79 crore in the year-ago period.

The September-quarter performance reaffirms the fact that ZEE remains the most valued asset in the group. At a time when the broader industry’s advertising revenue declined around 4 per cent, ZEE reported growth of close to 2 per cent.

Bloomberg
Analysts also believe that its focus on creating regional content for TV and video streaming platform ZEE5 should help the company remain competitive. Analysts believe that the proposal to monetise KidZee, through the divestment of its education arm Zee Learn, could fetch more than Rs 2,000 crore, and the proceeds could be used to reduce debt.

The promoters’ ability to repay outstanding loans will continue to dictate ZEE’s price movements, with the primary owners’ debt obligations often overshadowing operating performance over the past few months.

The company plans to launch four more channels — three movie channels in Kannada, Tamil and Bhojpuri languages, and a Punjabi entertainment channel.

Separately, the promoters are ready to sell a further 11 per cent stake in ZEE. In a recent interaction, ZEE’s chief executive officer Punit Goenka told ET that negotiations will start afresh with strategic investors wherein the promoters are willing to sell around half of their current 22 per cent shareholding.

This, along with the sale of other non-media assets, should help the primary owners repay the entire outstanding debt.

Goenka told analysts late Thursday in a post-earnings conference call that the promoters have recently been approached by some marquee investors for the Zee Learn stake, adding that they intend to consider those offers.

The promoters own 57.18 per cent stake in Zee Learn, which has a network of pre-nursery and K-12 schools, besides institutes of higher education. There are other education brands as well, such as KidZee (2,000 schools), Mount Litera (K-12 chains of 136 schools) and Mahesh Tutorial.

Recently, the education sector has seen greater interest from investors after the much-publicized acquisition of the Euro Kids, Euro Schools, Kangaroo Kids and Billabong High chains by KKR at an enterprise valuation of ?2,000 crore.

To be sure, the company’s valuation appears rather inexpensive at the moment. The increasing receivables and inventory, though a concern, are expected to come down in the coming quarter, said the promoters in the conference call. At the current market price, considering its FY21 estimated earnings, the ZEE stock is trading at an EV/Ebitda of about 7.7, compared with the five-year average EV/Ebitda of 24.2."

87,2019-10-18,Zee,"Most global brokerages maintained their call on Zee Entertainment (ZEE) even as the media house missed September quarter earnings estimates on Thursday.

Morgan Stanley remains underweight on ZEE with target of Rs 248. The brokerage said the stock will remain volatile until debt issues are resolved. The Subhash Chandra-led Essel Group, which is also a promoter of ZEE, is reeling under heavy debts. Chandra had to sell 11 per cent stake in ZEE to fund house Invesco Oppenheimer to pay part of its dues.

Morgan Stanley noted that the cash balance of the company further decreased, meanwhile receivables and inventory continued to increase. The brokerage decided to maintain its call largely because of its balance sheet.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises reported a profit of Rs 413 crore for the September quarter. The company blamed a non-payment on inter-corporate deposit (ICD) for missing most analysts’ estimates.

However, the income was greater than CLSA’s guess. The brokerage retained a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target of Rs 320.

CLSA said revenue at Rs 2,122 crore was also ahead of estimates. It expects ad revenue to pick up in the second half of fiscal 2020. The Hong Kong based brokerage blamed working-capital expansion for the drag on cashflows of the company.

It said it is awaiting a resolution to the pledged share issue and maintains that a resolution to this would be a key catalyst for the stock.

The debt on the company stands at Rs 7,000 crore as of September end. This has come down from Rs 13,500 crore in January, according to company CEO Punit Goenka.

Reliance Industries was up 0.6 per cent at Rs 1,404 ahead of its Q2 result. Analysts expect the September quarter profit to grow in double digits. Ambuja Cements was up 1.2 per cent to Rs 209.20. The cementmaker is also scheduled to releaase its Q2 numbers later today.

Zee Entertainment was down about 4 per cent to Rs 254.30 after the media house reported less-than-expected growth in profits. The company posted 6.73 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 412.09 crore.

Resultantly, Nifty Media was the biggest loser among sectors, down 1 per cent. Tata Motors which saw a spectacular rally on Thursday, was down 1.6 per cent as uncertainty over Brexit deal remained. Nifty Auto was trading flat with negative bias down 0.07 per cent in the early trade.

Asian stocks stumbled on Friday after China posted its weakest growth in nearly three decades, countering a global lift in sentiment on the UK and European Union striking a long-awaited Brexit deal.

China's economy grew 6 per cent in the third quarter -- the weakest pace in at least 27-1/2 years -- falling short of estimates, as the Sino-US trade war hit demand at home and abroad.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.17 per cent by 0350 GMT, erasing earlier small gains. Australian shares dropped 0.61 per cent and Chinese blue-chips were off 0.65 per cent."

On the other hand, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (down 5.75 per cent), Tata Motors (down 1.58 per cent), Eicher Motors (down 1.50 per cent), IndusInd Bank (down 1.16 per cent) and Mahindra & Mahindra (down 1.12 per cent) were trading in the red."
96,2019-10-19,Zee,"Brokerages see resolution of promoter pledge issues as the key trigger for Zee Entertainment Enterprises going ahead. Some of the brokerages have cut their target price on the stock after the second quarter result. Analysts were also concerned with continued spike in inventories and receivables leading to negative operating cash flow.

 Zee Entertainment on Thursday posted a 6.9% rise in consolidated profit for the September quarter from a year ago at ₹413.23 crore. Consolidated revenue jumped 7.4% to ₹2,122 crore. The stock fell 5.5% to end at ₹250 on Friday.

 “Until the debt issue is fully resolved and clarity emerges on future control and ownership, we believe the stock will remain volatile,” said Morgan Stanley, maintaining an ‘underweight’ rating with a target price of ₹248.

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch has retained a ‘neutral’ rating and lowered target price to ₹360 from ₹445. Credit Suisse has also retained a ‘neutral’ rating and cut target price to ₹230 from ₹400. Macquarie has cut target price to ₹268 from ₹375 while retaining a ‘neutral’ rating.

 “Zee reported a decent quarter on the operational front, with domestic subscription revenues growing over 25% and market share gain in advertising revenue as well. Nevertheless, Zee’s balance sheet and cash flow generation concerns are likely to persist,” said Credit Suisse.


 Kotak Institutional Equities has cut earnings estimates for Zee by 4-6% and lowered the fair value to ₹340 from ₹365. The stock faces a fair set of challenges considering promoter pledge issues and balance-sheet deterioration but the business is fundamentally in good shape and attractively valued.

 Promoters losing control of the company would be a worst-case scenario and could negatively impact operations as well as profitability, said Motilal Oswal.

 Edelweiss also believes that resolution of promoters’ pledged shares remains a key trigger for the stock even though the valuation is attractive now. The brokerage said advertising growth in the near term is likely to be subdued.

 However, some brokerages have raised target price on the stock. CLSA has increased its target price on Zee to ₹320 from ₹290 as the stock is trading at a 60% discount to its historic valuation."
97,2019-10-19,Zee,"The domestic equity market witnessed buying by FPIs and DIIs during the week gone by on improved sentiments and improving prospects for the economy. FPIs have initiated buying equities aggressively and covered their short positions, which has relieved Mr Market and cleared a major overhang.

Therefore, new highs are expected sooner than earlier estimates. IRCTC witnessed a bumper listing gain of 101 per cent over its issue price, which signalled that people are ready to take risk and increase equity exposure in the market. This, in turn, can help the government to quickly divest some of the companies that are up for strategic disinvestment. Money in the hands of the government will eventually help bridge fiscal deficit and boost infrastructure spend necessary to fuel the growth in economy.

When IMF and World Bank beat the drum of slowdown in any economy, it means the phase is already over and better times are ahead. Recently, both IMF and the World Bank trimmed India’s GDP growth prospects by a whopping 0.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. Historically, such downgrading has been a good indicator of market bottoms.

After the government’s holistic growth push through corporate tax cuts and recapitalisation of PSU banks, FPIs paring short positions and continued domestic inflows now point to one thing, that the worst may be behind us. Unless something dramatically goes wrong on the global front, Nifty50 looks all set to touch new highs before Christmas.


Event of the week

The September quarter earnings season continued with a bang, as Mr Market felt the glitters and jitters in the earnings numbers from HUL and ZEE Entertainment and others during the week.

HUL reported a strong set of numbers with PAT growing nearly 21% year on year, on cost control and margin improvement. ZEE Entertainment reported a disappointing marginal increase in PAT at 6.87 per cent, mainly due to a one-time loss of Rs 170 crore, which raised concerns over corporate governance.


Technical Outlook
Nifty50 is likely to face resistance at higher levels. The 11,950 level is likely to act as a strong resistance. However, some profit booking is expected at 11,700 level in the near term. There is marked weakness in Bank Nifty compared with Nifty50, which makes the ongoing rally a fractured one, susceptible to sharp falls in the short term. Traders should wait for a correction before going long.



Expectation for the week

Mr Market’s current rally is in the catch-up phase, and is likely to extend to individual sectors, which have largely been underperformers. Smallcaps and midcaps are likely to witness buying interest. The quarterly numbers of India’s two most respected behemoths, namely Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank, will set the ball rolling for the end of Samvat 2075.

International metal prices have bottomed out after a few quarters of steady declines. Precious metals are also showing signs of consolidation and can move higher in the near future. Hence, investors may deploy fresh funds at current levels, keeping in mind their appropriate diversification and individual risk-taking abilities.

Nifty50 ended the week 3.2% higher at 11,661."

105,2019-10-29,Zee,"Promoters of about 50 listed companies have reduced share pledges in the September quarter at a time when lenders have been invoking those of other firms because of falling stock prices.

Pledged shares have been redeemed by the promoters of JK Tyre and Industries, SH Kelkar, Steel Strips Wheels, Infibeam Avenues, Gateway Distriparks and Camlin Fine Sciences and their stocks could rally between 10 per cent and 40 per cent in the coming months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Others that have reduced pledges include Adani Transmission, Apollo Hospital, Omaxe, Swan Energy, Birlasoft, Centrum Capital, Igarashi Motors, Indo Rama Synthetics, Bharat Road Network and Emami Paper Mills.



The promoters of JK Tyre and Industries redeemed the 35 per cent stake that had been pledged by paying early a loan of Rs 200 crore taken from KKR Capital, helping to revive investor confidence in the stock.

Infibeam Avenues lowered pledged stock to 7.9 per cent from 21 per cent in the September quarter. India’s first listed ecommerce firm had dropped over 60 per cent on September 29 last year over rumoured concerns about accounting policies. The promoters of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise sold 5 million shares in September through secondary placements to raise around Rs 720 crore and reduced its pledges from 71 per cent to 66 per cent.

Shares have been sold in the open market recently after promoters failed to top up their pledges with more stock after prices dropped. In some cases, lenders have forced promoters to sell assets to repay loans.

In August, KKR enforced pledges by the promoters of CG Power and Industrial Solutions to take control of a 10 per cent stake. The Subhash Chandra-led Essel Group sold stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises to redeem promoter pledges. The promoters of Emami sold a 20 per cent stake in the consumer goods company to lower debt and pledges.

The promoters of Bajaj Consumer Care recently sold about 22 per cent in the company for Rs 628 crore through an open market transaction to pare debt. This has reduced the promoter holding from 60 per cent to 38 per cent but the holding is free from all encumbrances.

In June, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) issued strict norms for pledging shares. If more than 20 per cent of the total share capital or 50 per cent of the total promoter holding is being pledged, promoters have to give reasons for this.

Stock exchanges said last week that the trading margin levy would be more than doubled to 35 per cent from November 1 for companies with a market capitalisation of Rs 1,000 crore or more where promoters have pledged more than 25 per cent of the total equity capital."

113,2019-10-31,Zee,"Lenders to Essel Group promoters expressed misgivings about the lack of information regarding additional stake sale in Zee Entertainment and shot down a proposal to park all the promoter stake in an escrow account till the completion of the transaction.

The lenders, including mutual funds, still holding Zee Entertainment shares as collateral, demanded details of the sale of additional 10 per cent. Three people familiar with the discussions said that the lenders are growing sceptical about the prospects of a deal as Zee shares have plummeted over 40 per cent since the sale of 8.7 per cent stake to Invesco Oppenheimer in August.

ET has learned that the Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel Group recently submitted an escrow arrangement to the lenders which involved transferring the pledged shares to a separate account without disclosing the identity of the proposed buyer and the price at which it will be sold. This proposal didn’t go down well with the lenders who insisted on knowing the details.



“The company is yet to pay us and is proposing a deal which is only favourable to it,” said an official involved in the discussions. “It’s impossible for us to agree to such terms.”

The lenders, who are owed around Rs 7,000 crore by Essel group promoters, fear that the sale will happen at a sharply discounted price and that they may not be able to recover all their money.

“In its endeavour to seamlessly distribute the sale proceeds to all lenders, the Essel Group has appointed credible investment bankers to lead the divestment process,” a spokesperson for the promoters said.

“The lenders need to know the price at which the transaction is to take place. The fear is that the next sale could happen at a much lower price than the deal that happened with Invesco Oppenheimer atRs 400 per share,” said another official.

ZEE shares ended the day’s trade on the BSE at Rs 235 per share.

“Promoters of Essel Group have no control over the pricing. The investment banks have their own processes in order to get the highest possible price-point,” the spokesperson added.

In August, the promoters struck an agreement with Invesco Oppenheimer to sell up to 11 per cent for around Rs 4,224 crore at Rs 400 per share. Out of this, the promoters have managed to deliver 8.7 per cent stake.

The cash-strapped Zee promoters have around six months to come up with over Rs 7,000 crore to repay debt. Over 90 per cent of the promoter stake is already pledged, with 10.7 per cent pledged with Russia’s VTB Capital.

Last month, in an interview with ET, Punit Goenka, MD of ZEE, had said that post the fall in the share price of the company, some strategic investors, with whom the promoters were in talks earlier, had once again approached them.

“They have approached us... there is interest and it’s a subset of the same people who were in talks with us earlier,” Goenka had said. He had also added that the promoters are open to selling 10-11 per cent stake to strategic investors."

8,2019-11-01,Zee,"The painful bear hammering, led mainly by toxic debt and punitive government policies, seen in domestic equities over the past few months did not spare even quality companies. This is why as the market shows first signs of a bounceback, stocks that have been maintaining robust return on capital employed (RoCE) for last 10 years should be the first ones to draw investor attention.

Chances are that some of these stocks would emerge frontrunners and deliver handsome returns to investors in the coming months.

RoCE measures capital efficiency of a business. It is a measure of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for every rupee of capital (equity and debt) employed in the business.

Investing in companies with higher RoCE can reap rich rewards if it can maintain higher capital efficiency on new capital as well. In short, higher RoCE indicates better capital efficiency, which can will lead to better wealth creation for shareholders.

As many as 67 per cent of stocks that have a record of maintaining an RoCE of 15 per cent have lost up to 80 per cent of value in this correction.

With an 80 per cent fall since January 2018, TPL Plastech emerged as biggest loser on the list. It was followed by Wimplast (down 73 per cent), Kitex Garments (down 72 per cent), NBCC (down 71), eClerx (down 71 per cent), RPP Infra (down 69 per cent), Care Ratings (down 60 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (down 59 per cent).

Zee shares were under pressure through most the year, as worried investors sold the stock amid concerns that lenders may redeem pledged shares. The company has since managed to bring in some strategic investors.





BSE benchmark Sensex has advanced 18 per cent since January 2018 amid select buying in blue chips, while broader market indicators BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices dipped 18 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively.

“Some quality midcaps got hit badly in this selloff in tandem with companies that had corporate governance issues. This is an opportunity to buy,” says Vijay Kedia, MD, Kedia Securities.

“There are very few good stocks in the market right now and they may have bottomed out. We may not see any V-shaped recovery in the companies that have issues. They may recover partially, but it is very difficult to say if they will make money,” he said.

Data available with Ace Equity showed there are 117 companies that have been maintaining an RoCE of at least 15 per cent on BSE since 2009. Analysts believe after a steep correction such stocks can be good options to look at.

“Investors should look for such stocks, but there is a caveat. One cannot go by historical RoCE alone. One should look for prospective RoCE before taking any investment decision. In the current environment, several businesses have undergone massive business model changes, and hence, one needs to figure out how the RoCE will pan out in the future,” says Prabhakar Kudwa, Director, Samvitti Capital.

Meanwhile, among the chart toppers some stocks like NIIT Technologies, Asian Paints, Vinati Organics, Berger Paints, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Astral Poly Technik, Tata Consultancy Services, HUL, HDFC Bank, Relaxo, Titan, Morganite Crucible, Pidilite, L&T Infotech have rallied between 30 per cent and 133 per cent in this period.




Analysts feel many of these stocks have room to grow on the upside. Centrum Broking still has a ‘buy’ rating on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 2,042. BoBCAPS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda, has an ‘add’ rating on NIIT Technologies with a price target of Rs 1,600.

IDBI Capital Market is bullish on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490, while ICICIdirect has a ‘buy’ rating on Dabur India with a price target of Rs 550.

Some of these companies, which had debt in excess of Rs 1,000 crore as of March 31, delivered negative returns to investors in last 22 months.

For instance, ONGC had a consolidated debt of Rs 1,07,640 crore at the end of FY19. The stock declined 26 per cent between January 1, 2018 and October 29 this year.

Wipro, Dilip Buildcon, Godrej Consumer Products, Coromandel International, Hindustan Zinc, Aarti Industries, Coal India, Redington and Zee Entertainment had debt ranging from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore as of March 31, Ace Equity showed.

Kolkata-based Abhishek Basumallick, Founder and Chief Equity Advisor of Intelsense Capital, says looking at RoCE alone may not help. However, it is a very good starting point to spot stocks.

“Any company that can earn a decent RoCE over longer periods, especially if it is above its cost of capital, will be able to sustain the business and flourish,” he said."
9,2019-11-01,Zee,"Share pledge levels of select Indian companies hit new highs in September quarter even as a few of them removed share pledges completely.

Out of the 839 companies, which have reported promoter share pledges so far, the total value of promoter’s pledged shares stood at Rs 2.35 lakh crore, which was over 1.5 per cent of total market-cap of BSE-listed entities.

As many as 88 companies saw substantial (more than 1 percentage points) increase in the promoter share pledges in September quarter. Prominent among them included JSW Steel, JSW Energy, Bajaj Consumer Care, Adani Green Energy, Amara Raja Batteries, Zee Media, Adani Ports, Future Retail and Torrent Pharma, among others. 

Four firms saw promoters encumbering complete shareholding during the quarter, according to Ace Equity data. They included McDowell Holdings, PBM Polytex, MphasiS and DHFL.

Shares of many of these companies have taken a beating in recent months, as worried investors sold what they got at any price. Falling share prices forced a number of banks and mutual funds to revoke pledged shares, further hurting sentiments. However, not everyone is unhappy with the scenario.

Shankar Sharma of First Global thinks bear market acts as a cleaner. “Bear markets act as disinfectants. All the ills, which were being hidden by rising stock prices, come out when stock prices go down suddenly and you are left with your pledges out in the open. The reason you pledge shares is to put some other business up, as we have seen in some corporate groups. But because of the downturn, those businesses have collapsed. So, it is disinfecting your entire corporate landscape in a brutal way,” he told ETNow.

Normally, share pledging rises in a tight liquidity and rising interest rate environment. It becomes problematic in a volatile market, particularly if stock prices crash. This can then force promoters to increase collaterals to lenders by pledging more shares.

Essel group features prominently on the list of companies that have seen an increase in share pledges. Not surprisingly, the market has punished the stock. Zee Entertainment fell 21 per cent during the quarter and Zee Media 22 per cent.

Abneesh Roy, Executive Vice-President at Edelweiss Securities, expects Zee Entertainment to see conclusive rerating when promoter debt issue and the promoter share pledges get resolved. 



Meanwhile, promoters of 14 firms removed all pledges on their shares in September quarter, data shows. They include Birlasoft, Eros International, Triveni Glass, Triveni Turbine and JK Tyre, among others.

In all, promoters of 70 companies substantially reduced share pledges during the quarter AceEquity data showed. Major names among them were Adani Transmission, Star Paper, Centrum Capital, Infibeam Avenues, Granules India and NCC, among others."

The sale of shares, as and when completed, would bring down Chandra family’s stake to near single digits, heightening the prospect of them losing control in their crown jewel.

VTB has roped in two global advisors, JP Morgan and Citi, for the planned share sale.

The Zee management has been insisting so far that there is no risk of a VTB sale. It told ET that all the lenders have agreed not to invoke the pledge and wait for divestment to a foreign strategic partner or an institutional investor.

A Zee spokesperson said that the lenders have “extended complete support to the promoters of the (Essel) Group, enabling them to complete the divestment process in the most optimal manner.”

He added that Essel Group has appointed investment bankers to lead the divestment process of media and non-media assets.



‘In Steady Dialogue with VTB’

The group is also in a “constant process of evaluating proposals from the prospective partners” keeping in mind the interest of its lenders, including VTB Capital, the Essel spokesperson said.

“The group is in a steady dialogue with VTB Capital to collectively arrive at the best resolution. Essel Group has immense respect towards VTB Capital and appreciates its support extended in value generation and remains confident to seek the same in the future.”

He added that the group is in talks with some foreign portfolio investors to sell 10-11 per cent stake and that investment bankers have also been appointed.

A VTB Group spokesperson in Moscow declined comment on ET’s detailed questionnaire.

ET understands that the two advisors have begun work on the sale of the pledged shares held by VTB and feelers have been sent out to global and institutional investors. A transaction is expected in the coming weeks.

This VTB move could further galvanise some of the domestic lenders like mutual funds, NBFCs, banks to join forces and sell the pledged shares as well. However, some of them are still ready to back the current management.

The total promoter holding in Zee has been coming down consistently and was 22.37 per cent at the end of September, of which 96 per cent is pledged with lenders while the rest is held by the public. Other than VTB, the promoters have pledged 10.77 per cent to a clutch of domestic NBFCs, MFs and banks like Edelweiss, Indostar, Clix, Axis Finance, STCI Finance, Birla Mutual Fund, HDFC AMC among others. The promoters and the companies owe over Rs 17,000 crore to lenders.

If 100 per cent of the encumbered or pledged shares are sold, the founder-promoters will be left with around 2 per cent of the company. Just VTB’s share sale to a third party will halve the current promoter shareholding to 11.66 per cent, also making them vulnerable to any takeover attempt.

The Zee management told ET they are continuing their ongoing divestment programme of core media and non-core assets like solar parks, highways, financial services, education and are open to selling 50 per cent of their holding in Zee. In such an eventuality, the promoters will be left with a mere 5 per cent of the company.

A bigger 15-20 per cent block of shares might attract global media companies too but they would want control of the board and company, said a lender with exposure to the company.

VTB, the Russian financial conglomerate, with strong ties to the Kremlin, had also said it was hoping to reach a satisfactory resolution with the promoters to willingly cease all enforcement action and release the encumbrances upon repayment of the amount outstanding under the loan facility. The company has been trying to refinance the loan by taking out VTB but no resolution is so far in sight.


These offshore lenders gave loans to Essel Media in September 2017 against shares of Zee (held by Essel Media) as the collateral.

The domestic lenders and the Zee management are currently discussing whether to transfer the promoter family’s pledged shares into an escrow account prior to any sale. Essel Group recently submitted an escrow arrangement to the lenders which involved transferring the pledged shares to a separate account without disclosing the identity of the proposed buyer and the price at which it will be sold. Lenders, however, expressed their misgivings to about the lack of information regarding additional equity dilution, ET reported on October

31. But with the Zee Entertainment stock price rallying 32 per cent in just last two trading sessions, lenders are hopeful of a resolution.

In July, a Comcast-led consortium did make a non-binding offer to buy a controlling stake in the company in July but their offer was rejected by the company. Instead, the promoters agreed to sell only 11 per cent stake at a premium for Rs 4,224 crore to US-based Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund. The proceeds were used to repay Rs 2,300 crore to six mutual funds.

Investors, however, do worry about the promoter debt overhang, which means further sell-down of Zee stock. “We expect a reduction based on lower near-term free cash flows and emergence of a long-term discount to fair value due to likelihood of low promoter-stake post resolution of debt overhang. Key downside risk is further sale of pledged shares by lenders (VTB, domestic funds),” argued Sanjay Chawla and Vishnu KG, analysts with JM Financial.

30,2019-11-08,Zee,"Goldman Sachs has lowered target prices on select Zee Group stocks as they continue to see an overhang on account pledged shares at the promoter level.

The brokerage has cut target price on Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) by 28 per cent to Rs 347 and trimmed Dish TV India target price by 24 per cent to Rs 22.

“Post the stock price correction, both Zee and Dish trade at valuations which are close to historical troughs, but we stay on the sidelines and remain neutral given the lack of clarity on pledged shares,” said Manish Adukia and Piyush Mubayi of Goldman Sachs in a note.

As of September 2019, about 96 per cent of promoters’ shareholding in Zee Entertainment was pledged while 94 per cent of promoter holding in Dish TV was pledged.

Shares of ZEE and Dish TV have been under pressure in the recent times, down 36.6 per cent and 66 per cent respectively in the last one year. Worsening trend in the underlying business has also contributed to the weaknesses in the stocks.

ZEE posted a 6.9 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 413.2 crore for the quarter ended September, lower than analysts estimates.

Its balance sheet has also seen a worsening trend in the recent quarters due to increasing working capital, said Goldman Sachs.

Zee and Essel Group executives have said in investor calls recently that they remain confident of deleveraging over the next three months through the sale of group infrastructure and media assets.

ZEE BALANCE SHEET OVERHANG
Goldman Sachs said growth outlook for ZEE is still strong but pledged shares are an overhang. The firm estimates slower growth for domestic advertising at 9 per cent on a compounded basis due to a slowdown in advertising spend by FMCG and auto companies.

“We are keeping a close eye on the company’s working capital, but recent disclosures around delay in recovery of inter-corporate deposits present a worrying trend,” said Goldman Sachs.

DISH ARPU PRESSURE PERSISTS
Besides overhang of pledged shares, Goldman has remianed neutral on Dish TV also because of challenging near term outlook. Goldman believes pressure on ARPUs is likely to remain. “We believe this pressure on ARPU may persist due to competition in the linear TV distribution space and proliferation of digital content/cheaper wireless data in India; we expect ARPU for Dish TV to see a low-single digit decline over the next 3 years as Jio’s entry in fixed broadband/ Pay TV is likely to put pressure on pricing,” said Goldman Sachs."

35,2019-11-08,Zee,"By Abhishek Vishnoi

The founders of Indian companies are putting up more of their shareholdings as collateral, raising the risk of volatility in stocks trading at record-high levels.

The percentage of founders’ pledged holdings rose for the first time in three quarters in the July-September period, Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a report earlier this week. The broker estimates a total of 2.52 per cent of all founders’ shares are pledged as collateral, accounting for about 1.24 per cent of the S&P BSE 500 Index’s total market capitalization.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Yes Bank were among companies whose founders made the biggest increases in share pledges, said analysts led by Sanjeev Prasad.

Last year’s shock default at shadow lender IL&FS group has reverberated across the Indian economy. The ongoing credit crisis has choked economic growth to its slowest pace in six years, while company defaults on bonds are at a record.

Founders with repayment obligations are pledging more because “lenders have held back from giving loans due to the ongoing credit crisis and slowing growth,” said Deven Choksey, managing director of Mumbai-based wealth manager and brokerage K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt.

A request by India’s market regulator in August for additional disclosure on pledged stock may also have contributed to an increase in reporting. Last month, the regulator and the nation’s stock exchanges decided to levy a minimum margin of 35 per cent on stocks with high founder pledge ratios, among other criteria. The number of these so-called encumbered shares may rise further by year-end, Choksey said.

The S&P BSE Sensex Index closed at another new high Thursday, and volatility remains around 15 per cent after spiking over 25 per cent earlier this year. Still, the threat that stocks may be sold to cover a personal or corporate debt can shake investor confidence.

“Volatility can increase in stocks, especially those with high debt, as bringing additional capital into businesses is not easy anymore,” Choksey said."

44,2019-11-11,Zee,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, bought select FMCG, public sector companies and pharma players with both hands in October as September quarter earnings season peaked.

The fund house purchased more than 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and India's largest hydropower producer NHPC.

ITC last month posted a 37.06 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,173.72 crore for September quarter, while NHPC is scheduled to announce its number later on Monday.

Stock brokers are positive on ITC. Anand Rathi Financial Services in a November 6 report said: “With strong operating cash flows, continuous capacity expansions across businesses and a healthy balance sheet, we continue to remain positive on ITC over medium to longer term perspective. We maintain a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 352 per share.”

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other top buys in October included SBI, Coal India, REC, Bajaj Corp, Bharti Infratel, Neyveli Lignite, Cipla, Ambuja Cement, Federal Bank, Texmaco Rail, Tata Steel, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Firstsource Solutions and J Kumar Infraprojects, among others.

The fund house added 2.50 to 95 lakh additional shares of these companies last month.

SBI, the country’s biggest lender by assets, reported a nearly six-fold rise in Q2 profit at Rs 3,375.40 crore, supported by a partial stake sale in life insurance venture.

HDFC Securities earlier in November gave a ‘buy’ call to SBI with a target price of Rs 312.

HDFC AMC also added shares of infra players IRB Infra (18 lakh shares), Larsen and Toubro (11 lakh shares), Dilip Buildcon (6.51 lakh shares) and PNC Infratech (3.89 lakh shares). Besides, it further bought Sun Pharma (23 lakh shares), Grasim Industries (21 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (20 lakh shares), GAIL (19 lakh shares), Indian Hotels (19 lakh shares), Delta Corp (17 lakh shares), Kirloskar Ferrous (16 lakh shares) and Mishra Dhatu Nigam (16 lakh shares).

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore. The company had posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore in the same period last financial year.

From among large cap firms, the fund house added nearly 6 lakh shares of the InusInd Bank and 3.87 lakh shares of Bajaj Electricals. Financial firms including HDFC, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank also drew some interest of the AMC.

It further increased its exposure in Bajaj Finance, UltraTech Cement, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Dr Reddy’s Labs, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki, Zee Entertainment, M&M, Titan, HCL Technology and Adani Ports.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced 3.78 per cent, or 1,461 points to 40,129 in October amid robust inflows by foreign institutional investors during the month. On the other hand, BSE Midcap and Smallcap index gained 5.39 per cent and 2.94 per cent, respectively, during the month.

It is going to be a U-shaped recovery for the midcaps. They tend to do well when GDP growth surprises and we will see GDP recovery going forward. As the recovery gets a bit broad-based, we will definitely see midcaps outperforming the largecaps over the next two to three years.”"

49,2019-11-13,Zee,"Even after losing the Indian Premier League (IPL) – the Rs 1,000 crore annual revenue property – to rival Star India, Sony Pictures Network India (SPN) has managed to offset the potential loss and posted strong revenue and profit for the year ended March 30, 2019.

The company has posted operating revenue of Rs 6223.73 crore for FY19, a mere 2.8 per cent drop when compared to a revenue of Rs 6,400.58 crore in the previous fiscal, when IPL 10’s revenue of around Rs 1,200 crore was accounted for.

The company, in its filing to the ROC, posted its net profit for the fiscal at Rs 346.43 crore, down from Rs 520.67 crore.

“IPL was our biggest property, but whoever believed that SPN was too dependent on one property and had nothing else, is now proven wrong. We have not just managed to turn around Hindi general entertainment business, but digital and sports businesses are also raking in good numbers,” said a source in the company.

An email query sent to SPN did not elicit any response till press time Tuesday.

In the driver seat at SPN is MD and CEO NP Singh, who joined the company in 1999 as CFO and turns 60 on Wednesday. In an earlier interaction with ET, Singh had maintained that the company has many assets and is not dependent on IPL alone.

After taking over as CEO in 2014, Singh has made efforts to venture into multiple businesses. He shown aggression in acquiring Ten Sports from Zee Entertainment Enterprises as well as built digital business, Sony LIV, which now claims of over 100 million downloads and monthly active users. Recently, SPN also launched Marathi and Kids channels.

Industry experts and rivals now feel that SPN has made some right calls across sports and other businesses, which have started to deliver.

The company currently has both of its Hindi general entertainment channels – Sony Entertainment Television (SET), headed by and Sony SAB in top four in the all India market and Top 2 in the urban markets. Its Hindi movie channel Sony MAX is number one among pay channels in the genre, while kids channel Sony Yay has also entered into top 5 as per BARC India.

Incidentally, after losing IPL and the BCCI rights to Star India, SPN went ahead and picked up rights of Australia and England & Wales cricket boards. Now it has telecast rights of seven cricket boards - England, Australia, West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. It also has rights of the upcoming Olympic Games; eight premier international football properties: UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, LaLiga, Serie A, UEFA Super Cup, FA Cup, UEFA Nations League and UEFA EURO 2020, as well as WWE and mixed martial arts property UFC. SPN has also partnered with the Pro Volleyball and other sporting leagues.

In digital business, where the company owns and operates Sony LIV, the company claims operational profitability at a time when market leader Hotstar has reported losses of over Rs 500 crore for the fiscal.

Sources also add that the drop in the net profit is on the account of drop in the distribution revenue, which directly has affected the bottomline of the company.

“In the last quarter of the financial year, because of the regulatory changes thanks to the new tariff order, SPN has suffered a drop in the distribution revenues. While advertising has more than offset it in the topline, distribution has directly affected net profit,” the source added.

A subsidiary of Sony Corp, SPN now has 29 TV channels, two motion pictures studios, one digital and TV production studio, as well as digital service."

55,2019-11-18,Zee,"Analysts have been conservative about increasing their price targets on stocks these days given that corporate earnings growth revival continues to remain elusive and investor sentiment is turning cautious. At the same time, they have been prompt in cutting target prices at the slightest evidence of stress. Asset management companies, insurers and healthcare players are among the stocks that saw the biggest increase in consensus target prices after the September quarter results, while companies in banking, telecom and housing finance spaces saw the biggest cuts to target prices. ET takes a look at 10 stocks that have seen the biggest increases or cuts in target prices by analysts after the September quarter results.


HDFC ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY
The largest AMC in India reported a 79% jump in profit after tax at Rs 368.3 crore in the quarter ended September. The stock is trading at three times its issue price of Rs 1,100. While the AMC has seen one of the biggest target price increases in recent weeks, many believe the upside is limited. “HDFC AMC is the best placed to capitalise on the long-term growth opportunity in India’s mutual fund industry...But near-term upside is limited, given the recent re-rating,” said IIFL Securities in a note.


WHIRLPOOL OF INDIA
Analysts said Whirlpool’s second quarter results were ahead of estimates. “Q2FY20 was a robust quarter for Whirlpool, likely boosted by pre-festival sales in September 2019 as well,” the brokerage said. Whirlpool’s net profit rose 63.8% to Rs 128.7 crore in the September quarter. Though the consensus target price increased by 26% after September quarter results, analysts believe valuations are stretched at 40 times FY21 estimates.


MANAPPURAM FINANCE
The company’s consolidated profit jumped 82% in the September quarter to Rs 402.3 crore, which led to a 20% increase in consensus target price. “Pick-up in gold-loan in the coming quarters, higher gold prices and favourable regulatory environment will act as a positive catalyst. We believe that the company has the potential to deliver 20% plus RoE (return on equity) driven by RoA of 4% plus,” said IDBI Capital, retaining buy with a target price of Rs 195.


NARAYANA HRUDAYALAYA
Net profit of Narayana Hrudayalaya rose 233.80% to Rs 45.33 crore in the quarter ended September as against Rs 13.58 crore in the same quarter last year. “NARH remains the best-positioned hospital to benefit from the formalisation of large latent demand. The past three quarters have shown better execution and improved margins. Management has also said it is not looking at further capex,” said Jefferies in a note last week, retaining its buy rating and target price of Rs 340.


DR LAL PATHLABS
The company’s consolidated profit in the September quarter rose 41.4% at Rs 81 crore. “We believe that the long runway and good visibility on growth and high return on capital employed (RoCE) should continue to support premium multiples. We believe that the long runway and good visibility on growth and high RoCEs should continue to support premium multiples,” said Citigroup, raising its target price on the stock to Rs 1,700 from Rs 1,475.


INDIABULLS HOUSING FINANCE
Indiabulls Housing Finance reported over 32% decline in its consolidated net profit to Rs 702.18 crore in the September quarter. Morgan Stanley has cut its target price by 49% to Rs 210 as it continues to find the risk-reward unfavourable given the uncertainty on multiple counts and high stock volatility. “The stock has been and should remain volatile given numerous swing factors — news flow around the litigation outcome, asset quality, and funding access. We expect significant downside in our bear case,” said Morgan Stanley.


RBL BANK
RBL Bank’s net profit slumped 73% in the quarter ended September as bad loans weighed. Analysts do not rule out further negative surprises on the asset quality front. “The management has guided for almost similar slippages in the next quarter. Further surprises on asset quality cannot be ruled out given the high exposure to stressed corporate sectors like NFBCs, real estate, construction and power, and higher exposure to riskier credit card/ microfinance sector in a slowing economy,” said Ambit Capital, retaining its sell rating with a target price of Rs 269.


ZEE ENTERTAINMENT ENTERPRISES
Zee reported muted second quarter results. The company reported a 6.9% rise in net profit for the second quarter. “Material growth is likely to resume once demand from FMCG, auto, among others, revives...though the valuation is attractive now, resolution of promoter’s pledged shares remains key trigger for the stock,” said Edelweiss in a note. The brokerage has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 399.

The company reported a decline of 41% in September quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 11.2 crore. “Plummeting auto volumes remain a near-term obstacle, but robust growth in non-Mahindra, non-auto and warehousing segments, and robust client addition are encouraging long-term developments,” said BOB Capital Markets in a post results note. The brokerage has maintained buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 460.

58,2019-11-19,Zee,"EuroKids, a leading playschool chain in the country controlled by US private equity firm KKR, is in preliminary talks to acquire Asia’s largest preschool chain Kidzee from Zee Learn for Rs 1,000–1,200 crore people aware of the development said.

The deal, if it goes through, will help Subhas Chandra-promoted Essel Group further deleverage its consolidated balance sheet, sources said.

The group that owns broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises, direct-to-home service DishTV and specialty packaging firm Essel Propack is battling with a debt repayment issue of close to Rs 7,500 crore, across its diversified businesses.

New York-headquartered KKR — which bought 92 per cent stake in Euro-Kids for about Rs 1,500 crore in September — is believed to have made a non-binding offer to acquire educational portfolio of Zee Learn, particularly Kidzee, and is awaiting a response from the management, people cited earlier said.

“EuroKids and Kidzee complement each other, so that’s the key target,” said a person involved in the talks. “Adding Mount Litera into the negotiations could take more time, something the Zee Group can ill-afford at this time.” The person requested anonymity because the talks are in private domain.



The transaction involves demerging the preschool business from the listed parent company Zee Learn and subsequently hiving it off through a slump sale, sources said.

An Essel Group spokesperson said both strategic and financial investors have shown interest in its education vertical Zee Learn and that the group is “actively evaluating” those offers.

“The divestment of Zee Learn Ltd is in line with the overall asset divestment process undertaken by the group,” the person said. “Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements.”

EuroKids declined to comment.

Zee Learn has more than 1,900 Kidzee preschools in more than 750 cities across the country. It also has the country’s fastest-growing K-12 school chain, Mount Litera Zee Schools (MLZS), with more than 120 schools in 110 cities in the country, besides Zee Institute of Media Arts, Zee Institute of Creative Art, and Himgiri Zee University, an UGC approved state private university in Dehradun.

EuroKids is looking for aggressive expansion of its portfolio.

In an investor call in October, Punit Goenka, CEO at Zee Entertainment, had said, “We have been approached by some marquee investors, both strategic and financial, for the Zee Learn stake and we are considering their offers seriously.”

The group is already selling noncore assets in infrastructure and financial services as part of its efforts to pare debt. It may also sell part of promoters’ shares in flagship Zee Entertainment pledged with lenders.

Essel Group in an exchange filing in September had said the group is in steady and progressive dialogue with all lenders and had sought an extension of deadline for repayment of debt to few mutual funds and nonbanking institutions.

Zee Learn more than doubled its consolidated revenue for the year ended March at Rs 549 crore against Rs 272.50 crore in FY18. Its profit after tax rose to Rs 83 crore from Rs 49 crore in the previous fiscal. Its revenues from educational services and related activities stood at Rs 398 crore in FY19 against Rs 186 crore in FY18. Kidzee’s FY19 Ebitda was around Rs 70 crore.

The current market capitalisation of Zee Learn is Rs 755 crore. Promoters own 57.17 per cent of the company, of which 82.74 per cent is pledged with lenders.

Zee Learn shares have fallen 37.84 per cent in the past one year, significantly underperforming the benchmark Sensex, which gained 12.61 per cent during the same period .

In February 2018, Zee Learn had acquired a controlling 44.5 per cent stake in MT Educare, a Mumbai-based firm that runs the popular Mahesh Tutorials coaching classes, for about Rs 200 crore to expand its footprint.

“The overall financial performance has remained stable keeping in view the acquisition of MT Educare which has supported the revenues and profitability,” Brickwork Ratings had said in a note in July. “The total debt has increased to Rs 379 crore in FY19 versus Rs 258 crore in FY18.”

Zee Learn’s Mount Litera Zee School partners with local educational trusts and offer services such as school set up assistance, teacher training, assessment, teaching materials, student learning resources, and branding. It also runs five CBSE company-owned company-operated schools and an IB school at BKC Mumbai.

EuroKids is one of India’s largest education services providers in the preschool and kindergarten to K-12 segments. Its portfolio brands, including EuroKids, EuroKids DayCare, Kangaroo Kids, EuroSchool and Billabong International, serve more than 120,000 students from 1,115 preschools and 35 K-12 schools across five countries.

There is a wide potential for foreign investments in Indian education that is estimated to reach $144 billion by 2020 from $97.8 billion in 2016. The country allows 100 per cent foreign direct investment in this space under automatic route. An estimated investment of $200 billion is required to achieve the government’s target of 30 per cent GER for the education sector by 2020, according to Zee Learn annual report."

68,2019-11-20,Zee,"MUMBAI: The promoters of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) are looking to sell up to 16.5% more of their stake in India’s biggest listed media company to repay lenders.

Of the total promoter stake earmarked for the sale, up to 15.72% will change hands in block deals on Thursday.

According to a term sheet seen by ET, three promoter companies - EMVL, Cyquator and Essel Corporate - will sell 77 million, 61 million and 11 million shares, respectively, totalling 15.72% of the equity base. The stake will be sold at an indicative price of Rs 277 per share, translating into a 10% discount to Wednesday’s closing price of ZEE at Rs 307 apiece, the term sheet document showed.

At the floor price, the value of the 15.72% stake is worth $582 million (nearly Rs 4,132 crore).

Citigroup is the book runner for Thursday’s proposed block deals.

In a separate filing with the stock exchanges, ZEE promoters said that out of the planned sale of up to 16.5% equity, the promoters are seeking to sell around 2.3% stake in ZEE to OFI Global China Fund, a subsidiary of the Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund that had earlier bought into the Mumbai-based media company.

On July 30, ZEE’s promoters had reached an agreement with Invesco Oppenheimer to sell up to 11% stake for Rs 4,224 crore (Rs 400 per share): In this transaction, the promoters had completed the sale of 8.7%.

Separately, banking sources told ET that some foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have already committed their participation in the block deals.

“These deals are almost done. ZEE promoters will sell 15.72% via block deals and the remaining will be sold off-market. They will continue to hold 5% in the company, with Punit (Goenka) continuing as MD and CEO,” a highly placed source told ET.

Promoter Subhash Chandra and his family office have to repay more than Rs 7,000 crore they owe to domestic lenders, including mutual funds, and Russia’s state-backed lender VTB.

ET had earlier reported that ZEE promoters were talking to three FIIs to sell 10-11% stake. However, as the stock price fell, the promoters now have to sell more stake in the company.

As of September 30, ZEE promoters owned 22.37% stake in ZEE, out of which 96% is pledged with the lenders. VTB Capital has a charge of more than 100 million shares, worth 10.71% of the company’s equity.

After the next round of sale, ZEE promoters will continue to own 5% stake in the company, out of which around 1.1% will remain pledged, the company said.

A ZEE spokesperson had earlier said that Essel Group has appointed investment bankers to lead the divestment process of media and non-media assets, and that the group is also in a “constant process of evaluating proposals from the prospective partners,” keeping the interest of its lenders.

ET reported on Tuesday that private equity firm KKR-backed EuroKids is in preliminary talks to acquire preschool chain KidZee from Zee Learn for Rs 1,000–1,200 crore. Earlier, in an investor call, CEO Goenka had said that the promoters have recently been approached by some marquee investors to buy a stake in Zee Learn, where the Essel Group owns 57.18% stake.

Apart from KidZee, the company also owns a network of K-12 schools (Mount Litera) and Mahesh Tutorial."
76,2019-11-21,Zee,"NEW DELHI: Snapping their 2-day winning run, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty fluctuated between gains and losses to end lower in a volatile trading session on Thursday, as investors booked profits and avoided long positions amid tepid global cues. The market witnessed some selling pressure in metal, telecom and energy stocks on the day of weekly F&O expiry.

Analysts said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on both domestic and global fronts. The GDP data which is due on November 29 is likely to indicate whether the slowdown in Indian economy has deepened.

Any developments around US-China trade deal may also influence market mood in the coming days.

Meanwhile, shares of Zee Entertainment hit the upper circuit after reports said that 14.52 crore shares of the company changed hands in a block deal on the NSE. The Subhash Chandra-led Essel group on Wednesday said it was planning to sell 16.5 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) to financial investors in order to repay loan obligations to certain lenders of the group.

Also, PSU stocks were in focus today as the government kicked off a blockbuster disinvestment plan on Wednesday, lining up the sale of five public sector units (PSUs), including majority stakes in bluechip oil company BPCL and Shipping Corporation of India. BPCL was the top loser on NSE closing 6 per cent lower at Rs 512.10, while SCI slumped over 6 per cent to Rs 64.05 on BSE.

Telecom stocks also slipped in trade despite the Cabinet giving a two-year moratorium on spectrum payments, which is expected to give immediate relief of more than Rs 42,000 crore to mobile phone companies.

Experts Take
""Nifty traded lackluster and settled marginally lower, taking a breather after the recent upmove. It opened flat and remained range-bound thereafter, however, movement on the stock-specific front kept the traders busy. Most sectoral indices ended lower in line with benchmarks and the broader indices too remained under pressure. We strongly feel that market is set for profit taking or consolidation prior to further rise. Traders should limit their naked leveraged trades in the index and book profits on every rise. In case of decline, 11,800-11,850 zone would act as a cushion in Nifty. Stocks, on the other hand, would continue to see movement on both sides thus maintain extra caution in the stock selection"" -- Ajit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking.

72,2019-11-21,Zee,"Shares of Zee Entertainment hit the upper circuit in opening deals on Thursday after reports said 14.52 crore shares of the company changed hands in a block deal on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The Subhash Chandra-led Essel group on Wednesday said it was planning to sell 16.5 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) to financial investors in order to repay loan obligations to certain lenders of the group.

After this transaction, the promoter stake in Zee Entertainment will be reduced to 5 per cent, which means that media baron Subhash Chandra will lose control of Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

According to a term sheet seen by ET, three promoter companies — EMVL, Cyquator and Essel Corporate — will sell 77 million, 61 million and 11 million shares, respectively, totalling 15.72 per cent of the equity base. The stake will be sold at an indicative price of Rs 277 per share, translating into a 10 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of Zee at Rs 307 apiece, the term sheet document showed.

Zee, considered to be the pioneer of television entertainment industry in India, was launched by Subhash Chandra in 1992. Ever since the launch year, the company expanded operations to enter packaging, infrastructure, education, precious metals, finance and technology sectors.

At the floor price, the value of the 15.72 per cent stake is worth $582 million (nearly Rs 4,132 crore). Citigroup is likely the book runner for Thursday’s block deals.

Earlier this year, Essel Group sold up to 11 per cent in Zee Entertainment to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for Rs 4,224 crore.

Value investors Safir Anand in a tweet said, “The news on Zee promoter stake sell while retaining control on business is a big positive. The overhang on the pledge stands settled. Oppenheimer and others now in majority. As it is business had no issues and was doing well.”

Despite negative global cues on Thursday, NSE Nifty opened with marginal gains, but failed to capitalise on the gapup opening, as it witnessed selling pressure in the later half of the day.

The index made lower high and lower low and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. Formation of a negative candle after a Doji candle doesn’t bode well for the bulls. However, the overall chart structure is still bullish and till Nifty holds above 11,850, we maintain a positive stance on the market for a target of 12,050 and 12,103 levels.

On the flipside, immediate support is placed at 11,920, 11,850 and 11,780 levels.

On the monthly options front, Maximum Put open interest (OI) was at 11,900 followed by 11,800 strike, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200 strike. We have seen some Put writing at 12,000 and 11,900 strike, while Call writing was visible in 12,000-12,200 zone. Option data suggests a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200 levels.


India VIX fell 1.22 per cent to 14.97 level. Now it needs to continue to hold below 15 to surpass the recent highs.

Bank Nifty continued to hold above 31,200 for a second consecutive session and formed a small red bodied candle on the daily scale. The index made higher lows for a fifth consecutive session and ended on a flat note. The index moved within the territory of Wednesday’s trading range and thus formed an Inside Bar pattern on the daily scale. Till it holds above 31,200, we may see extension in ongoing optimism towards 31,500 and then 31,750. On the downside, supports are placed at 31,000 and then 30,800.

Nifty futures closed fell 0.39 per cent to 11,971. Builtup of long positions were seen in Zee Entertainment, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bosch, Cadila Healthcare and L&T, while shorts were seen in Vodafone Idea, Sun TV, Auro Pharma, Bata India and SAIL.

The headline index made a lower high and lower Low and formed a red body candle on the daily chart. For the second straight week, Nifty has traded in a narrow range of 171 points, which is the narrowest weekly range in the last six months.

Shares of country’s biggest listed media company were sold in block deals on the NSE on Thursday at Rs 304 apiece. While the promoters are now left with just 5 per cent stake in the company, they raised more than Rs 4,500 crore from the deals to repay lenders.

Citi and JP Morgan were the book runners for the block deals.

Among the domestic funds that bought into the stock were SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential, Sundaram, Axis Mutual Fund, and the Edelweiss Group. Among the other overseas funds were Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, Fidelity, and Nomura.

According to ICICIdirect, one key positive takeaway form the stake sale was removal of overall stock price led volatility owing to pledge issue. “However, we note that sale to financial investors was a tad disappointing as strategic investors coming in would have added value to the stock. On the operating front, the aggressive spending to build a content library as well as related party dues remains a spoiler,” the brokerage house said.

The brokerage house further added that the near-term concerns include softer advertisement outlook due to macroeconomic challenges as well as possible risks of tweak in NTO policies.

Emkay Global Financial Services has ‘Hold’ rating on Zee with a target price of Rs 389. On the positive side, the brokerage house believes that the deal removes the pledge overhang while also ensuring the continuation of the current management team.

81,2019-11-22,Zee,"MUMBAI: Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans.

Shares of India’s biggest listed media company were sold in block deals on the NSE on Thursday at Rs 304 apiece. While the promoters are now left with just 5 per cent stake in the company, they raised more than Rs 4,500 crore from the deals to repay lenders.

Citi and JP Morgan were the book runners for the block deals.

Among the domestic funds that bought into the stock were SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Sundaram, Axis Mutual Fund, and the Edelweiss Group. Among the other overseas funds were Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, Fidelity, and Nomura.

OFI Global China Fund, a subsidiary of the Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund that had earlier bought into the Mumbai-based media company, also picked up a 2.3 per cent stake. The total divestment by ZEE promoters stood at 16.5 per cent of their shareholding.

“I am overwhelmed by the positive response received from our investors,” Punit Goenka, MD and CEO of ZEE, said in a statement. He disclosed that the book was oversubscribed approximately three times.

Three promoter companies, EMVL, Cyquator and Essel Corporate, sold 77 million, 61 million and 11 million shares, respectively. The floor price was set at Rs 277 per share, at a 10 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 307 apiece, but the deals were carried out at Rs 304 apiece.


After the sale of shares, many broking firms upgraded the ZEE scrip, which rallied about 15 per cent intraday to close at Rs 343 on NSE, up 12 per cent from their previous close.

Morgan Stanley India noted that heightened volatility in the ZEE stock in the past few months could be largely attributed to the sale of pledged shares and uncertainty with respect to the sale of the remaining pledged shares. However, with promoters now selling a 16.5 per cent stake, a large portion of the promoter debt could be resolved.

“This reduces the risk of pledged stock coming to the market, so we lower our bear case probability,” the report said.

Proceeds from the sale will go toward repayment of more than Rs 7,000 crore the promoters owe to their lenders. With the stake sale, around 1.1 per cent of the promoters’ stake (amounting to 22 per cent) will remain pledged.

The Essel Group is also in talks to divest other media and non-media assets to clear debt."
80,2019-11-22,Zee,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Friday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 3.50 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Motilal Oswal has maintained a Buy rating on 
Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 7,390. The brokerage increased its consolidated earnings per share of Maurti for FY20 by 18 per cent to factor in the possible increase in the sales volumes. While the near term demand headwinds persist, Maruti is best placed to weather these headwinds, particularly BS6 transition due to limited price inflation, the brokerage said. Shares of Maruti Suzuki closed at Rs 7,017 apiece on Thursday, down 1.9 per cent.

• SBI Cap has maintained its hold rating on 
Marico with a target price of Rs 335. The brokerage belives core Indian hair oil revenue of Marico will be under stress along with Saffola edible oil. Further, expansion in adjacent categories is likely to outgrow overall company growth. With several FMCG companies noting weak demand, the brokerage expects the topline growth guidance of Marico’s core portfolio to be at risk. Shares of Marico closed at Rs 356 apiece, up 0.3 per cent on Thursday.


• Edelweiss maintained its buy rating on 
Zee Entertainment Enterprises with a target price of Rs 443. According to the brokerage, advertising growth in FY21 is likely to pick up due to anticipated revival in gross domestic product and benefits from corporate tax cut. Further, the ongoing promoter stake sale is likely to remove the promoter pledge related overhang on the stock. Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises closed at Rs 343, up 11.7 per cent on Thursday.

• Axis Securities has given a buy rating on 
City Union Bank with a target price of Rs 239. The brokerage said it remains positive on account of its consistent earnings and stable asset quality. Slower loan growth and asset quality stress could impact in the near term but the recent tax cuts will aid the bank. City Union Bank reported a tepid second quarter earnings on account of slowdown in loan growth and compressed net interest margins due conscious focus on credit quality and pricing pressures. Shares of City Union Bank closed at Rs 215, up 0.5 per cent on Thursday.

• ICICI Direct has maintained a Buy rating on 
Kalpataru Power Transmission with a target price of Rs 534. The company’s order book with good traction in non T&D business and improved performance of its subsidiaries is expected to register a consistent growth, the brokerage said. Also, strategy to monetise non-core assets and sales proceeds from three transmission assets would improve return ratios. Shares of Kalpataru closed at Rs 460 apiece, up 2.2 per cent on Thursday."
84,2019-11-22,Zee,"Analysts have started re-rating Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) after Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra said he will sell 16.5 per cent stake in the company to investors. The average target price on the stock has been raised to Rs 405 against the current market price of Rs 345 as the stake sale reduces the risk of pledged stocks flooding the market.

Essel promoters will use the stake sale proceeds to repay a large portion of the debt. Shares of Zee rallied 12.44 per cent to Rs 345.35 on Thursday.


“All in all, it is a better outcome than what it looked likely at the peak of the Essel Group’s debt crisis. Zee’s execution remains healthy in a challenging environment.” said GV Giri, analyst, IIFL Securities. “Over time, US media players could consider acquiring a stake in Zee, potentially triggering an open offer; but this is still some time away.”"

On the other hand, IT, Consumer Durables and Auto declined up to 2.50 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research Geojit Financial Services, said: “Buoyancy in the telecom sector was largely due to likelihood of hike in tariff and deferment of spectrum dues is likely to improve cash flow of these companies in the near term. On the other hand, fresh concerns over stringent norms for US H1b visa dragged IT heavyweights.”


Zee Entertainment climbs 24%
Share of Zee climbed 24 per cent to Rs 357.90 on November 22 from RS 287.50 on November 15. Several foreign funds, including the New York-based BlackRock, Singapore government-backed GIC, HSBC Global, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley Asia, Vanguard and Wellington Management, have picked up stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the promoters sold stock to repay loans. Zee also remained as top gainer in the Nifty pack for week ended September 22.

RIL nears Rs 10 lakh cr valuation
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the Rs 10 lakh crore mark helped by the continuous rise in its share price. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike. With a market value of Rs 9.80 lakh crore, share of the company signed off the week with gains of over 5 per cent at Rs 1,546."
98,2019-11-25,Zee,"MUMBAI: Subhash Chandra, the media baron who rode India’s tumultuous media and entertainment scene to make Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) one of India’s biggest media groups, on Monday quit as chairman of the company which he founded in 1992 after watching CNN make a big splash with satellite television. He will, however, continue as a non-executive board member, ZEE said in a statement.

The resignation comes days after Chandra’s family saw its stake in ZEE fall to 5% following a series of mistimed and expensive infrastructure bets. Chandra’s investment companies had borrowed heavily from mutual funds and non-bank firms to fund road and renewable energy projects.

The family had pledged ZEE shares to obtain these loans but was forced to sell and repay after lenders threatened to offload them in the market in case of a default.

The Chandra family’s stake in ZEE has come down to 5% now from 41% a year ago while the shares have fallen 27% year to date. On Monday, they ended 5.33% lower at ₹339, ahead of the resignation.


NEW DIRECTORS
ZEE said in a statement that Chandra stepped down to fulfil the requirements of Regulation 17 (lB) of SEBI Listing Regulations, which mandated that the chairperson of the board shall not be related to the managing director or the chief executive officer of the company.

The ZEE board inducted three independent directors – former finance secretary R Gopalan, ex-head of Intelligence Bureau Surinder Singh and art aficionado Aparajita Jain in lieu of two independent directors Niharika Vora and Sunil Sharma as well as nominee director of Essel Group Subodh Kumar. After reconstitution, the board now has six independent directors besides two members from the Essel Group —Chandra and his son Punit Goenka.

“The reconstitution of the board was to strengthen and induct independent members with varied experiences to build value and provide a strong signal to the existing and new institutional investors who have recently reposed their faith in the intrinsic value of the company,” the statement said.


TAKEOVER TARGET?
The resignation seemingly creates a vacuum at the top of the board. Punit Goenka continues to be the MD and CEO but the board will soon have to appoint a chairman and is expected to do so in its next meeting. It also raises the question of whether Chandra’s resignation and the fall in the family’s holding will entice a hostile bid from rival media and entertainment groups.

What makes ZEE attractive is its 20% market share in India’s entertainment market, programming content in 12 languages and a billion plus viewers across more than 100 countries. An attractive price could make investors hand over shares to a new bidder though hostile takeovers have rarely succeeded in India and the news and entertainment business is a highly sensitive sector.

Chandra is likely to continue to enjoy political heft and clout despite the apparent loss of control of ZEE. The long battle to save the company and prevent a precipitous collapse in share price and stake may have sapped his financial strength but the new bidder will also have to contend with ZEE’s existing investors, especially ones who have been around for a long time and are considered close to the Chandra family.

Invesco Oppenheimer, now the largest shareholder in ZEE with almost 19% stake, has been a ZEE investor since 2002. For any interested party seeking control of ZEE, it is essential to reach out to the fund. Another large chunk is with Singapore governmentbacked GIC, which now owns around 8.5%.

“The basic rule for any hostile takeover is that you pick up 26% and then do an open offer. In ZEE’s case, there are only a few big institutional investors like Invesco Oppenheimer that can deliver a big block. But given their long relationship (with the promoters) and the fact that they rely on the promoter family to run the business, it is difficult to imagine,” said advocate Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S&R Associates and an expert on M&As.

“ZEE is an attractive opportunity, but a hostile takeover is highly unlikely. For all practical purposes, the promoters will continue to run the show,” said Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research, IDFC Securities.


THREE-DECADE REIGN
Chandra’s move brings an end to a successful, near-three decade reign as boss of Zee Entertainment, India’s first satellite television company. He successfully built ZEE into an entertainment conglomerate in face of stiff competition from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing’s Star, which was later taken over by Rupert Murdoch, and the local arm of Japan’s Sony Corporation. He launched India’s first dish TV firm and promoted a controversial, short-lived T20 cricket league, forcing the Indian cricket board to come up with the now-famous Indian Premier League (IPL).

“Chandra has been the original media entrepreneur in India...He is the towering personality, and even if he steps down today, I am sure a newer innings is waiting to happen. He has got too much fire in his belly. He is too young to hang up boots,” said Sameer Nair, CEO, Applause Entertainment. As former CEO of Star India, Nair often sparred with Chandra’s Zee in the late 1990s and early years of the 21st century."

""News that the US and China will conclude a deal by next month lifted sentiment across the globe. Reconstruction of Sensex indices due on December 23 and new developments over divestment to curb fiscal deficit provided confidence to the Indian market.

Analysts’ views
''The market touching all-time high is a clear reflection of expectations of continued reforms by the government, especially with regards to critical issues such as disinvestment and labour reform. Since a lot of money has been sitting on the sidelines and considering the fact that there has been improvement in margins for most corporates in the last quarter, market sentiment for next six months is quite positive,” -- Prakarsh Gagdani, CEO, 5Paisa.com.

“Bullish sentiment is likely to continue and Nifty is likely to scale 12,400. Markets have climbed a wall of worries and have hit fresh all-time high, which signals sheer strength. We have maintained our bullish stance for a while. The 12,000 level is the immediate support zone. Traders should utilise dips towards support zone to build long positions,” -- Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst with Indiabulls Ventures

112,2019-11-27,Zee,"Mumbai: India’s largest entertainment company Star India slipped into the red in the financial year ended March 2019 with a Rs 1,216.13-crore loss as against a net profit of Rs 287.69 crore a year ago, according to its recent filings with the registrar of companies (RoC).

The company followed a ‘conservative accounting principle’ and booked expenses of Rs 4,000 crore on the Indian Premier League (IPL) during the fiscal under review. Star India suffered losses despite a 35% increase in revenues during the year. An e-mail query sent to Star India remained unanswered till press time Tuesday.

According to the consolidated financial statement, sourced from business intelligence platform Tofler, the company’s total revenue from operations stood at Rs 12,341 crore in FY19 as against Rs 9,149 crore a year ago. This includes advertising revenues of Rs 7,311 crore – up 49% – and distribution revenue of Rs 4,128 crore – up 9%. Revenue from other sales and services also doubled to Rs 902 crore.

Total expenditure also jumped 58% to Rs 13,707 crore from Rs 8,694 crore a year ago. The spike in costs is attributed mainly to a 66% increase in programming and operating cost to Rs 10,296 crore, a 34% jump in employee cost to Rs 1,198 crore, and a 57% jump in marketing cost to Rs 1,168 crore.




ET estimated that the company recovered around Rs 1,750 crore from advertising revenue on the 11th edition of the IPL. FY19 was the first time when Star India had both TV and digital rights of the cash-rich cricket league, after it outspent its rivals with a break-the-bank bid of Rs 16,347.5 crore for five years in 2018.

“In FY19, Star had one full IPL season and almost 20% of the 2019 edition, which was advanced due to the general elections. As per its accounting practice, Star has recorded over Rs 4,000 crore expenses on IPL in FY19, which has put a drag on its balance sheet,” a source said.

Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research at IDFC Securities, said that Star has done a great job in monetising IPL. “While there is a significant jump in ad revenues because of the way it monetised IPL, there is also a drag on the profitability, which is as per the nature of any sports rights. In the initial years, you will lose money, while by the end of the cycle, you hope to recoup and make profits. The same is visible on the cost side,” he said.

Also contributing to the loss was Star’s digital streaming service Hotstar, which individually reported a net loss of Rs 558.38 crore on a revenue of Rs 1,112.74 crore. Senior officials had earlier said that the company believes in the future of Hotstar and is committed to invest for long-term gains.

According to Dokania, Hotstar will continue to be a near-term drag, but it is a necessary one. “Digital business requires heavy investments in content and technology. That should not be too worrying for Star,” he said.

During the financial year, Star India invested Rs 832.32 crore in Novi Digital, the holding company of Hotstar. Ajit Mohan, the Hotstar chief executive quit to join Facebook as India head during the year.

Star India’s highly profitable regional entertainment business also witnessed a 9% drop in net profit to Rs 271.85 crore, down from Rs 298.22 crore. The regional business’ revenue was up 11% to Rs 1,445.10 crore during the fiscal.

Star India’s topline puts it ahead of its peers like Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) and Viacom18, but in terms of operating profit, ZEE leads by a wide gap. In FY19, ZEE had posted an operating profit of Rs 2,564 crore, SPN Rs 780 crore and Viacom18 Rs 199 crore. Star India’s operating loss stood at Rs 1,336 crore in the fiscal, as per data sourced from RoC."

116,2019-11-27,Zee,"New Delhi: Two former directors of Zee Entertainment - Subodh Kumar and Neharika Vohra - who resigned from its board, had raised concerns over several issues, including Rs 2,200 crore film advance given in 2018-19, according to a regulatory filing by the firm.

They also had flagged issue of no action on large outstanding from group firms Dish TV and Siticable for content.

The company, however, said its Board of Directors have noted that all of the issues raised by the resigning directors have been duly discussed, deliberated and acted upon from time to time in the previous committee/ board meetings in which the said directors were also present.

On Monday Zee Entertainment Entrprises Ltd (ZEEL) had announced that Independent Directors Neharika Vora and Sunil Sharma along with Non-Independent Director Subodh Kumar have resigned.

ZEEL said Sharma had informed that his resignation followed the sale of shares by the promoter group and reconstitution of the board.

On the other hand, Vohra and Kumar raised many issues and cited them as reasons for their resignation from the board.

According to a BSE filing by ZEEL, the two directors flagged the issue of ""film advances given in 2018-19 to the tune of Rs 2,200 crore"", to which the company responded by saying the information has already been disclosed in its annual report and clarified in various investor interactions.

Kumar and Vohra also raised the matter of ""a scheduled bank"" appropriating ""Rs 200 crore of the company's fixed deposits towards promoter loans and the management did not take legal action"".

ZEEL, however, said issues pertaining to the wrongful revocation of the bank guarantee stand resolved with the company having being secured by the promoter companies and appropriate legal notices were sent to the bank at the relevant time.

The two directors also stated that no action was taken on large outstanding from Dish TV and Siticable for the content supplied by ZEEL.

The company, however, said, ""the same have been secured by definitive plan and situation is being strictly monitored as instructed by the Board and also discussed in various analyst calls"".

They also raised the issue of non-implementation of certain decision of the board meeting held on October 17, 2019 relating to treasury operations, to which ZEEL said it is ""exploring options to withdraw these deposits in a phased manner without effecting the long term relationship with these banks"".

Vohra and Kumar also alleged ""laxity in spending of CSR amounts given to a related party foundation/trust"" but the company said CSR funds have been allocated in compliance with law and necessary certification was obtained.

The two directors also brought up the matter of a bank writing to all directors in October 2019, that a subsidiary of the company had guaranteed the repayment of certain loan given by the bank to a related party.

ZEEL said it has a ""legal opinion to state that the Company is not liable and in any event there has been no enforcement of the 'guarantee' by the bank, other than to write letters, including to all the directors"".

In their reasons for resignation, Vohra and Kumar also highlighted a matter relating to a ""letter received from a PMS (Portfolio Management Services) entity holding preference shares of the company raising questions regarding build up of related party balances and advances for content acquisition"".

To this, ZEEL said, ""Audit of the issues pertaining to related party transactions and advances is underway by auditors"".

In the regulatory filing, ZEEL said the company, ""while accepting the resignations and intimating the exchanges about the same, has discussed the same in detail in the board meeting held on November 25, 2019"".

The issues raised by the resigning directors have been duly discussed, deliberated and acted upon from time to time and disclosed in the public domain in financial statements and investor calls which are available on the company website, ZEEL said."

I thought India was slowing down, but overseas investors have poured more than Rs 44,000 crore in the domestic equity markets since September 1!For the large part of the year, we have seen a good amount of selling by FIIs. Also, year till date, India is up almost about 11-12% versus the US markets -- be it Dow or S&P or NASDAQ -- which for that matter are up anywhere 20% to 30%. Then there has been some kind of a cool-off in the bond yields. Plus, in the last two months, because of the steps taken by the government, there has been some revival. So these flows have reversed. But I do not think we should read too much into that at this point of time. 

Typically, long term money comes into the market because of the view that the next two-three years could be good but unless and until we see hard core data points coming from the corporate sector, the sustainability of this could be question mark.


Two independent and one non-independent directors resigned from Zee Entertainment citing a whole host of issues. Are these of concern for a stock that has already borne the brunt of a lot of concerns on promoters’ pledged shares and Subhash Chandra resigning from the helm?The market is extremely sensitive to any news pertaining to corporate governance. There is going to be a bit of discomfort. The important question to ask is are these new concerns? I would say that a large part of this news was already known. In the previous board meetings, they have been deliberated and discussed. So it is not as if a new revelation has come today. 

Then there is the fact that because of certain corporate governance issues, Zee for the last six to eight months had underperformed big time. Now with the recent deal, Mr Goyal has actually reduced the stake and the new investors are coming in. We have to see what kind of numbers we really looking at over the next six to 12 months. That is a call one would really have to take rather than worrying too much about the recent development. 

There might be a knee jerk reaction but there may not be a case for a severe correction in Zee at this point of time. 


How are you looking at RBL Bank just now?After the severe underperformance and recent recovery, if the company can go through a fund raising, the quantum and the pricing needs to be seen, that would definitely add to a lot of comfort because we have seen a big rally across the bigger financial names. The SBI Card IPO is also coming up. We might see some more positive traction for RBL Bank from current price point.

There might be a knee jerk reaction but there may not be a case for a severe correction in Zee at this point of time.-Hemang Jani


It seems telecom is not going anywhere?Well it would not be fair to say that it is not going anywhere. We have seen both Bharti, Reliance and even Vodafone have gone up quite a bit in the last 7-10 days, ever since the news of a likely moratorium relaxation by the finance ministry has been talked about. The question is that after this kind of a run up, are we really looking at any substantial rerating for the sector. A part of this positive news has already been discounted in stock prices of Bharti and it might consolidate.

For Reliance Jio, depending upon how the actual price hikes are taken and what kind of numbers we see over the next two or three quarters and more importantly depending upon the demerger or getting some investors into the platform, that could be a potentially bigger trigger and which is what the market is sensing at this point of time. We need to be overall positive on the telecom sector because the sector is under-owned by both institutional and retail investors. There might be a desire to chip in, whenever there is an opportunity over there."

117,2019-11-28,Zee,"HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential MF and Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund have received payments from the Essel group after the promoters sold stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) to repay lenders. The recovery is on loans that were given to Essel, with ZEE shares used as collateral.

In a filing with the stock exchange, HDFC Mutual Fund said it has received Rs 167 crore toward part repayment of debt instruments, along with interest. The outstanding exposure of HDFC MF to this debt reduced to Rs 13.7 crore from Rs 1,156 crore. ICICI Prudential AMC has received its entire principal of Rs 267 crore along with interest, while Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has received Rs 840 crore.

“With this repayment, the aggregate market value of the outstanding exposure… which was Rs 1,156 crore as on March 31, 2019, stands substantially reduced to Rs 13.7 crore as on November 26, 2019, which is adequately covered by listed shares of DishTV India Ltd,” HDFC Mutual Fund said in a note to investors.

In the case of ICICI Prudential mutual fund, two open-ended schemes had exposure to the Essel Group, with ZEE shares used as collateral.

“Pursuant to the sale of shareholding by the promoters of ZEEL, the above schemes of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund have received repayment of the total principal amount invested along with the accrued interest thereon. Subsequently, none of the schemes of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has any investments in debt instruments issued by the promoter group companies of ZEEL,” ICICI Prudential Mutual fund said in a statement to investors.

A spokesperson at Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund said it received Rs 840 crore, which included the interest accrued on the principal advanced.

However, three schemes of Aditya Birla SL Mutual Fund have exposure to Adilink Infra and Multitrading, an Essel group company that defaulted on loan repayment commitments. Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund has segregated Rs 787 crore of Adilink Infra & Multitrading debentures that its schemes held."

128,2019-11-29,Zee,"MUMBAI: Japanese major Sony Corp, which owns Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) is likely to create a new joint venture with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries-owned TV18 Broadcast, which will house all the entertainment assets of both the companies, two people with direct knowledge of the development told ET.

Sony will own a majority 51% stake in the proposed JV, while TV18 will own the remaining 49%. As part of the deal, the two companies will transfer 100% of SPN, 51% of TV18’s share in Viacom18 (US entertainment conglomerate Viacom Inc owns 49% in Viacom18) and 100% of Jio Studios business to the new entity, one of the sources said. He added that the basic framework is ready and talks are on with Viacom Inc on structure of the deal.

If the deal fructifies, the combined entity will own 63 channels, two video streaming services (Voot and Sony LIV), four film studios, and two digital content studios, making it an entertainment behemoth with the largest share of voice among the networks in India. “While there were rumours about Sony looking at acquiring stake in Relianceowned Viacom18, the talks were on for a much larger partnership,” said second source close to the development.

Incidentally, Sony’s top brass, including CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, and Mike Hopkins, chairman of Sony Pictures Television (SPT), are scheduled to visit Mumbai on December 9.

A few senior officials from the Japanese major’s US office are expected to arrive earlier.

“Sony’ India entertainment business is doing very well and this trip by Mike and Mr Yoshida was long planned. Mike had come to India two years back also and they had met with Mukesh Ambani. While discussions at that time were very different, a possibility of partnership was discussed then for the first time,” a second person close to the situation told ET.

Last week, Bloomberg reported that Sony was in talks to acquire a stake in the Indian television network controlled by Mukesh Ambani. “Consolidation is good for any industry and if this deals happens, it will straight away put the combined entity among the top two players,” said Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research at IDFC Securities.

“There are lot of synergies. Sony does not have a strong regional portfolio, whereas Viacom18 has a reasonably strong regional play. Viacom18 doesn’t have sports, while SPN has a strong sports portfolio. Only on the Hindi GEC front, how they will find balance is something that needs to be seen.”

Viacom18 posted a net profit of Rs 81 crore on a revenue of Rs 3,667 crore in the last fiscal. SPN, on the other hand, posted a net profit of —346 crore on a revenue of Rs 6,224 crore.



Together, the combined entity will have very strong presence across Hindi general entertainment, kids, Hindi movies, and sports. Sony and Viacom18 complement each other in many genres. Sony is weak in terms of regional, kids and youth entertainment, whereas Viacom18 doesn’t have a sports or infotainment business.

As per BARC India data for last four weeks, in terms of all India viewership (excluding news) Star India was leading with 20% share, followed by Zee Entertainment Enterprises (18%), where as Viacom18 and SPN both had a market share of 9% each. Together the combined entity will have 18-20% share."

5,2019-12-03,Zee,"Girish Pai, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang is betting on ICICI Bank among largecaps, gold finance players Muthoot and Manappuram among midcaps and Inox Leisure among the smallcap stocks in next 12 months. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Excitement has returned to telecom stocks ever since markets realised that the tariffs have bottomed out. Is this excitement short lived or is it here to stay?One needs to remember whether we are going to have a three-player market or a two-player market going forward. If this is going to be a three-player market, the value accretion for a player like Bharti Telecom may not be that dramatic from here on. But having said that, we need to understand that the payments due to the government have been only pushed back by a couple of years. Vodafone Idea is not exactly in a great place from a balance sheet standpoint. By hiking tariffs, Vodafone Idea has progressed from a bankruptcy kind of situation to a place where it is going to survive for a few more years. 

But I would probably take a bet on Bharti right now. I would say that this is probably the kind of company to look at if you take a 3-5-year perspective. There is going to be lots of ups and downs. While we have only seen the euphoria connected with the tariff hike right now. One also needs to see how things are going to pan out over a period of time in terms of how the market shares are going to shift.


What would be your top buys in the next 12 to 18 months?I would bet on ICICI Bank. In fact, it was my top trade even If you had asked me this question in December 2018, I would have said ICICI Bank, it still is. There is a long way to go for the stock. I would think that the market is not taking enough cognisance of the fact that this company has decided to get out of project finance permanently. That could lead to multiple expansion of valuation for the bank. 

Also, valuation accretion might come through the subsidiaries of the bank. The insurance space has done fairly well both from the performance as well as stock perspective. There could be a potential situation of a listing of ICICI Pru AMC for sometime in the next 12 to 18 months. That could lead to value unlocking. I would think this is a bank which has kept its asset quality under control in the last few quarters. We have not seen any kind of negative surprises being thrown up and the move away from project finance is a big one. So ICICI Bank is one largecap stock I would bet on in the next 12 months. 

In the midcap space as defined by AMFI, I would probably take a bet on the gold finance players Muthoot and Manappuram. These are companies which are delivering between 12% and 18% asset AUM CAGR. The ROA is very strong between 5% and 6% ROA. Stocks are trading close to 2, 2.1 times FY21 price to adjusted book. I would think there is a lot of upside there. 

In the smallcap space, we would bet on Inox Leisure. We think that within the consumer discretionary space, this is a stock which has got fairly low EV/EBITDA multiples -- in the region of 7-8% on FY21 basis. This is a stock which can deliver good returns because it is an oligopoly in the film exhibition space which is in its infancy right now. India has got just about 3,000 odd multiplex screens. China has close to 55,000-60,000 multiplex screens. So, we have got a long way to go from that standpoint. Over the last 24 months, content is being delivered on a consistent basis. 

If that continues, we are going to see very good numbers from Inox Leisure. These are the three stocks in the largecap, midcap and smallcap baskets I would bet on in the next 12 months.


Now that the promoter pledge issues are getting sorted, would you buy something like Zee or any other company where promoter pledge is a challenge?Promoter pledge being a challenge would be an issue if you have a situation where the entity to whom you have pledged, start selling in the market. You could have a technical situation where the stock could be under pressure, but if the business is doing well, which I think is a case in Zee Entertainment, I would probably think that such sell downs from technical reasons, should be opportunities to buy the stock. 

Now the question is who is going to drive the business? We have to see whether operational management is going to be good enough to drive the business going forward. From a 3-5-year view, Zee looks interesting.


The $1.2-billion fund raising almost turned out to be a buy on rumour sell on news kind of story for YES Bank. More importantly, the market seems a little circumspect about this new investor. What is your view?One would be circumspect about anybody with the kind of background that one is discussing about this new investor. I would definitely be circumspect about that. I am not sure whether RBI is going to allow that particular investor to enter the Indian banking system. One should remember that even if that money does come through, there is a substantial amount of write off or provisioning that the company would have to do even going forward with the kind of NPAs that it has on its books. So, there are going to be multiple rounds of fund raising to reach a level which would comfort institutional investors.

So, I would not be in a hurry to get into Yes Bank at this point in time. I would wait and watch whether they can execute this fund raise and what happens after that in terms of what more money can be brought in by the current management into the company. So those who have bought it at sub 30 levels, have had a fairly decent ride to where it is right now. But from here on, it could be a bit of a challenge for the company.

I would not be in a hurry to get into YES Bank at this point in time. I would wait and watch whether they can execute this fund raise.-Girish Pai


Let us work with two assumptions here; a)YES Bank gets capital. If they get capital, markets would say it does not matter who the investor as $1.2 billion comes into the balance sheet.What happens then? b)If they do not get capital, what happens in both the scenarios for the shareholder?If they do not get capital, it is going to go back down to that Rs 30 mark. It is quite possible, it is going to go back there. Survival comes into the picture again and you will probably see single digit kind of prices on that particular company. If it does get capital, then one needs to look at how things are going to pan out from an asset quality situation -- the watch list. YES Bank has got a fairly large watch list, running close to Rs 30,000 crore of loans. What kind of provisioning is going to be done there? How does that get bridged? Also, how much of extra capital is going to come on board even after this first raise?

Those are some things to watch out for. If money does come in the current prices will sustain, maybe it may go up a tad, after than one needs to see what more provisioning they do and how do they actually handle further capital raises from here on. 


The three-day meet of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has begun today. Especially in light of the GDP coming in at a six-year low, do you think the central bank is likely to cut interest rates further this time?Yes, the consensus view is interest rate is going to be cut by at least 25 bps. Whether it is going to do much more than that is something one needs to watch. Had the inflation, especially food inflation not been so high, I would have probably bet on a situation where we could have more than 25 bps, maybe even a 40 bps or even a 50 bps cut because the growth situation warrants that. 

We are probably going to land with a real GDP growth rate of 4.5-5% for the full year. Current official estimate is close to 5% but I think even Q3 numbers are not going to be too great from a GDP standpoint. So the 4.5 to 5% rate is significantly lower. In the last 10 years, we have probably not seen a number that would lead to RBI cutting rates beyond 25 bps, but I would wait to hear what the RBI thinks of inflation. Whether this is just a temporary phase based on food inflation or if it is going to focus more on the core inflation, which has come to almost 3.3%. . If they are going to focus on that, we could see a 35-40 bps cut come through.


Both Lakshmi Vilas Bank and City Union Bank have origins in south India, but while City Union Bank has gone up, Lakshmi Vilas has come down. In the last 52 weeks, the stock has taken a knock of 78%. Karnataka Bank has not given great returns even though the proposition is very attractive in terms of what they own and what they hold. Would you still buy City Union?If you have 12-month plus perspective, this is a good bank to buy into. It will keep compounding at mid teens kind of rate. If that is the kind of rate you are satisfied with, maybe you will get a little bit of price to adjusted book multiple expansion also. 

If you are happy with 15-20% CAGR in terms of returns, then you need to be patient. But retail investors are never patient. They want to make that quick buck in terms of trade. You should trade in YES Bank which goes from Rs 30 to Rs 60, rather than City Union Bank.


A Karnataka Bank, Federal Bank or a Karur Vysaya Bank have not created wealth. Why is City Union so different?We track this stock very actively. We have liked it for a long time. This is one of those unique mid-sized financial plays, which has not seen any kind of material NPA situation. For many decades now, City Union Bank has delivered more than 1.5% ROA through all credit cycles, which tells us something about the credit origination capabilities. It has got a very granular asset book, a very granular liability book, its net interest margins are in the 4% region and it has delivered an ROA of 1.5% plus. These days, it is delivering 1.7-1.8% ROA. 

Most of the stocks that are in the headlines in the financial services side, have to do with some problem or the other. City Union Bank has been delivering pretty good numbers, its cost structure is very good, its cost income ratios are close to 40-41% because it has been able to control its employee cost. 

You would be very surprised to know that the average age of an employee in City Union Bank is just 27 years. You will not come across that in any place. It is a Tamil Nadu focussed bank. It has also benefited from a couple of things; a)some of its regional peers like LVB, KVB and Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank, have gone through serious asset quality issues. City Union has gained market share at those banks’cost. 

Some of the PSU banks focussed on Tamil Nadu like Indian Overseas Bank has been in the PCA framework and has not been able to lend out too much. It has gained market share from both its private peers as well as some of the PSU peers. It is expanding beyond Tamil Nadu and going into other southern states. They are even going outside the southern region. So, it has done a fairly good job. It has been delivering 15% CAGR in assets, very steady net interest margins, good ROA.

It is not the cheapest bank, it is probably going at 2.5 times FY21, if I am not mistaken, price to adjusted book. It is a decent price to adjusted book multiple and it has also been a compounding story. It is a very rare financial services stock which has delivered that because every now and then you have something or the other blowing up."

17,2019-12-06,Zee,"Volatility is likely to persist in domestic equities in view of the expensive valuations of select largecap stocks amid the economic slowdown.

On a year-to-date basis, BSE Sensex has gained 12 per cent till date, while the broader Midcap and Smallcap indices are down 4 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, for the same period.

Valuation wise, the 30-share index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 28.70 times against its five-year average of 22.60 times, indicating overvaluation of stocks at the index level.

 “Valuations of domestic equities are above their long-period averages. Nifty trades at 12-month forward P/E of 19 times, at 5 per cent premium to its long-period average of 18.1 times. Nifty’s P/B at 2.7 times is also above its historical average of 2.6 times,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

But global brokerages are bullish on select blue chips and midcaps. In separate notes to clients, JP Morgan, Nomura, HSBC have either upgraded price targets or maintained ‘buy’ ratings on the five stocks listed below.


Zee Entertainment
Foreign financial firm JPMorgan has maintained a ‘neutral’ rating on Zee Entertainment. However, it hiked the price target to Rs 320 from Rs 260 earlier. It said Zee’s domestic subscription revenue growth is looking healthy. “Improvement in balance sheet, cash flow and success of Zee5 are key for a re-rating of the stock,” JP Morgan said.


Bharti Airtel
HSBC has maintained a ‘buy’ rating on Bharti Airtel with a revised price target of Rs 540 (Rs 510 earlier). The financial services firm believes the equity raising is likely to create a near-term share sale overhang on the stock. “Fundraising bodes well for its balance sheet in the medium term. Expect regulatory clarity to emerge on multiple issues over the next few weeks,” HSBC said.


Reliance Industries
Japanese brokerage firm Nomura maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the oil-to-telecom behemoth with a price target of Rs 2,020 (Rs 1,785 earlier). It believes Jio’s sharp tariff increase further improves the outlook. “More tariff hikes look likely. Jio tariffs are still at a discount to peers and market share gain will likely sustain,” Nomura said.


Tech Mahindra
Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘buy’ rating on IT major Tech Mahindra with a price target of Rs 890. The global firm believes the telecom vertical can see sharp growth revival in FY21E/22E.


ICICI Bank
Macquarie maintained an ‘outperform’ call on the private sector lender ICICI Bank with a price target of Rs 615. It said the management is focusing on pre-provision operating profit. “Both retail and corporate asset quality looks fine,” it said, adding that ICICI Bank is its top pick from the banking sector.

21,2019-12-09,Zee,"Zee provides a unique investment opportunity for the investors as there are no other leading media players listed. Also the recent share price correction, triggered by promoter woes, and the resultant fall in valuations has made the company a favourite of analysts.

Investors used to consider Zee Entertainment Enterprises as a low risk high reward opportunity because of its strong business model and balance sheet. Zee always used to report better than industry advertising growth rates and increased subscriptions. In addition to its strong presence in the Hindi entertainment space, Zee also invests heavily in regional language space and this should make Zee a pan-India player. Due to increasing market share, Zee was also able to report 16% annualised advertisement revenue growth during the past five years.

However, the decision of the promoters to raise money using Zee shares for their other projects has shattered this belief and dragged this counter to low levels. With the promoters selling their stake to repay personal debt, a big overhang over the counter has been removed now. This means the investor focus will now shift to its business fundamentals and balance sheet.


Analysts’ views
Sell 3
Hold 10
Buy 16

The media industry is going through cut-throat competition now and Zee is responding to it with increased investments. There was pressure on its working capital and its working capital days in first half of 2019-20 was 204 compared to 152 during the first half of 2018-19. Zee’s continued investment in new regional channels and its over the top (OTT) platform Zee5 is the main reason for this. Since these investments (for acquiring new movie rights etc.) are needed short term, this pressure on cash flow from operations will continue for some more time. However, analysts are hopeful that these pressures will be over soon and Zee will be able to return to positive free cash flows during 2020-21.

Recent share price correction, triggered by the promoter woes, and the resultant fall in valuation is another reason attracting analysts to this counter. Zee also provides unique investment opportunity because other leading players from the media space are unlisted. However, investors entering this counter now should also know the possible risk involved. The biggest risk in Zee now is the uncertainty about upcoming management structure, because Subhash Chandra has resigned from the post of chairman, though he will continue to be a non-executive board member. However, the current CEO Punit Goenka is working efficiently and is well entrenched from 2008, he is also from the promoters’ family. It means that the investors should keep a close watch on management changes in Zee.

Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (ie 5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks with at least 10 analysts covering it.

34,2019-12-11,Zee,"MUMBAI: Bharti Airtel, promoters of Dish TV and private equity firm Warburg Pincus have agreed to merge direct-to-home operations of Airtel and Dish after months of negotiations, a move that will create the world’s largest TV distribution company, two people with direct knowledge of the development said.

The three parties are agreed on deal structure, wherein the DTH business of Dish TV India will be hived off and merged in Bharti Telemedia, which houses Airtel Digital TV, they said.

They did not disclose likely financial details or shareholding pattern after the merger. “The final scheme of arrangement and other details are being worked on,” said one person cited earlier.

Warburg Pincus, which picked up 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia for $350 million in December 2017, is expected to remain invested in the company post merger, the person said.

Another person said Bharti Telemedia will be subsequently listed on the stock exchanges. “The deal has been in the making for a long time,” the person said. “They had almost reached an agreement by September, but then the Supreme Court verdict came, halting everything else. Now the talks have picked up again.”

The top court had on October 24 ordered mobile operators to pay over Rs 92,000 crore to the telecom department in penalties in a 14-yearlong case, putting pressure on the financials of Bharti Airtel that may have to pay more than Rs 21,000 crore.

Dish TV India, a listed company, will continue to offer non-DTH services including Dish Infra Services (infra support business) and own 51% in C&S Medianet, its distribution consultancy joint venture with cable TV service provider Siti Networks, sources said. Company promoters own 55.27% stake in Dish TV.

Email queries sent to Bharti Airtel and Warburg Pincus did not elicit any response till press time Tuesday. A Dish TV spokesperson said, “The company does not comment on any market speculations.”

ET was the first to report on March 18 that Bharti chairman Sunil Mittal had initiated talks with the Essel Group promoters to merge their DTH operations. The move had come after Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio took a controlling stake in two of the country’s largest multisystem operators – DEN Networks and Hathway Cable & Datacom.

Rohit Dokania, senior VP – research at IDFC Securities, said, “While final contours of the deal needs to be understood, a merger will help the promoters sort out debt and other issues. It will also be good for Zee Entertainment as most likely the receivables issue from group entities (i.e. Dish TV) will be resolved.” A merger may also ease off the pressure of ARPU (average revenue per user) on the DTH industry as there will only be two national players and one regional player, he said.




ECONOMIES OF SCALE
Together, Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV will create the world’s largest TV distribution company with just over 40 million subscribers and over 62% share of India’s DTH market. It will be followed by Tata Sky with about 25% market share and regional DTH player Sun Direct.

In the quarter ended September, Dish TV had 23.94 million subscribers with operating revenue at ?893.2 crore and operating profit of Rs 520.5 crore.

Airtel Digital TV had 16.21 million subscribers, and its revenue from the DTH business stood at ?789.3 crore with Ebitda of Rs 560.7 crore during the quarter.

India had six DTH players at one point of time. While Dish TV took over Videocon d2h in March last year, Reliance Digital TV changed hands and turned free-to-air.

Post stake sale to Warburg Pincus, Airtel’s DTH business was valued at Rs 11,300 crore, while Dish TV’s market cap as on December 10 was down at Rs 2,401 crore."

45,2019-12-15,Zee,"MUMBAI: After selling 205 megawatt (MW) of its operational solar energy portfolio to the Adani Group, the Essel Group has reached an agreement to sell the remaining 480 MW — currently under construction — to Adani Green Energy, two people with direct knowledge of the development said.

The Adani Group has agreed in principle to buy out the remaining portfolio, one of the people said.

“Adani Green is big on renewable power and has over 5.5 GW of portfolio with almost half of it already operational. After acquiring Essel Group’s solar assets in Punjab, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, they have agreed to buy the remaining assets too, once Essel Group operationalises them,” he added.

Adani Group did not respond to an email till press time on Sunday. A spokesperson for Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel Group said it was exploring various proposals from prospective partners. “Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements,” the spokesperson said.

Adani Group had signed an agreement in August this year to acquire the 205 MW of operational solar assets for Rs 1,300 crore. Essel Group’s total solar energy portfolio consists of 685 MW of installed and under-construction projects. At the time of deal, Essel Group said it was also in talks to sell the remaining assets.

The sale of solar energy assets was part of Essel Group promoters’ overall divestment process to reduce debt and repay lenders.

A significant portion of the promoters’ debt has already been paid after they sold 26.7% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises to institutional investors. The group is also selling non-media assets to square off debt within those companies.

ET had reported earlier that Essel Group promoters were in talks to sell six of 14 road projects to National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), including four operational and two under-construction toll roads. The deal has, however, not been finalised yet."

55,2019-12-20,Zee,"This is a difficult time and we are hoping that next year, we will see double digit growth coming back, says Punit Misra, CEO, Domestic Broadcast Business, Zee Entertainment. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Domestic subscription revenue has been healthy on account of new tariff order (NTO) tailwind and rising viewership in regional markets. Walk us through the outlook on the domestic subscription revenue.Thanks to the current economic environment, there was a dampening of the growth momentum in the overall TV advertising market over the last several years. In that sense, it is a difficult market for ad revenue. But given the fundamental nature of the opportunity in the country, we stay bullish and we see good growth coming back sooner than later. But yes, this is a difficult time and we are hoping that next year, we will see double digit growth coming back.


Domestic advertising has remained muted in the wake of advertising slowdown and largely because of withdrawal from the FTA platform. Are you worried about your ad revenue?We are cautiously optimistic that given the fundamentals of the market and the economy in the medium to long term, growth will come back. It may take a quarter here or there but we certainly are going ahead with our plans with the belief that market growth will be there and consumption driven growth will take place. It may take a quarter or two longer, but our plans and the investments that we are making are continuing with that assumption.


Take us through the outlook on regional channel growth. Traditionally there has always been a steady revenue stream for you, what kind of growth can we see here? What are the new channel launches?Our overall network has had almost 80% of our business. Contribution to viewership has grown in the last year and in the last three years, almost 70% of our share gains have come out of our regional channels. We would prefer not to call them regional channels. We think of them as viewers of different cultures who we are serving content to. 

We are seeing each of these markets contributing quite significantly to our overall growth. That is something which we are certainly seeing a lot of traction in and that is the reason why today as we talk of four new launches, we are talking of a Punjabi GEC which we are launching. This would be the first full play GEC in the Punjab market. 

We are launching three movie channels – one in Bhojpuri, one in Tamil and one in Kannada -- Zee Bioskop in Bhojpuri, Zee Picchar in Kannada and Zee Thirai in Tamil. We are going ahead with that belief that we have to serve all consumers across as many Bharats and make sure that we get a good share in each of these opportunities.


In light of the OTT ramp up and higher overall content spending, what is the range of margins that you expect? Will it remain around 33% or do you see them contracting further?That is a conversation we keep having in our quarterly results conversation where we have consistently maintained that we will deliver the 30% plus kind of EBITDA while investing in all the growth opportunities from OTT to in the broadcast side. All the channels that we are launching stay committed to delivering that kind of a number.


There are no confirmations but there is some buzz of a GEC channel and a possible JV with broadcasting majors. Are you worried about competition in light of this and what is your view on market share currently?We have realised one thing that the more the competition, the better it is because we find that the more aggressively markets are invested in to grow, the better it is for the business. In fact, we have seen that as more competition comes in any market, the market itself keeps growing and then it is up to us as players in the market to gain more share out of that pie. 


 What is your outlook on the revenue growth in light of the broad-based economic slowdown that one is witnessing?We have declared our first half numbers over the two quarters and what used to be a very strong double digit growth in advertising, has come down and in that sense, there is a dampening. 

The overall market used to be anywhere between 10-12%. We are going to see a very low single digit kind of growth in the market. The way we look at it, we would still be adding revenue share and growing ahead of the market. But yes, the market growth which was 10-12% will be low single digits on television this year."

56,2019-12-20,Zee,"MUMBAI: Expanding its linear TV portfolio, Indian entertainment company Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) is launching four new regional channels. The move is in line with its strategy to go deeper and serve the many ‘Bharats’ within the country.

The four new channels include – Punjabi general entertainment channel Zee Punjabi and three movie channels - Zee Biskope (Bhojpuri), Zee Thirai (Tamil) and Zee Picchar (Kannada).

Talking about the reason to launch regional channels, Punit Misra, CEO - Domestic Broadcast Business, ZEE stated that while the company has a reach of over 800 million people across India, almost 650 million is through non-Hindi offerings.

“We have always believed that deep understanding of cultures across the many Bharats, and then serving people entertainment rooted in each culture is what wins hearts, be it through original shows, or through curation of content like movies,” Misra said.

“From a highly TV penetrated but hugely under consumed latent Punjabi GEC opportunity to insatiable, thriving demand for movies in the Bhojpuri, Tamil and Kannada markets, the regional need gaps present the perfect opening to further deepen these bonds,” said Prathyusha Agarwal, Chief Marketing Officer, ZEE.

Zee Punjabi will have over 20 hours of original weekly content. Epic story of ‘Heer Ranjha’ will lead the fiction offerings. The channel will also have comedy, drama and biggest singing reality show of Punjab – ‘Sa Re Ga Ma Pa’ with Gurdas Maan as mentor and Jazzy B, Sonu Kakkar and Jaidev Kumar as judges.

Zee Thirai, meanwhile, will offer viewers a library of 400+ titles from Tamil cinema including a wide spectrum of genres from blockbuster hits to critically acclaimed movies which include ‘Mersal’, ‘2.0’, ‘Kanna’ and more. The channel will premiere one film every week of the year with 52 premieres in 52 weeks. There will also be ‘break less’ movies in the afternoon slot. The look of the channel will be unveiled at the Zee Cine Awards Tamil in January 2020.

Similarly, Kannada movie channel Zee Picchar will have a library of 350+ titles spanning across genres and generations from timeless classics to new age trendsetters. The channel will launch with 12 premieres to be aired on 12 consecutive days.

Zee Biskope, the Bhojpuri movie channel, also has a library of 300+ movies with the biggest blockbuster movies of the last five years and the biggest hits of the top 3 superstars of Bhojiwood – Nirahua, Pawan and Khesari.

ZEE already offers regional content in eight regional languages - Marathi, Bengali, Oriya, and Bhojpuri in the Hindi speaking markets and all four southern languages. Its overall portfolio include 42 SD and HD channels across various entertainment genres."

65,2019-12-23,Zee,"MUMBAI: Three large cable operators in Tamil Nadu – the state-owned Arasu Cable, Kalanithi Maran-owned SCV, and VK Digital – are at loggerheads with Zee Entertainment Enterprises over channel discounts.

As per multiple local cable operators (LCOs) in Tamil Nadu, Arasu Cable and SCN have switched off ZEE’s channels from their platform, while VK Digital has removed Zee Tamil from the base pack and changed its placement on its service.

The issue, operators say, is related to dispute over discounts. The timing is crucial as ZEE is launching a Tamil movie channel, Zee Thirai, in the market.

“The whole dispute is because these multi-system-operators (MSOs, the term used for large cable operators) are trying to extort more discounts from ZEE,” said a LCO, who works with SCV.

Hinting at a possible cartelisation among MSOs, he added that already ZEE provides 35% discount on the pack as permissable under the new tariff order. “There is 20% discount on MRP and another 15% discount given by the broadcaster on the basis of fulfiling certain placement and marketing requirements. Effectively, these MSOs get Zee Prime Tamil pack for Rs 6.5, while the MRP of the pack is Rs 10 per month,” he added.

Another LCO who services to close to 300 household in Chennai, said that the consumers are asking for the channel, which is removed by the MSO. “We have told consumers to either wait for the issue between the MSO and broadcaster to resoulve, or take the channels on an a-la-carte basis. Many have started doing it,” he said, not wanting to be named.

As per BARC India viewership data for week 50 (December 7th-13th) of 2019, ZEE’s flagship channel in the market, Zee Tamil is second most watched channel in Tamil Nadu, after Sun TV.

As per TRAI, as on April 1st, 2019, Arasu Cable, SCV and VK Digital had a total of 5.52 million active subscribers.

It is important to note that Sun TV Network owner Kalanithi Maran also owns Kal Cable, which runs SCV. When contacted, Vittal Sampathkumaran, CEO and MD of Kal Cable, refused to comment on the issue.

Arasu Cable and VK Digital could not be reached till press time Sunday as calls made to the boardlines remained unanswered.

ZEE issued a statement on Sunday, clarifying that all of its television channels in Tamil Nadu are fully operational across leading cable and DTH operators, including Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation, SCV and VK Digital.

“There has been no change in the consumer price (MRP) of the individual channels or channel packs whatsoever. Zee Prime Tamil SD pack, competitively priced at Rs 10 only, is the best value pack in Tamil Nadu market, when compared to other similar bouquets available in the same market,” ZEE said.

ZEE also said that it has received several complaints and requests through emails and social media platforms, wherein the consumers have mentioned that their cable operators have removed the ZEE bouquet from their channel packs, without any communication or reason."

91,2019-12-30,Zee,"1. Blue-chip companies face corporate governance issues
Traditionally, corporate governance lapses have been uncovered at small and mid-cap companies. However, with increased shareholder activism, tighter disclosure regime and elaborate compliance, even blue-chip companies and industry leaders have now been discovered to have governance issues. In an unprecedented trend, industry leading companies such as Sun Pharma, Yes Bank, IndiGo Airlines, Zee Entertainment, and Indiabulls Housing Finance have faced allegations of corporate governance lapses this year. A little over half the companies in the Nifty 50 index received a cumulative 4,552 whistle-blower complaints in FY19 — 30 per cent higher than the previous year.




2. Record number of Independent directors and auditors exit companies before end of terms
A fallout of a spate of corporate governance scandals in 2019 has been a record number of mid-term cessations of auditors and independent directors. The number of exits of independent directors from boards of Indian companies increased 54 per cent year on year in calendar 2019, as per data from nseinfobase.com. Also, 58 auditors stepped down mid-term in 2019, a tad higher than the number in 2018. Market regulator Sebi has taken actions against auditors for faulty audits and made qualifying examination mandatory for being an independent director.


3. Related-party transactions and siphoning of funds new eyesores
Related party transactions and siphoning of funds from the business have been the emergent issues in corporate governance of India Inc in 2019, moving beyond board governance and executive compensation that dominated the discussions earlier. From Sun Pharma to Indigo Airlines to Apollo Hospitals, some of the leading companies faced scrutiny for their related-party transactions. Illegal fund mobilisation in violation of Companies Act topped the list of the nature of violations in the prosecution launched by Sebi as revealed in the regulator’s latest annual report. As many as 47 out of the total 65 violations mentioned were pertaining to illegal fund mobilisation.


4. Increased action by regulatory bodies
Sebi initiated a record 309 enquiry proceedings in FY19 as against just 16 in the previous year. The market regulator also launched 65 prosecution cases against 399 persons/entities in the year, against 56 prosecutions launched against 407 persons/entities in FY18. Sebi also received a record 419 applications for settlement of cases in FY19 – 75 per cent jump over the previous year’s 241 applications. At Rs 46 crore, the amount collected towards cumulative charges was nearly 50 per cent higher than the Rs 31 crore collected in FY18.

The corporate affairs ministry has struck off 3,38,963 companies from official records in the past two financial years for failing to submit annual returns. As of end of November 2019, the ministry had deactivated 19,40,313 director identification numbers in the official database due to non-filing of KYC details. The move is to clean the system of shell companies and ghost directors.

5. Emergence of ESG funds in India
What began in 2018 picked up as a trend in 2019. With ESG (environmental, social, and governance) compliance becoming an increasingly important risk area, asset management companies have been launching ESG-themed funds to filter good quality stocks for their investors. Bombay Stock Exchange and NSE had launched their ESG-themed indices in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Kotak Mutual Fund was the first in 2018 to sign the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Four more investment management firms from India became signatories to PRI. SBI Magnum Equity Fund turned into SBI Magnum Equity ESG Fund. In 2019, many mutual fund houses forayed into the ESG segment. Some filed draft documents with Sebi to launch ESC schemes. The alternate asset management arm of Avendus Capital launched India’s first ESG-based fund. Three former Tata group executives came together with asset manager Quantum Advisors to launch a $1-billion ESG fund."

For many Indian tycoons, 2019 turned woeful as lenders -- empowered by the nation’s recent bankruptcy law and desperate to clean up soured debt from their books -- started seizing assets of delinquent firms or dragged them into insolvency.

Indian banks wrote off a record $39 billion of loans in the 18 months through September in a bid to repair their balance sheets as they battled the world’s worst bad debt pile. Making matters worse, a shadow banking crisis led to a funding squeeze, crushing debt-laden businesses that were critically dependent on rollover financing.

“Life has come a full circle for tycoons that had enjoyed debt-fueled growth,” said Nirmal Gangwal, founder of distress and debt restructuring advisory firm Brescon & Allied Partners LLP. “Many firms collapsed like a house of cards. The downfall was rather unprecedented.”

The government has also been cracking down on economic crime to assuage public anger over absconding businessmen. It’s even barred some from traveling overseas if they were deemed a flight risk.

Here are some of the country’s biggest and most-storied businessmen who saw their fortunes fade. Spokespersons for these tycoons didn’t immediately reply to emails and text messages seeking comments.


Anil Ambani
The chairman of Reliance Group, which makes movies to metro lines, had a close shave with jail time in March before his elder brother and Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, bailed him out at the last minute. The woes of the ex-billionaire came to the fore when India’s top court asked him to pay Ericsson AB’s India unit about $77 million of past dues or go to jail since Anil Ambani, 60, had given a personal guarantee. His telecom carrier slipped into insolvency this year, while unprofitable Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd. faced a cash crunch. Reliance Capital Ltd. is selling assets to pare debt. Ambani is also fending off Chinese lenders in a London court.


Malvinder & Shivinder Singh
Karma caught up with ex-billionaires and brothers Malvinder Singh, 47, and Shivinder Singh, 44, and how. Scions of a prominent business family, they once helmed India’s top drug maker and second-largest hospital chain. In October, the two were arrested on charges of fraudulently diverting nearly $337 million from a lender they controlled. India’s market regulator found in 2018 that the brothers had defrauded their hospital company of about $56 million. The collapse of the $2 billion empire turned brother against brother, prompting their mother to broker a peace deal that was short-lived. In February, Malvinder accused Shivinder and their spiritual guru of fraud.


Shashikant & Ravikant Ruia
After a hard-fought battle to keep their flagship steel mill, the first-generation entrepreneurs finally saw the bankrupt Essar Steel India Ltd. pass on to ArcelorMittal last month. The $5.9 billion takeover was almost two years in the making with multiple legal wrangles. The group, controlled by Shashikant Ruia, 76, and Ravikant Ruia, 70, were also reprimanded by a U.K. judge in March this year for concealing documents. Started in 1969 as a construction firm, Essar Group diversified, investing about $18 billion between 2008 and 2012, and piled on debt. In 2017, the group had sold another prized asset, Essar Oil.

V.G. Siddhartha
Before jumping off a bridge into a river in July in an apparent suicide, the founder of India’s biggest coffee chain Cafe Coffee Day had penned a letter that spoke of pressure from lenders, a private equity firm and harassment by tax officials. He had spent much of the last two years pledging ever more of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd. shares to refinance loans for ever shorter periods, at ever higher interest rates. “I would like to say I gave it my all,” V.G. Siddhartha, 60, wrote in the letter. “I fought for a long time but today I gave up.”


Naresh Goyal
The former ticketing agent who built India’s largest airline by value, stepped down as chairman of Jet Airways India Ltd. in March, caving in to pressure from banks who took over the company. Cut-throat price wars and surging costs pushed Jet deeper into loss. The airline stopped flying in April and went into bankruptcy two months later as lenders failed to find a buyer. In July, an Indian court barred Naresh Goyal from flying overseas after the government said it was investigating an alleged $2.6 billion fraud involving Jet Airways.


Rana Kapoor
The founder of Yes Bank Ltd., which became India’s fourth-largest non-state lender, tweeted in September 2018 that his shares were invaluable and requested his children never to sell them upon inheritance. But trouble was brewing. The nation’s banking regulator, which found the lender had repeatedly under-reported its bad loans, refused to extend his tenure as chief executive officer. This forced Rana Kapoor, 62, to step down by end-January. Kapoor, who has pledged some of his Yes Bank shares in July, sold almost his entire stake in the lender by October.


Subhash Chandra
The rice trader-turned-media mogul, 69, who brought cable television into Indian homes in the early 1990s with his ZEE TV, resigned as chairman of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. in November and lost control of his crown jewel. To help pay the debt of Essel Group, Subhash Chandra has been selling stake in Zee Entertainment in the past few months to repay group’s debt.


Gautam Thapar
A default by Gautam Thapar, founder of the paper mill-to-power transmission Avantha Group, on pledged shares made Yes Bank Ltd. the biggest shareholder in CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd. In August, the firm was hit by an accounting scandal forcing the board to remove Thapar, 59, from the chairman’s post. A month later, the market regulator ordered a forensic audit of the firm and barred Thapar from accessing securities market.
