0,2018-01-01,PowerGrid,"Indian equity market had a turbulent start to the New Year as the benchmark Nifty50 remained range bound throughout the day, but saw a sharp decline in the last hour of the trade. The Index ended the day losing 95.15 points or 0.90 per cent.

Though there is no technical breakdown on the charts, the Monday's session remain technically important and it has certainly pushed the Nifty into some more time under consolidation.

On Tuesday, we see the market making a quiet opening. We may see some lower volumes as well as the participation in the market will remain affected due New Year holidays.


 

The levels of 10,465 and 10,510 will play out as important resistance levels to watch out for on Tuesday. Supports come in lower at 10,380 and 10,345.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 55.2808 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD continues to stay bullish remaining in continuing buy mode.

An engulfing bearish candle has emerged. It remains significant as it has occurred at the resistance zone of 10,490-10,535 and therefore it reinforces the credibility of this resistance area. The pattern analysis reveals the importance of the 10,490-10,535 support zones.

The market has once again failed to confirm the attempted breakout twice from these levels. This zone will continue to act as immediate short term resistance for the market. Failing to clear the 10,490-10,535 zones for the second time has shown the credibility of this resistance area. Failure to clear the 10,490-10,535 zones has made some more consolidation imminent in the market.

There is no structural breach on the charts, but these levels will continue to resist until we see a comprehensive breakout above this resistance area. Going into trade on Tuesday, selection of stocks will hold the key. We recommend avoiding shorts and trimming exposures with any potential upmove and protecting profits. 
Due to New Year holiday season, the volumes will remain affected and this may also infuse some lack of depth and volatility in the market. Cautious outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Very high open interest is seen in counters like JP Associates, IDFC Bank, Suzlon, Adani Power, Sail, RCom, ITC, Tata Power and Federal Bank. Longs were seen added in Reliance Power, Bank Of Baroda, HCC, Power Grid, Karnataka Bank, CG Power and BHEL.

9,2018-01-08,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: The aggregate net profit of the Nifty 50 companies is expected to grow in double digits for the second consecutive quarter following festive demand and low base effect in case of some companies due to the demonetisation impact during the year-ago quarter.

According to ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, net profit of the sample will grow 13.1 per cent and net sales by 8.2 per cent year-on-year. The growth momentum is likely to continue from the previous quarter when net profit and net sales had increased by 14.5 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively.

“The Q3FY18 performance is likely to indicate an improvement in earnings momentum, with earnings set to clock double-digit growth,” mentioned Edelweiss Securities in a report. It expects 12 per cent earnings growth for the Nifty 50 companies.

The operating margin of the sample is also likely to remain above 20 per cent for the second quarter in a row. According to ETIG estimates, the sample’s margin will be 20.7 per cent in the December 2017 quarter compared with 19.2 per cent in the year-ago quarter.

Commodity companies, including metals and petroleum producers and refiners, consumer durables and nondurables, automobiles, select private sector banks and finance companies, and power utilities are expected to report stellar numbers for the third quarter.

On the other hand, public sector banks, pharmaceuticals, software services, real estate, and telecom companies are likely to report weakness.

“We expect double-digit growth in net income of automobiles, cement, consumer products, energy, industrials, metals & mining and NBFCs sectors. We model year-onyear decline in the net income of PSU banks, pharmaceuticals and telecom sectors,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report. It expects the Nifty 50 sample to report 15.4 per cent earnings growth for the December quarter.

The earnings momentum is expected to continue in the fourth quarter of the fiscal as well considering the persistence of low base effect and historically strong sales volume during the quarter.




December quarter: Sector expectations

AUTOMOBILESThe favourable base effect and normalisation of the channel inventory is likely to support the earnings of auto companies in the December quarter. Their revenue is expected to grow by 10-18 per cent. However, the operating profit may be impacted by higher commodities prices. Mahindra & Mahindra, India’s largest tractor maker, is likely to post higher earnings growth among all the auto makers thanks to a 16 per cent volume growth in the high- margin tractor segment and improvement in profitability in both automotive and tractor businesses. Tata Motors may see significant increase in profit on lower foreign exchange loss.


BANKING AND FINANCEBanks with significant corporate exposure may continue to report pressure due to higher credit costs. In addition, though loan offtake by industries was higher, rising interest rates may squeeze net interest margins. Among finance companies, the housing and automobiles segments will show stellar performance on higher demand for credit.


CAPITAL GOODSPublic sector capital expenditure (capex) will continue to provide momentum amid subdued private sector spending. Companies including BHEL and PGCIL reported large government orders during the December quarter. For L&T, it is expected to be a muted quarter.


CEMENTAll-India cement prices fell by 2 per cent sequentially to Rs326 per 50-kg bag in the December quarter. In comparison with the last year’s December quarter, cement prices have moved up by just over 5 per cent to Rs326 per 50-kg bag. On the other hand, prices of sand, a major raw material, rose by four-five times year-on-year due to lesser availability. Also, construction activities in real estate were subdued. Given this, cement companies would be unable to record any meaningful improvement in realisations. The low-cost housing segment may however support volume growth to some extent. As a result, large and pan-India cement companies are expected to clock 9-12 per cent revenue growth in the December quarter.


FMCG
The low base effect of the previous year due to demonetisation and GST benefits to organised players will help FMCG companies post high single-digit and in some cases double-digit sales growth for the December quarter. Moderation in raw material prices, especially agriculture related raw materials, will help strong margin expansion.


INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYThe December quarter has been historically weak for Indian IT exporters given holidays and the beginning of fresh capex cycle for the US clients. Top IT companies are expected to report 1-2.5 per cent sequential revenue growth in dollar terms. The performance in the quarter will be crucial in determining whether the companies will be able to outdo the previous year’s lackluster growth at the end of the current fiscal in March.


METALS & MININGMetals and mining companies will continue their growth momentum in the December quarter. The ferrous companies such as Tata Steel will benefit from higher product prices. Non- ferrous companies such as Hindalco, Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc will benefit from the higher LME prices amidst relatively benign raw material prices. The companies will see dual benefit: one, from seasonally strong quarter; and second, from firm prices thus leading to higher profitability.


PHARMAThe December quarter was an action-packed quarter for pharma with USFDA giving the highest ever approvals (246) in a single quarter. Although this will help benefit Indian pharma companies, it may also lead to higher competition and pricing pressure. Considering steep competition and stronger rupee against major currencies, the growth in pharma revenue from overseas market will be under pressure.


POWERIn the December quarter, all-India power generation rose by 4.2 per cent YoY. All-India thermal plant capacity utilisation also improved marginally to 59.8 per cent. Initial signs of pickup in power demand are apparent, led by improving traction in industrial activity. This should help power companies such as NTPC and Power Grid post good numbers.


TELECOMCompetitive pressure and reduction in interconnect charges will affect the performance of the listed telecom players. The user parameters such as average revenue per minute and per user will remain under pressure."

16,2018-01-09,PowerGrid,"After two days of breaking out above the 10,490-mark, the Indian equity market took a breather and consolidated on Tuesday. The benchmark Nifty50 ended with a negligible gain of 13.40 points or 0.13 per cent. However, it continued to pile up open interest.

Though we expect a quiet opening on Wednesday, we expect that despite some consolidation, we will ultimately see the Index inching higher after some rangebound movement, if any.

The buoyant intent is further support by inter-market analysis of the Hong Kong market, with which our market remains very strongly co-related. Hang Seng Index has went on to scale further lifetime highs.

Wednesday will see the levels of 10,655 and 10,710 working out as resistance area for the market. Supports came in at 10,590 and 10,545 levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily charts is 67.5491 and it has marked its fresh 14-period high, which is bullish. The daily MACD stays bullish, while trading above its signal line. No major formations were observed on the candles.

The pattern analysis reveals the Nifty is taking some breather after two days of breaking out. This consolidation may last, but overall under current continue to remain buoyant.

After two days of upmove, it will be no surprise if the market sees a rangebound consolidation or movement in a defined range.

However, at no point, it shows any sign of a major corrective move. In most likelihood, we may see the market consolidating for a while and then resuming its upmove.

We continue to recommend making selective profits with each consolidation that occurs. Overall, continuation of positive outlook is advised for the day.

18,2018-01-11,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Tuesday was special. This day 10 years ago, BSE Sensex hit the 21,000 mark for the first time on January 8, 2008, sending Dalal Street investors into wild jubilation.

Ten years thence, we are into a similar party mood, as the BSE barometer tests the 34,500 level, a lifetime high for the index.

In terms of market capitalisation (m-cap), the BSE universe expanded nearly three times in last 10 years, as did the number of Titans on Dalal Street. A total of 29 BSE-listed stocks now enjoy a market capitalisation of over Rs 1,00,000 crore each compared with 15 at the end of 2007. 

While familiar names like Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, PowerGrid and BPCL have made it to the Rs 1 lakh crore m-cap club, several firms that were top dogs in their respective industries back in 2007 have since fallen out of this Club Elite.

Among them are DLF from real estate, BHEL from engineering and construction, SAIL for steel and Reliance Communication from the telecom sector. Broadly, capital-intensive stocks took a back seat as consumer-oriented sectors took charge.

Among the top five companies in terms of market-cap, Reliance Industries remains numero uno, thanks to gains seen on the counter after the launch of its telecom venture Reliance Jio. TCS, the second most valued company, saw its m-cap swell five times to Rs 5.16 lakh crore. It was the 14th largest company 10 years back.

Five other companies that were not even part of the Rs 1 lakh crore m-cap club 2007 have since swelled in size and gone far beyond that benchmark. The HDFC duo and consumer-focused companies ITC, Hindustan Unilever and Maruti Suzuki today command market-caps in the Rs 2.7-3.20 lakh crore range.

ONGC, the second most valued company in calendar 2007 with Rs 2.5 lakh crore, is ninth largest today with a similar m-cap. NTPC, the third largest way back in 2007, is 17th largest today, while 2007’s fourth largest Bharti Airtel is 11th largest today.

DLF, the fifth largest back in 2007, has lost half its market value in these 10 years. NMDC has lost 73 per cent, BHEL almost 70 per cent and SAIL 65 per cent.

The biggest fall took place on the RCom counter. The seventh largest company by m-cap back then is not even a largecap stock today, as its market-cap shrank to Rs 9,153 crore. The stock has fallen 95 per cent in last 10 years."

However, Dalal Street lost its bullish momentum on Friday afternoon after four judges from India's apex court raised question over the administration of the Supreme Court.

ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Reliance Industries emerged as the top gainers. 

Shares of Reliance Industries gained after reports floated that the company's telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm was planning to create its own cyptocurrency, JioCoin. 

On the other hand, telecom stocks such as Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel and MTNL figured among the top losers of the day.

Telecom stocks developed cold feet over concern of reduction of international termination rate (ITR) - a charge paid by international operators to local networks that receive calls. The telecom regulator may reduce ITR by almost half from the current 53 paise a minute, a move that would deal a body blow to India's top telcos, including Bharti Airtel which receive a bulk of international calls.

24,2018-01-16,PowerGrid,"Northeast India will witness investment close to Rs 15,000 crore for improving the telecom connectivity in eight states of Northeast India. India’s frontier state Arunachal Pradesh which shares border with China will get over 2817 mobile towers.

Union Minister of State for Communications, Manoj Sinha who was in Guwahati on Tuesday to participate in a conference to review the implementation of BharatNet and other major telecom projects in the North Eastern Region said that last year Cabinet approved a modified strategy to implement the Phase-II through state-led and private sector models. The conference was attended by Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu.

He said that given the strategic importance of the north-east, as well as the fact that there are a number of areas which are in remote and hilly locations with poor connectivity, Telecom Commission in its meeting this month has approved a comprehensive strategy to implement BharatNet in North East Region (NER). “Under this strategy 4240 Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the North-East are to be connected by broadband by satellite connectivity by December 2018. The estimated cost of the satellite connectivity to 4240 GPs is Rs 733 crore.”

Sinha also explained that under Comprehensive Telecom Development Project for Northeast eastern region, 6673 towers are to be setup to provide connectivity to 8621 villages and along the National Highway, at a cost of Rs 5336 Crore.

The minister detailed MOU was signed between BSNL and Universal Service Obligation Fund (USO) to setup up 2817 mobile towers by BSNL in Arunachal Pradesh and two districts of Assam while the work of setting up of 2004 towers in six states has been initiated by Bharti Airtel in December, 2017, which is to be completed in 18 months.

Sinha added that the government has achieved a significant milestone under BharatNet by connecting over one lakh GPs across the country with high speed optical fibre . 

In the eight states of Northeast India there are 12017 GPs, out of these 7338 GPs were taken up in Phase I and it is only 2240 GPs that are Service Ready. The progress of the BharatNet project has been slow in Region due to capacity of agencies implementing the project, various developmental activities like expansion of National Highways by National highway authority of India, hilly terrain, remote & inaccessible areas, and law and order related issues.

Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary Department Of Telecommunications (DOT) informed that the total planned cost of all the USOF projects is Rs. 10,749 crore for Northeast states which is about 1/8th of the total investment planned by the DOT , which is likely to be enhanced to Rs.15000 Crore for North-eastern region soon.

She informed the plan for 100 percent teledensity by 2020, expansion of mobile connectivity – erection of 6994 mobile towers by June 2019, last mile connectivity through BharatNet in all the GPs by December 2018 including Satellite Connectivity in the difficult and inaccessible GPs, Network for Spectrum (NFS)project for providing Optical fibre connectivity for the defence forces in the border areas and Wi-Fi project to provide internet connectivity to the general rural public by December 2018.

Sinha dedicated the Asthamangal Project implemented by BSNL. Under this project, alternate bandwidth of 810 gigabytes per second (Gbps) at a cost of about Rs 35 crore has been provided by BSNL using reliable connectivity through Optical Power Ground Wire (OPGW) of Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) for all state headquarters and other important locations of Northeast Region."

""Telecom connectivity is a big problem in North East. The Central government had identified various solutions, but due to various reasons these could not be completed. Now, the Department of Telecom has initiated projects worth Rs 10,700 crore to complete these by December 2018,"" Sinha said at a press conference here.

This amount, which is about 1/8th of the total investment planned by the DoT, is likely to be enhanced to Rs 15,000 crore for North East, the minister said.

""As part of the initiatives, we are rolling out a Comprehensive Telecom Development Project at an estimated cost of Rs 5,336.31 crore,"" he said.

""In 8,621 villages and along the national highway in the North East, 6,673 mobile towers will be set up to provide connectivity and an MoU was signed between BSNL and USO Fund for this purpose,"" Sinha said.

Out of these, 2,817 mobile towers will be set up by BSNL in Arunachal Pradesh and two districts of Assam, while the work of erecting 2,004 towers in six states has been initiated by Bharti Airtel in December 2017 and will be completed in 18 months, he added.

Attending a two-day conference on implementation of BharatNet and other major projects in North East, the telecom minister dedicated the Asthamangal Project by BSNL to the nation, especially to the citizens of the region.

Under this project, alternate bandwidth of 810 Gbps at a cost of about Rs 35 crore has been provided by BSNL using connectivity through Optical Power Ground Wire (OPGW) of Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) for all state headquarters and other important locations of NE region.

""In conference with all the stakeholders, we have reached an understanding that Centre and states have to solve the problems jointly to expedite development in this region. Most of the projects we have planned, will be completed by the end of this year,"" the minister said.

He informed that the progress of the BharatNet project has been slow in the NE region due to capacity of agencies implementing the project, various developmental activities like expansion of National Highways by NHAI, hilly terrain, remote and inaccessible areas, and law and order related issues.

""In the eight states of North East, there are 12,017 gram panchayats, out of these 7,338 were taken up in phase I under BharatNet for connecting with high speed optical fibre network. But only 2,240 gram panchayats that are service ready,"" Sinha said.

The minister informed that 92,000 gram panchayats were connected in the last 18 months across the country in the first phase.

""In the second phase, 1,50,000 gram panchayats will be connected by March 2019. The target is tough, but we are hopeful of achieving it by December 2018,"" he added.

Due to various issues in connecting some remote villages by fibre network, 4,240 gram panchayats in the North East are to be connected by broadband by satellite by December 2018 and the estimated cost of this will be Rs 733 crore, Sinha said."

30,2018-01-23,PowerGrid,"Indian equity market continued with its strong upsurge, as the benchmark indices settled at a record high on Tuesday. The Nifty50 surged 117.50 points or 1.07 per cent.

On purely technical ground, the market ending near the high point of the day has prepared a ground for yet another positive opening on Wednesday. We expect another modestly positive opening.

However, with the current levels, we need to approach the market with heightened levels of caution. Volatility is expected to creep in as we enter the penultimate day of the expiry of the current derivative series.

The levels of 11,100 and 11,175 will play out as immediate resistance levels. Supports have shifted higher, but still exist little lower at 10,975 and 10,910 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 82.5336. It has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish, but it now trades heavily in overbought area. The daily MACD stays bullish, while it trades above its signal line.

The pattern analysis shows that the Nifty is firmly in a breakout mode, and is seen continuing with it for some time. However, the overbought nature of the market warrants some caution, and we might also see some volatility creeping into the market.

All in all, it is beyond discussion that the market has firmly established the uptrend. However, that being said, the market is showing some signs of tiredness and some slowing down of momentum.

The overall breadth remains a concern on Tuesday, as the broader market has underperformed the frontline indices. Though the momentum may continue, it may slow down a bit and may show some reduction in relative strength.

We recommend remaining highly cautious at higher levels. There are heightened chances that the market may take some breather at higher levels, and may choose to consolidate.

With volatility likely to remain ingrained in the market, we advice highly vigil approach with each higher level.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were seen in JP Associates, Adani Power, State Bank Of India, CG Power, Tata Power, DISHTV, PNB, ONGC and Power Grid.

I have purchased 53 shares of Vedanta at Rs 312. For how long should I hold these shares? — N Panwar
You may hold Vedanta with a target price of around Rs 360 (which is around 10x FY2019 estimated earnings) in the short term considering robust performance of oil and zinc businesses.


I hold 500 shares of Birla Cable at Rs 64. Should I keep it for two years? — 
R K Ajmani

Since FY14, its revenue base consistently shrinking. The valuation of stock looks stretched even after taking into consideration the market value of investments in Universal Cables. Hence, you may exit it if the market price nears your cost price.


I hold 500 shares of Powergrid bought at Rs 203, 1,000 of Hudco at Rs 81.8, and 500 shares of Karur Vysya at Rs 117.15. Should I sell them?— Chankarpani


PowerGrid Corp trades at single-digit PE on consensus estimate of FY2019 EPS – hold the stock with a short-term target price of at least around Rs 220. Hold HUDCO with a target price of around Rs 90, which is around 2x current year’s adjusted book value. After over 20 per cent fall from the recent peak price, Karur Vysya Bank looks quite attractive. It also trades at a significant discount to a couple of peers in the old private sector banks. Therefore, hold it with a target price of Rs 135.


I have 2,000 shares of Sunil Hitech at Rs 13.18 and 100 shares of Cochin Shipyard at Rs 532. Should I hold or sell them? — Sugam Choudhary

Hold Sunil Hitech with a target price of around Rs 15, which is a fair price considering its both expected EPS of around Rs 1.30 for FY2018 and its balance sheet status. Hold Cochin Shipyard for long term as it is, in my view, an emerging wealth creator. Its expansion plans, strong growth in highly profitable repair segment, free cash held and most importantly, the aggressive monitoring of oceans by all major nations in Asia would help in making this stock as a solid growth stock in the long term.


I have 1,029 shares of Gammon Infra at Rs 26. Please advise what to do with them. — Shri Narain
Even at such a low price, the valuation of the stock looks stretched. Although the stock trades at less than half of its book value, it has invested about 80 per cent of its total assets in subsidiaries, SPVs, joint ventures, etc and a majority of these investee companies are facing major business constraints. However, having lost 85 per cent of your capital, it is better to hold this penny stock for any possible tactical upside.

36,2018-01-30,PowerGrid,"Low renewable tariffs are good for the country provided the projects are financially viable at these levels, Power Finance Corp Chairman and Managing Director Rajeev Sharma said. The company has no exposure to aggressively bid projects given its strong appraisal mechanism takes care of such risks, he said in an interview to ET’s Sarita Singh. The power sector financier is looking at various ways to resolve NPAs including takeovers by PSUs, diversifying borrowing portfolio and tie-ups with discoms to explore opportunities in electricity distribution segment. Edited excerpts:


Please give us an update on the NPA position.
For the quarter ending Sep 30 2017, our gross NPAs stand at Rs 21,503 crore, 8.33% of our loan assets and our net NPAs stand at Rs 16,970 crore i.e. 6.69% of our loan assets. We have upgraded a government NPA of Rs 6,748 crore. We are also likely to get an upgrade of about Rs 5,221 crore during FY 2019-20. Going forward, to that extent, we see a significant fall in NPA level primarily on account of reversal of Government Sector NPAs.

PFC is also actively undertaking various measures available under RBI and legal frame work like 5/25 scheme, SDR scheme, S4A, IBC under NCLT to resolve stress in certain loan accounts. PFC has also been actively considering other stress resolution options like government takeover of certain strategic projects.


PFC has also signed an MoU with PTC for facilitating PPA signing. How will this benefit the company and the sector?
Over the past few years not many Case-I bidding for power procurement have been taken by state discoms. Thus, many of the commissioned projects have no PPAs and are forced to sell on exchanges. This has led to oversupply in the exchange markets and therefore the prices on the exchange have also come down significantly. The issue has been discussed at various fora like Parliamentary Standing Committee, NITI Aayog, PMO, Ministry of Power. PFC has been a stakeholder in these discussions. A scheme was conceptualised to revive the commissioned projects which can be revived by having a PPA and FSA quickly and making them operational to start servicing lenders’ dues. After extensive discussions at various levels, PFC Consulting Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of PFC signed a MoU with PTC for the scheme. The successful projects in the bidding would also save on preservation costs which may be incurred otherwise. Further, the discoms would also get assured supply at cheaper rates. So it’s a win-win situation for all stakeholders. This would ultimately lead to improvement in the investor sentiment towards the power sector.


What are your borrowing costs and are you looking at newer ways for resource mobilisation?
During the first half of the current financial year, we have raised about Rs 28,000 crore at a borrowing rate of 7%. PFC launched its maiden 54EC bond issue in July 2017 at a coupon of 5.25%, which will help us in lowering overall borrowing cost going forward. 

Our current focus is to diversify borrowing portfolio. We have already raised $400 million through first green bond issuance, which got listed at London and Singapore Stock Exchanges. The pricing of green bonds was the tightest ever spread for any Indian Issuer for its maiden 10-year paper. We have also raised $300 million through a syndicated loan at competitive rates. We are also in the process of raising funds through masala bonds. Further, we are also attempting to refinance our existing foreign currency borrowing to reduce the cost of borrowing. 


PFC recently announced MoU with Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. Please elaborate the plan and also if more such agreements are being considered. 
Under the MoU, we will jointly explore opportunities in electricity distribution sector in the country which shall include various distribution projects, network strengthening, electrical mobility, smart grid, smart metering, energy storage, Trainings or any other distribution scheme of the power ministry. We are definitely open to signing similar agreements with other utilities for different segments, locations etc. 


Are declining renewable tariffs a worry? How much has the company sanctioned to such projects in this FY vis-a- vis the target?
Declining renewable tariffs are good for the entire sector subject to the fact that the projects are financially viable at these tariffs. We have seen in the past that aggressive bids by the developers in the bidding stage has led to the loan accounts being either in stress or turn into NPAs. I would like to clarify here that we have no exposure to such aggressively bid projects and our robust appraisal mechanism takes care of such risks. PFC committed during RE-INVEST 2015 to provide a financial assistance of Rs 15,000 crore during 2015-19. Against this, PFC has already sanctioned Rs 9,954 crore and disbursed Rs 6,260 crore to various renewable energy projects with a total capacity of 2,880 mw. Our renewable sanctions have increased more than 10 times in the last 3 years. Similarly, our renewable disbursements have increased more than 5 times in last 3 years. 


Is the company considering any diversification plans as there are not many generation projects in the pipeline?
Though the traditional business opportunity in thermal generation has dried up and is currently not available, we are looking at significant business opportunity in renewables, where our current share is 3% of our loan assets. There is still a huge fund requirement in the power sector especially in the transmission and distribution segment. Power Grid Corp has entered into joint ventures with utilities in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh for setting up intra-state networks. We have already sanctioned financial assistance for the Bihar JV at competitive rate and we are looking for similar opportunities. Additionally, we are focusing on debt-refinancing opportunities available in the market to accelerate business growth. We are also looking for funding sectors allied to power sector i.e. funding forward and backward linkages to power sector, such as development of coal mines, LNG, gas etc. We are also considering mining projects for power projects on a standalone basis. We are also in discussions with ministry of railways for funding their electrification projects."

15,2018-02-07,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: A semblance of order was back in the stock market as benchmark indices resumed on a higher note on Wednesday, with investors viewing the recent selloff as having run its course and overdone. 

Wall Street found its bearing as US stocks climbed over 2 per cent in overnight trade despite high volatility. Most Asian shares were trading higher. 

The domestic market mirrored the gains ahead of the outcome of the two-day RBI policy meet where the central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged. 

At 9.20 am, the BSE was up 265.72 points, or 0.78 per cent, at 34,461.66. The 30-pack index soared over 300 points in early trade. Midcap and smallcap indices climbed up to 2.5 per cent.

The NSE Nifty50 hit 10,580.35, up 82.10 points, or 0.78 per cent. The index earlier reached the 10,600 level.

Rate-sensitive banking stocks were mixed ahead of the monetary policy decision.

""We expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to undoubtedly turn more hawkish at its monetary policy meet and lay the ground for a rate hike, possibly at its next meeting. Our base case is a rate hike in Q1 FY19 as an inflation- targeting central bank will prefer to act pre-emptively, and raise rates sooner than later,"" said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. 

Among Sensex stocks, ONGC jumped 2.29 per cent. Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors and Dr Reddy's Labs too rose. 

M&M, Adani Ports, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Maruti Suzuki gained over 1 per cent each.

On the downside, NTPC declined 1.85 per cent. HDFC, HDFC Bank, Power Grid and Hindustan Unilever fell up to 1 per cent. 

Most Asian markets were trading higher.

In overnight trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a 2.3 per cent jump, its biggest since January 29, 2016. The S&P 500 index climbed 1.7 per cent for the day."

Management guides for FY18 capitalisation to be Rs 280-300 billion, implying that 4Q would clock Rs 940 billion-950 billion of project commissioning. Wage provisioning in FY18 of Rs 4.4 billion is yet to be allowed as a tariff pass-through by CERC and is pending the Central Government’s approval for the wage hike. PGCIL’s capex remained stable at Rs 59 billion in 3QFY18, while CWIP fell 14 per cent YoY to Rs 335 billion. We factor capitalisation to converge with a capex run rate of Rs 250 billion-260 billion/year by FY20-21. We maintain our thesis that PGCIL will pass its peak capitalisation in FY18-19, following which transmission earnings growth would taper off. However, given the recent price correction and no change in our estimates/TP, we find its risk-reward to be favourable. We find PGCIL attractive given FY18-20 EPS CAGR of 13 per cent, available at 9x, FY20 earnings (1.4x, FY20 book value). We Upgrade to BUY while maintaining our TP of Rs 230,"" JM Financial said in a report."
16,2018-02-07,PowerGrid,"A big-bang sale of India’s pipelines, railway tracks, power plants and transmission grids could be on the cards through Infrastructure Investment Funds (InvITs).

The government hopes this will help companies monetise mature assets and raise funds for fresh investments that couldbe ploughed into upgrading the country’s infrastructure.

This year’s Budget suggested the use of InvITs to monetise roads by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), but the idea may be expanded to include other assets as well. First notified in 2014, the regulator simplified rules to encourage such investment vehicles last year. India has two listed private-sector InvITs.

“Mature assets can be converted into trusts where investors can invest into trust units and the original asset holder gets the money back for making fresh investments,” economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg told ET.

Public sector companies can pool their assets through these InvITs to raise funds. “Today, even in the public sector we have lots of assets — pipelines, railway tracks, power plants, transmission grids, all mature, developed assets,” Garg told ET.

“It should be possible to think of monetising them.” NHAI has begun doing this through toll, operate and transfer (ToT) projects and the railways could be looking to sell and lease back 30,000 km of electric lines.

Power Grid Corp. of India has over 145,000 km of transmission lines and 42,000 km of optic fibre.

“NHAI started in a way with ToT, railways is looking at that, Power Grid is looking at that,” Garg said.

Such a move will help accelerate the government’s programme of improving the country’s infrastructure, said Neeraj Sharma, director, Grant Thornton Advisory.

“Monetisation of assets being held in public sector undertakings through creation of InvITs will fast-track the agenda of improving infrastructure in the country,” he said.

Public infra assets may be monetised via invit model


Budget announcement
Finance minister Arun Jaitley had said in his budget speech that the highways authority could use the investment vehicle to mobilise funds. “To raise equity from the market for its mature road assets, NHAI will consider organising its road assets into special purpose vehicles and use innovative monetising structures like toll, operate and transfer (ToT) and Infrastructure Investment Funds (InvITs),” Jaitley had said.

The government had first announced asset recycling in 2016 to free up funds locked in idle assets.

Separately, it has pegged disinvestment at Rs 80,000 crore for FY19, following on from a record year for asset sales.

Disinvestment proceeds are targeted to exceed Rs 1 lakh crore in FY18.

However, money raised through InvITs will go to the asset holder The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought to make InvITs more attractive last year by allowing strategic investors such as registered non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and international multilateral financial institutions to invest up to 25% of the total offer size of such trusts.

IRB Infrastructure last year raised Rs 5,000 crore through its IRB InvIT Fund that pooled the developer’s road assets.

The trust owns, operates and maintains six toll roads in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. IndiGrid, established by Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd, owns inter-state transmission assets."

32,2018-02-09,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government will soon launch a Rs 100 crore project to ensure accurate dissemination and synchronisation of Indian Standard Time (IST), a move aimed at putting in place accurate timing system nationwide.

Accurate time dissemination and precise time synchronisation would have ""significant impact"" on diverse areas including banking, telecom, weather forecast, disaster management and automatic signalling in railways, a senior consumer affairs ministry official said.

As part of the ambitious project, the ministry would strengthen the infrastructural facilities of 5 existing regional reference standards laboratories. Besides, two more such labs would be soon set up.

""We are launching a Rs 100 crore project for time dissemination initiative. In budget for 2018-19, Rs 20 crore has already been provided,"" Consumer Affairs Secretary Avinash Kumar Srivastava told reporters here.

To have accurate time dissemination, the facilities at the five labs located in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Faridabad and Guwahati would be strengthened with the help of National Physical Laboratory (NPL).

""Synchronisation of all networks and computers within the country with a national clock is a must, especially for the real time application in strategic sector and national security,"" a senior ministry official explained.

For instance, non-uniformity of time across different systems could create problems in investigation of cyber crime, the official added.

The ministry is implementing the Legal Metrology Act, which covers the provisions for units of weights and measures.

According to the ministry, accurate time dissemination and precise time synchronisation has significant impact on industrial, strategic, societal and other spheres.

Such a framework would be key to monitoring of power grids, international trade, banking system, weather forecast and disaster management, among others.

The synchronisation of time could even reduce mobile phone bills, the secretary said, without elaborating.

A group of secretaries on Science and Technology had flagged that all telecom and internet service providers were not mandatorily adopting the Indian Standard Time.

A Standard Time and Frequency Signal (STFS) Dissemination Service using INSAT system is provided by National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The particular time has a precision of better than one microsecond and accuracy of better than 20 microseconds, as per ISRO website."

ET spoke to four senior analysts for their stock picks which can withstand this high-volatility phase and outperform going ahead.


AK PRABHAKAR

Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets

ITC
CMP: Rs 271.30 Target: 25% return in 1 year

THEY ARE well diversified now. The stock has not performed in the last 5-6 months. Valuation is attractive, better than other FMCG companies. Budget was rural focused, which should benefit ITC.


Power Grid Corporation of India
CMP: Rs 193.20 Target: 40-45% upside in two years

It is a low-PE and regular dividend paying stock. The company is growing at 18-20% annually with return on equity of 15%. Earnings are likely to sustain going forward.


Rural Electrification Corporation
Target: Rs 150.30 Target: Rs 225-Rs 240 in 1 -2 years

It trades at 0.6 times price-to-book and dividend yield is at 6%. REC’s loans are mainly to state and central government power utility or SEB and due to strict RBI norms, NPA has spiked. Once people see NPA’s getting recovered, it will boost the profitability of the company.


AMAR AMBANI

Head of Research, IIFL Wealth

Axis Bank
CMP: Rs 557.50 Target: Rs 715 in 1 year

The operating and credit performance of the bank is expected to stabilise from the second-half of FY19. Current valuation of 1.8 times FY20 P/ABV (price/adjusted book value) adequately captures the near-term concerns.


Mahindra & Mahindra
CMP: Rs 749.95 Target: Rs 930 in one year

M&M is one of the best proxy stories on emerging strength in rural India resulting in strong growth expectations for tractors. New launches will help M&M recoup the lost market share in the UV segment.


Reliance Industries
CMP: Rs 897.95 Target: Rs 1,150 in a year

RIL is on the cusp of strong earnings growth in its core business of refining and petrochemicals. Reliance Jio’s industry beating performance should sustain over the medium term.


AMIT KHURANA

Head of Research, Dolat Capital

Gulf Oil Lubricants
CMP: Rs 1,074.85 Target: 16-17% return in one year

The stock came off sharply when the market fell but within three sessions it has come back to its lifetime highs. Strong volume and margins should drive the stock going ahead.


Sun Pharmaceutical Industries
CMP: Rs 582.65 Target: Rs 850 in a year

We expect resolution of the US FDA issues at the Halol facility will be a huge trigger for Sun Pharma. Valuation of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is cheaper but we are more confident about Sun Pharma.


JK Cement
CMP: Rs 1,028.45 Target: 16-17% in one year

If cement prices stabilise, JK Cement can deliver good operating profits in both cement and wall putty business. It is a structural consumption story. One can buy at lower levels.


DHARMESH KANT

Independent Market Expert


Bharat Forge
CMP: Rs 761.90 Target: 30% return in one year 

The commercial and passenger vehicle segments are picking up. At the same time, the US economy is picking up. These factors should benefit Bharat Forge. Its forging business should do well in Europe, the US and India.


Tata Motors
CMP: Rs 369.20 Target: Rs 550 in a year 

Tata Motors’ domestic business which was a drag has started picking up. Operating leverage, new model launches and a global economy on the mend will help drive JLR sales. Valuations are cheap.


IndusInd Bank
CMP: Rs 1,651.40 Target: 30% return in one year 

It is consistently posting earnings growth in excess of 20% and its earnings growth is likely to sustain going forward. It has also managed its asset quality well."
37,2018-02-13,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Indian shares rebounded after posting their worst weekly show since August last week as global equities bounced back, with the Nifty closing above the 10,500-mark.

The BSE MidCap index ended up 1.3 per cent at 16,852.46, and the BSE SmallCap index ended up 1.6 per cent at 18,463.38. Indian markets will be shut on Tuesday due to Mahashivratri.

Tata Steel was the top gainer in the Sensex, up 4.2 per cent at Rs 712.50, followed by YES Bank, Power Grid Corporation of India, IndusInd Bank, and Hero MotoCorp ending 2.1-2.89 per cent higher. State Bank of India was the worst performer, ending down 2.67 per cent at Rs 288.50, after the lender posted a surprise loss for the quarter ended December.




Major Asian indices barring Japan’s Nikkei and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng ended in the green, up 0.2-0.9 per cent, while European indices were also trading higher.

Benchmark indices have closed higher only in two out of the eight trading sessions so far this month owing to selloff in global markets triggered by rising US bond yields. Despite the rebound, the Nifty and the Sensex are down 5.7 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively, from their record high levels. The Nifty and the Sensex had hit record highs of 11,171.55 and 36,443.98, respectively, on January 29.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) provisionally sold shares worth Rs 814.11 crore while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth Rs 1,342.7 crore on Monday.

“I won’t say sentiment has revived as concerns still linger. The biggest trigger for the market is the US 10-year bond yield flirting with the 3 per cent-mark. If the yield hits 3 per cent, it could be a problem. (Nifty’s) 11,200 would be a top for the market for some time,” said Rahul Arora, CEO-institutional equities at Nirmal Bang Securities.

“Earnings were also not too hot, nor too cold, and were largely cushioned by the base effect,” said Arora.

Market participants said that the volatility is here to stay. “Volatility, which had been missing for more than a year, is back and is here to stay. We see 10,000 level being tested in March. Pullback in oil is providing some comfort, but the market is still in a precarious spot,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-markets and corporate affairs at IIFL."

The Nifty50 index opened in the positive, but failed to hold above the 10,600 level and corrected towards the 10,511 level on Thursday. The index remained highly volatile through the day and finally closed near its opening level. In the process, it formed a Doji candle on the daily chart.

It has been facing a hurdle at its 50-day EMA for last seven sessions and a cluster of supply is visible in the 10,600-10,650 zone. Now, if the Nifty50 sustains below 10,480, then weakness could continue till 10,400 and then 10,333 levels, while on the upside, immediate hurdles are seen at 10,600 and then 10,650 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,500 followed by 10,000 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000, followed by 11,100. Fresh Call writing was seen at strike prices 10,650, 10,750 and 11,000, while Put writing was seen at 10,400, 10,500, 10,550 and 10,600.

Sustained Call writing as well as Put writing kept the index in a trading range with high volatility. The option band signified a broader trading range between 10,400 and 10,650 levels.

India VIX fell 5.03 per cent to 16.31.

Bank Nifty formed a Harami candle on the daily scale, which indicated buying interest on declines even after the weakness in PSU banks. Bank Nifty has been underperforming the Nifty index from the past couple of sessions. Now, if Bank Nifty sustains below 25,200 level, then fresh selling could be seen towards 25,000 and then 24,500 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 25,750 level.

Nifty futures closed in the positive at 10,557 with a gain of 0.60 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Apollo Hospital, HUL, Hexaware, PowerGrid and ICICI Bank and DHFL, while shorts were seen in PNB, Voltas, DCB Bank, Jain Irrigation, KPIT, Motherson Sumi, Grasim, Sun TV, Idea and Jet Airways.

54,2018-02-15,PowerGrid,"Indian equity market had a session defined with limited range on Thursday. The NSE benchmark Nifty50 saw a modestly positive start and then in the late morning trade it inched higher.

 The 50-DMA acted as resistance for the market as Nifty came off from day’s highs and ended with a modest gain of 44.60 points or 0.42 per cent. There was no volatility as such, but the Nifty remains trapped in between its 50-DMA and the 10,480-10,500 support zone, which is followed by 100-DMA on the downside.

 Going into trade on Friday, we continue to expect a modestly positive and quiet start to the trade. Just as we mentioned in our earlier note, the behaviour of the market vis-à-vis the 10,480-10,500 zone would be important to watch for.

 Nifty will have to remain above the 10,500-mark to avoid any more weakness creeping in. At present, Nifty trades without any directional bias post recent corrective declines.



 The levels of 10,580 and 10,635 will act as immediate resistance levels for the market. Supports will come in at 10,480 and 10,410 zones.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 43.2847 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. No significant formations occurred on candles.

 Pattern analysis reveals little uneasy picture as the market is just managing to hang on above the 10,480-10,500 support zone. It is important to remain above this level as any breach of this support zone will increase the possibility of the Nifty testing the 100-DMA levels.

 Market is exhibiting tentative approach and we need to address this situation with some caution.

 Until Nifty stays comfortably above the 10,480-10,500 zones and gradually moves past 50-DMA, which is currently at 10,584, it will remain vulnerable to profit taking bouts from higher levels.

 We reiterate our advice to tread the market with caution, and avoid taking lopsided exposures with either directional bias.

 The dips should be utilised to make quality purchases, while profits too needed to be guarded at higher levels until a confident directional bias is established again.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Long positions were seen being added in State Bank Of India, YES Bank, ICICI Bank, Ashok Leyland, ITC, Powergrid, Vedanta, Equitas and Infibeam.

India’s dependence on imported components for electric vehicles could make the country vulnerable to cyber-security breaches, according to the government’s chief policy think-tank.

India should manufacture the majority of the parts needed for its electric vehicle fleet as equipment shipped from overseas could be compromised, V.K. Saraswat, a member of the think tank, Niti Aayog, said in an interview. All of the software and at least 55 percent of the components need to be made domestically to keep electric vehicles and the grid secure.

“There has to be a push toward local manufacturing,” Saraswat said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration said last year it aims to have mostly electric vehicles by 2030, in a country where about 3 million fossil fuel powered passenger vehicles sell annually. In an attempt to jump-start the nascent electric vehicle market, India recently conducted its first tender to buy 10,000 electric cars for government use that was won by Indian automakersTata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.

Some foreign automakers are also looking to get into the new segment. Hyundai Motor Co. is poised to be the first global automaker to introduce an electric vehicle in India next year, with plans to bring completely-knocked down kits from its factories at home.

‘Backdoor Entry’
While China manufactures everything from a chip to a converter for its electric vehicles, Indian automakers use imported electronic equipment, Saraswat said.

Local electric-vehicle makers import nearly 80 percent of the core of an electric car, including the battery and the battery management system, according to Kavan Mukhtyar, who leads the automotive practice at PwC India. The local supply chain is nascent because there are hardly any volumes, with India expected to have as many 10,000 battery-operated four-wheelers and about 100,000 two-wheelers by the end of March, he said.

“In several industries where we take equipment from abroad, there have been instances where there’s a backdoor entry left open and information does go back to the equipment supplier, which could in future have implications for national security,” Supratim Chakraborty, an associate partner at legal services firm Khaitan & Co. said.

The Central Electricity Authority, India’s planning body for the power sector, has submitted a report to the government on cyber-security for electric vehicles. One of the suggestions is to ensure EVs and charging stations don’t have the same communication system, so there’s a firewall preventing a car from from communicating with the power grid, CEA Chairman Ravindra Kumar Verma said.

“Some of the Indian government’s concerns may just be to help justify supporting the domestic industry,” according to London-based Colin McKerracher, manager for advanced transport insight at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. No country makes all the components that go into a car, so many of these risks are already present, ,he said."

This gap area would be a cluster support and it could provide strength to the stock to move up further in coming sessions. In addition price has validated the last week’s piercing line candle pattern (Moved above pattern’s high) on weekly chart which is a bullish reversal confirmation. In bigger picture, price is in internals of major “wave V” and has good upside potential. “Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price (CMP) and add in dips to Rs 790 for the upside target of Rs 940 over the next 2-3 weeks.

The price started gaining momentum from the recent low of Rs 825 levels. RSI oscillator is rebounding from the overbought territory which is bullish development. Apart from this, major “wave v” has begun to unfold and the stock has fair potential to make new life high in the long run. For short term buying can be initiated at CMP and added in dips to Rs 850 for the upside target of Rs 1,015 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stoploss at Rs 820.


Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

JSW Steel | Buy | Target price: Rs 349 | Stop loss: Rs 300
In the present uncertain market conditions this counter is registering new life time highs suggesting that it has decoupled itself and can move higher based on its own inherent strength. “Last one year price action chalked out a well defined ascending channel on weekly charts with multiple touch points based on which we can project a modest target of Rs 345 going forward in next couple of weeks. Hence, positional traders should go long with a stop below Rs 300 on closing basis for an initial target of Rs 349,” said Mohammad.


Kotak Mahindra Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,110 | Stop loss: Rs 1,020
This counter appears to have made a decent bottom around Rs 1,028 level and making an attempt to bounce from the basing formation it made last seven sessions. Despite Friday’s attempt to bounce was aborted this counter still managed to close in positive zone. Hence, traders should make use of this opportunity to go long for targets of Rs 1,110 with a stop below Rs 1,020 on closing basis.

HDFC Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,020 | Stop loss: Rs 1,830

64,2018-02-20,PowerGrid,"SILIGURI: Indian land between Bangladesh and Nepal is going to be the conduit for the two friendly international neighbors to have large scale hydropower trade in between. Bangladesh will have hydropower plants installed in Nepal and import the output through Indian land soon.

“Interest of Bangladesh to invest in harnessing untapped hydro potential of Nepal is going to put both the countries into a win win situation. India is playing the positive role of catalyst in it,” President, Rangpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) Mostofa Sohrab Chowdhury told ET. RCCI is one of the largest Business and trade community platforms of Bangladesh.

Following expression of interest from Bangladesh to invest in Nepal’s hydropower sector couple of months back, Nepal submitted a list of seven possible projects. “Our Government is considering them,” said Chowdhury.

With a projected power demand of 34,000 megawatts (MW) by 2030 Bangladesh has present installed capacity of only 13,000 MW. Over 6 crore of its population is still out of national power grid coverage.

On the other side, against Nepal’s Economically feasible potential of 43,000 MW hydropower, existing installed capacity is around 1000MW only. Nepal has a set plan to establish 4500 MW fresh generation capacity.

These put together make Bangla-Nepal power trade a highly prospective investment sector. Following Bangladesh Government’s investment into it, private enterprises of the country are also likely to come forward giving the bilateral power deal a further boost.

The only question remained within this handshaking was availability of power transmission infrastructure that to be provided by India that has kept the two countries geographically separated.

But the new sub-regional framework Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) which has already been implemented, is bringing in a major and rapid change in the regional landscape in the fields like connectivity, transit, energy or grid.

Reportedly, Bangladesh Ambassador to Nepal Mashfee Binte Shams said, “India is positive and has agreed to allow transmission of electricity to Bangladesh from Nepal. We are ready to import electricity from Nepal after meeting Nepal’s requirements as much as can Nepal can export to us.”"

Where arewe? The market is in a time-wise and price-wise corrective phase. The Nifty made high of 11,171 posts which a correction till 10,276 was sharp and now pullback rally is very slow, expect a rally towards 10,700-10,950 before the next leg of correction where 10,275 and 10,033 are important levels. Till Nifty doesn’t cross 10,800 then next leg of correction can become bit deep. In the worst case scenario, 9,800-9,500 could be possible; while in the best case 10,030 would not breach.


What is in store? The euphoric market saw a sell-off and mid-caps and small-caps have corrected more than 15-20 per cent while correction in large-caps was hardly 6-8 per cent. Going forward, large-cap growth stock will perform, like ITC, Reliance, HPCL, Power Grid, TCS, Infosys, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, BEL, Titan, to name a few. The next leg of correction, if it happens, small-cap and mid-cap stocks which have weak fundamentals can correct big time and recovery would take time, so avoid lesser-known stocks. Avoid averaging losses as any stock which starts to correct would take a long time to recover.


What could investors do? An investor should generate some cash, 25-30 per cent would be ideal in this on-going rally and realign the portfolio mix to quality stocks which have not performed in last two years. Outperformers of last 2-3 years can become laggards, while IT and power can be outperformer. Persistent, L&T Info, Cyient, TCS, NTPC, Torrent Power, Power Grid, REC are stocks for the next 12-15 months in our view.

15,2018-03-09,PowerGrid,"SURAT: The harnessing of solar energy has made Diu the country’s first energy surplus Union territory and a model for an effective way for people to harness this renewable energy source.

In just three years, Diu has made rapid progress in solar power generation. The Union territory has an area of just 42 square kilometres. Despite scarcity of land, solar power plants have been installed over more than 50 acres.

Diu generates a total of 13 megawatts of electricity from solar power generating facilities daily. Around 3 MW is generated by rooftop solar plants and 10 MW by its other solar power plants.

Three years ago, the people of Diu consumed electricity supplied from the power grid owned by the Gujarat government, resulting in huge line losses. Once the local power company started generating electricity from solar energy, the electricity loss was significantly reduced.

Daman and Diu electricity department executive engineer Milind Ingle told TOI, “The population of Diu is only 56,000. For water and electricity, the Union territory was solely dependent on the Gujarat government. To overcome this limitation, the administration of the Union territory decided to set up solar power plants in Diu.”

Ingle said, “Diu’s peak-time demand for electricity goes up to 7 MW and we generate about 10.5 MW of electricity from solar energy daily. This is way more than the consumption demand requirement.”

He said solar power has come as a big relief for local residents as their monthly bill charges have fallen by around 12%. Previously, the 0-50 units charge was Re 1.20 per unit and 50-100 units was Re 1.50 per unit. But once the solar power plants began operating, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission for Goa and the Union territories removed the 0-50 units slab. They now have revised the 1-100 units charge to Re 1.01per unit."

18,2018-03-12,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices opened higher on Monday, tracking firm global cues. US stocks surged on Friday after strong jobs data. That coupled with lower-than-expected wage growth eased inflation concerns a bit, raising hopes that the US Fed may not go in for aggressive rate hikes.

At 9.23 am, the BSE Sensex was trading at 33,582.99, up 275.85 points, or 0.83 per cent. The NSE barometer Nifty50 added 85.05 points, or 083 per cent, to 10,311.90.

Investors keenly await January factory output data and February CPI numbers scheduled later in the day.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities expects the factory output data to come in at 6.7 per cent for January. The brokerage expects February CPI inflation to arrive at 4.9 per cent against 5.1 per cent in the previous month. 

The likely softening of inflation is largely on account of a sustained decline in vegetable prices, the brokerage said. 

“However, core CPI inflation (excluding food and fuel, but including petrol and diesel) is also likely to inch up to 5.26 per cent from 5.14 per cent in January 2018,” it added.

Shares of Andhra Bank plunged 10 per cent. The Enforcement Directorate on Friday filed a supplementary prosecution complaint (charge sheet) against former Andhra Bank director Anup Prakash Garg in connection with a Rs 5,000 crore bank fraud involving the Vadodara-based Sterling Biotech Ltd (SBL) of the Sandesara group of companies.

RCom fell 1.8 per cent. The National Company Law Tribunal on Friday gave RCom and Ericsson a week’s time to negotiate a settlement over outstanding payment.

20,2018-03-13,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: As the Nifty50 reclaimed the crucial 10,400 level on Monday, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled upward crossovers in 50 stocks on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The MACD is known for identifying trend reversals.

Among the stocks that saw bullish crossovers were Power Grid, Infosys, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Mahindra & Mahindra, Wipro, Dabur India, Zee Entertainment, Maruti Suzuki, PNC Infratech, Shankara Building, Akzo Nobel and Atul.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bullish crossovers included La Opala RG, Swaraj Engines, Nilkamal, Natco Pharma and GE Power.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience an upward movement, and vice versa.



However, MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any such trend.

Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators.

The MACD charts also showed bearish crossovers on 27 counters on NSE, which analysts tend to read as ‘sell’ signal. They included Bhushan Steel, CESC, Uflex, Swan Energy, Avanti Feeds and Ramky Infrastructure.



On Monday, the 50-share Nifty index settled 194 points, or 1.90 per cent, higher from its previous close at 10,421.

“Looking at Monday’s smart bounce back, we may extend the relief rally towards 10,460-10,500 levels. But our directional view remains unchanged. We advise traders not to participate aggressively in this move and rather lighten up long positions at higher levels,” said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking.

“For the next couple of days, a stock-specific approach is recommended. However, one needs to be careful while picking up a stock and should ideally trade with a proper exit strategy,” said Chavan.


Understanding MACD



A close look at the chart of Maruti Suzuki shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has mostly shown an upward momentum and vice versa.

29,2018-03-19,PowerGrid,"In an interview with 
ET NOW,
 Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director Fund Research, Morningstar, said, ""I think managers have been rightfully watchful of the midcap space.""


ET Now: What is exactly happening in the largecap space? It seems they are clearly in favour right now. What are some of the key largecap stocks that you are watching out for?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: There has been a fair bit of activity in the largecap space because money has been coming in from retail investors. You would find that a number of largecap names that are coming up are unusual. For instance, Idea Cellular came up from the communication space purely because there was a QIP and lot of managers subscribed to it. SBI continues to see buying despite the pressure on the prices after PNB scam was unearthed. Then there is Tata Steel coming in on the largecap side, Power Grid, Bharat Petroleum, IT names like TCS and power utility like NTPC. The good part is that last year we saw mostly banks being bought but this year the flavour has changed. You are seeing a number of basic material companies, auto and technology stocks being bought by managers.


ET Now: What should be one's strategy when it comes to midcaps in the current market scenario?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: I think managers have been rightfully watchful of the midcap space not just now but over the last one year when clearly valuations did run up ahead of themselves and there was lot of exuberance that was being shown on some of the stock prices. So managers have been extremely selective in picking up these counters. The largecaps remain the largest pie of what managers are buying but yes, select midcaps do see buying. Investors are buying in Triveni Turbines or Voltas as they are seeing value there. I think managers will continue to cherry-pick midcaps as it is not going to be an all in sort of trade. They will be very careful about where they allocate money in the midcap side.


ET Now: Besides PSBs, are you seeing large ticket exits for some of the large private corporate banks like ICICI or Axis because there has been a fair amount of price correction there too?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: The interesting thing is that there may have been some buying on the PSB counters after the price correction. SBI, BoB have been added a fair bit and even PNB has seen some minor additions. I think the managers need to have that faith that yes the price has corrected, more than we want to get into some of these counters. There has been some profit booking on private banks like Kotak Mahindra, IndusInd and Yes Bank. Financials is not something that has been sold extensively. Yes, some counters have been sold but the likes of HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, continue to see addition. Axis Bank is another name which saw a fair bit of addition but I think the enthusiasm with which the managers were buying in 2017 has definitely come off because they are already loaded up in positions and they want to look at other counters or rather sectors which are looking better buys at this point of time.


ET Now: A correction played out in the metals globally and it rubbed off on us too after Trump announcing those tariff hikes. Are people running for cover when it comes to metals? There is enough proof that the commodity is in an upcycle but are you seeing any capital protection within metals?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: Interestingly, we are betting on domestic demand picking up in metals. You can see additions in Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, Hindalco and SAIL. Metals saw a fair bit of buying in the month of February too.


ET Now: How are you looking at the overall oil and gas space? What is your sense when it comes to the connection between crude oil prices and some of the largecap upstream and downstream oil and gas companies?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: In the oil and gas segment the interest has been limited over the last few quarters. We have not seen any large additions like the ones we saw last year. But clearly companies like BPCL and HPCL continue to see minor adding though nothing exceptional. IOC is one counter where we have actually seen selling in the previous month. I think it is a mixed bag. There is obviously a wait and watch situation and see around what level does oil prices stabilise or if they continue to go up. I think managers will take some time before they take a call to get back more aggressively into these counters.


ET Now: What is the kind of churn that you are seeing happening when it comes to largecaps as a whole?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: Since laregcaps saw a fantastic run up in January, where clearly a lot of these stocks moved up, managers did not mind taking some profit off the table. Obviously, we have had a correction in February but still a healthy amount of money was made over the last year or two. The focus is now slowly shifting. You can see a lot of buying happening in power utilities, commodities, basic materials and cement. Banks are no longer the darling of the Street from a fund managers' perspective. That trend has definitely changed.


ET Now: What is the outlook on IT, based on the management commentary as well as the way the currency is shaping up?

Kaustubh Belapurkar: IT remains a very staggered play. I do not think too many of the midcap names really have got into much buying. The one name that pops up was Cyient that has seen some buying. But beyond that buying was prevelant in the largecap IT space and Infosys particularly was that one counter that saw a lot of activity. TCS has been playing a little bit of catch up now but Wipro still remains a flattish bet for manager. So I think it is going to be a very stock specific play right now. It is not going to be broad based buying from managers as yet."
30,2018-03-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Falling for a fifth straight session, the BSE benchmark Sensex hit over three-month low on Monday on heavy selling in metals and IT stocks, as market participants looked cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s meet on March 20-21.

As many as 41 stocks in the Nifty pack ended in red, with HCL Technologies, falling the most at 4.61 per cent, followed by Tata Steel (down 4.37 per cent), Bharti Airtel (down 4.13 per cent), Tech Mahindra (down 3.94 per cent) and BPCL (down 3.70 per cent.

On the other hand, NTPC, Power Grid, Maruti Suzuki, Hindustan Unilever and Larsen & Toubro gained between 0.90 per cent and 1.25 per cent.

Metal counters witnessed severe selling pressure, tracking losses in Chinese iron ore prices. The BSE Metal index cracked over 2 per cent to 13,550.30. Barring Nalco (up 1.82 per cent), other counters in the index closed in red. Share price of NMDC, SAIL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Coal India tanked between 2.50 per cent and 6.50 per cent.

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking said, “Weak global cues and caution ahead of the FOMC meet were weighing on the sentiment. We reiterate our immediate target of 10,000 for Nifty. We feel correction could be steep on broader front thus suggest maintaining extra caution in midcap and smallcap space.”

Chinese iron ore slipped to its lowest level since November 2017, as high inventory levels and a weak domestic steel market weighed on prices. Worries over the potential trade war between the US and China and frustration over US President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs also played spoilsports hurting investors’ risk appetite. 

Among other sectoral indices on the BSE, Realty and Telecom index slipped over 3 per cent each. 

Initial public offerings by Bandhan Bank got subscribed by over 14 times till 4.15 pm (IST), according to the data available with NSE.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, “Market continues to drag under global market volatility ahead of the FOMC meet tomorrow, where consensus hints at a 25bps rate hike. Bond yield remains at elevated levels and concern on trade tensions is influencing investors to book profit.”

Asian peers ended mixed on Monday. Nikkei slipped 0.90 per cent, whereas Hang Seng and Shanghai ended marginally higher by 0.04 per cent and 0.29 per cent, respectively."
31,2018-03-19,PowerGrid,"Indian equity market had a disappointing session on Monday, as Nifty slipped below its crucial 200-DMA. The benchmark was on a downward slope for the entire session and it ended the day losing 100.90 points or 0.99 per cent.

 The advance decline ratio remained heavily in favour of the former.

 As we approach Tuesday’s trade, we stare at a probable break of key support levels. We are presently dealing with two most important support levels of the recent past.



 The first level is 10,163, which is the 200-DMA on the daily chart; and second is the 28-month long upward raising trend support of 10,040. The zones of 10,040-10,163 are expected to provide support to the market, failing which, we will stare at a possible initiation of an intermediate bear trend. Tuesday will see the levels of 10,160 and 10,230 as a potential resistance area. Supports come in at 10,040 and 9,980 zones. There are still chances that the Nifty might hold on to these supports at the close.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 34.0379. A bullish divergence is observed. Nifty formed a fresh 14-period low, while RSI did not. The daily MACD has reported a negative crossover. It is now bearish while trading below its signal line. If we look strictly at the pattern analysis, though the Nifty has ended below its 200-DMA, it still stays within its filter. 

 Further, it also eyes another important pattern support of 10,040, which remain in very close vicinity. On a theoretical note, Nifty still has chance to avert more weakness if it manages to crawl above 200-DMA again.

 Overall, it would be extremely crucial to see how the markets behaves vis-à-vis the levels of 10,040-10,160 on a closing basis. The Nifty will be able to avert the weakness if it manages to crawl back above these levels.

 However, at the same time, we now have to take into account the fact that if the levels of 10,040 is significantly breached, we are staring at some prolonged weakness and the levels of 200-DMA will become a resistance for the market in the immediate short term.

 We advise refraining from taking any major directional view until a validation of the current trend comes.

 A highly cautious view is advised for tomorrow.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Amid chaos, fresh longs were also seen being added in stocks like Nalco, SRF, Tata Communications, Divi’s Labs, GAIL, Reliance, Power Grid, Star, Marico, Grasim, Petronet, Larsen & Toubro and Titan.

33,2018-03-23,PowerGrid,"ET Intelligence Group: The lack of a clear trend in sustainability of earnings, increasing crude oil prices and rising uncertainties in global macro-economic environment are some of the challenges for investors. In such a situation, low-beta stocks may be a better choice. Here are five such stocks you may look at:


BALKRISHNA INDUSTRIES
One of the largest tyre makers, Balkrishna Industries is expected to benefit from stable rubber prices. It is expected to boost operating margin. Analysts expect the company’s tyre sales to rise by 13-15 per cent for the next two fiscals as demand for off-the-road (OTR) and agriculture tyres is expected to be strong. A key reason for this is improvement in business activities in the mining sector.


BRITANNIA INDUSTRIES
Factors such as encouraging double-digit volume growth in the December 2017 quarter after six quarters, cost saving measures, geographical expansion, and new capacity augur well for the country’s largest biscuit company. In addition, it has forayed in high-priced biscuit products and the dairy segment, which are expected to boost revenue growth.


CG CONSUMER ELECTRICALS
The company has dominant market share in fans, residential pumps and consumer lighting. The government reforms focusing on housing for all, electrification and favourable situation for organised players after the implementation of the GST may boost revenue. The company has gained market share in premium segments of fans and lighting which should enhance operating margin in the next two to three years.


POWER GRID CORPORATION
India’s largest electric power transmission utility is expected to benefit from $16.3 billion worth of proposed projects. Being in the business which generates fixed return of 15.5 per cent on equity, the company provides high stability to the portfolio. The company has been able to complete projects on time, which has resulted in healthy cash flows. This has reduced the risk of equity dilution since capital expenditure can be finance through internal accruals.


GSK PHARMACEUTICALS
Healthcare company GlaxoSmithkline Pharmaceuticals has been able to fix issues related to shortage and supply of vaccines and other medicines from its parent company. The company relaunched Neosporin, which is an antibiotic used to treat minor wounds. Besides this, the company launched two new healthcare products. It has a pipeline of new launches in the form of three more respiratory products and one diabetic drug in addition to two vaccines in the next two years. These products are expected to boost revenue in the present and the coming fiscal."

Locally, markets have been facing headwinds since the start of February, be it the imposition of Long-term capital gains or the much talked about banking fraud.

Where we are
The market is in a time-wise and price-wise corrective phase, and the Nifty could target 9,400 or 9,100 in the worst-case scenario. The index, after making a high of 11,171 in January this year, has corrected to 9,951, which is the low of the past five months. In 2018 alone, it has 3 gap-down and one pending Negative Island.

Nifty has closed below 200-DMA for the past five days in a row, and the Friday gap-down signals more selling could come in next few weeks. Unless the Nifty crosses 10,300, the correction can become a bit deeper. In the worst-case scenario, 9,400-9,100 could be possible.


What is in store
The euphoric bull market has given way to a bear market, which can last for 6-8 months more. We are already in the second month. Now is the time to be in quality and growth stocks. Avoid promoterpledged stocks, and stocks with a high leverage. Mid-cap & small-cap stocks can correct more and recovery could take more time. Bank Nifty is showing more weakness than the Nifty itself. I assume financial stocks are likely to correct more than the overall market.


What could investors do
An investor having cash level, 30-40% would be ideal to deploy in this ongoing correction. Avoid averaging. Wait for the market to stabilise for 1-2 months before any fresh averaging. Outperformer of the past 4-5 years can become laggards, while IT & power can be outperformers. Titan, ITC, TCS, ZEEL, M&M, BEL, NTPC and Power Grid are stocks for next 12-15 months."

3,2018-04-04,PowerGrid,"Market's fabled mood swings have been well-chronicled. Sample this. The last session of 2017-18 ended up being the 28th fall for the Sensex since its all-time high on 
January 29 this year. And it went up for 12 sessions during the period.

Volatility is here to stay. The point is how to ride the wave.

In fact, domestic equities have seen such fluctuations more frequently, especially since the re-introduction of Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax in this year's Budget. A string of frauds in public sector banks, rising bond yields and trade concerns involving the US and China have only worsened things.

The 30-share BSE index has tanked over 3,000 points to 33,174 on March 27, from 36,283 on 
January 29. India volatility index, Vix, continued to hover above 15-mark during the period. It was 11.49 on April 3, 2017. 

Despite the correction, market experts believe that it is difficult to predict the bottom of the market. So, what can equity investors do if they have an ability to digest the volatility? 

Shyam Shekhar, Chief Ideator and founder, ithought, in an exclusive chat with ETNow said, “I would buy some large companies in metals and steel. Besides these, I would also consider companies that have completed capex or where the acquisition decisions are already out in the open.”

Rusmik Oza, Head-midcaps at Kotak Securities, said, “The markets may not have bottomed out as the broader mid caps are still in correction mode and the Nifty is trading below the 200 DMA. Midcap index forward P/E is still at more than 300 bps premium over that of Nifty, signalling room for further correction in the midcap index. After the fall, many large caps have come in the ‘Buy’ zone and risk-reward ratio of large caps has improved and become favourable.”

As much as 90 per cent of stocks in the Nifty 50 index had delivered negative return to investors since 
January 29, with Tata Steel and ICICI Bank sliding over 20 per cent each. 

Other major losers included State Bank of India (SBI), Lupin, Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Vedanta, Adani Ports, Hindalco, Axis Bank and YES Bank with a fall between 15-20 per cent during the same period.

Oza added that the potential downside in the Nifty could be in single digit whereas the potential upside could be in double digits. “Within the largecap, we are preferring good quality, defensive bets at this juncture as markets could be volatile in the near to medium term due to international and local political news flows. Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, ICICI Bank, ITC, Vedanta, Cipla and Power Grid are among our preferred picks at present.”"
2,2018-04-04,PowerGrid,"Infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro (L&T), Genus Power and Allied Engineering have bagged a contract to supply 10 million pre-paid meters to Uttar Pradesh under the Saubhagya scheme, which aims to add more than 40 million households to the power grid by December this year.

Noida-based Genus Power Infrastructures won 50% of the order by quoting the lowest price at Rs 1,185 per meter. L&T was the second lowest bidder at Rs. 1,204 per meter, while Allied Engineering Works quoted Rs 1,892 for each meter. The two companies will be allotted the remaining 30% and 20% of the order, respectively.

“We are satisfied with the price that has been discovered. This is something that we are doing for the government of U.P and the entire money is being paid by them,” Saurabh Kumar, managing director of Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), which floated the tender in November last year, told ET.

4,2018-04-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian stock indices made a spectacular comeback on Thursday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent in its first bimonthly policy review of FY19. 

Besides, ebbing of trade war concerns and positive global cues too boosted sentiment.

The Sensex ended 578 points or 1.75 per cent higher with SBI (up 5 per cent) being the top gainer and Power Grid (down 0.15 per cent) the worst laggard. 

The Nifty National Stock Exchange (NSE) reclaimed the 10,300 level to settle at 10,325.15, up 196.75 points or 2 per cent. Out of 50 constituents, 48 ended in the green.


RBI maintains neutral stanceThe central bank today kept the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The MPC noted that the decision was consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy.


RBI gives provisioning relief to stressed banksReserve Bank of India (RBI) has temporarily relaxed provisioning norms for lenders to defaulters undergoing bankruptcy resolution in a move that could help banks bolster their financial results for the year and quarter ended March. Provisions for accounts referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) have been reduced to 40% of dues at the end of March for secured loans, down from 50% earlier, RBI told banks in a circular issued to them on Wednesday.


Asian stocks rally as trade war fears easeAsian shares bounced from two-month lows on Thursday as world equities recovered from a selloff triggered by escalating Sino-US trade tensions, with investors hoping a full-blown trade war between the world’s two biggest economies can be averted, Reuters. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent. Japan's Nikkei gained 1.2 per cent. Markets in mainland China, and those in Hong Kong and Taiwan, are closed on Thursday, Reuters reported. US Dow Jones index rose 0.96 per cent to 24264.30 in overnight trade. 


Macro cuesBrokerage Centrum said, ""We believe that India is much better placed now in comparison to 2007 and 2013. However, admittedly, the “sweet-spot” is behind us which India had enjoyed during 2014-2017 when macros and political stability were at enviable levels."" 

Anxiety has been building-up in terms of slowing FDIs, widening trade deficit, tightening global liquidity with global central banks coming off their accommodative stance, concerns over fiscal slippage (indicating fiscal deficit at ~3.5% for FY18) and political uncertainty. Biggest headwind, of course, is painful banking woes in terms of frauds and non-performing assets (NPAs). At this juncture, macros are precariously poised.


Technical factors
While the Nifty50 on Wednesday made a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the daily, technical analysts noted that the selloff had more to do with global concerns. Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said chances of stability in market post RBI policy outcome can’t be ruled out. 

""The 10,016 level is a critical level to watch out for as breach of this level, based on our technical observations, shall lead to retest of 9950 kind of levels. Upsides for time being shall remained capped around 10,279 levels,"" the expert said."

6,2018-04-06,PowerGrid,"NIFTY50 companies are expected to report a double-digit growth in net profit for the third consecutive quarter, shows the latest quarterly preview by the ET Intelligence Group. Net profit will grow by 18.4 per cent year-on-year for the March 2018 quarter.

A lower base in the previous year due to demonetisation is expected to boost performance of select companies in sectors including automobiles, banks and finance, consumer, and metals. In addition, the magnitude of profit growth for the quarter will likely be higher than the previous two quarters.

Net sales of the sample are likely to increase by 7.7 per cent for the quarter while operating profit may rise by 15.9 per cent. The sample companies were able to retain the operating margin at around 20 per cent in the two quarters to December 2017. The March quarter may not be an exception with an expected margin of 19.9 per cent.

Though the overall growth is expected to be upbeat, only a handful of sectors will continue to drive the growth. Automobiles, consumer goods, retail oriented banks and financial services companies, and metal companies are likely to shine. On the other hand, public sector banks, private sector lenders with higher exposure to corporates, information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, and telecom are likely to report weak numbers.


Sector Trend
AUTO SECTOR
The volume growth in the December quarter was 13-35 per cent across auto segments due to improving consumer sentiment and replacement demand. The revenue growth will also be strong since auto makers tend to maintain pricing power. The operating profit margin may moderate owing to firm raw material prices.


BANKING AND FINANCE
Lenders focusing on retail segments including automobiles, housing, and personal loans will continue to do better than those having a higher exposure to corporate accounts. In case of banks with corporate-heavy loan books, the rate of fresh nonperforming assets or slippages is likely to decelerate.


CAPITAL GOODS
A pickup in the execution of several projects is likely to support the earnings growth of capital goods companies. Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest infrastructure company, is likely to report better project execution along with better momentum of new orders. Power Grid Corporation is expected to maintain the ratio of commissioned projects and capital expenditure above one.


CEMENT
In the March 2018 quarter, the average all-India cement price increased marginally by 1.2 per cent to Rs 314 per 50 kg bag. In the northern region, demand was slightly weak due to lower availability of sand. Demand was higher in across Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu. Ultratech, the country’s largest cement manufacturer with pan-India presence and the only Nifty 50 member from the sector, is expected to report double digit year-on-year revenue growth.


FMCG
The low base of the previous year’s March quarter due to demonetization and share gain from unorganized players following GST implementation will enable consumer companies to report strong double digit volume growth. The margins should also expand for most companies partly aided by the GST. ITC’s cigarette volume growth will see a decline of low single digit but this will be offset by a 12 per cent average price hike.


IT
The March quarter has been historically weak for the Indian software exporters given the rejig of IT budgets by clients during the quarter. The dollar denominated revenue growth may remain under 2 per cent sequentially. The weakness in the rupee against the major currencies may support operating margins for the quarter.


METALS AND MINING
The domestic demand of steel strengthened in the March quarter. Consumption grew by 7 per cent year-on-year in January and February. This and higher steel prices will help companies post double digit revenue growth. Aluminium players, too, are likely to see better realization as prices increased by 10 per cent year-on-year.


PHARMA
It will be another subdued quarter for the pharma sector as the US business for most companies will continue to be a drag. No major drug approvals were given to Indian companies in the March quarter. This may result in a low single digit year-on-year revenue growth.


POWER
During the March quarter, power generation rose by 4.3 per cent year-on-year and that by the coal fired plants was up 5.5 per cent, despite coal shortage. The plant load factor or capacity utilization was at 63 per cent. Coal India’s overall production was up by 4 per cent and dispatch by 5 per cent. Dispatch to the power sector was up 8 per cent. Revenues and profits of Nifty 50 participants including Coal India and NTPC are expected to grow in single digits.


TELECOM
It will be still some more time before the benefits of recent consolidation in the sector would reflect in the financials of telecom operators. Their revenue and profits are expected to remain under pressure for the March quarter amid intense competition."
7,2018-04-06,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: The capital goods and engineering industry may be in for a tough year in 2018-19 as the previous year ended on a dismal note with new project announcements in the January-March period being one of the lowest in any fourth quarter since 2005.

Government orders have been the key driver for capital goods and engineering companies for the past two-three years as private sector capex remained muted. But industry data and anecdotal evidence show slowing of orders even from government agencies.

The bigger concern is that order inflows may slow down further in the second half of fiscal 2018-19, as the country heads for the next general elections in April-May 2019, industry executives said.

“New project announcements in 4QFY18 were one of the lowest in any 4Q since 2005. However, even as the absolute quantum of new projects is lower, the quality of projects is better as low visibility projects accounted for only 7% of 4QFY18 new announcements versus 28% in 4QFY17,” Phillip Capital India Research said in a report.

“We believe that a broad-based recovery in the capex cycle is still absent. A revival in capex would be led by starting of stalled projects, as conversion of new project announcements into projects under implementation would take time to gather momentum,” the report said.

State-run Power Grid Corporation of India, which accounts for almost 40-45% of annual investment into the power transmission sector, ordered the lowest amount since 2008-09 in the absence of large orders. The company ordered projects totalling around ?9,000 crore in 2017-18, down 68% year-on-year, denting the order flow to engineering companies in the sector.

While the sector has partially recovered from the combined impact of demonetisation and goods and services tax on order execution, muted order inflow casts a shadow on revenue visibility going ahead. Also, industry executives said the Reserve Bank of India’s new guidelines on stressed assets will further hurt cash-strapped infrastructure companies’ ability to invest.

“Post demonetisation and GST (goods and services tax) impacting growth in the first half, we expect execution ramp up to continue in Q4FY18, after 11% year-on-year growth in Q3FY18. We estimate 15% yo-y revenue spurt aiding 50 bps margin expansion,” brokerage Edelweiss said in a fourth-quarter result preview. “Among public spending verticals, railways and infra continued to see significant order finalisation, followed by T&D. Pickup in greenfield projects continues to remain a key monitorable as it is crucial to drive the next leg of growth of engineering, procurement and construction companies, which we believe is around 12-15 months away.”"

The 50-share Nifty50 index closed 20 points, or 0.19 per cent up, at 10,549 with 23 stocks advancing.

“Market remained in a trading range led by normal monsoon forecast and positive earnings expectation. However, underlying caution ahead of state election and volatility in crude prices refrained the market from a decisive upmove. IT index slid despite a weak rupee, as lowering of margin guidance for FY19 added concerns in the mind of investors,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The Nifty50 index opened on a positive note on Tuesday and managed to hold above the 10,480 level. The index formed a Hanging Man candle on the daily charts, which signalled that followup buying was missing at higher levels.

However, Nifty50 continued to form higher highs for last 12 consecutive sessions, which indicated that the bulls were still holding the momentum in the market.

As long as the index holds above 10,480, it can extend gains towards 10,580 and then 10,630 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,480 and then 10,440 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,400, followed by 10,300, while maximum Call OI was at 10,700, followed by 10,500. Significant Put writing was seen at strike prices 10,500 and 10,550, which shifted its support higher, while minor Call writing was seen at strike price 10,600 followed by 10,700. The option band suggested an immediate trading range between 10,480 and 10,650 levels.

Bank Nifty opened on a flat note and took support at its previous hurdle at 25,250. It formed a Hammer candle on the daily chart, which meant every decline is being bought into. As long as the Bank Nifty holds and sustains above 25,250, it can start the next leg of upward move towards 25,500 and then 25,750 levels, while on the downside, major supports are seen at 25,000 and then 24,750 levels.

26,2018-04-17,PowerGrid,"Hi there! You are listening to ETMarkets Evening Podcast.

This is Abhinav Kaul, with today's trading update and detailed analysis from top-notch market watchers.

Sensex's good luck continued for the ninth straight day, its longest winning streak since September 2014. For the Nifty, it turned out to be an uninterrupted run since January 2015.

This time, it's IMD projection of normal monsoon that saw the stocks pull through. The Sensex rose 0.26 per cent to close at 34,395 while the NSE Nifty shut shop at 10,549, up 0.19 per cent.

Power Grid jumped 3 per cent and was the leader of the Sensex pack. Axis Bank lost the most, down 2 per cent, fighting off corporate governance blues.

Infosys fell further on unimpressive margin guidance for FY19 and closed the day 0.69 per cent lower on the BSE. 

Buying in power, realty, FMCG and consumer goods contributed to the upmove.

Let's listen in to what Milan Sharma of Rivergate Capital Partners has to say on fundamentals.

Byte 1: Milan Sharma

DCB Bank registered the biggest spike in open interest at 64.80 per cent. Power Grid (28.51 per cent) and Apollo Tyres (15.62 per cent) came in second and third, respectively.

27,2018-04-17,PowerGrid,"Nifty continued with its winning momentum, and ended ninth straight session in the green, as it ended with a net gain of 20.35 points or 0.19 per cent on Tuesday.

Though the session ended with modest gains, it saw a V-shaped intraday recovery. What was seen on Tuesday was a classical consolidation, while the Nifty tested its important near-term resistance.

For Wednesday, as mentioned in our previous note, the levels of 10,550-10,575 will continue to pose immediate resistance.

Though underlying buoyancy remains very much visible, the market may continue to consolidate a bit more before a clear upmove continues.



The levels of 10,575 and 10,610 will act as immediate resistance area, while supports will come lower at 10,510 and 10,465 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stands at 62.6075. While it remains bullish, forming a fresh 14-period high, it continues to remain neutral showing no divergences against the price.

The daily MACD stays bullish, while trading above its signal line. A ‘Hanging Man’ that emerged on the candles shows likely creation of reversal top and can temporarily halt the upmove.

Pattern analysis shows the Nifty resisting to the 10,550-10,575 zones, which is the strong pattern resistance area for the Market. It is the upper range of the broad rectangle formation, which was created since February.

This range was breached, but during the pullback, the Nifty managed to crawl back inside it. Overall, there are no doubts that the undercurrent remains extremely bullish.

The Nifty is adding open interest with each upmove, this shows buoyant intent of the market participants. However, given the overstretched nature of few oscillators and given the present structure of the charts, some consolidation in form of rangebound movements with limited downsides remains imminent.

This will bring with itself fair amount of volatility as well. We reiterate our advice of protecting profits at higher levels while continuing to rotate stocks effectively while maintaining a cautious view on the market.

28,2018-04-19,PowerGrid,"The Thursday’s session remained extremely rangebound, as the NSE benchmark Nifty oscillated in a 20-point range throughout the day, making no directional headway. The Index gained 39.10 points or 0.37 per cent, but showed no conviction on either side.

As we approach the last trading day of the week, we see Friday’s trade getting off on a quiet note once again. The market is showing a lot of inherent buoyancy, but if we speak about the immediate short term, some consolidation is now getting long overdue.

It would be healthy for the market if it spends some time oscillating in a capped range. This will make the current pullback more healthy, sustainable and potent to scale higher levels.

The Friday’s trade will see the zones of 10,580 and 10,625 acting as resistance levels. Supports have shifted littler lower at 10,510 and 10,465 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 62.8027. While it marked a fresh 14-period high, it remained neutral against the price showing no divergence.

While daily MACD continued to stay bullish, no significant formations were observed on the candles.

Pattern analysis of the daily charts showed that the market is trying to break out from the pattern resistance area. The market is trying to break out from a rectangle formation, which resulted out of a broad trading range.

Overall, it is beyond doubt that the inherent buoyancy in the market is quite visible. However, the current structure on the daily charts looks bit overstretched and possibilities of a profit taking from higher levels cannot be ruled out.

The Nifty PCR (Put to Call ratio), which is at relatively higher levels might restrict the upmoves as well. We strongly advise to refrain from creating shorts as the undercurrent remains bullish. However, with possibilities of market encountering volatile profit taking bouts at higher levels, vigilant protection of profits is advised.

While adopting a very cautious view on the market, all profit taking bouts, if any, should be continued to be used for making select purchases.

29,2018-04-23,PowerGrid,"India’s biggest domestic institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) was on a major shopping spree on Dalal Street this March quarter, even as the broader market weakened thanks to a series on domestic as well as global headwinds.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 20 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 35 companies from the BSE500 index. The insurer had exposure to nearly 200 companies on the index.

The insurance behemoth booked a record equity profit of Rs 25,000 crore last financial year, compared with Rs 19,000 crore it had earned in financial year 2016-17.

The domestic equity market witnessed a lot of volatility in the second half of March quarter owing to a Budget proposal to tax long-term equity gains, fears of a trade war following some protectionist measures by the Trump administration, geopolitical crises and signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates more rapidly than expected. This also triggered strong FII outflows from the domestic market.

But the domestic institutional investor increased stake in a couple of companies from across sectors, including rating agencies, IT, pharma, downstream oil and gas players, housing finance, select private banks, FMCG and power companies.

Among the large caps, Coal India saw LIC stake go up to 10.30 per cent at the end of March from 9.66 per cent as of December 31, 2017. LIC also raised its holding in oil marketing company HPCL (from 2.08 per cent to 2.17 per cent), L&T (17.94 per cent to 17.96 per cent), Tech Mahindra (3.60 per cent to 3.77 per cent), UltraTech Cement (2.33 per cent to 2.41 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (3.84 per cent to 4.89 per cent).

Oil marketing companies have since come under pressure amid soaring of crude oil prices, which are currently hovering around their three-year high levels.

Infrastructure major L&T has been seeing a lot of interest from institutional investors in recent times.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recently named it as one of its preferred picks.


The public sector insurer also showed confidence in rating agencies during the quarter gone by, hiking stake in ICRA to 8.98 per cent from 7.45 per cent in December quarter. It held 5.88 per cent in Crisil as of March 31, 2018 against 5.45 per cent at the end of December quarter. ICRA shares are down 8 per cent in last one year, having slipped to Rs 3,812.50 as of April 20, 2018 from Rs 4,152 on the same day last year. Crisil is down around 0.77 per cent at Rs 1940.85 from Rs 1,955.90 that it had quoted a year ago.

LIC also showed confidence and raised stake in Castrol India, Adani Transmission, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Hindalco, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, Swan Energy, Power Grid, Oracle Financial Services, ONGC, NHPC, Mindtree, ICICI Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indraprastha Gas, Granules India and YES Bank.

Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance are up 38 per cent in last one year. The company on Friday posted a 22.6 per cent rise in net profit for March quarter to Rs 1,030 crore from Rs 841 crore reported for the same period of last year.

Hindalco has been among top buy recommendations of analysts on Dalal Street following a major spike in aluminium prices. The stock is up 40 per cent in last one year.

Brokerage Edelweiss says Alcoa’s Q1CY18 numbers and guidance reinforce the belief that LME aluminium price will stay robust in the near term as unprecedented constraints in the global supply chain post sanctions on Rusal and cut in Alunorte’s production, smelter restarts/new capacity are expected to be slower or lower in China and ensure steady growth in global aluminium demand at 4.25-5.25 per cent. Alcoa is world’s sixth largest aluminium producer.

Taking cognizance of the improved outlook, Alcoa has revised its CY18 Ebitda guidance higher by 30 per cent. 

All domestic aluminium companies — Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco — will benefit in the near term, Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

Meanwhile, LIC holdings came down in companies such as Dena Bank, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank, UCO Bank, Tata Steel, Indian Hotels and Cipla."

on Thursday inaugurated a microgrid solution at its Vadodara facility that will harness solar power and reduce its carbon footprint. This is the first of its kind to be installed at a manufacturing campus in India, the company said.

The microgrid’s rooftop photovoltaic field and battery-energy storage system will support the factory’s productivity and enable green power supplies in the evening hours or during cloudy periods, the company said adding the use of renewables will minimise the factory’s carbon footprint by near 1400 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. 

“The solar energy driven ABB Ability microgrid reinforces our commitment to clean energy, said Claudio Facchin, president of ABB’s Power Grids Division. He said with India’s per capita electricity consumption just one-third the world average, there is scope for ABB to offer sustainable solutions to the Indian market.

32,2018-04-29,PowerGrid,"BENGALURU: Renewable energy developers are worried that transmission facilities are not keeping pace with power generation even as 12,000 MW of solar projects under construction and another 7,000 MW of wind projects have been bid out since wind auctions began in February 2017.

Developers expressed fear that completed projects might not be able to start functioning because all ‘bays’ at the nearest substations are already occupied and transmission lines already carrying their full capacity at a recent meeting of developers and officials across concerned government agencies in Delhi. A second meeting of all stakeholders to discuss this issue alone was held on Friday.

“The main reason is that so far there has been no coordination between ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE), Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) and Central Electricity Authority (CEA), all of whose representatives were present at the meeting,” said a developer who attended both the meetings. “Solar Corporation of India (SECI), which is under MNRE, has been merrily holding auctions for both wind and solar projects without making sure that enough evacuation facilities are available.”

According to the developer, CEA and PGCIL representatives at the first meeting claimed they had not been told that so many auctions would be held, while SECI official maintained that getting connectivity was the developers’ problem, not the corporation’s.

PGCIL and SECI did not respond to ET queries as of press time Sunday.

The problem is most acute in Gujarat where, according to one developer, over 2,000 MW of wind projects are being built, but substations can only accommodate 400 MW, industry insiders said.


Others

They said the solution lies in building more substations and transmission lines, but the process will take much longer than the time the currently under-construction projects take to get completed.

“With the private sector having been allowed into this segment, auctions will have to be held for the construction of substations, with PGCIL competing against private players,” said the developer quoted earlier. “Getting the substations actually built will take at least three years. Our projects have to be ready in 18 months or less, according to the power purchase agreements (PPAs) we have signed,” the person said.

Some developers suggested doing away with the bidding through a government ordinance and assigning the task entirely to PGCIL, which, if it starts work immediately, could have the substations ready earlier.

However, PGCIL builds substations and transmission lines only for inter-state links, while state transmission units (STUs) are responsible for intra-state ones, and these too will need to work on a war footing to meet the requirements of new projects.

“Implementation of the green energy corridor project, meant specifically to connect renewable energy plants to the national grid, needs to be speeded up,” said an industry insider.

In 2017-18, 350 circuit km of transmission lines were installed under the green energy corridor project, with 1,900 circuit km targeted in 2018-19. However, the parliamentary standing committee on energy has recently pointed out that, given the target, the budget allocation of Rs 6 billion for 2018-19 is far too low.

The mismatch between MNRE and PGCIL is all the more glaring considering that the problem has arisen despite PGCIL performing well on targets it had set itself.

In the first eight months of 2017-18, by end November, PGCIL had laid a total of 13,820 circuit km of new transmission lines, achieving 59.9% of its annual target, and set up new substations with an additional capacity of 50,805 mega volt amperes (MVA), which is 94.1% of its annual target."
0,2018-05-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government proposes to amend the Electricity Act to ensure that companies applying for power distribution rights in an area have signed sufficient power purchase agreements (PPAs) to ensure uninterrupted supply to consumers, Power Minister R.K. Singh said on Tuesday.

Briefing reporters here on the achievement of bringing electricity to all villages in the country, R.K. Singh said the changes to the law were being proposed in order to help achieve the next target of universal household electrification in India by December 2018.

""The regulator giving rights to a distribution company (discom) over an area of 2 crore consumers, for instance, has to ensure that it has enough power to meet up to the peak demand.

""We are going to propose amendments to the (Electricity) Act that if a discom's demand is 5,000 MW, then it should have entered into PPAs for that amount of power,"" he said.

The Minister said although there was a power market in the country in the way of exchanges, it commanded supplies that were limited and variable.

He said since there was no longer a state monopoly, ""discoms have fallen into the habit of not entering into PPAs, but preferring to depend on the spot market"".

""The root of the problems is the discoms' incapacity to buy power because they are running losses and this fundamental problem needs to be addressed.""

The government has set the next target of providing electricity connections to over four crore remaining rural and urban households by March 2019 under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) initiative.

According to officials here, the average actual household electrification level in rural areas is more than 82 per cent with variations across states.

Singh also noted that the government's budget on rural electrification in the current fiscal at around Rs 22,000 crore was almost at the level spent over the last four years at around Rs 24,000 crore.

On Saturday evening, Leisang village in Manipur's Senapati district became the last village to be connected to the national power grid.

The work of bringing power to India's nearly 6 lakh villages had been undertaken under the government's Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana.

As per government data, 1,236 villages are uninhabited and 35 have been notified as grazing reserves."
1,2018-05-02,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market Index is likely to fall 20 basis points as a result of inclusion of China A-shares, which would entail total outflows of around $540 million by passive funds, said Morgan Stanley in a report.

The MSCI will announce the results of its semi-annual index review on the morning of May 15 and the changes will be effective from June 1.

“Qualified A-share stocks will be included in the MSCI EM index starting in May with an inclusion factor of 2.5% applied to their free-float market cap. By August 2018, the inclusion factor will be increased to 5%... Subsequently, ceteris paribus, India’s weight in EM would likely fall by approximately 20bp (basis points) by August, implying total outflows of around US$540mn (million) by passive funds,” said Morgan Stanley’s Sheela Rathi and Ridham Desai in a report.

In June 2017, MSCI had announced that beginning June 2018, China A-shares will be included in MSCI EM and MSCI ACWI index. India’s weightage in MSCI EM index is 8.5% currently.

In specific stock inclusions, the firm said Pidilite Industries and Power Grid Corporation of India are high-conviction stocks that can be included in the MSCI India index. UltraTech Cement and Container Corporation of India could see an increase in their weightage in the index, which could lead to potential inflows of $49 million and $40 million respectively.

Avenue Supermarts, Future Retail, HDFC Standard Life Insurance and InterGlobe Aviation are also potential candidates for inclusion in the index but the conviction for addition of these stocks is less due to lower free float market capitalisation, said Morgan Stanley.

Tata Motors Differential Voting Rights and Vakrangee could be excluded from the index, said Morgan Stanley.

Sectoral classification changes are also likely. MSCI had announced in November 2017 that the telecommunication services sector will be broadened and renamed as communication services to include companies that facilitate communication and offer related content and information through various media.

Apart from the classification of telecoms sector stocks Bharti Airtel and Bharti Infratel into the communications sector, media stocks like Zee Entertainment would be reclassified into the MSCI India Communications sector from the consumer discretionary sector currently, the report stated."
2,2018-05-02,PowerGrid,"In a note for Wednesday’s session, it was mentioned that volatility (India VIX) was likely to remain at one of the lowest values in recent times. Today’s trade, however, saw volatility making a comeback, as the Nifty oscillated in a 60-point before settling with a nominal loss. The Index lost 21.30 points or 0.20 per cent.

 The market consolidated for the session, but at the same time, remained quite volatile. We expect this volatility to spill over into Thursday’s trade as well.

 Though the start to the trade may be uneventful on either side, we will see the market consolidating with the levels of 10,785 acting as immediate resistance area. On Thursday, the levels of 10,760 and 10,785 will offer resistance to any upmoves, while supports will come in at 10,680 and 10,650 zones.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stands at 67.7129. It remains neutral against the price showing no divergence. The daily MACD stays bullish trading above its signal line. On the candles, a black candle emerged. This has occurred near the upper Bollinger band, and this typically stalls an ongoing upmove.



 Pattern analysis reveals that after breaking out from a rectangle formation, the Nifty is consolidating at higher levels. Though some retracement from current levels should not come as a surprise, it has continued to consolidate in a capped range at present.

 Overall, as we approach trade on Thursday, if we see such consolidation continuing, it should be healthy for the market. Some shorts have started to get build up once again as we are see Nifty premiums getting reduced by nearly 25 points.

 We expect the levels of 10,785 acting as resistance for the immediate short term, and expect the market to oscillate with limited downsides.

 We recommend avoiding shorts and utilising downsides, if any, to make select purchases. Volatility too is likely to remain ingrained in the market.

 Overall exposures should be kept moderate while maintaining a cautious view on the market.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Short positions were seen being built in Hindustan Zinc, ICICI Bank, Idea, Ashok Leyland, Marico, Power Grid, NCC, Tata Power, CG Power, Engineers India, IGL, TVS Motors and Coal India.

13,2018-05-07,PowerGrid,"The domestic equity market on Monday made a buoyant start to the week. The market opened on expected lines with modest gains and traded in a range in the first half of the session. We saw further strength coming in in the second half of the day.

The benchmark Index Nifty50 finally ended the day with a decent gain of 97.25 points or 0.92 per cent. The market has resumed its upmove after a brief corrective spell after testing the immediate past high level of 10,784.

As we approach Tuesday’s trade, we see the upbeat sentiment persisting. The market is likely to enjoy a positive start to the day. That said, market still face chances of consolidation at higher levels, and 10,784 will remain important level to watch for.

Market is still expected to face resistance at these levels in the immediate short term. The levels of 10,765 and 10,790 will act as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports will come in at 10,675 and 10,630 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 63.5806 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish, while trading above its signal line.

Pattern analysis reveals that after achieving a breakout from the broad rectangle zone, the Nifty suffered a classical throwback and suffered a minor corrective decline. After a brief consolidation, Nifty has resumed its upmove. Key would be to see if it faces resistance once again at 10,784 levels.
Overall, a modestly positive, but quiet start is expected in the trade on Tuesday. It is advised not to attempt to create shorts at higher levels. We will continue to see stock specific performance. The undercurrent remains very much buoyant. The levels of 10,784 will be important to be watched as the market may face resistance at higher levels.

Even if some resistance is found at higher levels, the market will see more consolidation once again in a given range than outright correction. We continue recommend making stock specific purchases with any decline that the market offers.

While continuing to guard profits at higher levels, neutral to positive outlook is advised for the day.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen being added in Federal Bank, Nalco, Exide Industries, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, Reliance Naval, Power Grid, PFC, Hind Petro, YES Bank and Titan.

21,2018-05-09,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: India faces the risk of grid collapse because of forecasts of simultaneous storms across the country in the week ahead, prompting officials operating the electricity network to issue a ‘high alert’ to regional centres and cautioning them that severe weather can uproot towers and trip the lines.

The government is closely monitoring power supply situation in view of predictions of storms. The alert follows tripping of several lines last week, following storms in northern India. Power Grid Corp’s unit that operates the grid, POSOCO, has issued highalert advisories to all the regional centres to avoid grid collapse. Leaves of all concerned officers have been cancelled, Power Grid Corp CMD IS Jha said.

“We are always prepared for unforeseen circumstances and in case of bad weather predictions we keep our Emergency Restoration System on alert. The system ensures alternate arrangements so that there are no power supply disruptions,” Jha told ET.

The met department had predicted thunderstorm, dust storm and squall at many places in northern India on Tuesday. On Wednesday and Thursday, the weathermen have predicted thunderstorm accompanied with squall with up to 70 kmph wind speed over West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim. 

Heavy rains are expected in Karnataka and TN and heat wave conditions are expected in Rajasthan and Vidarbha on Thursday and Friday. Fresh western disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region between May 12 and 15. Jha told ET the Indian electricity grid has robust arrangements to withstand such conditions.

Thunderstorm and dust storms in the northern region last week led to tripping of multiple high capacity power transmission lines, leading to sudden load crash of 14,000 MW, but there has been no major impact on grid operations or power supply, he said. 

During the storms, complete 765 kV Agra station went offline due to outage of multiple lines following equipment damage or tower collapses. Total of 87 transmission lines of voltage level 220 kV and above tripped in the intervening night of May 2 and 3, a POSOCO official said."

The Nifty50 index managed to hold above its support at 10,785 and headed towards 10,929 level in Tuesday’s trade. However, it failed to hold at higher levels and wiped out its entire gains as the day progressed as Karnataka poll verdict didn’t produce any winner with a simple majority.

The index continued to hit higher lows for the seventh consecutive session, but formed a Shooting Star candle on the daily chart, which indicated that the bears are quite active at higher levels.

Now, Nifty has to hold above 10,785 to extend its move towards 10,888 and then 10,950 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,725 and then 10,680 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,700 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,800. Meaningful Put writing was seen at strike price 10,800 followed by 10,900, which shifted its support to higher level. Minor Call writing was seen at 11,200 and 11,000 levels. Options data suggested an immediate trading range between 10,700 and 10,900 levels.

India VIX fell 7.55 per cent to 13.16 level, as the market got stuck in a range after Karnataka election results.

Bank Nifty remained highly volatile throughout the session. It rallied more than 500 points, but later witnessed sustained selling and formed a pattern similar to the Long-Legged Doji, which implied that preceding trend was losing momentum. As long as it holds above 26,250 level, the immediate trend for Nifty should remain intact and it can move towards the 26,750- 26,850 zone, while on the downside, supports are seen near the 26,100 mark.

Nifty futures closed flat to positive with a marginal gain of 0.01 per cent at 10,816. Long buildup was seen in Power Grid, Colgate Palmolive, Bajaj Finance, Lupin, IndusInd Bank and Tata Steel while shorts were seen in Allahabad Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, ACC, Tata Motors DVR, BEL, Tata Global, PC Jeweller, NCC, Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, OFSS, Cummins India and SBI.

84,2018-05-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government proposes to set up charging stations for electric vehicles every three kilometres in cities with million-plus population and smart cities, and every 50 km on busy national highways.

It is likely to offer fiscal incentives and facilitate land from municipal authorities for those interested in setting up the infrastructure, which is a key requirement for the proliferation of electric vehicles.

“It is expected that 30,000 slowcharging and 15,000 fast-charging stations will be required to be put up in a phase-wise manner in the next 3-5 years. There should be at least two high-charge points and one fast-charging point at every three kilometres in cities. Similarly, there should be electric vehicle charging station every 50 km on highways,” a senior government official said.

Land for setting up the charging stations is likely to be identified in consultation with local authorities and electricity distribution utilities and given on long-term lease to companies willing to set up the facilities, another government official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Public sector undertakings in the energy sector such as NTPC, Power Grid Corp and Indian Oil Corp are likely to initiate the process to set up charging stations at several locations in identified cities.

The government is considering to provide subsidies to the PSUs for the roll out programme, the official said.

NTPC is already setting up such facilities in Maharashtra. Power Grid Corp last week said it signed an agreement with L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Ltd for developing charging infrastructure at metro stations for e-cars and ethree wheelers in Hyderabad.

The company said it plans to build charging infrastructure at all metro rail corridors.

Automakers including Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors to cab-hailing companies Ola and Uber, state-run enterprises and startups are all interested in setting up charging infrastructure for electric vehicles."

Some of Asia’s biggest infrastructure investors are seeing plenty of opportunities in India. In China’s mammoth Belt-and-Road initiative, however, not so much.

India is a key market for Macquarie Group thanks to strong economic growth and state asset sales, said Frank Kwok, co-head of Asia Pacific at Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets. Hence its recent purchase of nine toll-roads with charges indexed to inflation.

China’s Belt-and-Road, however is more driven by geopolitics than investment returns, he said at the Bloomberg Invest Australia summit in Sydney on Wednesday.

“It’s very much a China-led initiative, but really it’s about the entire region,” said Kwok. “But because one of the main drivers is that it’s for China to exert its influence over the region, financial returns are probably not the top priority.”

Asia’s developing economies will need to spend about $22.6 trillion on projects like roads, bridges, ports and railways over the 15 years to 2030 in order to maintain economic growth and reduce poverty, according to the Asian Development Bank. China has stepped in to fund some of those investments with Belt-and-Road.


Grand Plan
President Xi’s vision, first proposed in 2013 and now enshrined in the Communist Party’s constitution, involves spending as much as $1.2 trillion on railways, roads, ports and power grids over the next decade, according to Morgan Stanley. The intent is to open new business opportunities for domestic companies and extend China’s reach -- even though the route cuts through multiple conflict zones and some of the world’s most corrupt countries.

Still, India poses its own challenges, said Cyril Cabanes, head of Asia Pacific infrastructure transactions at Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada’s second-biggest pension-fund manager. He says the opportunity is clear, but the deals are slow to come.

“The size of the market is well known, but the velocity of deals coming to market and getting done has been generally fairly low,” he said. “It’s not just about putting capital in, it’s about generating returns and then moving on to the next opportunity, which India hasn’t quite graduated to.”"
86,2018-05-16,PowerGrid,"The domestic equity market ended on a flat note on Tuesday as uncertainty over government formation in Karnataka hit market sentiment.

While the Nifty50 settled almost flat at 10,801, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, signalled downward crossovers on 50 counters on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Among the stocks that witnessed downward crossovers in Tuesday’s session were Punjab National Bank, ITC, HDFC Standard Life, Bank of India, Arvind, Tata Chemicals, KPIT Technologies, Exide Industries, Engineers India and Adani Transmission.

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Other stocks that saw bearish crossovers included Snowman Logistics, Central Bank, Kalpataru Power, Info Edge, Dalmia Bharat, Lux Industries and Lumax Industries.

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator and is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal’ line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD slips below the signal line, it gives a bearish signal on the charts, indicating that the price of the security may experience a downward trend or vice-versa.




However, the MACD alone may not be sufficient to help take an investment call.

MACD charts also showed bullish crossovers on 24 counters on Tuesday, signalling opportunities to buy these stocks ahead of a new price spike.

The stocks included JSW Steel, Power Grid, JBM Auto, V-Mart Retail, Sadbhav Engineering, VST Industries, and Somany Ceramics.



The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 12.77 points, or 0.04 per cent, down at 35543.94 on Tuesday.

On further movement of the Nifty index, Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said as long as Nifty holds above the 10,785 level, it can extend its move towards 10,888 and then 10,950 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,725 and then 10,680 levels.”

India VIX moved down 6.89 per cent to 13.2625 in the previous trading session.

89,2018-05-17,PowerGrid,"HDFC Bank, which for long stayed away from funding projects, is getting into the game, thanks to the many changes brought in by the government — be it in road building, or power transmission. Banks understand financing projects, bond market can’t finance projects, unless they are credit wrapped, says Rakesh Singh, head of investment banking at HDFC Bank in an interview with Saikat Das and M C Govardhana Rangan. Edited excerpts:

What’s the new thrust that HDFC Bank is bringing into investment banking after remaining a relatively low-profile player all these years when you focused just on basic banking? 

There’s a good opportunity for capital funding. If you see that way, we are still less than 1%, being the largest or one of the best. One thing we are very happy about is that in investment banking there were a lot of global names. Not anymore. Globally, investment banking generates a lot of variants for big banks. Even we are heading in the same way.

The regulator is also pushing for fund raising through bonds. Can it succeed? They are advising companies to go tap the bond market which is good. But I think, for project finance you need a loan. You just can’t raise funds from the bond market. Banks understand financing projects. Bond markets can’t finance projects, unless they are credit wrapped. Any long-term project cannot be funded by the bond market, because bond market expects highly rated paper and only then you can raise volumes. So, if you have to raise ₹5,000 crore for a refinery project, bond market can’t do that.


Your CEO Mr Aditya Puri has been averse to project funding. What has changed now? 

He basically says a very simple thing - if you can understand the risks, go ahead. Till you can box the risks and do it very well, he has no objection to it. So, last year, we were the leaders in HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model) financing for roads. This year we are just rolling out. Last year, we did close to nine hybrid annuity project financing. We are continuously evolving. Project finance or underwriting has a learning curve. So, when you learn from other projects, you basically ensure the other products do not have the same issues.


What has changed in the landscape for you go to for road funding?

The government itself has done a fair bit of it. For example, they have said that land has to be 80% in possession. Most bidders have become smarter to understand that you don’t want to overcommit on projects. We further have our own internal norms, saying what is the minimum rating on which we will work with sponsors… what are the stretches we will work with the sponsors, because certain stretches are easier to work and some are more difficult to work. There are issues with availability of land, such as stone quarrying issues. There are sectors where it is difficult to get manpower. So we are saying we will not go to those sectors. Then we want to work with sponsors who do their own work, not who further sub-contract.


When you say you are into project lending, what are the things you do to avoid the mistakes other banks committed?

Wherever we are lending we will go sector by sector. We are happy to be in transmission because they are very stable contracts. Power Grid is the central canalising agent – which collects payments for everyone. So, payment history is good. For transmission we are happy to be connected. Similarly, NTPC also looks good. If the tariffs are good, we are happy to look at that and evaluate. All in all, it is the risk assessment of each individual project. There is no one size fits all. So, we go to each project, look at that whether it works or not and then decide whether this is what we want to do. The evaluation to final approval success is 30%, maybe 25%. So 1 out of 3 of 4 projects is finally what we do.


What are the things you would require if I were to come to you tomorrow to borrow?

I would look at your balance sheet first. What your total commitments are. So, today on your balance sheet if you have commitments of, say, Rs 500 crore of equity, I must see Rs 500 core of equity on your balance sheet - first thing. Next, if you have committed more than that, I would say I might as well. Number 2, are you yourself doing a project? Have you done projects in that region earlier, how will you manage the project. What is your experience of execution at that stage in terms of manpower mobilisation, what season are you picking up the project in? Are you just before the monsoon?


You are rarely present in equity market. What’s the plan to be there?

We are mandated in many upcoming issues and you would see it. We are 6th in the IPO league table. We don’t work for free. It is hard work, so we should earn. You will collectively see the money being raised close to be anywhere between ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 crore over the next 12 to 18 months.


What is triggering your excitement about wealth business where you are hiring?

People have become wealthy. Two, the overall wealth has increased India’s GDP is 2.5 trillion, let’s say at the last count. Every year you grow about 8%, so every year you are adding close to about 200 billion dollars to this. We serve across India. We have currently 250 to 300 Relationship Managers. We have the largest feet on street. We have got close to today say about a ballpark of 16,000-17,000 families and we have managed close to a lakh-crore total assets under management."

The company’s annual revenue is expected to cross the Rs 10,000-crore mark in FY19 and its order book stands at a record high of over Rs 17,000 crore, said Kejriwal. “Brazil will announce transmission and distribution orders in June and November, and we hope to pick up orders from developers.

Orders from Indian states would be a major growth driver as Power Grid has been slightly slow in orders. But typically, six to eight months before elections a lot of orders are finalised, so we expect good orders from central utilities ahead of the 2019 polls,” said Kejriwal.

“Saarc countries, especially Bangladesh and Nepal, are spending huge amounts on T&D, and this offers great opportunity,” Kejriwal said. “We already have 11-12 jobs from Saarc and revenue from this should be in excess of Rs 1,000 core in FY19. It is growing at 25%.”"

99,2018-05-24,PowerGrid,"Though the market was expected to find some stability, the Nifty traded contrary to expectations on Thursday. After making a tepid start and losing ground in the initial trade, the index rebounded sharply and nearly tested the 100-DMA. The index ended with a gain of 83.50 points or 0.80 per cent.

On technical parameters, the Nifty has defended the 50-DMA levels on closing basis, which stood at 10,471.60.

For Friday, we expect this attempt of a pullback to continue. However, the 100-DMA level of 10,538 still remains a concern, as Nifty isn’t completely out of the woods as yet. Friday is likely to see the levels of 10,538 and 10,595 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports came in lower at 10,470 and 10,380 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 44.16 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. It has started to narrow its trajectory. On the candles, a strong bullish candle emerged. It has emerged near the support area of 50-DMA, and therefore it holds some significance.

The pattern analysis throws up an interesting picture. The 50-DMA rules below 100-DMA level and this indicates likely continuation of short-term weakness. The Nifty has pulled back from near the 50-DMA and this has validated 50-DMA as support for the immediate short term. However, it has still resisted to the 100-DMA mark, which stands at 10,538.



Overall, the level of 10,538, which is the 100-DMA, has come into play again.

Though a quiet start is expected and some followup move may still be seen, the Nifty can still find resistance at 100-DMA levels. Any fresh sustainable upmove shall occur only after the Nifty moves past and closes above this level. Until this happen, theoretically speaking, the market remains susceptible to selling pressure at higher levels.

Rawat also said Pakistan should stop sending militants into the state if it was interested in peace.

""If Pakistan really wants peace, then we will want them to take the first step by stopping infiltration of terrorists into our side. The ceasefire violation mostly takes place to aid infiltration,"" Gen Rawat told reporters at a function here, 95 kms from Srinagar.

The army chief said India wants peace along the borders but Pakistan was continuously violating the ceasefire, which caused loss of life and property.

""When such an action takes place, we also have to respond. We cannot sit idle. If there is ceasefire violation, then there will be action from our side,"" he said.

Gen Rawat said for peace, it was imperative that cross-border terrorism comes to an end.

""It is imperative to stop terrorism from across (the LoC), the camps which are there where training is given to them, from where the ammunition is infiltrated into J-K and India, that should stop. If that happens, then I can assure you that peace will prevail on the borders,"" he added.

The Army chief said the suspension of anti-militancy operations in Jammu and Kashmir was an attempt to make people realise the benefits of peace.

""The suspension of operations or what we call NICO (Non initiation of combat operations) has been done to make the people believe and see how the atmosphere is when there is peace. The way an atmosphere of peace and calm is here right now, in my opinion, the people here are very happy with that,"" he said.

The Union home ministry had announced on May 16 that security forces would not launch any operations in J&K during the holy month of Ramzan. However, the security forces reserve the right to retaliate if attacked or if essential to protect the lives of innocent people.

Gen Rawat said the Army will think about continuing the unilateral ceasefire if the peaceful situation continues in the valley.

""If this atmosphere of peace continues, then I assure you that we will think about continuing with NICO. But if there is some action by the terrorists, then we will have to rethink on this ceasefire or suspension of operations or NICO,"" he said.

Gen Rawat was here to launch Digital Education in five Army Goodwill Schools which has been established with the help of Power Grid Corporation and Extra Marks Foundation.

""Children in AGPS should get right kind of education. Their education standards should keep improving. Knowledge and education today needs infusion of technology. With this aim, we have taken help from PGC and Extra Marks foundation to start Digital education here,"" he said.

Gen Rawat said the Corporation has contributed nearly Rs 25 lakh and Extra Marks foundation is providing support.

""This will be started in five army good schools on pilot basis. We would like to extend this technology to other Army Goodwill Schools also. We want the children from here develop and progress in life,"" he added."
102,2018-05-25,PowerGrid,"State-run Power Grid Corporation today said it will complete by the first week of next month the restoration work of transmission lines damaged in windstorms. 

 ""Work for restoration of balance 12 transmission lines is in full swing with mobilisation of 39 gangs consisting of 1,000+ persons and is expected to be restored by the first week of June 2018,"" PowerGrid said in a statement. 

 PowerGrid has restored 54 transmission lines on war footing within 24 to 30 hours that had been damaged in the severe windstorms of speed up to 130 km/hr that hit several parts of India this month. 

 About 66 transmission elements, including several sub-station equipment, were reported damaged. 

 The company said swift action taken by it for the restoration of lines/substation equipment minimised the impact of line trippings on the national grid and it was able to meet the power demand of 160 GW of the country, which is the highest so far. 

 PowerGrid Chairman and MD I S Jha told that the company has reviewed its plan to strengthen the transmission network in view of change in high speed wind zones. 

 He further said, ""The areas in the country are divided into 4-5 wind zones depending upon the wind speeds which can be as high as 170 km per hour during storms. Zone 1 has low wind speed while Zone 5 has the maximum speed. The National Capital Region and Agra were not in high wind speed zone. 

 ""Their zone has changed. Accordingly we are strengthening our network here."" 

 Jha said, ""PowerGrid did all its efforts and tried to reduce the impact of wind storm on power supply and grid stability. Despite such a natural disaster, our grid did not fail."""

103,2018-05-26,PowerGrid,"The Indian Railways has decided to revamp its antiquated signalling system in phases to enhance safety and increase average speed of trains. The national transporter plans to introduce the new European Train Control System-2 (ETCS2) which will allow it to increase train speeds significantly and, as a result, run more trains with the same infrastructure, officials said.

The new technology allows trains to run in shorter blocks, which means trains can run on the same track with a minimum distance of just 500 metres between them. The first such signalling system will be installed on the highly congested Delhi-Mughalsarai section. Indian Railways expects companies such as Bombardier and Alstom to bid for the project, according to officials.

“At the recent Rail Board meeting, the 830-km Delhi-Mughalsarai section was identified for ETCS2 signalling. This will be carried out through a joint venture with Power Grid Corporation for signalling and with Railtel for communication.

Since the Delhi-Mughalsarai route has very high traffic density, modern signalling will help in decongestion,” said a railways ministry official, who did not wish to be identified. “Modern signalling will help reduce congestion in rail network and increase line capacity by 40-50%,” he said.

The ability to run more trains on tracks will also help the railways improve its chequered record in terms of punctuality.

“It will eliminate train delays due to automated signalling and real-time information of train movements being made available, eliminating the need for manual data logging,” the official said.

Besides, the move will enhance safety on tracks. In 2017-18, 73 accidents had taken place on railway tracks. “Signalling will potentially eliminate human induced rail accidents to zero,” the official said. In a recent review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the railways was told to go for a signalling technology which was financially viable and indigenous.

The ministry official said that once the ETCS2 technology is tried on the Delhi-Mughalsarai section, foreign companies will be invited to set up the signalling equipment manufacturing plants in India.

“The European technology will be price competitive and in later stages we also plan to manufacture it locally under ‘Make in India’,” he said."
104,2018-05-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government plans to award a big chunk of new transmission corridors worth Rs 25,000 crore to Power Grid Corp (PGCIL) on nomination basis citing urgency, evoking protests from private players in the sector. 

The Tariff Policy provides for award of power transmission projects only through bidding, but it allows the Central government to allot them to staterun PGCIL based on strategic importance, technical upgradation or urgent situations. 

“Most of the projects awarded to PGCIL on consideration of compressed time frame have not met the objective as about 90% of the projects got delayed,” Electric Power Transmission Association director general Subhash Sethi said. “It could be inferred that planning of power system with PGCIL, also the central transmission utility, has gone awry. Yet, PGCIL benefits by getting projects on nomination basis.” 

The government has identified dedicated transmission corridors and substations with capacity to transmit about 18,500 MW electricity from wind and solar plants in western and southern regions. The per megawatt cost of the projects is estimated upwards of Rs 1.25 crore. 



Others

Private transmission companies said discrimination between public and private companies is not in line with the intent of the Electricity Act to promote competition. Private companies last week had expressed resentment against the Centre’s decision to allocate more coal to PSU power plants. They demanded that any excess coal be distributed on merit rather than on ownership basis, particularly when the private sector is reeling under stress. 

A PowerGrid Corp spokesperson said the company was not aware of the development. A government official said a major portion of the projects could go to the state-run firm as there was severe transmission constraint, particularly in places like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu that needed to be addressed immediately. He said the transmission congestion could not be envisaged earlier as renewable energy project developers are swarming a few locations due to favourable conditions. 

As per the government official, there is a mismatch of 1-2 years between commissioning of renewable energy projects and associated transmission infrastructure, necessitating the need for intervention by PGCIL. The industry executive said awarding the contracts to PGCIL would deny private companies of large orders."

Crude oil prices declined in global markets after Russia, the US and Saudi Arabia said they will increase the output to ease production cuts.

Besides, global cues radiated optimism as US officials prepare for a meeting between Donald Trump and Kim.

The Sensex index added 241 points, or 0.69 per cent, to finish the day at 35,165, while the Nifty index climbed 84 points, or 0.79 per cent to end Monday's session at 10,689.

As many as 23 stocks remained in the green in the Sensex, while 8 in the red.

In the Nifty pack, 34 closed the day with gains and 16 suffered losses.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outpaced Sensex, closing 1.35 per cent and 1.60 per cent up, respectively.

HDFC Bank, Larsen & Toubro, Sun Pharma and ITC remained the key contributors to the rally in Sensex.

On the contrary, TCS, Infosys, Power Grid Corporation, Mahindra & Mahindra and Bharti Airtel remained the top drags.

Barring BSE IT and teck, all sectors closed the day in the green, with oil & gas, capital goods and healthcare rising over 2 per cent.

Sun Pharma surged 7.11 per cent after it reported on Friday a 6.93 per cent rise in consolidated profit at Rs 1,375.62 crore for the quarter to March, which was above ET Now poll of Rs 895 crore.

Larsen & Toubro settled 2.52 per cent up on Monday. The company post market hours reported a 4.69 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 3,167 crore for the March quarter, beating Rs 3,098 crore estimated by analysts in an ET Now poll.

Shares of Manpasand Beverages plunged 20 per cent, hitting its 52-week lows of 344.80, after Deloitte Haskins and Sells resigned as auditor ahead of the company's quarterly results scheduled to be released on Wednesday.

105,2018-05-28,PowerGrid,"With year-on-year revenue and net profit growth of 17% and 14% respectively, ABB India reported decent results for the first quarter of 2018-19. The engineering services company’s strong performance in power grid, robotics, and motion and renewable energy segments bolstered its overall performance. ABB India’s exports too did reasonably well during this period.

All power equipment manufacturers have been underperforming because the demand from the traditional capital expenditure market—conventional energy projects— has been weak. However, after several years of stagnation, now green shoots are visible in the capital expenditure cycle with most of the demand coming from sectors such as cement, FMCG and transportation.

ABB India’s new verticals are doing well now. Its focus on future ready segments such as solar inverters, fast-charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, micro grids, etc. will be help the company in the long term. The market for export of these new solutions is also big. For instance, ABB India has signed agreements with Volkswagen to set up fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in the US. Successful implementation of this project will give the company a head start when similar projects come up in India. Upgrading of emission norms by the Indian auto industry from Bharat IV to Bharat VI will also bring new opportunities to ABB India.

While the recent jump in commodity prices has brought its margins under pressure, ABB India is expected to maintain its Ebitda margin by raising prices and improving operational efficiency. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. According to analysts’ consensus estimate, ABB India is expected to report annualised revenue and net profit growth of 19% and 27% respectively between 2017 and 2019.

Though ABB India is a quality company and is a good proxy for the expected cyclical recovery in capital expenditure, its high valuation used to be a major deterrent. This has been partly offset by the counter’s 35% under performance compared to the Sensex during the past year. But even though the counter is now trading at close to the lower range of its six-year valuation history, it is still expensive compared to its peers. So, investors should get into this counter only with a long-term view of at least three years.

The company has already approached the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) for approval on the same, PGCIL chairman and managing director IS Jha told reporters here today.

""We have 1.5 lakh towers across the country. We wanted to use them for the telecom business where we can give it to telecom operators. It will be a good source of income for us,"" he said.

Jha further said since the government has emphasised on reducing consumption of diesel to reduce pollution, the telecom operators will have a good option in our towers.

Telecom regulator Trai has recommended 40 per cent reduction in carbon emission in the telecom network by 2022-23, with base year being 2011-12.

The regulator has also suggested that the government should pass all the benefits granted under various schemes for using renewable energy technologies to telecom operators.

""We hope that even if 10-20 per cent of our assets would be utilised, it will give good business,"" Jha added.

Power Grid has set a capex of Rs 25,000 crore for the current financial year and plans to raise around 70 per cent of it through debt, especially domestic bonds.

The company at present has total works of worth around Rs 1,10,000 crore scheduled for completion in the next two to three years. Of this, around Rs 75,000 crore worth of projects are ongoing and about Rs 2,500 are new, he said.

The Nifty50 index opened with a gap down on Wednesday, but managed to hold its support of 10,550 and bounced to the 10,650 level. However, the index remained highly volatile during the session ahead of Thursday’s F&O expiry. The index formed a bullish candle on the daily scale and got stuck in the grip of option writers.

Now, it has to continue to hold above 10,550 to extend the gains towards 10,680 and then 10,725 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,550 level.

The Nifty50 is flattish on an expiry-to-expiry basis as the April series closed at 10,617 and it hovered near the same zone. The volume weighted average price or VWAP of the entire series and week was at 10,680 and that is likely to act as an immediate hurdle. Nifty remained volatile in a broader trading range between 10,418 and 10,929 levels, but option writers kept their grip on the market for most part of the series.

It has seen lower rollover compared with the average of last six months, while roll cost was very low comparatively, which suggests a neutral market stance for the foreseeable future.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was intact at 10,500 followed by 10,600, while maximum Call OI was at 10,800 followed by 10,700. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,500 while significant call writing was seen at 10,600 then 10,550. Options data suggested a broader trading range between 10,550 and 10,700 levels.

India VIX moved up 2.16 per cent to 13.41 level.

Bank Nifty opened with a gap down but managed to hold its support in the 25,950-26,000 zone and rebounded to 26,400 level. It remained highly volatile throughout the session. It erased intraday losses and formed a Bullish Candle, which suggests the decline was bought into.

Bank Nifty has to hold above 26,250 to witness any upward move towards 26,500 and then 26,750 levels, while on declines, major support is seen near 26,100 and 26,000 levels.

Bank Nifty is up 5.27 per cent on expiry-to-expiry basis as the April series settled at 25,010. Bank Nifty outperformed the Nifty index significantly, on buying in HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank.

Bank Nifty is trading higher than its series VWAP of 26,000, while the weekly VWAP comes near the 26,500 level. The VWAPs are now likely to act as support and resistance for the index.

Nifty futures closed flat at 10,613. Long buildup was seen in Petronet, M&M Financial, Bharat Financial, PowerGrid, Tata Elxsi, Havells, M&M, Pidilite Industries and TVS Motor while shorts were seen in Shriram Transport Finance, Motherson Sumi, Tata Motor DVR, Ambuja Cement, Hindalco and Oil India.

Reliance Industries: The owner of the world's biggest refining complex, is planning to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a first sign that new US sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran.

15,2018-06-03,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government is readying a roadmap to lower its stake in all central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to 49% in three years, except for those operating in sectors of strategic importance such as defence and oil. This will increase autonomy, reduce political interference and also raise the valuation of the remaining government holding.

The companies in which the government is likely to pare its stake include large ones such as NTPC Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd among others. The companies are being identified by the government’s apex planning body, NITI Aayog, said a senior government official aware of the deliberations. There are over 250 CPSEs in which the government holds 51% or more.

“The plan is to reduce government’s stake in most CPSEs to at least 49% over the next three years besides ensuring that the boards of these firms are more professionally managed,” he said.

According to the official, the government has no business to be running these companies and should focus instead on social sector development. “We must exit all companies except the ones that have some strategic importance,” the official added.

There is no change in law required as in the case of state-run lenders, where the Banking Companies (Acquisition & Transfer of Undertakings) Act mandates a minimum 51% government holding.


Another government official said some of the firms where the government may like to retain majority stake will be in the defence and oil sectors. “In some companies such as BPCL and HPCL the government has to maintain at least 51% holding as a Supreme Court verdict in 2003 had restrained the government from privatising them,” he added. Under Section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013, a government company is one in which not less than 51% of the paid-up capital is held by the central government or a state government or partly by both or one or more state governments.

A senior finance ministry official said that the government has to take a balanced approach and not all CPSEs can be privatised.

“It depends on how fast NITI Aayog recommendations are taken up by the respective administrative ministries,” he said.

The finance ministry official said that lowering stakes to 49% or below will depend on whether changes are required to certain laws. He also said that the government would need to take a call on whether to lower stakes in companies that serve “social needs.”

The government will not look for strategic sales in most of these offerings but prefer stake dilution through the secondary market such as follow-on public offers or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The government has set a divestment target of Rs 80,000 crore in this fiscal. Niti Aayog has been entrusted with the task of identifying companies for disinvestment. Under CEO Amitabh Kant, it has so far proposed five lists totalling over 45 PSUs for strategic sales and disinvestment, most of which have already been approved by the union cabinet.

Last year, NITI Aayog suggested strategic disinvestment of 34 sick public sector units after the Prime Minister’s Office asked it to look into the viability of such companies. It recently moved the fifth list with 11 PSUs for to the finance ministry and PMO.

Of the total, eight, including Scooters India and Pawan Hans, are in the process of inviting expressions of interest while five, including Engineers Project (India) and Hindustan Prefabs, will be merged with other CPSEs.

In seven other CPSEs such as HLL Lifecare and Dredging Corporation of India Ltd, the government is in the process of appointing advisors to lay out a roadmap for disinvestment."

23,2018-06-04,PowerGrid,"Indian equity market saw a volatile session on Monday as the Nifty continued to oscillate in a range, but continued with its corrective decline as well. The market made a negative start to the week, as Nifty ended 67.70 points or 0.63 per cent down.

The NSE benchmark slipped below its short term 20-DMA and the overall structure of the charts suggest that such tentative mood of the market is likely to persist for some time.

Significant amount of short positions were seen being added in the system. Given the amount of shorts, we might see a modestly positive opening to the trade on Tuesday.

However, the Nifty continues to remain vulnerable to selling pressure at higher levels until some fresh area formation helps prepare a base for Nifty for a fresh upmove. Tuesday will see the levels of 10,650 and 10,735 acting as immediate resistance levels. Supports may come in at 10,580 and 10,540 zones.


Bloomberg
The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is 50.4630. RSI stays neutral and shows no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. A big black candle emerged. This remains significant as it occurred near the 20-DMA and this gives credibility to the resistance area in the present situation.

If we look at the pattern analysis, Nifty has slipped below the 20-DMA while lending credibility to the short-term resistance area. The Nifty remain in very close vicinity of the 100-DMA support area and is expected to continue to spend some more time in the present broad range.

Overall, though a modestly positive opening is not ruled out on Tuesday, the Nifty still continues to remain vulnerable to some selling pressure at higher levels.

However, given the amount of shorts that exist in the system, it is likely to keep the overall downsides limited. All this translates into a likely rangebound session with some amount of volatility remaining ingrained.

Cautious view is advised for the day.

Sebi Lens on FPIs Run by NRIs
The Securities and Exchange Board of India has asked custodians of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to identify offshore funds that are ‘controlled’ by non-resident Indians. Sebi, acting on the government’s instructions, has made it clear through fresh restrictions on investments and in subsequent meetings over the past few weeks that it’s not in favour of NRIs using FPI vehicles to trade on Indian stock exchanges. This is primarily due to a suspicion that resident Indians have been using NRI friends and relatives to bring back and legitimise undisclosed funds parked abroad through registered FPIs.


9 PSU Banks Submit Recovery Plan

Nine of the 11 PSU banks, which are currently under RBI watch for poor financial health, have submitted a two-year recovery plan to the government entailing stake sale in subsidiaries and reduction of corporate loan book. The 11 banks under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) are Dena Bank, Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India, Corporation Bank, IDBI Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Bank of Maharashtra. Meanwhile, a TOI report said that the government is pushing loss-making state-run banks to sell their riskier assets to larger peers, such as SBI, to reduce the capital requirement of public sector lenders, that have been hit hard by the RBI’s latest norms on provisioning for bad debt. 


ICICI Bank Searches for New Chairman
The board of ICICI Bank has begun looking for a new chairman as the term of the incumbent, MK Sharma, expires at the end of this month and he may not want a second term. Veteran banker and former Bank of Baroda chairman and managing director MD Mallya is the frontrunner to succeed Sharma, two people aware of the development said. Mallya was appointed to the ICICI Bank board on May 29. The ICICI Bank board led by Sharma has been criticised in the past for its support for the CEO. The board, which last week ordered an inquiry, had cleared Kochhar of all alleged misdoings in a strongly worded statement on March 28.


Concessions for Exporters?
Good news for exporters! In view of the adverse impact of the goods and services tax (GST) on exports — particularly in handicrafts, apparel and carpet sectors — the government is considering making concessions in rates and allowing additional input tax credits to the industry. This may include a reduction of rates on finished carpets and expanding the list of duty-free imports of essential embellishment to make them competitive in the international market. The government is concerned over the fact that since October last year, exports of ready-made garments have significantly declined. 


Car Sales Zoom
Who cares if oil prices are touching record highs? Vehicle makers across segments posted strong sales for the second straight month in May, driven by a growing economy, launches and as customers advanced buying expecting price hikes. The Indian passenger vehicle market is estimated to have broken the 3-lakh-units-a-month barrier after eight months, with dispatches close to the peak volumes seen in last September which was a festive month.

Floating the Oil Boat
OPEC and non-OPEC Arab oil ministers stressed the need for continued cooperation between oil producers who are part of a pact for a global supply cut that is due to expire at the end of 2018. OPEC ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Algeria along with their counterpart from non-OPEC Oman gathered in Kuwait on Saturday for an unofficial meeting of a joint ministerial committee that monitors compliance with the agreement. OPEC could raise oil output as soon as June to cool the market and due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far. In India state-run oil marketing firms marginally lowered petrol prices for the fifth consecutive day on Sunday under the dynamic pricing regime.


Green Nod for Illegal Mines

The Centre will give environment clearance (EC) to regularise illegal mining projects provided the companies pay penalty as directed by the Supreme Court, the environment ministry has said. The apex court in its August 2, 2017 order had said the mining companies in Odisha operating without EC will have to pay a 100% penalty to the state. 


Growth & Hand of Govt
The ""hand of government"" was the main driver behind the rise in January-March GDP growth to 7.7% -- the fastest pace in seven quarters -- as exports and private consumption disappointed, says an HSBC report. The report cited four key drivers for the rise in growth print -- core GVA (Gross Value Added), the public spending component of GVA, construction, and rise in central and state government fiscal deficits. According to HSBC, the public spending component of GVA and the government consumption component of GDP grew at a rapid pace, accounting for roughly one-fifth of overall growth.

The companies in which the government is likely to pare its stake include NTPC, Steel Authority of India and Power Grid Corporation of India among others.

FUNDAMENTALS

Rupee Up: The Indian rupee stormed ahead to end at a near one-month high of 67.06 against the US dollar, surging by 35 paise after a flurry of upbeat economic data bolstered confidence in the growth outlook.

The 7.17% 10-year benchmark bond maturing in 2028 weakened to Rs 95.48 from Rs 95.62, while its yield moved up to 7.85% from 7.83%. The 7.59% G-Secs maturing in 2026 eased to Rs 97.1075 from Rs 97.3275, while its yield edged up to 8.10% from 8.06%. The 6.68% G-Secs maturing in 2031 gained to Rs 89.23 from Rs 89.18, while its yield edged down to 8.01% from 8.02%. The 6.84% G-Secs maturing in 2022, the 6.65% G-Secs maturing in 2020 and the 8.24% G-Secs maturing in 2027 were also quoted lower to Rs 96.23, Rs 98.44 and Rs 100.84 respectively.

16,2018-06-04,PowerGrid,"Skipper, one of the leading manufacturers of power transmission and distribution (T&D) structures, has reported lacklustre results in the fourth quarter of 2017-18. While its net sales moved up 5%, net profit fell 15%, year on year (y-o-y). Muted performance of its core engineering products division—transmission business contributes around 83% of its sales—and its new PVC pipes business are the main reasons for this.

However, analysts believe that the current dull phase is a short-term phenomenon and Skipper will get back to high growth soon. Skipper continues to bag orders from companies such as Power Grid Corp, state electricity boards, telecom and solar operators, etc. It has bagged new orders—domestic and overseas—worth Rs 620 crore in the fourth quarter.

The company is benefitting from the continued power infrastructure push by the central government in states like Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and the North-East. Overseas orders, mostly from Europe and South-East Asia, are also expected to get a boost because of the recent appreciation in the rupee— it will improve the company’s price competitiveness. Since its order book of Rs 2,627 crore (as of March) is larger than its annual sales, there is clear visibility on future earnings as well.

Diversification into PVC pipes business and its less than-expected growth has been a drag on the company. For example, while the Ebitda margin of T&D division improved 245 basis points to 19.6%, margin from the pipes division fell 36 basis points to 7.5%. To streamline the operations from the PVC division, Skipper has engaged an agency that will advise it on improving its supply chain management and on tie-ups with channel partners across India. Analysts are confident that this segment will gain good market share by 2019-20.

After the 40% under performance during the past six months—34% price fall compared to 6% rise in the Sensex—the stock is now valued reasonably. This, coupled with clear revenue visibility because of its strong order book, increased business opportunity from its core T&D business and new pipe business, make Skipper a good buying opportunity now. If growth happens as expected by consensus estimate—annualised revenue and net profit growth of 17% and 26% respectively between 2017-18 and 2019-20—it will lead to a re-rating in the counter.

Investment rationale by Emkay Global
We have lowered our capitalisation target to Rs300bn p.a for FY19E–FY20E (vs earlier expectation of Rs325bn for each year). Accordingly we have trimmed our earnings estimate by 4.7% for FY19E and by 4.5% for FY20E. We now expect PGCIL to clock EPS CAGR of 19.2% over FY18-FY20E and generate RoE of 17.6% by FY20E (vs earlier expectation of 18.0% in FY20E). We have assigned a target multiple of 1.6x to its FY20E regulated equity, 1.0x multiple to its TBCB project equity and 1.0x multiple to its CWIP equity, as capitalisation will happen in bulk and will be back-ended. Accordingly, we have cut our TP to Rs244 (vs Rs254 earlier) and downgrade our rating to Accumulate from BUY."

24,2018-06-05,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Hot on the heels of the billion-dollar acquisition of Orange Renewables, Greenko’s key shareholders GIC of Singapore and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) have agreed to infuse another $450 million to bankroll the company’s next phase of growth. This involves 15 GW of integrated, round-the-clock renewable assets combining hydro, wind and solar with the latest storage technologies.

This will be the largest single round of capital raising by a green energy company in India, overshadowing previous initiatives by Re-New Power Ventures that received $247 million in April for Ostro Energy’s buyout. Greenko Group on Monday announced the acquisition of Orange Renewable from Singapore’s AT Capital Group at an enterprise value of $1 billion. ET reported this ahead of the announcement.

After this round, both investors will have cumulatively invested $1.3 billion with GIC alone putting in $1 billion since 2015 in four rounds.


Addressing Needs of Discoms
GIC will remain the controlling shareholder with a 60% stake.

The two first-generation founders, Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, control about 25% while ADIA holds the remaining 15%.

“We will not pursue standalone renewable assets. Our focus for the next three-five years will be on building integrated round-theclock renewable energy which can compete with base load curves to address the real needs of the discoms when our Indian energy market is transitioning from a deficit market to a real demand-driven market,” Greenko group CEO Chalamalasetty told ET.

“Our new assets will compete with conventional coal energy projects on quantity, quality and cost. We are working on building 15 GW round-the-clock renewable assets that will deliver 3GWs of base load. It’s a unique proposition but is required today.”


Agencies

POWER OF THREE
The plan is to have three strategic “integrated asset class” assets — one in the north and two in the south that are dispersed across the country to create a bundled form of energy supply. Most of the incremental investments will go into storage technology.

In recent months, there has been a big drop in new base load capacity addition while existing capacities have been operating at half of their rated levels.

Close to 40 GW of base load assets are facing coal supply crunch or other disruptions. Gujarat recently saw a base load drop of 5GW. As a result, spot prices on the electricity exchanges have spiked to Rs 11-12 per unit from Rs 3 per unit earlier.

Renewables are a 5-10% additional energy source on top of the base load powered by coal and gas.

The challenge facing India’s power grids is the base load and clean energy on its own cannot be a replacement.

“Renewable got the tag of cheap energy but it is destabilising the grid. Coal is of course firm energy but in the last few months both crude and coal prices have gone up. We don’t have a fixed-price, inflation-protected energy,” said Greenko joint managing director Mahesh Kolli.

“In most markets, gas acts as a flexible base load energy to support renewables but we do not have that option with domestic gas and LNG imports cannot be a cheaper alternative either, so the discoms are all feeling the heat of this. We think we can create value — the capital infusion will support that growth plan.”

The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) reported a month ago that the more renewable energy is pumped into the distribution networks, the more expensive it gets for the grid.

According to its calculations, every unit of energy from renewables is costing the discoms an incremental Rs 2 to Rs 2.50 per kilowatt hour.

“We will be integrating multiple storage technologies like batteries, hydro, with wind, solar and hydro and creating an integrated round-the-clock (RTC) renewable energy asset class to meet the discoms’ cost-effective base load energy growth needs while meeting the future Renewable Power Obligations targets,” said Chalamalasetty.

Most of the investments will go into storage technology. Battery prices are coming down but pumped hydro storage is becoming an important asset class.

“It’s common in Europe and also in Tehri Dam where during off-peak time, you pump to bring the water levels up and vice versa during peak hours,” Chalamalasetty said.


NEW STRATEGY
However, the existing portfolio of 4.3 GW, inclusive of Orange, will not be part of this since they already have signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state utilities while the new assets will be meant for supplying to the national power grid at high voltage.

Ever since losing the opportunity to acquire Reliance’s Mumbai power distribution business to Adani in 2017, Greenko has planning this new strategy, the executives said. Construction work is slated to begin later this calendar year.

Commenting on the Orange acquisition, the biggest by the company so far, Kolli said more than scale it was the geographical complementarity that helped.

“We are working with a large cluster approach in states where we operate,” he said. “Adding the (Orange) portfolio within those clusters is part of our business model. We did not acquire Orange because it has a gigawatt size portfolio, but because of the assets meeting the Greenko’s operational and financial benchmark returns.”"
37,2018-06-05,PowerGrid,"The NSE benchmark Nifty slipped for the third day in a row on Tuesday, losing 35.35 points or 0.33 per cent. Though the loss was a modest one, the kind of volatility the session witnessed, creates reason to be cautious in the coming days.

The session saw continued addition of shorts in the system, however, the last 45 minutes of the trade saw sharp short covering coming in.

The short covering that was seen in the last hour of the trade is likely to spill over to Wednesday's session. We might see continued upmove in the initial trade.

However, two things remain distinctly clear. One, there won’t be any runaway upmove despite shorts existing in the system, and second, the 50-DMA and 100-DMA are expected to lend important support to the market in event of any downsides.

The Wednesday’s session is likely to see the levels of 10,630 and 10,675 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in at 10,550 and 10,535. These levels represent the 100-DMA and 50-DMA.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stands neutral showing no divergence against the price. Daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. On the charts, a candle with a long lower shadow emerged. In the present context, it remains significant, as it has emerged near the support zone of 100-DMA and 50-DMA and they remain in very close vicinity of each other.

Pattern analysis suggested that the Nifty tested the support zone wherein the two DMAs -- 100 and 50 -- converge. They remain in close vicinity of each other and Nifty taking support in this area may trigger a mild possibility of a pullback.

In the second half on Wednesday, we will have the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy review to which market may react to. 

The market has discounted the possibilities of a 25 basis point rate hike. But apart from infusing some volatility in the session, this may remain a non-event.

Given the amount of shorts in the system, we may see mild pullback continuing, but with this the Nifty still continues to remain vulnerable to selling at higher levels.

Overall, a slightly wide ranged market with some volatility is expected on Wednesday.

We recommend remaining very light on overall exposure while maintaining a cautious view on the market.

The market watchdog, through a notification issued on May 29, drastically slashed the 'additional expense' charged by mutual funds to just 5 basis points from 20 basis points, as part of its effort to help increase the penetration of such products among investors.

47,2018-06-07,PowerGrid,"The equity market had a relatively stable and strong session on Thursday despite the NSE benchmark Nifty coming off nearly 50 points from the high point of the day. The index finally settled 83.70 points or 0.78 per cent lower.

Though gains were observed across board, the stocks and sectors, which received a good beating in the previous few sessions, saw some value buying from the lower levels.

From the structure on the charts, the upmove is likely to continuing on Friday as well. A modestly positive start can be expected, but in the same breath, the zone of 10,820-10,845 will offer resistance at higher levels. At these levels, we see market taking a breather and entering into some fresh consolidation before any decisive move.

Friday will see the levels of 10,820 and 10,850 acting as potential resistance zone. Supports may come in at 10,735 and 10,680 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 58.3524. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high, which is bullish, but it does not show any divergence against the price. The daily MACD has reported a positive crossover and is now bullish while trading above its signal line. On the candles, a ‘Rising Window’ occurred. It is essentially a gap, which implies continuation of the upmove.

Pattern analysis suggests that the market has got some steam left. However, these upmoves will find resistance in the 10,820-10,850 zones as this happens to be a major pattern area resistance for Nifty.

Overall, the momentum may persist in the market, and we may still continue to see the dips, if any, being used to make quality purchases. However, in the pursuit of momentum, the zones of 10,820-10,850 are expected to offer formidable pattern resistance to the market.

We recommend continuing making fresh purchases with each opportunity that volatility offers, but at the same time, profit needs to be vigilantly protected at higher levels, as the possibilities of some volatility and profit taking cannot be ruled out if the Nifty tests 10,820-10,850 zones.

54,2018-06-08,PowerGrid,"Smart investors, who spotted the trend early and shifted focus to largecaps in early 2018, have not only managed to protect their wealth in the recent carnage, but have made money too! Some have done it even in midcap and smallcap stocks, and how! 

Nifty Smallcap100 and Midcap100 indices are down up to 20 per cent this year, while the benchmark Nifty50 is still holding its head above water. 

A couple of largecaps drew investors’ attention this year, with IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surpassing the $100 billion market capitalisation in April, and stocks like HUL, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints scaling fresh all-time highs over the past one month. The Infosys stock is hovering around its highest level in two years. 

The theme is pretty clear: it’s a year for fundamentally strong businesses and those that have been trying to tap demand revival.

Most analysts are bullish on the largecaps despite the depression in the broader market in recent times. They are advising investors to add some stocks from this segment to protect their portfolios against volatility ahead of the general elections in 2019.

There are expectations that the largecaps may provide some cushion to investor portfolios as their valuations are lower compared with those of midcaps and smallcaps.

As many as 21 stocks from the Nifty pack were trading in the green so far this year, with Tech Mahindra up 37.50 per cent till June 6, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 31.58 per cent), Tata Consultancy Services (up 30.46 per cent), Bajaj Finance (up 25.21 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 22.78 per cent), Infosys (up 19.73 per cent) and IndusInd Bank (up 18.23 per cent).

The 50-share index moved from 10,435 on January 1 this year to trade at 10,684 on June 6. 

Largecaps look attractive compared with midcaps and smallcaps at this point of time, Sankaran Naren, Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, told ETNow in an interview.

Brokerage Sharekhan prefers HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS. HCL Tech has advanced over 3 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Managements of most IT companies have indicated that CY2018 would be better year compared with the previous one, thanks to some large deal wins, improving macro environment in key geographies, demand in certain industry pockets, emerging demand in digital, higher outsourcing demand from European clients and benefits of a weaker rupee.

Shares of HUL, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints and HDFC have gained between 10 per cent and 17 per cent in this period.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse has a ‘buy’ rating on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,750. Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 2,251.

“Largecap valuations are far more reasonable than the second-rung stocks. Select largecap companies with rich valuations are also among the top picks right now when it comes to future growth visibility,” said Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director, Ladderup Wealth Management.

Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says the margin of safety is better in largecap names than in midcaps and smallcaps.

“There is certainty in terms of how the numbers will pan out,” he said.

More than 70 stocks from Nifty Midcap100 index gave negative returns to investors in 2018. Vakrangee, PC Jeweller, Adani Power and Suzlon Energy have plunged up to 93 per cent.

On the other hand, select midcap names like Mindtree, Indiabulls Ventures, Jubilant FoodWorks, Mphasis and Gruh Finance have risen up to 67 per cent in the same period. Gruh Finance hit an all-time high of Rs 381 on June 7.

There are takers for quality in any market. “I think it is time to buy into some of the quality companies in the midcap space, where the comfort level is on the higher side. Forget the index, this correction is a welcome opportunity for investors,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Smallcap stocks like Gitanjali Gems, Diamond Power, Bombay Rayon and Electrosteel Steels have slipped up to 91 per cent. 

There are specific pockets in the midcap and the smallcap segments, which are qualitative in nature, and earnings growth in this space can still be far better over the next two years, said Joshi of Angel Broking.

Coal India, YES Bank, L&T, Titan Company, Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, ITC, Power Grid and Eicher Motors are other largecap stocks, which have been trading in the green so far in 2018.

49,2018-06-08,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets opened on a weak note on Friday tracking selloff in other Asian markets. There are concerns that global liquidity will take a hit as the ECB looks poised to signal winding down of its bond buying programme. US stocks ended lower in overnight trade and that too hurt the sentiment. A kick start of hike in interest rates in emerging markets added to the concern.

 At 9.27 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 95.90 points, or 0.27 per cent, lower at 35,367.18. Nifty50 fell 41.55 points, or 0.39 per cent, to 10,726.80. Fear guage India VIX eased 6 per cent to 12.01. Midcap and smallcap indices restricted losses.


The weakness in the domestic market also has to do with earning downgrades. The cycle of earnings downgrades doesn’t seem to have ended yet, with May standing out for the ferocity with which analysts slashed growth estimates in the month. The projected earnings per share (EPS) for 2018 of the MSCI India Index — a dollar-denominated benchmark used by global fund managers to evaluate their investments in Mumbai stocks — has been trimmed by 2.6 per cent in May.

On the upside, drug maker Dr Reddy's Labs rose 1.87 per cent to Rs 2,003 while Sun Pharma added 1.84 per cent to Rs 497.50.

Tata Motors gained 1.60 per cent to Rs 310.20. The auto maker's arm Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) reported 6.1 per cent increase in global sales at 48,281 units in May, driven by introduction of new models including the Range Rover Velar across markets. 

 On the global front, Asian shares kicked off to a poor start as global risk appetite deteriorated on worries the European Central Bank was ready to start tapering its massive stimulus, although trade was expected to be cautious ahead of big diplomatic meetings, Reuters reported. The ECB will debate next week whether to end bond purchases later this year, the bank’s chief economist said on Wednesday.

The scrip closed 8.17 per cent up at Rs 528.40.

Sensex and Nifty rallied for the last two sessions even as the Reserve Bank of India hiked the short-term lending rate by 25 basis points, but maintained the neutral stance in its second bi-monthly policy review on Wednesday. 

Market participants attributed the rally to RBI's neutral stance and said that market had already priced in the rate hike.

But the upbeat momentum fizzled out on Friday and market appeared to be in the correction mode amid a depreciating rupee and rising crude oil prices.

This means objectionable conditions were found and documented, but the agency is not prepared to take or recommend regulatory action. 

Dr Reddy's laboratories was up next, rising nearly 5 per cent. As per PTI, the drug maker expects to launch the generic version of Copaxone in the US market during the first half of next fiscal.

90,2018-06-14,PowerGrid,"In Wednesday’s session, Nifty made a half-hearted attempt to move past the 10,850 mark, which has been posing critical resistance to the index. In a session that remained largely rangebound and capped on the upside, the 50-pack came off from the high point of the day and settled with minor gains of 13.85 points, or 0.13 per cent.

We expect a quiet start to Thursday’s session, but just like the previous session, the 10,850 level and Nifty’s behaviour vis-à-vis this level needs to be watched. Nifty will have to move past this level in a convincing manner for any meaningful upward move to occur.

If it faces resistance at higher levels just like it happened in the previous session, it is likely to be pushed into some more consolidation.

The 10,890 and 10,945 levels will be immediate resistance for Nifty50 on Thursday, while supports will come in lower at 10,810 and 10,760 levels.




The Relative Strength Index or RSI on the daily chart stood at 63.0384 and it has reached its highest value in last 14 days, which is a bullish signal. It does not show any divergence from price. The daily MACD remains bullish even as it trades above the signal line. Apart from the black body that occurred on the candles, no significant formations were seen.

Going by pattern analysis, Nifty is making attempts to move past the pattern resistance that exists in form of falling trend line that emerges from 11,170 and subsequently joins the falling tops.

F&O data and lead indicators exhibit strong undercurrent and buoyant intent of the market. There are chances that though we might see some corrective swings given the current structure of the markets, but eventually Nifty is likely to move past the 10,850 mark, which has been posing important pattern resistance to the market.

We are also likely to see some volatility in trade and the session is likely to remain rangebound with limited downsides and underlying buoyant intent.

One should continue to guard profits at higher levels, but selective purchases may be made.

96,2018-06-15,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Football fever is gripping the investment world as much as soccer fans, with the Fifa World Cup 2018 kicking off. 

Globally, brokerages are making projections for potential World Cup winners, just like they do them for stock prices and corporate earnings.

So involved is the financial world with this game of brawn that one analysis found as much one-third drop in equity trading volumes in select countries during this four-yearly extravaganza.

On Dalal Street, several renowned faces are either already in Russia or heading there to watch all the action live.

And then there are analysts and brokerages which are trying to draw simile between soccer and World Cup.

IIFL Institutional Equities has gone one step ahead to pick the equivalent of a World Cup soccer team from among the listed stocks, comprising the traditional strikers, defenders and goalkeeper.

The brokerage assigned the job of the coach to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Ayon Mukhopadhyay of IIFL Institutional Equities said he was tempted to put in four forwards or go the way of the 1970’s Dutch Total Football format for team formation.

However, he had to settle for a more orthodox approach. The stocks picked for the team do have a few substitutes, if conditions change, he said in a note.


Here are stocks the brokerage picked for its Dream Team:

3 Forwards:
Mukhopadhyay defined them as 
alpha generators; cyclical, high rewarding stocks with goal scoring appetite, momentum and energy. His picks are:-

Biocon: Having established its credentials in global leagues now with Mylan tieup, this sharpshooter is my centre forward. Expected to clear its ‘dope tests’ for its biosimilars approvals, revenues can grow 6 times in next four years. Mukhopadhyay says he would not be surprised if this ends up with the ‘Golden Boot’.


Yes Bank: The focus on scoring at all cost at times has led to RBI handing it the red card. But shedding the bad boy image by aligning its stressed asset recognition methods and extending the term to Rana Kapoor, Yes Bank is more focused. No matter what they do off the pitch, on ground action is what matters, and the stock is a winner on that count all the way. Still inexpensive, with strong earnings trajectory, Yes Bank will find the back of the net consistently.


Larsen & Toubro: The old war horse is getting fitter by realigning its business and shedding the non-core flab. Valuations at historical averages and with cyclical tailwinds and focus on core EPC business, this ambidextrous striker can get you off the mark very fast in an early uptick of the investment cycle and expand the lead in the more competitive late capex cycle.


Agencies

Midfield: They have ‘slightly attacking’ characteristics. They would still be high earners in a cyclical environment but could drop back and keep possession to allow consolidation when need to be less adventurous, Mukhopadhyay 
said.

HDFC Bank: The bellwether of the financial markets is the superstar. It is also the captain of team, who can effortlessly thrust forward with scale, organisational knowledge and cost competitiveness to drive growth and maintain profitability. As profitability is driven by both productivity and efficiency improvements, earnings growth will sustain and so will its tag as one of the most prized players. Its ADR avatar commands an even higher wage in the Major League in US.


Tata Motors: Another old hand, which is available at a decadal low valuation. But given the new launches of JLR and Indian business looking up (with CV improvement), things should turn around and it can be the attacking midfield option. Given the double dividend, I will play the DVR avatar.


Teamlease: A rookie, which has had a phenomenal run since its debut two seasons back on the bourses. But has it peaked too soon? Not really, it's well-positioned to mature to legendary status as it makes multi-year earnings growth underpinned by low penetration of temp staffing in India and market share gains from a vast unorganized sector.


Defence: These are the pillars of the team. Nothing can sneak past them. Be it on sunny days, or torrential storms, these will give you the comfort.


Hindustan Unilever: A consumer stock as defence is an old cliché, but this beast guarding the northern wall is India’s largest FMCG company. Hours on the training ground with manic focus on costs have led to this veteran ensuring an increase in operating margins for 7 seasons now. It has played the offside trap of GST to its advantage and long term drivers include market share gains with premiumisation opportunities.


Infosys: Having forayed across the pitch in various roles under countless mentors (with ugly exits) and been sidelined to the wilderness, the prodigal son of India IT returns with a rejuvenated but conformist mindset. With focus on scaling the digital business and use of AI/Automation to modernise the clients’ core and accelerating large deals and improving win rate, this refreshed new look augers well. Also tackling down the nemesis of rising USD-INR, a (still 20 per cent cheaper than TCS) new look Infy is the cornerstone of my defence.


Motherson Sumi: The three-pronged strength across its 3 lines with mid-to-high-teens earnings growth in standalone (led by volume and value) and SMR (led by market share gain, slight margin expansion) brings a steady head to the backline. High endurance training is also leading to significant Ebitda margin expansion for SMP/PKC and would result in multi-fold rise in earnings of these two subsidiaries.


Bajaj Finance: Earnings keep compounding for this stallion which is still shy of considering itself a big boy. Strong cross selling capabilities making core product an acquisition tool, long runway in underpenetrated market, strong management team, well managed execution and scalable businesses will keep overall growth higher than peers. A rock in the defence with clear visibility on earnings.


The goalkeeper: A safe no-frills option to do the job.


PowerGrid: Choosing from the PSU Club maybe unpopular, but given its regulated ROE model, and strong earnings visibility through FY21, PGCIL is safe as a house. A strong balance sheet and impeccable track record of clean sheets give it stability to stop any surprise attack of private competition. Also, its low risk model makes it best positioned to stop the penalties of global volatilities of liquidity crunch/portfolio reallocation. Very cheap (10x PE with 3% yield ) price gives it the gloves.


And finally the coach

PM Narendra Modi. A year back it seemed his position was sealed for a long term. But recent events at home have jolted his long term hopes a bit. Still loved by players, but popularity is dwindling. Need his team to fire to get back the confidence.

If you want a few more stock ideas, here are your substitutes:


Equitas: A forward with immense potential but seems to be less communicative on its role of MFI, SFB or NBFC. Also now shrugging off its provisioning injuries it should be well fit to ride the operating leverage to gain superior RoEs. A bit more faith shown by investors should see this kid take star status.


Ujjivan: Another kid to have graduated from the MFI academy but growing faster than Equitas. Very tempting option if you do not trust the old legs of L&T to score.

Asian Paints: Another expensive defender but worth its price tag with unmatched distribution network and leadership position. Proven ability to defend margins with price hikes makes it a first change if the formation needs to change to 5-3-2.


Zee: An attacking midfield option, which will benefit from sharp recovery in ad spending in India."

93,2018-06-15,PowerGrid,"ET Intelligence Group: After a lull of nearly six years, the executable order book of engineering and construction (E&C) companies reported meaningful increase in FY18. According to a report by CLSA, the total E&C order backlog grew by 12 per cent year-on-year after adjusting for the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The reported order backlog of the companies was suppressed in FY18 since it excluded excise and other tax elements after the implementation of GST. In the previous year, these taxes were a part of the order value.

Total order backlog of the E&C companies was Rs 8.1 lakh crore at the end of FY18. Of the total order backlog, nearly 62 per cent was contributed by the construction companies, followed by 24 per cent from capital goods companies catering to the power sector.

The order backlog picked up in the second half of FY18 due to the momentum in the road construction and projects from power and transmission segments. The order inflow was slow in the first half if the fiscal. This led Larsen & Tubro, India’s largest infrastructure company, to cut the order inflow guidance in the first half though it ended the year with 7 per cent higher order inflow at Rs 1.5 lakh crore.L&T’s order book growth was mainly aided by the public sector projects. Consequently, the share of the domestic orders in the total order inflow increased to 76 per cent in FY18 from 70 per cent in the previous year. The domestic order flow grew by 15 per cent in FY18 to Rs 1.17 lakh crore.

The road sector has emerged as significant contributor to the total order book in FY18 thanks to a record pace of orders from the National Highway Authority (NHAI) and Ministry of Road Transport and Highway. The orders of NHAI were two times higher than the order value in FY18 compared with the previous year. As a result, the order backlog of road construction companies including Sadbhav Engineering, Nagarjuna Construction, Dilip Buildcon, and IRB grew by 72 per cent, 80 per cent, 36 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, in FY18.

The investments in transmission and distribution from the Power Grid Corporation and state electricity boards boosted order backlog of KEC International, and Kalpataru Power by 57 per cent and 25 per cent in FY18. India’s largest power equipment company BHEL also recorded 12 per cent growth in order backlog.

The buoyancy in the orders is likely to continue in the current fiscal based on the commentary of the companies after the March quarter results. L&T has guided for 10-12 per cent order inflow growth, while BHEL expects revenue of Rs 32,000 crore in the current fiscal."

91,2018-06-15,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The government will not accept Niti Aayog’s proposal of reducing the Centre’s stake in non-strategic public sector companies to below 50% even as it is confident of breaching the disinvestment target for the second year running and raising over Rs 1 lakh crore in the current fiscal, a senior official told ET.

ET had earlier this month reported that Niti Aayog has recommended lowering the government’s stake to less than 50% in all non-strategic state-run companies over time for raising revenues as well as giving these companies the functional autonomy to perform better.

Niti had reasoned this would also increase the value of government’s remaining stakes in these companies. There are over 250 CPSEs in which the government holds 51% or more and include large ones like NTPC, Power Grid and Steel Authority of India.

Government officials said several companies with higher government holdings were performing well and it would be unfair to say that ownership and management structure needed to be overhauled for better efficiency.

An official pointed out that government holding in several PSUs was much more than 50% and it would not There was adequate headroom to raise revenue by decreasing shareholding without bringing it down to 49%.



The government has rejected Niti Aayog’s proposal, said one of the officials quoted above.

According to some independent observers, the government was also possibly reluctant to consider a politically sensitive proposal of ceding control over state-run companies in a year leading to elections.

The government is, however, pressing ahead with its disinvestment programme and is confident that like the previous year when it exceeded its disinvestment target, this year too it will breach its Rs 80,000 crore target and raise over Rs 1 lakh crore.

A senior official said the setback to the Air India privatisation plan will not impact the government’s disinvestment programme as it had not been factored into the target.

“We are not too worried over the delay of Air India stake sale. There are other companies and the government will exceed the disinvestment target this year as well,” said the above quoted official.

The government is already redrawing its plan to sell 76% stake sale in Air India after the first round of bidding that ended on May 31did not elicit any response. It is considering various tweaks to the offer to make it more attractive.

ET had reported earlier that government’s decision to retain 24% stake in the airline may have upset potential investors.

So far around Rs 434 crore has been raised through initial public offer of Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd (Midhani). MSTC Ltd., North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. (NEEPCO), Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd.

(GRSE), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd are lined up for initial public offer.

“So we have a pipeline and hence no immediate need to focus only on the blue chip firms,” the official added.

The finance ministry is all set to launch the second tranche of Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) on June 19 which will help raise up to Rs 8,400 crore from the markets.

In addition, the government has also initiated the process of strategic disinvestment in 23 CPSEs, and will also come up with more exchange trade fund (ETF) offers including debt ETF."
97,2018-06-17,PowerGrid,"The 5G committee of the telecom ministry has said that around 6000 megahertz (Mhz) of spectrum can be made available without delay for the next generation mobile service.

If accepted, the panel's recommendation, which has been submitted to the government, can lead to India's largest ever spectrum allocation for a service.

An expert member of the panel, Arogyaswami Paulraj said in an interview that initially the service will enhance mobile data speed in India by up to 50 per cent compared to current levels.

Paulraj is Professor Emeritus, Stanford University, and a pioneer of MIMO wireless communications, a technology break through that enables improved wireless performance.

MIMO is now incorporated into all new wireless systems, as per Stanford site.

The Department of Telecom (DoT) is taking strong initiative to make spectrum available for the new service, Paulraj said.

As much as 2,354.55 MHz of frequencies valued at around Rs 5.63 lakh crore were put up for grabs in country's largest ever auction held in 2016. At present mobile phone signals in the country are transmitted in 800 Mhz to 2600 Mhz band.

Now, the panel has spotted spectrum for 5G service across 11 bands of which 4 bands - premium 700 Mhz band, 3.5 gigahertz (Ghz), 24 Ghz and 28 Ghz band can be made immediately available for the service.

The panel estimates that 5,250 megahertz of spectrum can be made available for 5G services in higher frequency bands, 300 Mhz in 3.5 Ghz band and 405 Mhz spectrum in sub- 1000 Mhz.

Paulraj said: ""Spectrum reduces cost of infrastructure. People will benefit from it. Our spectrum release in 5G will be more than spectrum to be released in many countries.

""If you have more spectrum you can use less base station to serve more people, the cost goes down. If there is less spectrum, you have to deploy many BTS (mobile sites) and everybody pays the penalty.""

He said that unlike earlier generation technologies including 3G and 4G, the next gen 5G will not be limited to mobile services but will play an important role in societal transformation with usage in power grids, smartcities, agriculture, banking, railways, healthcare and the like.

Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha has set the target for commercial roll out of 5G services in India by 2020 at par with advanced countries of the world.

Paulraj said: ""India has already taken lead over many other countries. Perhaps first country to do spectrum in 5G was US and I would think may be a little bit from Europe.

""Otherwise we are ahead of many countries in the world. Bringing spectrum early will enable lot of things. Most importantly, I feel it will enable growth of that manufacturing ability in our country.""

Padma Bhushan award recipient Paulraj said the panel has not deliberated on spectrum allocation modalities but favoured issuing the radiowaves to telecom operators at rational prices.

""To serve people of our country, operators must deploy (5G). For them to be able to deploy, they have to be profitable. So spectrum pricing must understand all this dimensions so that operators can make viable business out of it,"" he said.

He said that spectrum price per unit for 5G service in higher frequency bands cannot be priced at same level as lower frequency band.

""Upper bands will be at a lower price. Also remember in order to deploy in upper band there is much more infrastructure required. It is more expensive for them to deploy in upper band. So obviously spectrum should be cheaper for them,"" Paulraj said.

In lower frequency band like 700 Mhz band the mobile signal can cover wide area but the coverage shrinks as the frequency band count increase like in 3.5 Ghz, 24 Ghz and 28 Ghz.

The base price of one unit of pan-India 700 Mhz spectrum in 2016 was fixed at around Rs 11,000 crore by the government and interested telecom operators were required to buy minimum of five units of radiowaves in this band. There were no bidders for this premium band due to high base price.

Paulraj said base station for 5G will have to be deployed at around every 50 metres as coverage of mobile signals in higher bands reduces that will lead to escalation of infrastructure cost.

He said that spectrum in E (71-76 Ghz frequency and 81-86 Ghz) and V band (57-64 Ghz frequency range), in which data can be transmitted at speed of 1000 mbps, should be allocated as per international norms.

""E and V bands, we will do that expeditiously... There are some minor issues to be sorted out. DoT is committed to release E and V band spectrum very quickly. It is essential because in those bands you can do high speed radiolinks. In India 5G will require a lot of backhaul. In 5G we need to have base stations almost at every 50 meters. We don't have fibre every 50 meter here,"" Paulraj said.

The panel has recommended that government should identify spectrum for 5G services in 600 Mhz, 1.4 Ghz, 30 Ghz, 31 Ghz and 37 Ghz band, while exploring the feasibility of 5G spectrum for the service in 500 Mhz and 3.7 Ghz bands."
100,2018-06-18,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Union government plans to set up a national power distribution company that will handhold state discoms in electricity distribution activities and ensure time-bound implementation of central schemes. The proposed company will compete with private firms and contractors to bag contracts of state-run distribution companies for appointing franchisees or engineering tenders, officials said. 

Apart from small distribution consultancy wings in Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Grid Corporation and NTPC, the central government has no presence in electricity distribution sector. 

“The Union government has presence in all the power sector segments, be it financing, generation or transmission, but power distribution has always been out of focus and a laggard in the entire system,” said a senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

“There has been demand from sections of society to have a national level distribution corporation that may work in joint ventures with state governments for implementation of various power distribution activities. The proposal is at a drawing board stage,” he said. 

Girishkumar Kadam, sector head-corporate ratings at ICRA Ltd said, “Such an entity could also benefit the discoms in cost competitive power procurement as nodal agency through bidding route with backto-back power supply agreements with the interested discoms.” 

The proposed company may or may not obtain a distribution licence, said another government official, adding it will not interfere in the working of state power distribution companies given the federal structure. 

“But the utility will ensure implementation of central schemes for power sector in a time-bound manner. It has been widely felt that there is a need for handholding and guiding state distribution companies, and a national distribution corporation may fill the gap,” he said. 

Experts said this would be a smart move, particularly for fulfilling the Narendra Modi government’s “power for all” promise ahead of the 2019 general election. 

The government proposes to electrify all households and provide reliable electricity supply by March next year. The draft Electricity Act, likely to be circulated for comments this week, provides for separation of distribution infrastructure ownership from power supply licences and also penalties on discoms for gratuitous load-shedding. India has also been trying to achieve smart metering and smart grid network."
99,2018-06-18,PowerGrid,"The NSE benchmark Nifty ended with a minor loss of 17.85 points or 0.17 per cent at 10,799.85 after spending much of the Monday’s session is a capped and narrow range. 

With the session remaining extremely rangebound, key thing to note was Nifty’s struggle with the levels of 10,820-10,850, as it failed to move past this important pattern resistance.

As we step into Tuesday’s trade, we feel that some weakness might persist and Nifty may remain under modest pressure, but the downsides are likely to remain limited.

On the upper side, the struggle with the levels of 10,820-10,850 is likely to continue. The behaviour of the market vis-à-vis this zone is extremely important to watch out for in the coming days. Tuesday will continue to see the levels of 10,850 and 10,895 acting as important resistance area. Supports will come in at 10,765 and 10,710 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 57.7446. RSI continues to remain neutral, showing no divergence to the price. The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line. A small black body occurred on the candles and in the present context it holds no significance.

The pattern analysis shows that Nifty continued to resist to the falling trend line resistance area of 10,820-10,850 zones. Breach on the upside of these levels is necessary for any meaningful upmove to occur. 

Overall, while Nifty continues to resist to the falling trend line that joined the high of 11,170 to the subsequent lower tops, it also continued to show some inherent strength by consolidating around the resistance area without showing any major declines.

The present amount of shorts in the system is likely to keep the overall downsides limited. However, in the same breath, unless the index moves past the 10,820-10,850 zone and sustain above that, it will remain vulnerable to pressure from higher levels and prolonged consolidation.

We recommend remaining modest on exposures, preserving cash and making select purchases with each available opportunity.

98,2018-06-18,PowerGrid,"Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) chairman IS Jha blamed private companies for power system transmission woes and rubbished allegations of monopolistic practices levelled against the state-run company by its competitors. In an interview to ET, he said that 80% of transmission projects awarded to private sector were delayed.
 Edited excerpts:


How would you respond to private companies’ allegation that PGCIL purposefully mismanages transmission planning so that the lines get delayed and are given to PGCIL on nomination basis?
 The transmission planning process is collaborative and transparent. There is a well-established procedure of planning of transmission system, under which transmission planning is carried out by the Central Electricity Act (CEA) in association with CTU, POSOCO and other stakeholders. The technical approval of the transmission scheme is given by the Standing Committee on Power System Planning, which is convened by the CEA and is comprised of stakeholders including the CEA, CTU and POSOCO. Once the system is approved, the empowered committee convened by the CEA recommends the modalities, and based on this recommendation the power ministry decides the implementation route (through bidding or otherwise).

The transmission system planning is done on need basis, assessed taking into consideration the applications, inputs provided by state transmission utilities, operational feedback report from POSOCO and other inputs from various other stakeholders. When transmission system is planned, the required date and the timeframe for implementation are clearly mentioned. As on date, no LTA application case is pending with the CTU for planning consideration. The allegation that the CTU purposefully delays the transmission planning is absolutely incorrect. In the past three years, all the major transmission projects have been awarded only through TBCB (tariff based competitive bidding) route.


Private companies allege government bias and say a proposal to give large green energy corridor projects to PGCIL may render them non-competitive…. 
We are not aware of any such proposal to give any large green energy corridor project to Power Grid. This allegation is completely unfounded. In fact, the transmission systems are yet to be evolved for the new renewable energy additions. For that purpose, I understand that a committee comprising of members from renewable energy ministry, Solar Energy Corp of India, CEA and CTU has been constituted to study and evolve new transmission system based on the potential locations for renewable energy.


Have projects awarded to PGCIL been completed on time? Private companies say a lot of your projects are late, defeating the purpose of allotment on nomination basis.
This allegation is also completely baseless and devoid of any facts. Power Grid has commissioned (projects worth) more than Rs 90,000 crore in the last three financial years. Our important projects such as Green Energy Corridor-I are on schedule and being commissioned matching with generation. Similarly, for the HVDC Raigarh-Pugalur project, as on date, the progress so far is six to 12 months ahead of schedule.

Let us compare the performance in TBCB projects. Till date, 14 TBCB projects have been commissioned – three projects by Power Grid and 11 by different private companies. All our three projects were completed on time. While only two out of 11 projects by private companies have come up on time. The balance nine projects, all by private companies, have had delayed commissioning. It translates into a delay in more than 80% of the projects which are awarded to private players. Apart from the delays, one grave area of concern is that some of the projects have not taken off even years after the award. We have seen four such cases awarded to private companies during the competitive bidding regime. In two of the cases, DGEN and North Karanpura, the generation has come up but the evacuation system to be developed by the private companies under TBCB has not even taken off. It is a matter of serious concern with the potential to cause huge economic losses and impact the entire power sector value chain.

There may have been genuine reasons for the delays but to issue a blanket statement that Power Grid projects get delayed and private players come up on time is not correct and misleading.


Private players also accuse PGCIL of profiteering, saying your tariff-to-cost ratio for cost-plus projects is 17.5% but comes down to 13.5% if there is competition.
This statement is again misleading. In cost-plus, tariffs are higher in the first year, decreasing gradually every year and falling considerably from 13th year onwards due to higher depreciation rates allowed for principal repayment of loans for initial 12 years, while in the TBCB projects, the levelised tariff depends on the discounting factor. All quoted tariffs for each year are reduced to a single number using this discount rate.

For the sake of comparison, if we consider a hypothetical transmission line project, the 1st year tariff in cost-plus regime comes out approximately 16-17% of total project cost. For the same cost-plus project, if we compute the levelised tariff, it comes to around 12-13% of project cost. If we further leverage and reduce equity from 30% to 20%, the levelised tariff in cost-plus project shall further be less than 12%.

From the above calculations, it is amply clear that 1st year tariff of 17.5% in cost-plus is in no way superior to the 13% levelised tariff in TBCB regime. Over and above this, the cost-plus projects have to deal with regulatory uncertainty of returns.

If you go through the details of tariffs quoted for TBCB projects, you can notice that in a few of the projects wherein Power Grid could not participate, the tariff quoted is much higher than what it would have been in cost-plus basis. In fact, Power Grid’s participation in the TBCB route has ensured that the prices obtained are reasonable and the nation gets the infrastructure at the right cost."
103,2018-06-19,PowerGrid,"Dhirendra Kumar, Founder, Value Research, says Bharat 22 ETF is a combination of 60% relatively superior quality PSUs and 40% private companies which are relatively out of favour. He was talking to ET Now.Edited excerpts:

A very classy set of stocks, representing various sectors in Bharat 22 ETF. The first tranche had been subscribed well but up until now the performance has been just about okayish. What exactly would be your recommendation? It is available at a 2.5% discount. Is this a good option for retail investors?
It is an interesting option. It might have proved to be reasonably attractive for investors. It is a better option and just not a PSU disinvestment vehicle. If you look at other rounds of big investment or previous alternatives, compared to that, 40% of the disinvestment is in private sector companies. L&T, ITC and Axis Bank together account for nearly 40% of the total fund. So 40% is non-PSU. 

I am wary of PSUs. The government being the owner of companies is itself a bad news but the set of PSUs which I find here except for oil marketing companies are quite varied though they are small stake. When I look at NBCC, Bharat Electronics, I do not see them as having same variables as PSUs and they are definitely companies with significant competitive advantage. They have a mote around them and have unique business models. 

Being a government-owned company in a capitalist world itself is a bad thought. We know that of the 250 public sector companies, only 40 companies have survived and thrived or they have some advantages. But when I look at Engineers India, Bharat Electronics and even NHPC, I find that this is a great fund. There is no great novelty. All these stocks can be bought. I like the fact that the low extent of this fund is 0.01% which is virtually nothing. It is available in a neat packet 2.5% discount and that also makes it attractive. 

It is a combination of 60% relatively superior quality PSUs and 40% private companies which are relatively out of favour. That is why it has not done well since the issue of the first tranche. It might be an attractive ETF to have but for how long, I do not know. If any industry is not thinking for two-three years, one should not have a short-term view on such a fund.


From what I understand, your recommendation seems to be yes. It may be a good time to put your money into Bharat 22. You do not seem to be too perturbed that there is weightage on the banks. Banks are not the flavour of the season right now, neither are energy companies.
Despite that, if you look at the decline in the value of the large companies, a good number of companies offer significant competitive advantage. Larsen & Toubro and ITC account for nearly 31% or one-third of the fund. Axis Bank is another 8.7%. This fund was actually a vehicle for the government to sell off the holdings that they have but the package they have been able to create is nice. 

The banking domination actually comes only from this Axis Bank and State Bank which I would still say might be the best of the lot which the government has to offer. The rest is virtually insignificant. Bank of Baroda is just 1.15% of the fund. Rest of the public sector companies are quite prominent ones and they have the competitive advantage. Some of them might be very cheap as well and they are leaders in their segment. 

The public sector comes with a rider that they need to really withstand the competitive pressures of the economy. Some companies have been able to prove their mettle. They have some cost advantage. NTPC is the fifth largest holding of this fund which accounts for nearly 7.7% or Power Grid which is a non-replicable business. Of course. the sector has been opened up but I do not think this company can lose its math in next 20 years.


My other concern is how this ETF may lack a clear strategy. You mentioned expense ratio is just about 1 bp and that is perhaps because neither is it an actively managed fund and nor is it essentially tracking any benchmark which has specific characteristics. It is randomly selected stocks that the government wants to divest of. It would not be proper to call it as tracking India’s growth story because it lacks the likes of RIL, HDFC Bank or even an HUL for that matter.
Yes, there is an absence of strategy but I find that the starting point of this fund was not that the government wanted to create a great vehicle for individual investors, they wanted to create a vehicle for individual investors whereby they should be able to sell the stock holdings of many companies that they are owners of. 

So, the starting point is very straightforward, the government wants to sell its stock ownership of the companies which it has accidentally or strategically ended up owning. An actively managed fund might be a better option but it is not all that bad. When I look at the companies, from a relative valuation point, it is a very novel package. 2.5% should not be the only reason why investors should come for a short while. 

The kind of companies and their relative valuations are interesting. Many of these companies have been out of favour for a long time and some of these companies might have a great investment case. There is absence of active management but when active management has to deliver 2% more to map the return of this fund. That itself translates into a competitive advantage.


Senior officials of the finance ministry yesterday said there is another reason to really open this up for retail investors. For the first time, a non demat account holder can actually invest in Bharat-22 ETF. Is that correct and do you think that there could be a rewrite of the rules of the game and that could help in penetration?
 One of the advantages of mutual fund industry has been that they are able to approach investors through their distribution channels in a manner which is not necessarily dependent on the stock brokers or the demat account.

Here is a fund which necessarily does not require a demat account for an investor. This will democratise this investment more and it might still appeal to many investors. It may not be the finest actively managed choice but going by the complexion, the way it has been packaged, it looks reasonably attractive."

On the contrary, Vedanta, Indian Oil Corporation, HPCL, UPL, Mahindra & Mahindra and BPCL stood as the top losers in the Nifty index.

Weighed down by sustained selling in most sectors, led by IT, metal, oil & gas and auto, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended their losses for the second consecutive session on Tuesday.

Investors were on a selling spree, taking cues from the weakness in global stocks amid escalating trade spat between the US and China.

The Sensex index lost 262 points, or 0.74 per cent, ending the day at 35,287, with only 4 stocks in the green and 27 in the red.

The Nifty index tanked 89 points, or 0.83 per cent, settling at 10,710, with 8 stocks advancing and 42 declining.

All sectors closed the day in the red on NSE. Nifty Realty, falling 2.01 per cent, emerged as the top loser among the sectoral indices.

102,2018-06-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: And you thought midcaps and smallcaps have been under pressure over the past three months because of the Sebi reclassification, requiring mutual funds to rejig their portfolios?

Mutual fund houses across the board exited several midcap and smallcap stocks over the past three months. As such, while the largecap equity indices have shown signs of stabilising in recent weeks, midcaps and smallcaps continued to be in turmoil. In fact, these stocks continued to bear the brunt of the selloff in market.

Data showed BSE midcap and smallcap indices were up 50-55 per cent in last three years, but are down 10-12 per cent year-to-date. BSE smallcap and midcap indices fell 6 per cent each in May.

Some analysts say there has been a structural shift among institutional and individual investors towards largecaps, amid near-term concerns on domestic and global fronts, which has put pressure on midcaps and smallcaps.

""Earnings is a concern. Resignations by auditors at some midcap and smallcap firms too may be weighing on sentiment. There could a general shift towards safe haven blue chips,” said AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital.

Portfolio analyses of mutual funds throw up some interesting trends.

BNP Paribas Asset Management exited 17 stocks, mostly smallcaps and midcaps, while adding only two new stocks from that basket. Among key exits were Shankara Building Products, Bharti Infratel, Galaxy Surfactants and Inox Leisure, among others.

HSBC Global Asset Management added six stocks, but exited 23 stocks during the month.

Axis Mutual Find exited Shankara Building Products, Can Fin Homes, Apollo Tyres and Ajanta Pharma, RBL Bank and 12 others. Shares of Shankara Building Products had doubled in last one year. Can Fin Homes rallied 150 per cent in last three years and 1,130 per cent in last five, but has not performed well in last one year. 

Canara Robeco Asset Management added three stocks and exited eight during the month. SH Kelkar, Parag Milk Foods and Lakshmi Vilas Bank were some of the smallcap scrips the fund house totally exited.

Birla Sun Life made five exits and added five. It sold off Reliance Naval, Just Dial, Narayana Hrudayalaya and Engineering and Jubilant FoodWorks.

Interestingly, the fund house added PC Jeweller in small quantity during the month even as many funds such as Edelweiss Asset Management, JM Financial Asset Management, L&T Investment Management and Axis AMC exited the counter.

HDFC MF completely exited Reliance Infra and Amara Raja Batteries; Reliance Nippon MF exited Maharashtra Seamless and Teamlease Services; Franklin Templeton moved out of Pidilite and Ujjivan Financial Services; DSP Blackrock exited Spicejet, Indian Terrain and KSB Pumps. SBI MF sold off Mahindra Holidays and Repco Home.

BOI AXA Investment Managers exited 15 and added 8 stocks. Among the key exits were Minda Industries (up 1,182 per cent in 3 years), Avanti Feeds (up 6,627 per cent in five years), Thirumalai Chemicals (up 1,124 per cent in 3 years) and Somany Ceramics (up 600 per cent in five years). Some of these stocks are 40-50 per cent off their 52-week highs, thanks to recent selloff. 

The fund house denied the exits had anything to with Sebi re-classification. “Normally, it’s good to take a relook at portfolio stocks after the end of the earnings reason to re-validate the investment hypothesis. If we find deviation from our initial understanding in terms of business model and valuation, we exit the stock,” it said.

Other fund houses said most of the recent exits were because of a change in their fundamental view about certain companies.

Many midcaps and smallcaps have gone off MF radar, partly due to high valuations and concerns over management transparency, said G Chokalingam of Equinomics Research.

Foreign brokerage UBS said the economic growth cycle in India is less strong now than in the historical tightening periods, and this is reflected in earnings cuts.

This could remain an overhang for smallcaps and midcaps. “Our analysis of flows suggests MF flows clearly had more relevance than foreign flows in last two years. We expect strong local MF flows to fade, as the demonetisation-led liquidity abates and interest rates rise,” UBS said in a recent note.

Many small and midcap firms have failed to meet expectations on the earnings front. UBS said corporates do believe the GST impact is over, but potential benefits like a shift in market shares from unorganised to organised sector is yet to be seen.

Investors continued to focus on buying opportunities when share prices dip, but relative valuations of smallcaps and midcaps suggest the optimism may be priced in but not the uncertainties despite the recent corrections, UBS said. 

Among largecaps, HDFC was the most favourite pick among domestic mutual funds during May. It was followed by IT firms Infosys and HCL Technologies and FMCG major ITC. Power Grid, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IOC and TCS were among the top stocks that saw selling by mutual funds."
105,2018-06-19,PowerGrid,"The Sikkim government's failure to complete transmission line from Teesta-III hydro power station to Kishanganj substation has resulted in Rs 6 crore loss per day, All India Power Engineers' Federation said today.

""The failure of Sikkim government to complete and commission the 400 kv transmission line from Teesta-III hydro power station to 400 kv grid substation Kishanganj (Bihar) has caused serious transmission bottleneck in Sikkim, resulting in loss of over 500 MW power continuously with financial impact of Rs 6 crore per day,"" an AIPEF white paper on the transmission line said.

According to the paper, power generated from 6 hydro power stations in Sikkim is pooled at 400 kv (kilovolt) grid substation Rangpo, owned by Power Grid Corporation. This pooled power is transmitted from Rangpo to 400 kv grid substation at Binaguri (near Siliguri) about 150 km away in West Bengal. From Binaguri this hydro power is dispersed over eastern grid which in turn is linked with northern, southern and western grid of the country.

The 6 hydro stations which are connected to Rangpo are as NHPC Teesta-V (510 mw, Chuzachen (99 mw), Jorethang (96 mw), Teesta-III ( 1200 mw, with over load capacity of 1320 mw), Dikchu (96 mw), and Tashiding ( 97 mw).

The combined capacity of these hydro stations is 2,098 MW. However, the only transmission line to evacuate this power to eastern grid is the 400 kV double circuit line from Rangpo to Binaguri. Since this line has twin moose conductor, its capacity is about 1,700 mw (megawatt). This line was originally envisaged for Teesta V station of 510 mw, while power from Teesta III was to be evacuated to Kishanganj.

During summer and monsoon, all these hydro power houses get sufficient water availability and operate at 100 per cent capacity on 24x7 basis. But, due to the limitation of Rangpo - Binaguri line with capacity 1,700 MW, the hydro stations of 2,098 mw have to be restricted to about 1,700 mw and thereby have to be backed down to the extent of 398 MW, the paper said.

Since, the Teesta-III power station of 1,200 mw has in-built overload capacity of 10 per cent and is designed for continuous rating of 1,320 mw, the enhanced generation capacity of the 6 power station becomes 2,098 plus 120 at 2,218 MW. With this capacity available, the quantum of backing down necessary to limit the line loading to 1,700 MW then becomes 518 MW, it added.

In the summer/monsoon period of 2017, due to transmission constraint resulting from non-commissioning of Kishanganj line, the Teesta-III power station had to be backed down and there was loss of energy to the extent of 1,462 MU (million units). This resulted in financial loss to TUL (now a Sikkim government company) of the order of Rs 500 crore, the paper noted.

The All India Power Engineers' Federation (AIPEF) stressed that Central government should actively intervene so as to minimise further delay in commissioning of Teesta III- Kishanganj 400 kv line and minimize further loss at rate of Rs 6 crore per day.

So far, the energy loss due to transmission bottleneck caused by the delay is of the same order as the capital cost of the 400 kv line, it added."
101,2018-06-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices opened on a tepid note on Tuesday, tracking weakness across Asian markets. The US President's warning to impose a 10 per cent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in a tit-for-trade trade war spooked global sentiment. Concerns over outflows from emerging markets too weighed on the sentiment.

 At 9.26 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 126 points, or 0.35 per cent, lower at 35,422. Nift50 was trading 33.40 points, or 0.31 per cent, lower at 10,766.45. Asian markets were down up to 0.7 per cent.

 Analysts feel the index may remain rangebound for some time, before seeing a decisive breakout. “Nifty continues to consolidate within the 10,830-10,750 range for past three consecutive sessions, indicating a short-term sideways movement. Breakout on either side of the range will signal further direction,” the expert said.

 Among Sensex stocks, Vedanta dropped 1.55 per cent to Rs 228.70 and was the worst index performer. Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Auto and Wipro fell 1.11 per cent, 1.03 per cent, 0.87 per cent and 0.85 per cent, respectively. 

Coal India, Hero MotoCorp, NTPC and Power Grid declined up to 0.7 per cent. Bharti Airtel, tata Steel and Tata Motors remained exceptions, gaining up to 0.6 per cent. 
Trump on Monday warned China that it would impose a 10 per cent tariff on $200 billion worth Chinese goods following Beijing’s decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in US goods. If China retailates, “we will meet that action by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200 billion of goods,” Trump said.

Meanwhile Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Raphael Bostic said that the US economy is “in a pretty good place” that should let the Fed continue its steady program of raising interest rates.

106,2018-06-20,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government plans to appoint state-owned power distribution companies, central public sector undertakings and municipal corporations as nodal agencies for setting up a minimum skeleton network of more than 4,000 electric vehicle charging infrastructure in identified cities and highways.

The Centre is working on a policy for electric vehicle charging infrastructure as per which the designated government agencies such as NTPC, Power Grid Corporation of India, state power discoms and select municipal authorities will have to identify locations and set up charging infrastructure in the assigned cities and on select highways within one year. They will have to operate the stations for at least three years, said a senior government official.

The government has proposed a grant of Rs 1,050 crore for 4,200 public charging points in populated cities and major highways, besides concessional land and local authority support.

India aims to shift 40% of its fleet to electric mode by 2030.

As per the proposed policy, committees at central and state levels will identify the cities and highways, designate nodal implementing agencies and monitor and review implementation of the charging stations, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The committees might opt for bulk procurement of charging stations through agencies such as Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. The Department of Science and Technology is yet to announce the technology to be adopted for charging stations.

Private companies including Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Fortum, Ola and Uber are keen on entering the charging infrastructure sector but only when e-vehicles sales pick up, the government official said.

“This intervention by the government is required to break the chicken and egg situation where electric vehicle sales are not picking up due to lack of charging points and charging points are not coming up as there are no vehicle sales. PSUs (public sector units) are likely to be asked to set up the required initial infrastructure irrespective of the traffic estimations,” he said.

ET had on May 16 reported that the government proposed to set up a network of electric vehicle charging stations every three kilometres in cities with a million plus population, and at every 30 km on busy national highways.

“This is a gigantic step for New India, and such a policy push would enable to accelerate electric vehicles on ‘market-mode’, similar to solar in the coming years. Large-scale penetration of e-vehicles would be beneficial for grid operators to manage transition in the Indian electricity sector due to high penetration of renewables,” said Alekhya Datta, fellow, The Energy and Resources Institute.

Joy Nandi, Advisor at Blue Canopy Consultants, said this is a welcome move, given that there not a lot of announcements from private charge point operators as yet. ""Of course, key challenges to the execution will be overcoming regulatory and administrative hurdles in their respective organisations with appropriate internal capex and revenue model approvals. Even if that is resolved, customer service orientation and ability to mitigate technology obsolescence with changing battery and charging technologies, catering to multiple EV form-factors and power ratings of EV/EVSEs, are bigger challenges that they will find more difficult to overcome.

""The main question will unfortunately still remain - by when will these public undertakings be ready to take on this mammoth task, after fully understanding the commercial, operational and technological issues related to installing and operating charging stations,"" Nandi said.

The power ministry had clarified in April that setting up of charging stations for electric vehicles would not require a separate licence under the Electricity Act of 2003."

107,2018-06-20,PowerGrid,"The mayhem in midcaps has caused so much pain that investors across the board have turned their focus on just about 100 names in a universe of 3,000 actively-traded stocks on BSE! They are the largecaps, going by Sebi’s definition for mutual funds, which analysts say would be safest bets in a market being buffeted by deteriorating global and domestic macros.

Even among these 100, 10 stocks belonging to a range of industries from pharma to footwear, IT to metal and NBFC to chemicals seem to have become cynosures of all eyes, as mutual funds have bought them in hordes over the past few months and domestic brokerages too are gung-ho about them.

Domestic fund houses bought additional shares in around 100 of BSE500 companies every quarter during the last financial year from across sectors. Among them are 10 stocks which have seen common interest among fund managers and broking firms alike.

When fund managers went shopping last quarter, they mainly concentrated on some of the popular names, such as HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, MRF, ONGC and ITC, among others.

Incidentally, most brokerages have turned overweight on this same set of stocks.

Of the 97 companies in the BSE500 index, where fund managers hiked stake every quarter last year, 47 per cent delivered negative returns last year. However, select stocks like Sonata Software, Jindal Steel & Power, Bajaj Finance, Jamna Auto and Parag Milk Foods rallied over 50 per cent between June 2017 and June 2018, as per March quarter shareholding data.

Buying by this set of domestic institutional investors (DIIs) has provided a cushion to the market so far this year. Foreign institutional investors have offloaded shares worth Rs 1,297 crore till June 14, 2018, while DIIs have bought shares worth Rs 54,394 crore in the same period.

At a time when FIIs have been on a selling spree, DIIs continue to invest in the domestic equities, which has helped stabilise the market to some extent, says Himanshu Srivastava, Senior Analyst - Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Advisor.

“For FIIs, India is like any other investment destination. They continually evaluate India with other countries to understand the risk-reward profile it offers at a given time. Hence, they will not shy away from shifting to other investment destinations if they offer better prospects. As for DIIs, India is the only option they have,” he said.

Among these so-called buzzing stocks, HDFC Bank after allotment of employee stock options (ESOPs) created a 143 basis points additional limit for FIIs on the HDFC Bank counter. And then the government approved a proposal of the bank to raise an additional Rs 24,000 crore capital by selling equity to foreign investors to fund business growth.

Emkay Global Financial Services has a buy rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,306. The scrip was traded at Rs 2,035 on June 20.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is among the conviction buys of JM Financial. “We believe current valuations at 17.3 times FY20 PE capture the near-term risk to company’s earnings to a large extent, and looks like a convictional buy,” the brokerage said. 

M&M is expected to grow faster than the industry average, driven by traction in XUV500 refresh (125 bookings per day), launch of three new UVs and offerings in gasoline powertrain. The UV segment is expected to grow 15 per cent during the year, according to JM Financial.

Market mavens are also bullish on a couple of tyre stocks this year. Fund houses have increased stakes in CEAT and TVS Srichakra to 9 per cent and 4.6 per cent at the end of March quarter from 5 per cent and 1.6 per cent in the same quarter a year ago.

Brokerage firm IIFL is bullish on CEAT with a target price of Rs 1,500. The company has planned a capex of Rs 3,500-4,000 crore over next 4-5 years. This would be front-ended in FY19-FY20. Deutsche Bank last month recommended a ‘buy’ rating on MRF with a price target of Rs 89,000.

Cigarette and tobacco majors VST Industries, ITC and Godfrey Phillips are three so-called sin stocks fund managers were bullish on last year. 

Among others, Torrent Power, NTPC, Power Grid and NHPC from the power generation or distribution sector; and Torrent Pharma, Sun Pharma, Wockhardt, Aurobindo Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Cadila Healthcare and Ajanta Pharma from the pharma space received a lot of attention from fund managers during the year gone. 

Fund houses also bought shares of ONGC during the past four quarters. IIFL has a ‘buy’ on the stock with a target price of Rs 240.

Pharma stocks recently hogged limelight after Sun Pharma’s Halol facility got clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration, removing a key overhang on the stock. 

Gaurav Dua, head of research at the BNP Paribas-owned Sharekhan, said a lot of negatives are now priced in. “We have upgraded Sun Pharma to buy from sell after Q4 results, as many negatives are priced in. There are still pricing pressures in the US, but the intensity of that pressure is easing. The company has a strong product pipeline,” said Dua to ET. 

Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 690.

Antique Stock Broking has a ‘buy’ call on Jindal Steel and Power with a target price of Rs 305. Jindal Steel & Power's steel capacity rampup at Angul positions it well to capitalise on the growth in domestic steel demand and firm pricing scenario, the brokerage said.

Emkay Global Financial Services is also positive on NBCC with a target price of Rs 158. The scrip is hovering around Rs 85 at present. Fund houses increased their stake in NBCC to 2.10 per cent as of March 2018 from 1.7 per cent in December 2017 and 0.60 per cent in March 2017.

Among footwear companies, Bata India is one stock drawing eyeballs. Karvy Stock Broking is bullish on the stock with a target price of Rs 890. The stock has rallied over 40 per cent in last one year till June 14. Fund managers increased their holdings in the company to 17.50 per cent till the end of March quarter from 13.30 per cent in the same period last year."

110,2018-06-21,PowerGrid,"BENGALURU: The $3 billion Riyadh-headquartered Alfanar Group is making a major foray into India’s renewable energy sector, looking to raise $200 million for investments, half of which will be its own funds.

The company plans to bid in auctions planned by the Indian government and expand its portfolio of projects in the sector. Renewable energy auctions have attracted many foreign firms, which have bid aggressively and bagged projects.

“We want to set up 2000 MW by 2021,” said Mohammed Irfan, director-Indian operations at Alfanar Energy. “Half of it will be in wind energy, and the other half in solar.”

So far Alfanar Energy, which entered India in 2016, has commissioned only a single 50 MW wind project in Gujarat with turbines provided by Suzlon. It also won 300 MW at the 2000-MW wind auction conducted by Solar Corporation of India (SECI) in February this year – this project too is being set up in Bhuj, Gujarat.

“We plan to participate in forthcoming auctions of SECI and NTPC, as well those of Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,” said Irfan. “We have already identified large land sites in windy areas in these states and signed agreements with some of the landowners. We are unlikely to bid in auctions of other states as in our view they do not have a good enough project pipeline. For the time being, we will focus on wind projects, because of the uncertainty around the imposition of safeguard duty on imported solar products, but once that is resolved, we want to move into solar as well.”

The company currently has renewable energy – mainly wind – projects in Spain, Egypt and Bangladesh adding up to a total of 1400 MW.

Renewable energy is only one of the many verticals of the group, which is also engaged in building energy infrastructure (power plants and transmission lines), manufacturing a range of electrical equipment, and in design engineering. It also has an R&D hub in India, Alfanar Engineering Services India Ltd, since 2008-09, while its affiliate company, DAR Engineering, runs an architecture design studio in Chennai. In March 2017, Alfanar Electric also acquired the automation business of Crompton Greaves in India for around Rs 845 crore.

“India is a large market,” said Irfan. “We are looking at more than renewable energy here. We also want to enter the EPC transmission and distribution business. Power Grid Corporation of India recently announced it is going to do Rs 17,000 crore worth of upgrades in grid infrastructure. We want to take up projects for setting up 400 kw transmission lines.”"

137,2018-06-22,PowerGrid,"State-run transmission utility Power Grid Corp will commission by the first week of July its first commercial e-vehicle fast charger at one of the metro rail stations in Hyderabad. 

 ""We have tied up with the Hyderabad Metro. We will commission our first commercial fast (direct current) charger at one of the metro rail stations in Hyderabad,"" PowerGrid Chairman and Managing Director I S Jha told reporters on the occasion of the release of a book 'Renewable Energy Technology', co-authored by him. 

 Jha said the company is in talks with Hyderabad Metro to install fast chargers at its 24 stations in the city, which can charge an e-vehicle in about an hour and top up half charged batteries in 15 to 20 minutes. 

 He further said that the company is in talks with Gurugram metro rail and Chennai metro rail to install its fast chargers at their train stations to give a boost to the e-vehicles initiative in the country. 

 The CMD was of the view that the public sector has to push e-vehicle initiative in the country by providing supportive infrastructure till the time it is a big hit among the private sector players. 

 About the green energy transmission infrastructure being developed by PowerGrid, he said the company has already completed many transmission links and the transmission infrastructure development is way ahead of clean energy project development. 

 He said the green energy transmission infrastructure is in place much before coming up of renewable energy generation projects in the country. 

 Talking about high voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, he said Champa to Kurukshetra HVDC line would be operational by the end of this year while the company will try to commission Raigarh to Pugalur HVDC by April 2019 against its deadline of 2020. 

 Power Minister R K Singh after launching the book, said, ""Renewable energy technology covers in depth renewable energy generation technologies and challenges associated with grid integration of renewables and their solutions. Seasoned professionals as well as young student community interested in the domain of renewable energy will greatly benefit from this book, which is written by qualified persons both from industry and academics working in this field."""

139,2018-06-25,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Stocks that are part of the recently-concluded further fund issue of Bharat 22 ETF are likely to see a rally as traders who sold their futures contracts before the offering will now reverse their positions. Many traders including arbitrageurs had put money in the Bharat 22 ETF issue which ended on Friday and simultaneously sold futures of stocks that are part of the ETF (exchange traded fund, which is a basket of stocks).

“If somebody is applying in the ETF, they hedge the likely receivable of units by shorting the stocks which are part of ETF. They short futures of high weightage stocks which gives them sufficient hedge. Once the allotment is done, these short positions will have to be covered,” said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICIdirect.

The second tranche of the Bharat 22 ETF was subscribed 2.3 times on the final day of the offering, with the issue getting subscription to the tune of ₹14,000 crore, according to reports. The government had targeted mopping up ₹6,000 crore from the Bharat 22 ETF with a greenshoe option of another ₹2,400 crore.

The ETF comprises 22 stocks including that of public sector bluechips and private companies which are strategic holding of Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India or SUUTI. These include NALCO, ONGC, Indian Oil Corp, BPCL, Coal India, SBI, PFC, REC, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, L&T, ITC, Power Grid and NTPC, among others.

“The SUUTI stocks and energy stocks which are part of the Bharat 22 ETF have a high weightage in it. So these stocks are likely to see a short covering led rally,” said Gupta.

The short covering will depend on how oversubscribed the ETF is and likewise how much have people hedged against it, added Gupta.

The government has offered the Bharat 22 ETF at a 2.5 per cent discount to its net asset value or NAV. Last year in November when the government launched this ETF, it had given a 3 per cent discount.

“Arbitrageurs have hedged by selling futures just like they did in case of the Bharat 22 ETF last year. The stocks like L&T, ITC and ONGC which are part of the Bharat 22 ETF are likely to be firm in the coming days given that the hedging activity is over,” Yogesh Radke, Head of Alternative and Quantitative Research at Edelweiss Securities When allotment happens, some short covering is possible, he added.

Analysts are also positive on some of the stocks in Bharat ETF due to better risk-reward.

“We are positive on ITC, SBI and L&T. These stocks have seen correction in recent days and risk reward is attractive now,” said Chandan Taparia, derivative analyst at Motilal Oswal.

Shares of ITC have fallen nearly 5 per cent in the last one month while that L&T have declined 2 per cent during the same period."
138,2018-06-25,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: The corporate bond market, projected as the primary funding source for India’s infrastructure needs, is in a spot because of escalating borrowing costs and dwindling volumes.

Against this backdrop, top traditional borrowers — Nabard, Power Grid, IRFC, and Rural Electri--fication — are meeting this week to overcome the hurdles they face in raising cash on the new electronic bidding platform, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ET.

Individual companies could not be contacted immediately.

They are likely to present a joint case to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

“Nabard has called a meeting of seven to eight government-owned companies, which are big issuers of corporate bonds. They want to make a joint move to the authorities to help ease the barriers,” said one of the sources cited above.

In April and May, corporate bond sales (via private placement) fell 63 per cent to ₹32,704 crore, show data from Prime Database.

The largest institutional debt investor, the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), has already approached Sebi seeking a relaxation of the new norms, ET reported on June 18. Another large financial institution, known for its voluminous bond buying, is said to have raised concerns with the finance ministry.

Since the beginning of the financial year, Sebi has made the electronic bidding platform (EBP) mandatory for all private bond sales with a minimum size of ₹200 crore. The move was aimed at attaining transparent pricing through the bidding process. BSE and NSE are the two popular platforms for such an operation. “This has diminished the role of arrangers, who in some cases prove pivotal for fine pricing,” said a senior bank executive.

Participants say the new practice is posing two key challenges: Payment remittances and price discovery.

An investor needs to make pay ments to the exchanges for bonds subscribed by 10.30 am the day after the bidding.

Due to banking operations and multiple fund deployments, many large investors are unable to stick to this deadline.

Consequently, some of them in need of money are approaching market arrangers, who are collecting multiple bids only to put a uniform coupon following the new norms. Such rates tend to be much higher than the issuer’s estimate.

For example, if there are 10 bidders giving different bids through one arranger, it will have little option but to take the highest bid as the uniform bid, agreeable to all. This is raising borrowers’ costs.

Primary bonds are about 10-20 basis points costlier than secondary market rates of the same company, dealers said.

Nabard has sold 15-year bonds at 8.83 per cent in the primary market on exchange platforms, compared with 8.65 per cent available in the secondary market. Latest rules suggest that an investor must go through the electronic bidding platform if investment is ₹15 crore or more.

The spread between the central government and corporate bonds has also widened to 75 basis points for 10-year maturity, compared with 55 basis points two-three weeks ago."

Investors restricted their bets ahead of the expiry of June series of options and derivatives contract on Thursday.

Besides, a fresh rise in global crude oil prices and a precarious Indian rupee remained a worry. A recent ET poll of 20 market participants suggests that the rupee may slump to a new low this year amid global policy uncertainties while domestic interest rates will remain elevated, raising borrowing costs. 

However, Indian shares, especially the largecaps, showed some resilience during the afternoon session as European shares showed a slight uptick, despite the worries around an escalating trade war.

“The escalating global trade tensions between the US and other major economies could keep the Indian markets choppy and volatile in the coming sessions.

The Nifty50 index continued to face selling pressure for the second session after the recent breakdown from consolidation phase to slip below 10,700.

The index formed a bearish candle on the daily scale, followed by Bearish Belt Hold pattern. It has been making lower highs and lower lows for last three sessions and has slipped below its 50-day EMA.

As long as Nifty sustains below 10,660, the index may weaken further towards 10,550 and then 10,420 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,660 and then 10,700 levels.

On the options front, open interest was scattered across different strike prices at the start of July series. Maximum Put open interest was at strike price 10,600 followed by 10,500 while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,800.

Options data suggested limited upside while downside support is yet to be established in the absence of meaningful open interest inventory at the beginning of a new series.

India VIX moved up 3.24 per cent to 13.95 level. The spurt in VIX indicates that the bears have a grip on the market and there was selling pressure even in the heavyweight stocks in line with the weakness in global markets.

Bank Nifty continued to face selling pressure and has been making lower highs and lower lows for last three sessions. It has formed an engulfing pattern on the weekly scale, which signalled limited upside. As long as Nifty remains below 26,500, it could drift towards 26,100 and then 25,950 levels, while on the upside, major hurdles are seen at 26,500 and then 26,750 levels.

Nifty futures closed in the negative with a loss of 0.89 per cent at 10,671.

150,2018-06-28,PowerGrid,"Life Insurance Corporation has bought the first issuance of the longest maturity 30-year bonds this financial year, sold by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

India’s biggest domestic institutional investor bought Rs 2,000-crore worth of the bonds in an online primary transaction. NHAI offered 8.55% coupon on the bonds for the first 10 years while the rate would be reset after every decade based on existing benchmark yields then, dealers said.

Both NHAI and LIC could not be contacted immediately.

NHAI, which has been working actively on new road building, needs long-term money to meet its targets.

NHAI will need to raise about Rs 1.3 lakh crore by 2020 on the back of increasing cost of land acquisition due to faster construction, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Securities.

“Increase in construction activity thus would possibly drive cost of land acquisition to new highs,” the report said.

The latest bond sale has helped lift sentiment in the corporate bond market, which is projected as a viable channel for long-term financing.

In April and May, corporate bond sales (via private placement) fell 63 per cent to Rs 32,704 crore, show data from Prime Database.

The corporate bond market, projected as the primary funding source for India’s infrastructure needs, has been in a spot because of escalating borrowing costs and dwindling volumes. Some operational difficulties arising out of new norms applicable for exchange bidding platforms are blamed for the lower volumes. Both investors and borrowers have voiced their concerns.

The country’s biggest pension fund has approached the Securities Exchange Board of India over the matter, while another largest domestic institutional debt investor is said to have approached the finance ministry.

Top-rated borrowers including Nabard, Power Grid, IRFC, and Rural Electrification Corp are working jointly to overcome the procedural hurdles."

""Here (in case of railway concessions) I had not announced anything. But the railways themselves on their form asked people if they would want to give up their senior citizen concessions...I am proud to say that in the past eight-nine months, 42 lakh elderly passengers have voluntarily given up their subsidy,"" Modi said.

He further said that he had requested the doctors of the country to treat pregnant women free of cost at least once in a month, following which thousands of medical practitioners had come forward. ""And 1.25 crore pregnant women have been treated free-of cost so far,"" he said.

The prime minister had called on doctor working in the private sector to provide free ante-natal services (ANC) on the 9th of every month on a voluntary basis to pregnant women, especially those living in under-served, semi-urban, poor and rural areas during his radio address in 2016.

Reiterating India's commitment to eradicate TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global target, Modi said he has faith that the healthcare sector of the country would meet the challenge.

In the past four years, the public healthcare sector has been given a new direction and the continuous policy interventions by the union government have ensured that the poor and the middle-class do not have to wander around for better health services and spend unnecessarily on them.

0,2018-07-01,PowerGrid,"The bulls and bears have been engaged in a tug of war on Dalal Street for most part of this year, testing investors' patience. While most midcap and smallcap stocks have tumbled up to double digits, many of the heavyweights from top industries too have failed to hold up, giving mixed returns.

Data showed that five top stocks of India Inc from 10 major industries have failed to deliver positive returns despite a 4.76 per cent jump in Sensex in the first six months of the year.

But analysts continue to be bullish on most of the largecaps and believe select sectors, including IT and pharma, can be good contra bets in a tepid market.

Blue chip companies that underperformed the benchmark equity index, telecom major Bharti Airtel has plunged 27.86 per cent during January 1 to June 29, followed by real estate company DLF (26.50 per cent) and auto major Maruti Suzuki (down 8.73 per cent).

A cut throat tariff war has kept the pressure on telecom majors this year. Telecom revenues (adjusted gross revenues, AGR) fell 7 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) during January-March, and are down 25 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2015-16 levels, revealed a report by Jefferies.

It said telecom revenues are now back at the 2012-13 levels. ""The fall was precipitated by price cuts at end-January by Jio and incumbents. Industry ARPUs (average revenue per users) fell another 11 per cent QoQ and now stand at Rs 70/sub/month.""

Ambar Ambani, Head of Research, IIFL said, “Telcos face an acute dilemma as bundled plans raise volumes but do not provide commensurate revenues due to low ARPU regime. Hence, the near-term pressure on margin may persist as incumbents will need to invest to stay relevant. We retain overweight stance with a bullish bet on Bharti Airtel based on inexpensive 6 times FY20 EV/EBIDTA.”

Even the country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, has been underperforming the broader market due to concerns about fuel price inflation, Yen appreciation, and slower-than-expected progress so far in parent Suzuki’s alliance with Toyota.

Maruti reported a 26 per cent increase in total sales at 1,72,512 units in May against 1,36,962 units in the year-ago month. The firm’s domestic sales stood at 1,63,200 units, up 24.9 per cent from 1,30,676 units in May last year. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has a buy rating on Maruti with a target price of Rs 10,525.

“The stock underperformance was despite stronger-than-estimated volume growth at around 15 per cent in CY18YTD. We expect the earnings upgrade cycle for Maruti Suzuki to continue, driven by higher volumes and margins,” Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Many of the smaller real estate players have gone out of business post the implementation of RERA, which should help big players, especially the cash-rich realtors. But DLF continues to lag.

Yogesh Mehta of Motilal Oswal in a chat with ETNow has earlier said that, “For DLF, there will be a lot more to understand into the balance sheet and lot of many things to be watched out. We do not have a comfort level to evaluate this company on the balance sheet.” DLF recently reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 244 crore for the fourth quarter of 2017-18.


State-owned power transmission behemoth Power Grid Corporation and drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries are super powers in their own domains, but their shares are down 6.81 per cent and 2.28 per cent, respectively, in 2018.

Most analysts are bullish on pharma. Independent analyst Anand Tandon told ETNow that profitability still has to come through in this sector. There may be some profit taking in the near term. But if you look at it on a one or two-year timeframe, there is reasonable headroom on the upside for the pharma companies to continue to do well.

“We have just seen the initial news flow coming through in terms of some approvals as well as from the fact that there is just that initial bit of less pricing pressure in the US. But a lot more needs to be done and the road ahead is quite long,” he added.

Global brokerage firm CLSA has a ‘buy’ call on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 600, whereas Elara Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Power Grid with a target price of Rs 245.

IT major Tata Consultancy Services and FMCG major Hindustan Unilever have rallied 38 per cent and 21.87 per cent, respectively, this calendar. Private sector lender HDFC Bank, oil and gas major Reliance Industries, and engineering major Larsen & Toubro are up 13.52 per cent, 6.74 per cent and 0.75 per cent, respectively. HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries are among the stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focussed list.

Morgan Stanley said, “L&T is a beneficiary as India's capex journey accelerates and the company is the best way to play the acceleration.”

On June 15, Tata Consultancy Services became the first listed company in India to hit a market capitalisation of over Rs 7 lakh crore after the firm's board approved a share buyback for about Rs 16,000 crore, which was larger than expected in terms of price and quantity.

CLSA has a ‘buy’ rating on TCS with a target price of Rs 1,850, whereas Motilal Oswal is ‘neutral’ on the IT major with a target price of Rs 1,750. The scrip ended at Rs 1,847.20 on June 29.

Motilal Oswal is also positive on HUL with a target price of Rs 1,840."

Market participants use three major indicators, 50-, 100- and 200- DMAs to read the direction of a security. When a stock trades below all the DMAs, it is usually said to be in a continuing downtrend.

Just because a stock trades below its 200-DMA does not mean it is in a bearish trend. It just implies that the stock is undergoing a major corrective move.

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections make stocks test their 50- or 100-DMAs, but any serious correction may cause a stock not only test its 200-DMA, but also slip below it.

Avanti Feeds, Sheela Foam, Somany Ceramics, Sterlite Technologies, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company, SpiceJet, Shankara Building Products and Sadbhav Engineering are among the stocks trading well below their 200-DMAs.

On the downside, a breach of the support zone between 10,604 and 10,557 shall trigger a major decline.

19,2018-07-06,PowerGrid,"Is India’s power sector, dogged by supply overhang and debt for long, finally showing early signs of revivalRs The demand-supply situation is improving with tapering capacity additions and accelerated retirements of old capacities. This also reflects in the improving plant load factor (PLF), or capacity utilisation in FY18, and a rebound in merchant tariffs.

From their 2017 lows, of Rs 2.5 last July, tariffs have rebounded to Rs 3.7 per unit average price in June. Similarly, after seven years of decline, industry PLF improved by 100 basis points yearon-year to 51 per cent (excluding renewables) and by 100 basis points to 58 per cent in case of only thermal (coal and gas) power capacities.



Gross conventional capacity additions are also drying up – down to only 6 GW in FY18 from 9 GW in FY17 and 23 GW in FY16. It peaked in FY13 at 24 GW. At the same time, retirement of old capacities is accelerating – from none in FY16 to 4 GW in FY17 and 4.1 GW in FY18 against estimated retirement of 1.5 GW in each of the last two years. While the incremental supply is tapering, demand is estimated to gradually inch higher in the coming years. Industry experts expect the demand growth to be at 6.3 per cent for the next three years, compared to 5.6 per cent in the last three years.



This improving demand-supply situation would be a positive for the listed power companies such as JSW Energy, CESC, NTPC, Coal India and Power Grid. Unlike several other power utilities that are under stress due to high debt or lack of fuel availability, these companies are well placed with strong balance sheets and no fuel-related issues.



Stocks of these companies are trading at multiyear low valuations – price-to-book multiples – and can see a re-rating if the positive trend continues for the next few quarters."
18,2018-07-06,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: A lower base in the previous year’s quarter and likely good show by select companies in sectors such as automobiles, capital goods, FMCG, IT, and metals should help the Nifty 50 companies report a double-digit growth in aggregate sales and profits for the June 2018 quarter. According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, net sales is likely to increase by 12.1 per cent and net profit by 13.5 per cent year-on-year. Sales and profit will grow in double- digits for the fifth and third consecutive quarters, respectively.

The corporate performance in the June 2018 quarter will get a leg up given relatively muted performance in the year-ago quarter. This was because of lower inventories of companies in the June 2017 quarter ahead of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1, 2017. Subsequently, net profit of the sample grew marginally by 1.8 per cent during the year-ago quarter on sales growth of 10 per cent while the operating profit fell by 1.3 per cent.

Operating profit for the June 2018 quarter is likely to grow by 15 per cent, the highest growth in at least nine quarters. In addition, the operating margin is expected to improve by 180 basis points year-onyear to 20.2 per cent.

For investors, the quarter will be crucial in deciding whether an overall turnaround will be in sight amid headwinds of strong crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, rising inflation and hardening interest rates.




SECTOR TRENDS

AUTOMOBILESAuto companies are expected to report good numbers following sustained volume growth across the vehicle segments thanks to improving consumer sentiments, replacement demand and price increase. Auto volumes grew 13-60 per cent during the June quarter. A better operating leverage is likely to support operating margins of Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki and domestic operations of Tata Motors.


BANKING AND FINANCEPrivate sector banks with relatively higher focus on corporate lending, including Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, are expected to report lesser amount of new non-performing assets considering their higher slippages in the previous quarter. This combined with rising retail book may help them to post a resilient performance.


CAPITAL GOODSThe continued support from the government-funded projects is likely to support the earnings growth of capital goods companies. The trend in Larsen & Toubro’s order flow will be watched closely since the country’s largest infrastructure company has earlier guided for 12-15 per cent growth in order flow on a higher base. PowerGrid is expected to maintain the ratio of project commission-to-capital expenditure above one.


CEMENTCement prices were largely stable during the June quarter, which means companies may not be able to clock meaningful growth in realisations. Volume growth will be between 5 per cent and 18 per cent for large companies. Companies are expected to record 4-21 per cent year-on-year revenue growth.


FMCGFor FMCG, numbers may not be strictly comparable due to destocking before the GST implementation in the previous June quarter. However, the positive trend shown by FMCG companies in the previous two quarters is likely to continue. Nifty companies HUL and Asian Paints are expected to deliver highteen sales growth, albeit on a low base, while ITC may report modest numbers as the year-on-year decline in cigarette volumes continues.


IT
Select top IT companies including TCS, Infosys, and HCL Tech are likely to report 2-3 per cent growth in the dollar denominated revenue keeping the currency rates constant to the previous quarter’s levels. The impact of unfavourable cross-currency rates between the euro, the pound, and the dollar may be partially offset by 4 per cent sequential drop in the average rupee rate against the dollar. The trend in digital revenue will be critical.


METALSFerrous metal companies are likely to do better than non-ferrous counterparts unlike the previous few quarters, thanks to record high global steel spreads (excluding Europe). Non-ferrous companies will face the headwinds on the cost front, particularly coal, crude derivatives and alumina. Coal India is expected to do well with 15 per cent volume growth in the first three months of FY19.


PHARMAPharma companies are likely to report strong double-digit growth for their Indian businesses, due to low base of the previous June quarter. The US business for pharma companies is likely to remain flattish to marginally positive due to lack of any meaningful launches. However, the Indian players will benefit from the rupee depreciation and see a double- digit operating profit growth in the US business.


TELECOMTelecom companies are expected to report pressure on average revenue per user for voice and data segments. This may limit the scope for higher topline growth despite rising data usage."

21,2018-07-10,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: India’s latest bidding for 2,000 MW wind energy capacity has been undersubscribed by 800 MW, and there is a chance that the tender may be scrapped as lack of transmission infrastructure continues to bother clean energy players.

Four renewable energy developers — Renew Power, Adani Green Energy, Sprng Energy and Alfanar Energy —submitted technical bids for 300 MW capacity each on Tuesday, making up for 1,200 MW of the total capacity floated by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). Industry watchers said the lacklustre response is not due to lack of interest in the wind sector, but there are concerns over whether there is enough infrastructure available to evacuate the power generated through these projects.

A senior official said the government is trying to address the concerns of developers and will take a decision soon.

“Within a couple of days, a call will be taken on whether we want to defer the bid or cancel it entirely— I wouldn’t rule out that possibility,” the official said on condition of anonymity. “We will try and keep the interest in the bid alive.” The tender will be floated afresh if the bid is cancelled, the official said. SECI had tendered the interstate transmission (ISTS)-connected 2,000 MW capacity under Tranche-V in May.



An industry executive, however, said there is no clarity on power evacuation. “Power Grid Corporation is right now augmenting all their sub-stations. Unless that is done, there is no free capacity available,” the executive said. “It could probably be one of the reasons why many developers stayed away.”

Vinay Rustagi, managing director at renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India, said the dampened interest in SECI bid was inevitable as developers continue to invest in projects without a visibility on the transmission side."

23,2018-07-12,PowerGrid,"GE Grid Solutions today said it has commissioned the first leg of mega grid-stabilisation project of Power Grid Corporation for the northern grid.

After completion, the project would be the world's largest Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) solution that entails monitoring and controlling of electricity supply across the country which will positively impact India's total population, a company statement said.

The project is part of the Unified Real Time Dynamic State Measurement (URTDSM) initiative.

The project has been executed by GE T&D India Ltd, listed entity of GE Power's Grid Solution business in India.

This first stage will enable PGCIL to monitor power flow across 110 substations in the Northern Grid (NR) and respond to fluctuations within a fraction of a second. This will be critical in addressing power demand-supply imbalances and ensuring grid stability benefitting from the integration of renewable energy with the grid, it said.

When fully commissioned, this new WAMS solution will be the world's largest comprising 1,184 Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and 34 control centres across India, 350 substations in the national grid.

In July 2012, India suffered the world's biggest power blackout due to a grid failure which impacted more than 620 million people across 22 states.

A committee of international experts formed by the government to minimize the future possibility and impact of grid failure, recommended the implementation of a Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) solution across the country to measure the dynamic state of the grid and detect the onset of any unstable oscillation event.

In January 2014, GE T&D (formerly Alstom T&D) was awarded a USD 52.2 million contract to install WAMS across all five regional grids of north, south, east, west and northeast India."

A 'buy' signal occurs when the MACD rises above its signal line and vice-versa. However, the MACD indicator alone may not be sufficient to take an investment or trading call.

27,2018-07-20,PowerGrid,"Foreign institutional investors (FII) turned net sellers during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. However, they were found picking select stocks from across sectors, such as staffing, auto ancillary, construction, chemicals, information technology, pharma, housing finance and stock broking, among others.

FIIs offloaded shares worth Rs 20,443 crore during the April-June period against Rs 13,722 crore inflow in the same period last year. Soaring crude oil prices, a depreciating rupee and higher bond yields in the US were among the primary reasons that led to the outflows.

Among the largecaps, FIIs increased holdings in Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, UPL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Lupin, Power Grid and Bajaj Finance. They increased their holding in HDFC Bank to 40.86 per cent at the end of June quarter from 40.43 per cent as of March 31, 2018. 

Barring UPL and Power Grid, shares of these companies rallied between 2 per cent and 27 per cent during the quarter.



Shareholding data available with Ace Equity till July 18 shows overseas portfolio investors hiked stakes in around 75 companies by more than 1 percentage points.

Tiles manufacturer Nitco drew strong interest from FIIs, who raised stake in the firm to 24.25 per cent at the end of June quarter from 1.18 per cent at the end of March. 

Among others, Indiabulls Integrated Services, SE Power, Mercator, Gokaldas Exports, MEP Infrastructure and BSEL Infrastructure Realty saw FII holdings go up by more than 10 percentage points during the quarter gone by.

In the real estate space, Sobha, Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty attracted FII interest. FII holding in the Bangalore-based Sobha rose to 30.27 per cent from 28.53 per cent in the previous quarter, while in Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty, FIIs raised holdings by over 4 percentage points.

Sales bookings at Sobha jumped 22 per cent to Rs 762.40 crore during June quarter on bigger volumes as well as higher price realisations.

FIIs showed a lot of interest in midcap IT firms, including L&T Infotech (from 6.92 per cent to 7.98 per cent), Sonata Software (from 14.67 per cent to 15.94 per cent), Cyient (from 40.42 per cent to 43.08 per cent), Mphasis (from 22.79 per cent to 29.17 per cent) and Aptech (from 5.19 per cent to 7.12 per cent) during the quarter. 



From the pharma space, Neuland Labs, Suven Life, Ipca Labs and Marksans Pharma saw strong FII interest.

A depreciating rupee will provide a fair amount of tailwind to IT and pharma companies in terms of margin expansion, but one can’t be sure whether it can improve the prospects of IT and pharma on a headline basis, Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher, told ETNow in a chat.

“Selectively, some of the stocks would look good, but as a sector, it would be more defensive and may not help make big money on a proactive basis,” he said.

In the textiles space, Lakshmi Machine Works, Ambika Cotton Mills and Gokaldas Exports saw increased interest from FIIs, who also hiked stakes in Dish TV from the broadcasting space.

Staffing players found favour with foreign investors, who took their stake in Teamlease to 40.30 per cent in Q1FY19 from 32.46 in Q4FY18. Likewise, Quess Corp saw FII holding rise to 13.70 per cent from 4.70 per cent.

“Staffing companies will be a natural play on formalisation of businesses, because you are taking a labour force, which is primarily informal. They will now start coming into the formal world,” independent market expert Saurabh Mukherjea told ETNow. 

Staffing companies are a kind of go between. They are the brokers of people. Staffing as a space and formalisation as a theme would be two mega themes that will work wonderfully well in the years ahead, he said."

39,2018-07-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: India may be touted as the next big market for electric vehicles (EV) but they will find the going tough for the next decade in the world's third-largest oil-guzzling economy due to dominance of affordable cars and absence of meaningful policy drive for new energy mobility.

According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), EVs will make up only 7% of annual vehicle sales in India by 2030. Sales will gather pace after this and reach 27% of annual vehicle sales by 2040, by which time 13% of passenger vehicles in the country will be EVs.

In contrast, the BNEF 'Outlook for EVs 2018' sees EVs constituting 41% of annual vehicle sales in China by 2030. The world's secondlargest oil consumer has already emerged as the largest EV market globally, selling 777,000 EVs in 2017, representing 49% of global passenger EV sales in 2017.


Unlike China, there were just under 6,000 highway-capable passenger EVs on India's roads at the end of 2017 when annual sales stood at 2,000 units. By 2022, however, the report sees EV sales rising to 30,000 units a year, driven primarily by government and corporate procurement programmes.

According to the report, adoption of EVs in India has been hamstrung by uncertain policy support mechanisms, lack of access to reliable charging service, unreliable power supply and inability of discoms to invest in charging stations due to poor financial health. It is only now that state-run companies are testing the waters with scattered pilot-size EV charging projects.

But unlike India, EVs are flying off the shelves in China on the back of strong policy push and hefty subsidies. The country's two state-owned utilities - State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid - have heavily invested in charging infrastructure. China had rolled out its nationwide New Energy Vehicle subsidy programme in 2015.

India, on the other hand, moved in fits and starts. Power, coal and renewable energy minister Piyush Goyal had in March 2016 announced that the government was considering plans to achieve 100% EV sales by 2030. Transport minister Nitin Gadkari backed this by suggesting car makers redesign their future production plans. But last year, the government said it would leave it to the market to decide the pace of change. Finally in January, the heavy industries ministry told Parliament that the government had no official EV target for 2030.

The government revised regulations to enable private investment in charging infrastructure recently but lack of coordination among its different wings, unreliable electricity supply and lack of demand due to the low number of EVs hamper private investment."
38,2018-07-27,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: India’s stock indices ended at record highs Thursday led by banking shares, with the benchmark Sensex hurdling the 37,000 barrier for the first time, underscoring the impact of robust June-quarter earnings on investor sentiment.

Both the Nifty and the Sensex gained for the fifth consecutive session. 

The Nifty gained 35.30 points, or 0.32 per cent, to 11,167.30 points at the expiry of the July derivatives series. 

It surpassed the earlier record of 11,171.55, hit on January 29, and set a new all-time high of 11,185.85.

The Sensex, meanwhile, ended just shy of the 37,000 level after breaching the mark intraday, gaining 126.41 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 36,984.64. It hit a record high of 37,061.62 intraday. The volatility gauge, India VIX, fell 1.5 per cent at 12.03.

SBI was the top performer on the Sensex on Thursday, ending up 5.6 per cent at Rs 286.70.


Driven by a Handful of Large Caps

Other top gainers — ICICI Bank, Power Grid Corporation of India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Axis Bank, NTPC, Bharti Airtel and Housing Development Finance Corp — climbed 1.2-4.1 per cent.

“It is true that the market has gone up on the back of a few stocks, the Nifty at least,” said Mahesh Patil, co-chief investment officer at Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund. “However, the broader market participation is slowly starting to get reflected. Stocks with good fundamentals in mid- and small-caps should be able to bounce back as valuations have corrected now.”

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Indian shares worth Rs 2,453.57 crore Thursday while domestic institutional investors sold stock worth Rs 2,716.04 crore, provisional data showed.

The BSE Mid-Cap index gained 0.76 per cent at 15,763.22 and the BSE Small-Cap index ended up 0.3 per cent at 16,306.02.

The Nifty ended the July series with a gain of 5.5 per cent and the Sensex gained 5.6 per cent during the same period. The BSE Mid-Cap index gained 3.9 per cent during the July series and the BSE Small-Cap index gained 3.7 per cent.

“We don’t expect the divergence between large caps and mid-caps to increase further unless there is a global risk off,” added Patil.

Despite the recent gains, the Mid-Cap index is 14 per cent away from its record high of 18,321.37 hit on January 9 this year. The Small-Cap index is 19 per cent away from its record high of 20183.45, hit on January 15.

The broader market beyond the frontline stocks has been affected by the US-China trade war, a recent surge in crude oil prices, the depreciation in rupee, and rising interest rates in the US. High valuations have further exacerbated the pain for mid- and smallcaps. Reclassification of mutual funds by the capital markets regulator and increased surveillance measures announced by exchanges also took a toll on this category of shares.

“The market rally is a narrow one, driven by a handful of large caps, while mid and small-caps have seen a decline,” said Pratik Gupta, head of equities at Deutsche Bank India.

Gupta prefers large-caps to mid- and small-caps.

“Valuations are still high versus large-caps. Given the relatively better liquidity and growth prospects for some of the large-caps, we believe that it is still early to get back into small- and mid-caps,” said Gupta. “There are certain good quality mid-caps that may be worth looking at but, by and large, we would still advise caution,” he added."
43,2018-07-28,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Stocks set new records on Friday with the Sensex hitting a life-high for the fifth consecutive day and the 21st time this year on hopes that the spate of recent corporate results bodes well for the country’s economic outlook.

 Bank stocks surged, cigarette maker ITC rallied after strong results while Reliance Industries, which has the second-biggest weightage in the index, rose ahead of quarterly results.

 The Nifty, which hit a life-high on Thursday, continued to climb on Friday closing above the 11,200 mark. The Sensex closed above the 37,000 for the first time ever. The index has now made a lifehigh eight times in July and 21 times so far in 2018.

The benchmark has gained 5.4% so far this month and is on track to achieve its best-ever monthly gain since April this year, when it climbed 6.6%. The BSE MidCap index is up 3% so far in July, while the BSE SmallCap index is up 2.6%.

“As markets make new highs, stocks which were not performing are also starting to perform. Risk appetite is going up not just in India but globally. The S&P and Dow are also close to year highs. Crude has retraced and is now stagnant at $72-75 per barrel. We expect the Nifty to touch 11,450 in August,” said Piyush Garg, CIO, ICICI Securities.

FMCG major ITC led the gains ending up 5.2% at ₹302.2 as brokerages remained upbeat on the company following strong June quarter result. The cigarette maker contributed nearly 33 points to Nifty’s gain on Friday. Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto and Axis Bank ended up 1.85-3.56%. Power Grid Corporation, Adani Ports, Coal India, TCS and Maruti Suzuki ended the day as worst performers, down 0.86-1.72%.

Optimism over corporate earnings have fuelled buying interest and has trumped the concerns surrounding trade wars. Easing oil prices have also aided the gains.

Foreign portfolio investors net bought shares worth ₹738 crore, while domestic institutional investors net bought shares worth ₹406.12 crore.

The Sensex closed up 352.21 points, or 0.95%, at 37,336.85 after hitting a life-high of 37,368.62. The Nifty jumped 111.05 points, or 1%, at 11,278.35 after having hit a lifetime high of 11,283.40. Nifty Bank ended up 0.8% at 27,634.40 after hitting a lifetime high of 27,661.05.

“FII outflows being less volatile and oil prices coming off the highs and stabilising have supported the market. Midcaps had also seen a sharp correction and they have now come off the lows,” said Vinit Sambre, head of equities at DSP BlackRock Investment Managers.

Analysts believe the rally may be short lived.

“We believe the rally is likely to be short lived as it does not have legs to go up regularly. We need to monitor the valuations and the macro picture. The next trigger will be oil prices and the tone of the central bank in the upcoming monetary policy,” said Sambre.

Pramod Gubbi, head of equities at Ambit Capital, believes a broader stock participation is required for the markets to sustain the gains. “We need a new bunch of stocks to participate for the market to sustain (the rally), which needs a more secular recovery in the earnings and the economy. I don’t think the market has more legs to rally unless more stocks participate,” said Gubbi."
44,2018-07-29,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a terrific run last week, as it scaled fresh lifetime high. However, only select largecaps lifted the equities higher while broader market continued to struggle.

A better-than-expected quarterly numbers from companies, including ITC, Colgate-Palmolive, JSW Steel, YES Bank, Biocon and Dr Reddy's nudged the bulls to take big strides, lifting frontline indices to fresh milestones. Other factors that compelled investors to fall for equities included reduction in GST rates on over 100 items, FIIs buying again and positive global cues.

On a weekly basis, the BSE Sensex gained 840 points, or 2.3 per cent, while the 50-share pack surged 268 points, or 2.4 per cent.

Going ahead, it's going to be a policy week as many major central banks are going to declare their monetary policy. 

Here’s an in-depth look at these and other factors that are likely to steer market this week - 


RBI's rate-setting meetingThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to meet during July 30 to August 1 for the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2018-2019. The six-member monetary policy committee of the central bank headed by Governor Urjit Patel in June meet bit the bullet and hiked the repo rate – the short-term lending rate – by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.

Speculations are rife that the bank will hike interest rates for second time on Wednesday as inflation risks mount. 


Next batch of quarterly earningsCorporate earnings will continue to dominate the Street's proceedings in the coming week. Among notable names, Axis Bank, HDFC, Idea Cellular, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Shree Cement are slated to declare their June quarter results on Monday. Bank of India, Dabur India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Motors and Vedanta will announce theirs on Tuesday. Indiabulls Housing Finance and Marico are expected to unveil their report cards on Thursday. Nestle India and Titan Company will declare theirs on Friday.


US Fed meetUS Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed had hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point in June and indicated that two more increases are likely this year. The move pushed the funds rate target to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.


BoJ and BoEBank of Japan (BoJ) will unveil its interest rate decision on Tuesday. According to a report by Reuters, it might be doing some ‘jinarashi’ i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. BoJ had left its key short-term interest rate unchanged at -0.1 per cent at its June 2018 meeting.

This apart, Bank of England (BoE) will declare its interest rate decision on Thursday. Governor Mark Carney is looking to throw off his “unreliable boyfriend” tag and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 per cent, reports Reuters. BoE left its key bank rate on hold at 0.5 per cent on 21 June 2018.


Auto stocks in focusAutomakers will start releasing their sales numbers for July from Wednesday. Auto firms including cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, reported a higher double-digit growth in sales in June. Auto major Maruti Suzuki India posted a robust growth of 44 per cent in the domestic sales with 1.34 lakh units in June as compared with 93,057 units the same period last fiscal.


TCNS Clothing listingShares of TCNS Clothing will get listed on BSE and NSE on Monday. The initial public offer (IPO) of the women's apparel maker was subscribed 5.27 times during its IPO. The Rs 1,125 crore public offer received bids for 5,79,79,780 shares against the total issue size of 1,09,99,828.


What tech chart sayThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a bullish candle similar to the 'Bullish Marubozu' pattern on the daily and weekly scales. Friday's opening gap remains unfilled, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. “A long bull on the daily time frame chart and a similar candle on the weekly chart indicate strength in the upward move. The weekly momentum oscillator is signalling strengthening of the upside momentum in the Nifty50,” the expert said.


US jobs dataUnited States non farm payrolls data for July will be unveiled on Friday. The country added another 213,000 jobs in June, although the unemployment rate rose to 4 per cent, according to a report by CNBC. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected a nonfarm payrolls gain of 195,000 and the jobless rate to hold steady at 3.8 per cent, which had been tied for the lowest since 1969, the report added."

Tech view: Nifty forms small bullish candleWhile the index formed higher highs and higher lows for the seventh consecutive session, in the process, it entered the overbought zone as suggested by the 14-day relative strength index. Analysts had mixed views by the end of the day; some said Nifty is heading towards the 11,500 in a week’s time, whole others said the time is ripe to take some profit off the table. 


Volume drop hints at lack of interestBull markets typically top out when both commitment and valuations turn decisively frothy.

12,2018-08-02,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Extending losses for a second consecutive session, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty plunged on Thursday, a day after the Reserve Bank of India raised repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent on fears of rising inflation.

Sustained capital outflows in the wake of weakness in global stocks, triggered by renewed trade war worries between the US and China, roiled domestic market. 

An uptick in US bond yields and strengthening dollar, bolstered by the Federal Reserve's positive assessment of the US economy, fuelled foreign capital outflow.

Global stocks reflected the sombre mood. Major Asian markets declined up to 2 per cent, pressed by the worries of a trade war.


Let's take a look at the key reasons that hit market sentiment today:

RBI's rate hike
Investors sentiment affected by the hike in the key lending rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI on Wednesday hiked its key lending rate by 25 basis points to bring the repo to 6.50 per cent citing upside risks to inflation. As a result, heavy selling in interest-sensitive counters includes auto and banking dragged benchmark equity indices on Thursday.


Concerns over GST revenueMarket participants also remained cautious with a report stating that the goods and services tax (GST) collection rose in July but stayed well below the government's target of Rs 1 lakh crore for the third month in succession of the current financial year (starting April 1). 


Precarious macroeconomic indicatorsThe mood of the markets also remained impacted with RBI Governor Urjit Patel flagging the risks to macroeconomic stability from a potential currency war in the wake of rising global trade tensions.


US Fed moveUS stocks closed mostly lower in the previous trading session after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged but signalled another imminent rate increase. Fresh worries over US-China trade friction too dampened sentiment. Asian equity markets also settled lower with Shanghai, Hang Seng and Nikkei plunged up to 2.30 per cent.


Technical reasonNifty on Wednesday formed a 'Spinning Top' candle on the daily chart suggests that the pace of buying is slowing. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities after the previous trading session said that the index needs to hold above 11,300 for any upside towards the 11,400- 11,435 zone."

China is building a very 21st century empire—one where trade and debt lead the way, not armadas and boots on the ground. If President Xi Jinping’s ambitions become a reality, Beijing will cement its position at the center of a new world economic order spanning more than half the globe. Already, China has extended its influence far beyond that of the Tang Dynasty’s golden age more than a millennium ago.

The most tangible manifestation of Xi’s designs is the new Silk Road he first proposed in 2013. The enterprise morphed into the “Belt and Road” initiative, a mix of foreign policy, economic strategy, and charm offensive that, nurtured by a torrent of Chinese money, is rebalancing global political and economic alliances.

Xi calls the grand initiative “a road for peace.” Other world powers such as Japan and the U.S. remain skeptical about its stated aims and even more worried about unspoken ones, especially those hinting at military expansion. To assess the reality of Belt and Road from the ground up, Bloomberg Markets deployed a team of reporters to five cities on three continents at the forefront of China’s grand plan.

What emerges is a picture of mostly poor nations—laggards during the past half-century of global growth—that jumped at the promise of Chinese-financed projects they hoped would help them catch up. And yet as some high-profile ones falter and the cost of their Chinese funding rises, would-be beneficiaries from Hambantota, Sri Lanka, to Piraeus, Greece, are questioning the long-term price. In Malaysia, one of the biggest recipients of Chinese investment in Southeast Asia, newly installed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is pushing back. Expressing concerns about loan conditions and the use of Chinese labor that limit benefits to the local economy, he’s put billions of dollars of Chinese-­funded rail and pipeline projects on hold.

Xi intends a century-long enterprise. China has already outspent the post-World War II U.S. Marshall Plan, measured in today’s dollars. Within a decade, according to Morgan Stanley estimates, China and its local partners will spend as much as $1.3 trillion on railways, roads, ports, and power grids. “Economic clout is diplomacy by other means,” says Nadège Rolland, Washington-based senior fellow for political and security affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research. “It’s not for today. It’s for mid-21st century China.”

Belt and Road is very much about politics at home, too. With the government and state-owned enterprises investing vast sums outside China, Xi is encouraging Chinese companies to channel their spending into domestic projects that will directly benefit the economy and, incidentally, the popularity of his regime.

Businesses aren’t exactly defying Xi, but they’ve adjusted their plans to fit his. With the Belt and Road project enshrined in the Communist Party’s constitution as of last year, Chinese companies are using it to help them navigate Xi’s restrictions on foreign investment and capital outflows. Many are sheltering their overseas projects under the umbrella of Xi’s pet project to get the state’s blessing. Belt and Road, says Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Rabobank Group in Hong Kong, is “a political special sauce. ... If you drizzle it on anything, it tastes better.”

At first, the sauce whetted the appetites of many developing countries in Asia and Africa. As the notion of a modern Silk Road gained traction, Belt and Road meandered into places that had never had any connection with ancient caravans. This year it reached South America, the Caribbean, and even the Arctic. In June it rocketed into space: Beijing announced that Belt and Road-participating countries will be among the first in line to plug into China’s new satellite-navigation services.

Most of the proposed plans are infrastructure-based, such as a new deep-sea port in Myanmar and power lines in the ­Maldives. But almost any overseas investment gets tagged as being part of the initiative: a freight train carrying Chinese sunflower seeds to Tehran, a new courthouse in Papua New Guinea, an irrigation system in the Philippines.

“Economic clout is diplomacy by other means. It’s not for today. It’s for mid-21st century China”

The growing web of trade routes, including the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road Initiative, now extends into at least 76 countries, mostly developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, together with a handful of countries on the eastern edge of Europe. With most global trade moving by sea, it’s no surprise that many of the first places to lock up major Chinese investments were ports along with pipelines and other transport links that connect shipping to markets.

China’s plans to build or rebuild dozens of seaports, especially around the Indian Ocean, have sounded alarm bells in Washington and New Delhi: How many of those docks will end up hosting Chinese warships? Just as mighty navies and global networks of military bases helped support trading empires for Britain in the 19th century and the U.S. in the 20th century, so China is building a fleet of submarines, aircraft carriers, and warships that will rival U.S. power.

China has said it has no intention of using Belt and Road to exert undue political or military influence and that the initiative is designed only to enhance economic and cultural understanding between nations. “In pursuing the Belt and Road initiative,” Xi said in 2015, “we should focus on the fundamental issue of development, release the growth potential of various countries, and achieve economic integration.”

If that’s the case, Xi will need to change the perceptions of people who live along the length and breadth of his latter-day Silk Road. And that can only happen in the towns and cities that are being transformed by China’s empire of money. 

Yiwu, China
Nestled in the mountains of Zhejiang province, Yiwu is the embodiment of “Made in China.” The market here is unlike any other. A vast complex of five-story buildings houses 75,000 booths selling 1.8 million kinds of goods across an expanse the size of 650 soccer fields. If you’ve picked up cheap jewelry and toys in District 1, you may need to hop onto a motorcycle taxi to reach auto parts in District 5. Most of those thousands upon thousands of stalls specialize in single items—scissors, for example: scores and scores of different kinds of scissors.

An ancient market town about 180 miles southwest of Shanghai that’s grown into a city of 1.2 million people, Yiwu got a big boost from Belt and Road. People from Beirut to Seoul and beyond have come to start businesses. Some 13,000 traders from around the world now live here. More are arriving every day, says Mohanad Ali Moh’d Shalabi, a Jordanian businessman who owns the Beyti Turkish restaurant in the center of the city and a company that exports goods to the Middle East. “In my restaurant,” he says, “I have met people from countries I have never known of.”

It wasn’t always like this. When Bloomberg reporters visited in early 2014, business was so slow that bored shopkeepers played computer games, read newspapers, or slumped over in their chairs, asleep.

Janey Zhang, whose Zhejiang Xingbao Umbrella Co. employs about 200 workers, remembers the bad old days. In 2013 the vast, labyrinthine halls of Yiwu—a legacy of 1978, when it became one of Communist China’s first wholesale markets—were almost deserted. Wholesalers and producers struggled with soaring manufacturing costs and the rise of online marketplaces such as Alibaba.

Then came a glimmer of hope. On social media and television, Zhang started seeing reports about a new freight train that would roll west for thousands of miles, crossing China into Central Asia and on into Europe. This was part of the Xi government’s “New Eurasian Land Bridge,” a seemingly endless skein of stacked container wagons replicating ancient Silk Road camel caravans. “The impact of the railway was huge,” Zhang says. “I remember seeing pictures of it piled high with cargo. After the service started, our sales and customers quickly increased.”

The first Europe-bound train pulled out of here in November 2014, heading to Kazakhstan and Russia, then through Eastern Europe and on to Madrid—an 8,000-mile journey that supplanted the Trans-Siberian Railway as the world’s longest freight-train route. Since then, more routes have opened to destinations including London, Amsterdam, and Tehran.

Zhang’s dream is for her Real Star brand to become the Hermès of umbrellas. Europe has long been her biggest market. Since the new freight trains came to Yiwu, she’s picked up customers all along the route, from Kazakhstan to Russia to Iran.

Trains have cut the time to Europe by a third or more compared with ships. The return journeys bring European goods such as wine, olive oil, vitamin pills, and whiskey. China Railway Express Co. said the value of outbound freight from Yiwu in the first four months of 2018 jumped 79 percent from a year earlier, to 1.8 billion yuan ($268 million), while imports tripled to 470 million yuan.

Even so, rail freight accounts for less than 1 percent of China’s overall exports. While it can shorten journey times to Europe, it’s more expensive than seaborne trade and slower and less flexible than air cargo. But for cities such as Yiwu, and especially for those in western China even farther away from seaports, the train that Xi built has injected new life into their economies. 


Hambantota, Sri Lanka
In a southern Sri Lankan jungle, Dharmasena Hettiarchchi plucks green chile peppers that grow in the shade of banana trees. His grandfather tended the same patch of land when this island was the British colony of Ceylon. Hettiarchchi takes a break from the heat under a teak tree, removes his wide-brimmed hat, and says, “If a jeep with Chinese characters comes down the road, the whole village will gather in protest.”

Hettiarchchi’s village and the surrounding town of ­Hambantota have become a cautionary tale for Xi’s Belt and Road aspirations. The idea was to take an inconsequential harbor visited by fewer than one ship a month on average and turn it into a modern, bustling seaport adorning a southern Belt and Road maritime route. It hasn’t turned out so well.

After Sri Lanka elected Hambantota native Mahinda Rajapaksa as president in 2005, he began sprinkling development projects across the region, one of the least-developed parts of this nation of 21 million people. Even long before Belt and Road was officially embedded in Chinese government policy, Beijing was eager to lend a hand, and Chinese loans financed Rajapaksa’s munificence. Hambantota (population at the time 11,200) got a new port, an international conference center, a cricket stadium, and an airport that, despite all the staff on show, doesn’t service a single scheduled flight.

To fund the projects here and others all across Sri Lanka, the Rajapaksa government fell deep into debt. The port at Hambantota, for example, was partly funded during the Rajapaksa administration by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. By the time Rajapaksa was voted out of office in 2015, more than 90 percent of Sri Lanka’s government revenue was going toward servicing debt.

Last year, with Xi’s Belt and Road plan in full flow, a new Sri Lankan government moved to ease the debt. In return for $1.1 billion, it basically handed the seaport over to China. Under a 99-year lease agreement, the government gave 70 percent ownership of the port to China Merchants Group, a state-owned company with revenue bigger than Sri Lanka’s economy.

China Merchants has promised to revive the port and turn it into a major regional trading hub. But some local people have had enough of promises. “All these huge projects are a waste,” says Sisira Kumara Wahalathanthri, a local politician who opposes the current Sri Lanka government. “No ships are coming to the port. No flights are coming to the airport.”

After 30 years of civil war, many Sri Lankans are glad to see investment, any investment. At the port and in a surrounding industrial zone, construction work continues, presaging change. Displaced from their normal habitats, wild elephants regularly trample the port’s perimeter fence. At a nearby ancient Buddhist temple, head monk Beragama Wimala Buddhi Thero says he began attending protests because the area’s way of life is under threat. While his temple will be spared, the nearby farms won’t, leaving him and his fellow saffron-robed monks without worshipers.

“It’s becoming a Chinese colony,” he says of Hambantota. In a darkened hall, reclining on a wooden throne decorated with elaborately carved lions and flowers, he complains that China has already despoiled its own rivers in the name of progress. “If that kind of pollution comes here,” he says, “it doesn’t matter if we’re developed.”

The chile farmer Hettiarchchi is wary of the surveyors who’ve begun to appear in his neighborhood, making measurements and leaving their telltale markers behind. He says the plan is for him to be relocated to a part of eastern Sri Lanka to make way for development. It’s all happening so fast, and what ­Hettiarchchi could be losing can’t be replaced easily or quickly. Gesturing to the towering teak above him, the 52-year-old says, “A tree like this cannot grow within my lifetime.""


Gwadar, Pakistan
Surrounded by desert in southwest Pakistan there’s a stone arch bearing a single name, Al-Noor. Farther along a desolate road, a black shipping container has been painted to tell you where you are: Gwadar Creek Arena.

Al-Noor and Gwadar Creek are planned housing ­developments—emphasis on “planned.” There’s nothing here yet. The same goes for White Pearl City, Canadian City, Sun Silver City, and other residential tracts on the drawing boards. What you see are billboards, lots of them, as speculators and developers carve out future projects on the sun-blasted outskirts of an old fishing village named Gwadar.

Gwadar is a city of dreams made in China. Beijing is pouring money into highways and roads, a hospital, a coal-fired power plant, a new airport, a special economic zone along the lines of Shenzhen, and, crucially, the port. The chain of events that led to Chinese involvement here fits a pattern repeated up and down Belt and Road routes: Local or national efforts to expand a port stumble; China comes in and saves the day.

In the case of Gwadar, a redevelopment project begun in the 2000s under then-military ruler Pervez Musharraf foundered. In 2013 the Chinese arrived. A deep-water port here would be a natural southern terminus for a key binational project started that year, the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, as well as an important component of Belt and Road. To that end, Beijing is financing the lion’s share of the $1 billion in spending on the port and infrastructure development elsewhere in Gwadar.

Gwadar, across the Arabian Sea from Oman, is so remote that its electricity comes from Iran, 60 miles down the coast. In recent years, the village has become a city of 100,000 or so. Although still mostly a gigantic building site flanked by highways and crisscrossed by roads, signs of change abound.

Ghulam Hussain, 40, is a shopkeeper. Every month, he gets six to eight truckloads of rice, flour, sugar, and other groceries delivered to him from Karachi, an eight-hour drive to the east. Five years ago, three loads a month met his needs. “There was nothing in Gwadar before,” he says. “It was deserted. We were really backward. Since the Chinese came, our businesses are booming.”

Even so, it’s hard to imagine Gwadar as the sea terminus of a road-and-rail trade link stretching 3,000 miles to eastern China. Most of the route would traverse some of the world’s most ­inhospitable—and economically barren—mountains and deserts.

A rail line, says Andrew Small, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington-­based public-policy think tank, “makes no economic sense in the foreseeable future. The economy of Pakistan and the economy of western China would need to look quite different.”

Some say that military expansion is the real driver of the activity in and around Gwadar. “The Gwadar Port shows that there is a close link to the Chinese military ambitions,” U.S. ­Congressman Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) said during Foreign Affairs Committee hearings on U.S.-Pakistan relations in February.

Zahid Ali, who used to run a small business topping up credit on mobile phones in Sindh province in eastern Pakistan, sees things very differently. Desperate to find a way to pay off 800,000 rupees ($6,300) in debts, he asked a client if there was any job in Pakistan that paid 50,000 rupees a month. Go to Gwadar, the customer replied.

That’s what Ali did. He started as a laborer, learned steel work, and was soon earning Rs 55,000 a month. Now, having learned a little Chinese, he’s been promoted to supervisor. “We’re getting good money, so people are coming from far away,” he says during his work shift on the six-lane East Bay Expressway. “It’s good that the Chinese came here. A lot of people have gotten jobs who were jobless.”

The Chinese who came here to work don’t mix much with the locals. Some of the 150 or so of them live in a guarded and gated compound where green shipping containers have been converted into living spaces.

One of the first things a visitor to Gwadar notes is that there are more soldiers on the streets than police—an added precaution against the threat of terrorism across Pakistan. Security is tight because Chinese wouldn’t come otherwise, says a Pakistani army officer who declined to be named because he’s not authorized to talk to the news media. He says there are checkpoints on all the roads leading into the city.

Good, says Naseem Ahmed, 25, who works for the provincial government. “Security is great here,” he says as he warms up before taking part in a soccer game at a local stadium. “You can be out at 
3 a.m. in the morning, and there is no fear.” 

Mombasa, Kenya
Astride his boda boda, or motorcycle taxi, at a crossroads in Mombasa, Simon Agina is counting containers on a passing train that’s heading to Nairobi: “… 82, 83, 84.”

There are plenty of freight containers back where those came from—and much more besides. The port of Mombasa, Kenya’s import lifeline, is a heaving mass of traffic of all sorts. Trucks line up quayside to move shipping containers from the docks to the railway. Three-wheeled tuk-tuks weave dangerously between other vehicles through hot, dusty streets filled with noise and litter.

Kenya’s largest port is also its oldest. So in 2011, with the ancient British colonial-era Mombasa-to-Nairobi narrow-gauge railway falling into disrepair and Beijing in the market for African investments, Kenya made its move. It agreed to let China finance and build a standard-gauge railway at a cost of $3.8 billion. The Mombasa-Nairobi SGR, as it’s called, is the nation’s largest infrastructure project since independence from Britain in 1963.

Atanas Maina, managing director of Kenya Railways, says more than 30,000 Kenyans were employed directly on the project, which was run by China Road and Bridge Corp.; an additional 8,000 worked for subcontractors.

The first paying passengers rode the line in June last year. Along its 293-mile journey, the SGR rumbles across almost 100 bridges and viaducts, many designed to allow the lions, zebras, and other wildlife that inhabit two national parks, Tsavo East and Tsavo West, to cross under the tracks.

Freight trains like the one Agina saw from his boda boda began running in January. “Those are 84 trucks off the road,” he says as the containers whiz by. The railway cuts the ­Mombasa-Nairobi trip to five hours, down from more than eight by truck. Five freight trains a day were making the journey during spring. The number could eventually increase to 12, removing as many as 1,700 of the 3,000 trucks that currently ply the route.

Like any major infrastructure project, the rail line has its detractors. The economist and government critic David Ndii says it’s not commercially viable, while a Kenyan newspaper, the Standard, accused China Road and Bridge of “neo-colonialism, racism and blatant discrimination” in its treatment of local employees; Kenya Railways subsequently said it would investigate the allegations.

Environmental activists tried without success to block the SGR from going through Tsavo parkland and have taken legal action to try to stop the next phase of railway construction, which would run the line through Nairobi National Park on the edge of the capital.

Trucking companies, whose business grew steadily as the old railway decayed, are now worried about the loss of customers. Vanessa Evans, managing director of Rongai Workshop & Transport Ltd., says the SGR could have been a plus for the Kenyan economy in the long run, but poor coordination at the Mombasa and Nairobi rail terminals causes cargo backups and delays. The new rail line, she says, “has nearly destroyed our business because the turnaround time varies between not good and awful. We have been in agony for the past five months.”

The train that pulls out of Nairobi Railway Station each morning at 
8 o’clock, with noteworthy punctuality, is called the Madaraka Express. In Swahili, “madaraka” means power or responsibility; Madaraka Day, a national holiday, celebrates self-rule. If the old railway was a relic of Kenya’s British colonial past, the new one, built with Beijing’s money, could be seen as a harbinger of a new kind of imperial reach.

It’s a blue-suited Chinese instructor who makes sure the female train attendants—uniformed in the colors of the Kenyan flag—are standing in a nice straight line as passengers board. China financed 90 percent of the SGR’s $3.8 billion cost. And the giant Chinese Communications Construction Co. will operate the rail line for its first decade.

The area around the station thrums with activity as construction pushes ahead on houses, container yards, and warehouses. Along the route to Mombasa, gleaming steel-and-glass stations stand out against clusters of tiny houses with rusty corrugated iron roofs and mud walls; the contrast encourages the locals “to dream big,” says Maina.

Michael Ndungu, 21, a student who studies in Mombasa and visits the capital on weekends, used to take the bus. “The SGR has made my life much better,” he says. “It is faster and definitely safer.” In Mombasa the surge in passengers—1.3 million during the first six months of the year—has been good for the economy. “Business is good,” says Stephen Kazungu, a 26-year-old taxi driver.

The newly laid track, the trains, the stations—“You don’t see that kind of infrastructure development in this part of the country,” says Agina, the 22-year-old boda boda driver, as the freight train fades into the distance. “This is amazing.” —Samuel Gebre


Piraeus, Greece
It was the spring of 2016. Greece was in the vise-grip of the European sovereign debt crisis. Its neighbors and creditors were pressuring the government to enforce austerity. So Greece sold control of Piraeus, the storied seaport once connected to Athens by fortified walls, to China Cosco Shipping Corp., a Chinese state-owned enterprise.

The deal bears many of the hallmarks of China’s biggest Belt and Road projects. It began years before Xi’s signature project was announced—in 2009, Cosco won a contract to run part of Piraeus’s container business—and was then handily folded into the initiative; it was geared largely toward enhancing the reach of China’s mari­time trade; and it involved a host nation desperate for investment.

But unlike many of China’s high-priced Belt and Road investments, this isn’t a remote greenfield construction project in a developing nation. The port deal marked China’s gradual takeover of one of Europe’s oldest and most important sea gateways. Piraeus has been Athens’s port and shipyard for about 2,500 years, a perch on the Mediterranean that helped Athens become a naval superpower.


From his office, Ioannis Kordatos, managing director of the Hellenic Welding Association, can see the wall of containers stacked high at Pier II, Cosco’s original beachhead here. “If Cosco magically disappeared 
tomorrow, it would be a huge loss,” says Kordatos. “What matters isn’t that they are Chinese but that they are a private company doing serious business in the area.”

Very serious business. The 2016 deal gave Cosco a 67 percent share of Piraeus Port Authority SA for €368.5 million ($429.5 million). During PPA’s first full year under Chinese control, its net income jumped 69 percent, to €11.3 million, as revenue from its container terminal rose 53 percent. Since Cosco first became involved, Piraeus has risen to be Europe’s seventh-busiest container port; 10 years ago, it wasn’t in Europe’s top 15.

Piraeus is a bustling city in its own right. Marinas here are filled with Athenians’ yachts ready for weekend sailing. Passenger ferries dock near the town center to carry locals and tourists to Aegean islands. Farther west, in the repair yards, workers mend boats. Above all, giant gantry cranes loom over shipping containers.

These days, whether you arrive here by sea, by metro, or by road, you’re bound to run into construction, with chunks of the city boarded up as bulldozers work on a new subway station and public transportation connections.

In the heart of Piraeus, Cosco plans to upgrade the ferry and cruise ship terminals, adding a shopping mall and new hotels. Farther out, around the Gulf of Elefsina, Cosco’s investments could help revive Greece’s rust-belt industrial heartland in the Thriasio Plain west of Athens. There, a planned logistics center, linked to the port by rail, could become a staging area for goods headed north through the Balkans.

Not everybody in Piraeus shares Kordatos’s warm feeling toward Cosco’s purchase of PPA. “If I had the money, I’d buy it myself rather than let it go to foreigners,” says Evlampia Kavvatha, who owns a store selling shelving in the town center.

Perhaps Cosco’s presence here is a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Like the rest of the country, Piraeus has been hit by a depression that’s wiped out a quarter of the nation’s economic output since the sovereign debt crisis. Away from the main shopping district street, Piraeus suffers from the blight of empty storefronts that afflicts cities across Greece.

Giorgos Gogos, general secretary of the Piraeus Dockworkers Union, says he’s worried about the impact of a Chinese state-owned enterprise on labor relations and the local community. “We think it’s a mistake for infrastructure like this to leave the state,” he says. “The Chinese have their own way of operating. [Cosco is] a state colossus backed by capital of the Chinese state. It has the characteristic of Chinese state capitalism.”

For all the concern about the potentially corrosive effects on Greece’s economy and sovereignty—and about Beijing’s ulterior motives—Cosco’s incursion into Piraeus has something in common with other investments by Beijing along the vast and meandering Belt and Road: China put its money where others wouldn’t.

16,2018-08-05,PowerGrid,"Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has cancelled a recent 2,000 megawatt wind power tender, which was undersubscribed, owing to lack of sufficient transmission infrastructure, officials aware of development said.

“We have decided to cancel the tender since the response was not good,” a senior government official told ET. “The bid was undersubscribed by 800 MW, so we couldn’t have gone ahead with it.” SECI managing director Jatindra Nath Swain did not comment.

Four developers — Renew Power, Adani Green Energy, Sprng Energy and Alfanar Energy — had submitted technical bids for a capacity of 300 MW each at the auction last month. SECI had tendered the interstate transmission-connected 2,000 MW capacity under Tranche-V in May.

Renewable energy developers have, for long been complaining about lack of power evacuation infrastructure at their disposal. Key renewable locations like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu face huge transmission constraints and developers are not getting connectivity despite completing their projects.


The official quoted above, however, said that in a recent meeting with Power Grid Corporation, transmission issues related to the previous wind tenders have been resolved.

“The transmission issues have largely been sorted out during subsequent meetings with PGCIL. We now have the Tranche-VI wind tender for 2,500 MW capacity, and we will go ahead with that,” the official said.

The tender did not reach the price bid stage, as tariffs would have been uncompetitive and on the higher side.

“If the tender has not been fully subscribed, there is no point holding the price bids because developers can quote whatever tariff they want and there is no competition. Eventually it would be cancelled,” another official said on the condition of anonymity.

Industry experts said constraints on transmission capacity are proving to be key risk across all renewable technologies. “In case of wind power, given its local manufacturing ecosystem, a steady order flow is needed,” said Kameswara Rao, leader—energy and utilities at PwC India. “As we saw last year, tariffs went down when bids were few, and now due to a bunching of bids, tariffs have risen,” he said.

“The government has to set a formal timetable and procuring agencies will need to coordinate better to ensure a proper balance is achieved,” Rao said."

The market rally is likely to sustain going forward with some of the laggards, such as ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and select public-sector banks, showing signs of recovery. According to technical analysts, the Nifty is expected to touch 11,500 this week itself, and several pharma and PSU stocks look attractive for investment.


Where are We? The chances of the Nifty moving higher towards 11,600 or 12,000 are possible, and the index going below 10,910 indicates caution. Nifty’s 200DMA of 10,567 and 50DMA of 10880 are also important levels to watch out for in case a correction comes. The market is in an unchartered territory, and now quality beaten-down stocks would see a good rally. So far, the market has rallied because of select heavyweight large caps, and if this rally has to sustain, the other sectors and stocks should play a catch-up game. Else, the overall market might see a fall.


What is in Store? Previously, our focus had been on IT and private sector banks. Now, the attention has shifted to pharma and PSU stocks, which look very attractive.
In pharma, we like Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Sun Pharma, Cadila and Torrent Pharma, and in the PSU space, we like BEL, Power Grid, NBCC, REC, PFC, Petronet, NMDC and MOIL. These stocks offer good value at the current levels and look very good on long-term charts.


What could Investors Do? An investor can ideally deploy 20-30% of his cash at the moment because valuations are very expensive and the US market has rallied from 2009 till date. In case the global market corrects, India will not be spared, but our long-term growth is still intact."

The index has continued with its unabated rally, but off late the range has been getting narrower.

Thursday’s trade also saw the Nifty trading in a narrow 25-point range throughout the session. The volumes too have been either lower-than-average or heavily stock-specific in nature.

The upcoming session is likely to see a subdued start to the trade. In event of any uptick that may be seen in the initial trade, there are probabilities of the Nifty facing retracement from higher levels.

Friday may continue to see the levels of 11,495 and 11,530 acting as immediate resistance area. Supports may come in lower at 11,410 and 11,330 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 74.4825 and it continued to trade in the overbought territory. Apart from a black body that emerged on the candles, no major formations were seen.

Pattern analysis showed that the Nifty continued with its upmove post breaking above the 11,170-11,175 zones. At present, it trades overbought and stares at some imminent consolidation from the higher levels.

Overall, despite the buoyant structure and the unabated upmoves, if we speak of immediate short-term horizon, some retracement from higher levels is overdue.

Given the overbought nature on the charts, Nifty is staring at imminent retracement from the higher levels with each upmove. It is also important to note that though downsides, if any, may not be much, but volatility tend to increase during such corrective bouts that result into broader consolidation.

We recommend staying away from aggressive purchases and refrain from chasing the momentum blindly.

We recommend taking the market very cautiously and continue to maintain highly stock-specific approach for the day.

28,2018-08-10,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: After two straight sessions of record highs, equity benchmark Sensex retreated on Friday owing to profit-booking in recent gainers, including Reliance Industries, State Bank of India and ICICI Bank amid weak global cues.

It was Nifty's first fall after five straight sessions. 

The domestic market experienced the heat of weakness in global stocks, following a new round of US sanctions on Russia. Plunging Turkish lira too weighed on European markets as most of them fell more than 1 per cent on Friday.

However, Chinese stocks showed some resilience. As per media reports, gains in technology stocks made Chinese market post its best week in a month. 

Sensex took a beating of 155 points, or 0.41 per cent, settling at 37,869, whereas Nifty fell for 41 points, or 0.36 per cent, to close the day at 11,430.

In the Nifty index, 19 stocks remained in the green, compared with 31 in the red, while Sensex saw 12 stocks advancing and 19 declining.

For the week, the Sensex rose by 0.83 per cent and the NSE counterpart Nifty inched up by 0.60 per cent. 

State Bank of India, Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank contributed the most to Sensex losses.

Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, ITC and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the top five gainers in the Sensex index.

State Bank of India, Sun Pharma, Vedanta, Tata Motors and Power Grid Corporation stood as the top five Sensex losers. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices underperformed Sensex on Friday, falling 0.80 per cent and 0.78 per cent, respectively.

Gail (India) declined 3.40 per cent even as the oil and gas major on Friday reported 22.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in standalone profit at Rs 1,259.25 crore for June quarter, in line with Rs 1,262 crore PAT projected by analysts in an ETNow poll. 

Shares of Hindalco Industries also suffered losses of 2.22 per cent, despite the company on Friday posted 42.84 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit at Rs 413.53 crore for the quarter ended June 30. It had posted a net profit of Rs 289.51 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday reported a standalone net loss of Rs 4,875.85 crore for June quarter, which fell way short of Rs 242 crore profit projected by analysts in an ETNow poll. This was the third straight quarter of losses for the largest domestic lender in terms of assets. The stocks settled 3.79 per cent down on BSE.

Jet Airways (India) Jet Airways tanked 8.39 per cent after the airline deferred the consideration of unaudited financial results for the first quarter of the current financial year 2018-19.

26,2018-08-10,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Indian benchmark indices extended their record-breaking run with Sensex breaching the 38,000-mark on Thursday for the first time as investors shrugged off concerns over the impact of escalating trade dispute between the US and China on the global economy. Bank shares such as ICICI, Axis and SBI led gains on expectation that the bad loan cycle has peaked.

The Sensex ended up 136.81 points, or 0.4%, at 38,024.37 after hitting an all-time high of 38,076.23 during the day. The Nifty ended up 20.7 points, or 0.2%, at 11,470.70, after scaling a record high of 11,495.20 in Thursday’s session.

The indices have hit record highs in 15 out of the last 21 sessions. The 1,000-point rally from 37,000-level to 38,000-level took just 10 sessions, and it is among the fastest 1,000-point journeys for the 30-stock index. The Nifty fell just shy of breaching the 11,500-mark.



Sensex and Nifty have managed to notch up only modest gains on most of the last three weeks. The average gain for the Sensex was 0.28% in the last 10 trading days. ICICI Bank surged the most in six months after the lender said it has made full disclosures about its bad loans in its annual report, investor presentations and analysts’ calls. The stock gained 4.6% to Rs 332.95. Axis Bank gained 3.8% and SBI rose 2.5% on Thursday. 

The Nifty Bank index hit record high, ending up 0.9% to 28320. Among other gainers on the index, Vedanta, Power Grid Corporation of India and NTPC advanced 1.4-3.9%. Analysts said investors are shifting to stocks that have not rallied so far. “Earlier the rally was led by expensive stocks such as private retail banks, consumer staple and IT stocks, which became even more expensive on valuations. Now, we are starting to see other banks, which have shown positive trends in terms of their numbers such as NPLs (non performing loans) and provisions and likely RoA (return on assets) trajectory, starting to rally,” said Sanjeev Prasad, Co-Head, Kotak Institutional Equities.


Best performing Asian marketPrasad said these banking stocks were undervalued and there is increased expectation that the NPL cycle is finally getting over in terms of recognition and resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code process. This has led to investors taking a positive call on some of the corporate lenders with high NPLs, said Prasad.

Foreign portfolio investors net bought shares worth Rs 370.68 crore on Thursday while domestic institutional investors net sold shares worth Rs 85.39 crore, provisional data showed.

FPIs have been net sellers in only one out of the six trading sessions so far in August, and are net buyers of Rs 869 crore worth of shares during the period. DIIs are net sellers so far in August, of Rs 971.95 crore.

The BSE MidCap index rose 0.6% to 16,340.88 and SmallCap index gained 0.3% to 16,916.85. The Sensex had hit its 2018 low of 32,483.84 on March 23 while Nifty’s low of 9,951.90 was also on the same day. From those levels, the markets have overcome various concerns such as weakening macro-economic scenario, political uncertainty and US-China tariff war primarily on the back of gains in select heavyweights such as HDFC Bank, TCS.

The Sensex and Nifty have gained 11.6% and 8.9%, respectively, so far in calendar year 2018, holding its place as the best performing Asian market this year. It also holds the place of an expensive market with valuations at 18.39 times on a one-year forward earnings basis compared to MSCI Emerging Market Index’s 12.15 times."

The launch was initially planned for Saturday morning.Over the next two months, Parker Solar Probe will fly towards Venus, performing its first Venus gravity assist in early October -- a manoeuvre a bit like a handbrake turn -- that whips the spacecraft around the planet, using Venus's gravity to trim the spacecraft's orbit tighter around the Sun.""This mission truly marks the humanity's first visit to a star that will have implications not just here on Earth, but how we better understand our universe,"" Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. This first flyby will place Parker Solar Probe in position in early November to fly as close as 15 million miles from the Sun -- within the blazing solar atmosphere, known as the corona -- closer than anything made by humanity has ever gone before.Throughout its seven-year mission, Parker Solar Probe will make six more Venus flybys and 24 total passes by the Sun, journeying steadily closer to the Sun until it makes its closest approach at 3.8 million miles.Parker Solar Probe will set its sights on the corona to solve long-standing, foundational mysteries of Sun, the US-based space agency said.The probe is named after Eugene Parker, a solar physicist, who in 1958 first predicted the existence of the solar wind, a stream of charged particles and magnetic fields that flow continuously from the sun.--IANSvc/tsb/sed"
30,2018-08-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government is considering awarding about 25 small and mid-sized power transmission contracts aggregating to about Rs 1,200 crore to state-run Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), a move that has upset private sector transmission companies.

National Committee on Transmission has recommended that the execution of these projects should be through regulated tariff mode (RTM), a government official said.

“Contracts for only some upgradations are proposed to be handed over to PGCIL,” the official said. “The larger ones are being identified for auctions.”

About two large transmission projects worth about Rs 800 crore have been proposed for tariff-based bidding, officials said.

The development comes at a time when allegation of bias toward state-run companies have been levelled against the government by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Private companies allege that government is favouring PGCIL at the expense of cost and time overruns even as rules provide for mandatory auction of such contracts.

“Knowing that the competitive bid route yields great cost and time savings, adopting cost plus route and giving it on nomination basis is irrational and against consumer interest,” said Ashok Khurana, director general at Association of Power Producers.

The official quoted earlier, however, said upgradation of existing sub stations cannot be put to bidding at times because individually these contracts are either too small to be auctioned or critical in nature that they need to be implemented on an urgent basis. 

Though collectively the value contracts of the contracts is large at around Rs 1,200 crore, individually these are of smaller amounts, the person said.

The Reserve Bank has alleged that stress in the power sector has been caused by state-run utilities being favoured at the expense of private ones, as ET reported on Monday.

RBI has referred to the draft national tariff policy circulated by the government for public consultation as per which new power projects of central PSUs such as NTPC and PGCIL may not have to compete with private companies.

The Electricity Act mandates awarding power generation and transmission contracts only through auctions, but the central government has the right to exempt strategically important contracts and projects with stringent timelines. The official said augmentation of projects which involves modification of existing substations in other transmission providers’ bay face challenges in coordination.

Private power companies argued that the proposal goes against the spirit of national tariff policy and the Electricity Act.

Power transmission projects awarded under competitive bidding have lower costs, tariffs and better implementation records, they said.

“Most of the tariff-based bidding contracts require coordination with other transmission service providers for expansion of sub stations and this is a non-issue,” an official with a private power firm said.

In an interview to ET in June, PGCIL chairman I S Jha had rubbished allegations of monopolistic practices levelled against the state-run company by its competitors.

He denied charges that the company purposefully mismanages transmission planning to get projects under nomination basis and said the company has been delivering transmission projects in time or ahead of schedule."
31,2018-08-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Mirroring recovery in Asian markets after Monday's rout, the domestic equities opened on a positive note on Tuesday. 

At 09:20 am, the S&P BSE Sensex was trading 151 points or 0.40 per cent higher at 37,796, with Tata Steel (up over 2 per cent) being the best gainer and Power Grid Corporation (down nearly 1 per cent) the worst laggard.

The broader Nifty50 pack of National Stock Exchange (NSE) was trading 41.20 points or 0.36 per cent higher at 11,397. 37 out of 50 components were trading in the green while 11 in the red and 1 remained unchanged.

Structurally, the index has completed an Impulse on the upside at the recent high of 11,495 and has entered the correction mode. Nevertheless, the correction being a fourth wave is likely to be a shallow one and can turn out to be a sideways consolidation, says Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

""So let the index sail through this consolidation phase and prepare itself for the next leg of the rally. Till then the positional traders are recommended to hold their horses and wait for the next opportunity to surface to take a fresh entry on the long side for a target of 11,640,"" Ratnaparkhi added. 

Among specific stocks, shares of Tata Steel rose 3 per cent in opening deals after the steel giant on Monday reported 112.76 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,954.02 crore for June quarter. However, it fell short of Street's expectations. Analysts in an ETNow poll had projected a profit of Rs 2,725 crore. At 09:31 am, the stock was trading 1.42 per cent higher at Rs 577.30 apiece on BSE. 

Sun Pharma was trading flat at Rs 561.70 apiece on BSE, down 0.19 per cent ahead of its June quarter results due later in the day. 

In the sectoral landscape, shares of PSU bank stocks advanced the most. At 09:36 am, the Nifty PSU Bank index was trading 37 points higher at 3,183, with 11 out of 12 constituents trading in the green and 1 in the red.

32,2018-08-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: When shares of HDFC Asset Management Company listed at a 58 per cent premium to its issue price on Monday, it joined the league of nearly four dozen companies that delivered in excess of 50 per cent listing gains in last 12 years since 2006. 

But there is a catch! Such stellar listings have almost always been followed by a prolonged slump. 

Only a half of such debutants (with big gains) held above their listing prices even for one week, forget one month or three months. And nearly two-thirds of such stocks traded below listing prices six months post listing, data compiled from PRIME Database showed. 

History shows investors with short-term horizons have always failed to make money on such issues. 

Even in the case of HDFC AMC, analysts had raised red flags before listing, even when they were bullish on business prospects. 

“The market is ignoring valuations. It is very hard to justify the kind of pricing that they are willing to pay for HDFC AMC. I would not be very surprised, if you find the stock much cheaper a year down the line,” Anand Tandon, an independent analyst, told ETNow. 

On Thursday, the HDFC AMC stock traded 1.6 per cent down from its listing price at Rs 1,710. 

Tandon said the AMC business itself is very attractive. “AMC per se is an excellent business to be in, but at some stage, you have to look at valuation. If you like the HDFC Group so much, there is a case to be made for buying either the life insurance business, which has similar characteristics, but a much more sticky set of clients, and where valuations are perhaps cheaper than the AMC at this stage,” Tandon said. 

Of the 45 listed firms that saw over 50 per cent listing gains in last 12 years, 22 traded below listing prices within a week, 25 slipped below listing price after a month, 24 after three months, and 28 after six months, data available with PRIME Database showed. 

As per IPO norms, the anchor investor portion in an issue gets locked in for 30 days from the date of allotment. 

Investors who want to invest freshly in the HDFC AMC stock should wait for two or three weeks for the price to rationalise, said Payal Pandya of Centrum Broking. Pandya said investors should buy the stock in a staggered manner over the long term. 

Among the stocks that failed to hold on to listing gains in first week were Lokesh Machines, Meghmani Organics and Reliance Petroleum (this Mukesh Ambani company was later merged with Reliance Industries). 

On the other hand, Allied Computers International, Everonn Systems, Power Grid, ICRA, Religare Enterprises, Mundra Port, and Burnpur Cement, among others, climbed further in the first week after stellar listing gains. 

Stocks with strong listings tend to lose steam after six months of their debuts. 

Apollo Micro Systems which listed at Rs 478 was trading at Rs 129 after six months, which was below even the issue price of Rs 275. 

Shares of Edelweiss Capital, Mundra Port, Zylog Systems and Sobha also traded below listing prices in six months. However, Avenue Supermarts, Dixon Technologies and Info Edge continued to amaze investors. 

Short-term trends for most mega listings became muted after sometime, but if fundamentals are strong, stocks do offer solid returns in the long run. 

HDFC AMC is India’s most profitable asset management company. Managing Director Milind Barve told ET Now that his AMC had spent a significant amount of strategic effort on managing cost in a manner that the operating profit margin is maintained. 

“Maintaining strong, high operating profit margin and building on the retail franchise are our secrets. 

We continue to build on the high margin, high quality equity business and, most importantly, manage the costs. The high profits and higher return on equity are consequences of that,” he said. 

Brokerage Nomura India last week initiated a bullish view on India’s asset management companies (AMCs), given the strong growth opportunity and improving operational metrics, which it believes are more structural and less cyclical. 

“We expect a 20 per cent CAGR in AUMs over FY18-25 with improving equity mix, as the sector is one of the key beneficiaries of the rising financial savings mix, while penetration levels are still extremely low. In our view, operating leverage and improving equity mix should take care of yield pressures, while strong AUM growth should help improvement in profitability,” it said."
38,2018-08-17,PowerGrid,"Most domestic corporates, barring a few, can withstand the ongoing rupee plunge as the share of their dollar-linked earnings largely balance the share of their greenback-denominated debt, says a report.

The rupee fell beyond Rs 70 to the dollar, closing at an all-time low yesterday at 70.15, while today the market was closed. So far, the rupee has lost close to 9 per cent, making it one of the worst performers among the large currencies.

""A weaker and more volatile rupee would likely result in increased hedging costs for companies, while the same may benefit exporters,"" an S&P report said today.

""Most corporates can withstand the rupee plunge as the share of their dollar-linked earnings largely balance the share of their greenback-denominated debt. A few of them will be negatively affected, but not severe enough to impact their credit ratings,"" S&P said.

The report further said it expects the credit profile of rated infrastructure companies to be largely protected from the current bout of rupee depreciation.

While regulated utilities (like NTPC, Power Grid, and NHPC) enjoy cost pass-through for currency depreciation or hedging costs, unregulated power companies are protected due to hedged forex bonds. But Delhi airport and Hyderabad airport will benefit from forex earnings as well as hedging.

""We thus believe the impact on infrastructure sector will be limited"", the agency said.

In other cases, such as for Tata Motors, the share of foreign currency in debt is broadly comparable to the share of foreign currency in earnings.

""We believe the debt-laden telecom sector could face further stress due to limited foreign-exchange earnings combined with foreign currency debt. Bharti Airtel's share of forex earnings is only 20 per cent, whereas its share of forex-denominated debt is about 50 per cent,"" it said. A sustained depreciation of the rupee could thereby negatively affect its leverage.

The report also noted that Reliance Industries can also see rising leverage as 75 per cent of its debt is dollar-denominated, while 85 per cent of its earnings are in dollars. However, at the same time it entire cash balance is denominated in the rupee.

""Thus a depreciation in the value of those cash balances feeds through to leverage calculations,"" the report warned.

Oil companies like IOC, BPCL and HPCL will see a big boost to their profit since they will be able to sell crude on dollar benchmark-linked prices. Similar will be the case of software exporters like TCS, Infosys and Wipro."

39,2018-08-18,PowerGrid,"Having failed to attract private players in a big way to undertake skilling in India under PM Narendra Modi’s flagship Skill India Mission, government is rapidly roping in its own public sector enterprises to take on targeted skilling in the country.

The latest PSU to join the bandwagon is the NALCO, which will put in Rs 50 crore towards skill development and entrepreneurship till 2020. So far the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) has received financial commitments of Rs 163 crore for training more than one lakh beneficiaries including 40,000 aspirants with recognition of prior lending.

The other PSUs who have come forward to rescue the government include the Powergrid, Coal India Limited, NTPC, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), Hindustan Copper Limited, Mineral Exploration Corporation (MECL), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Airports Authority of India, Department of Public Enterprises, Indian Oil, Bharat Electronics Limited, NHPC, Nuclear Power (NPCIL) and Nalco Foundation among others. 

A senior government official told ET that government is committed towards skilling. ""We are trying to do our bit to provide skill training to as many as possible through our PSUs even if private players are taking time to come on board in big numbers,"" the official said. 

According to the official, active participation of PSUs in the skilling mission willl encourage industry to come on board and collectively work with the government to make it successful. 

NTPC has recently committed to train 30,000 youth in five years. Under NTPC Projects, so far trainings has already been completed for around 14,500 beneficiaries.

Among the private players SBI Card has taken the lead commiting a contribution of Rs 2.28 crores for training 1000 candidates in the Delhi-NCR region in key roles in healthcare, retail, telecom and BFSI sectors.

Other private players who have marginally contributed to this initiative as part of the corporate social responsibility include Alstom Bharat Forge Power, L&T, Posco, Powerlinks, Hitachi India Limited, Avery Dennison India, GE Grid Equipment, GE T&D India and GE India Business Services among others. 

The National Skill Development Mission was launched in 2015 with the objective to provide overall institutional framework to rapidly implement and scale up the skill development efforts across India.

The ministry of skill development & entrepreneurship, through the National Skill Development Corporation, has taken up multiple initiatives to connect with industries for partnership under the larger Skill India Mission.

NSDC has been working with diverse set of stakeholders such as corporates, foundations, government and community based organisations in structuring high impact collaborative skill development projects.

Under this NSDC allows its industry partners to contribute to the skilling mission in several ways including sponsoring physical assets, directly contribute to the NSDC, set up corporate excellence centres, set up trade specific or multi-skill centres, collaborate with sector skill councils and undertake creation of industry relevant curriculum.

Besides, NSDC, along with its sector skill councils and approved training partners, also facilitates placement opportunities to eligible aspirants, who have successfully completed the entire training module on job roles, pegged at NSQF levels."
40,2018-08-22,PowerGrid,"Institutional investors, which hold nearly 60per cent of PTC India, the country’s largest power trading company, have questioned its management over allegations related to misuse of funds and window-dressing of accounts. Fund managers that ET spoke to said on the condition of anonymity that they have asked the management not to allocate any more funds to non-core businesses. Also, there is a demand to liquidate existing non-core operations at the earliest.

“We are disappointed with the performance of the management. We recently met them to understand how they would utilise the cash generated from the core business and asked them not to divert into unrelated businesses,” said a fund manager who holds a chunk of PTC India shares.

“The investment decisions made by the management have been value destructive. Instead they should have returned that money to shareholders as dividends. This would have generated more value for the investors,” said another institutional investor that is invested in the company for over four years. “Despite such strong core business, its share has not gone anywhere in the last four years.” he added Over the years, the company has invested several hundreds of crores rupees in other businesses such as lending and investing in the power companies only to write off a significant portion or wait for the assets to become non-performing (NPAs).

PTC has entered into lending and investing in power sector assets and companies through its NBFC subsidiaries: PTC India Financial Services (PFS) and PTC Energy (PE). After investing Rupee310 crore in FY17 in PFS, its gross NPAs have shot up by 43per cent to Rupee838 crore. This is 35per cent of PFS’ networth. The investment was made at Rupee39 per share and PFS’ current share price is Rupee16.5 amounting to a mark-tomarket loss of Rupee170 crore.

PTC also invested Rupee515 crore in PE in FY17. Since it is an unlisted company, the details of this investment will be disclosed only once the annual report for FY18 is published. PTC has also directly invested nearly Rupee500 crore in several power projects, which it has gradually started writing off (See table).

Few months ago, stock exchanges had sent a notice to PTC asking for clarification about the aforementioned allegations. The company’s official told ET, “We have adequately replied to them(stock exchanges) for the concerns raised.”

In July, the company’s board of directors recommended the reappointment of Deepak Amitabh as the chairman and managing director for a term of four years until October 2022. This was over and above the one year extension which he got in October 2017.

In an email reply to ET’s queries, the company spokesperson said, “As in any business, these businesses are subject to systemic risks that exist in the environment. Both PTC and PTC India Financial Services are listed entities and their financial and operational performance are subject to disclosure of the highest quality. “ He added that both PTC and PFS, have a consistent track record of dividend payments, with a steady growth trend in payouts. However, according to Bloomberg, the payout has continuously declined to 21per cent in FY17 from 28per cent in FY13.

The concerns are reflected in the company’s stock performance as well. The stock has lost 23per cent over the past year while the benchmark index S&P BSE Sensex has gained 21per cent. In addition, the stock trades at low price-book (P/B) multiple of 0.5 due to concerns that the incremental profits may be misused once again. Its price-earnings multiple (P/E) is at six times FY18 earnings. This is very low despite the double-digit volume growth in the core trading business and the company’s debt free profile. It had nearly Rupee800 crore cash in FY18.

The government owns 16per cent of PTC India through four companies including NTPC, Power Grid Corporation, NHPC and PFC while most of the remaining stake is held by institutional and retail investors. Some of the large domestic institutional investors include LIC, Aditya Birla Sun Life Fund, Reliance Capital and IDFC Fund. There are also several foreign institutional investors."
41,2018-08-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Change is the only constant in stock market and index composition is no exception.

Many heavyweight stocks of yesteryears have since lost their say on the Indian benchmark indices, even as others have come to acquire clout and become titans in Dalal Street’s new power equation.

Take for instance, ONGC, a Nifty heavyweight from 2004 to 2006 with 12-13 per cent weightage. Today, its index ranking is 24 and the energy firm commands just 1 per cent weightage in the index.

HDFC Bank, which was not even among the top 10 Nifty50 stocks a decade ago, enjoys the highest weightage today at 9.5 per cent.

This broadly reflects the changing contours of the Indian economy, which financials have surpassed every other segment, growing at breakneck speed. Since 2002, when HDFC Bank had a mere 1.8 per cent weightage in Nifty50, the stock has compounded annually at 28 per cent backed by strong earnings.

A change in the methodology used to compute Nifty50 weightage to free-float basis in 2009 has also brought about a complete overhaul in the index composition, brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a report.






Baahubalis today
The more weight a stock holds in the index, the more clout it carries in swinging the index. This is best reflected in Nifty’s recent spurt to 11,500 level, which has been fuelled by only a handful of index heavyweights. That is the main reason behind the disparity in market behaviour, wherein the Nifty has risen some 9 per cent year-to-date against a 7 per cent drop in the Nifty Midcap index. 

“Nifty, in particular, has been running up because of a select few stocks. Outside of it, the market has actually seen a good beating down in the recent months,” Nitasha Shankar of Yes Securities told ETNow.

At present, HDFC Bank (9.5 per cent), Reliance Industries (9.4 per cent), HDFC (6.8 per cent) and Infosys (6 per cent) alone account for nearly one-third of Nifty50 weightage. All these stocks have outperformed the 50-pack this calendar.

Shares of RIL have risen 36 per cent this year, while Infosys has risen 33 per cent and HDFC Bank and HDFC 12 per cent each.


Baahubalis yesterday
Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which was the second biggest Nifty heavyweight in 2002, has slipped to 10th rank in clout with just 2.8 per cent weightage. This stock has delivered 16 per cent return CAGR during this period, which has been in line with Nifty50 return during the same period. Wipro was the third biggest Nifty heavyweight in 2002. It is on the 41st slot now.

Reliance Industries has remained in the top 10 club within Nifty50 for last 16 years, though even it has often witnessed swings in clout. The stock's weightage in the index has declined from 12.3 per cent in December 2002 to 12.7 per cent in 2009, 5.2 per cent in 2014 and 9.4 per cent this August.

There are 46 stocks outside Nifty with market capitalisations higher than the lowest market-cap Nifty stock. They belong to emerging sectors such as insurance. The weight of the financial sector has seen a secular rise in the benchmark indices over the years, said the Motilal Oswal study.

Private financials now hold 34.3 per cent weightage (grown 5 times in 16 years) in the Nifty50. ""It can expand even further, given that the index doesn’t have any representation of the insurance sector yet. Technology’s weightage (13.7 per cent) is reviving after slipping to a five-year-low of 11.4 per cent in 2017,” the brokerage noted.

Interestingly, 13 stocks that got listed since 2003 have since become part of the Nifty50, replacing older members. They include Maruti (listed in July 2003), TCS (August 2004),UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), Yes Bank (July 2005), TechM (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infra (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013).

The insurance behemoth held 197.50 crore shares of ITC, valued at Rs 61,770 crore, at the end of June 2018. The stock is up 19 per cent for this calendar against a 12 per cent rise in the Nifty50 index. It underperformed the NSE barometer in calendar years 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Analysts are currently bullish on the stock. “ITC is going to be a pedigree stock. I have a Rs 350 target for the yearend. And I can stick my neck out to say ITC will be Rs 450, because 63 per cent of the cigarette volume is no longer the brand show. Also, ITC is now all about paper, hotels, FMCG and ITC Haryali. Other businesses are doing extremely well. Valuations are extremely attractive,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL told ETNow.

51,2018-08-26,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Last week, a truncated one, saw domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty rise for the fifth consecutive week, despite headwinds in the form of weak global cues, trade war worries, a falling rupee and firming crude oil prices.

Falling for the first time in five sessions, the indices took a breather on Friday, as profit booking happened at record high levels.

For the week, Sensex and Nifty rose by 0.80 per cent and 0.75 per cent, respectively. The market’s rise was gradual, devoid of any significant upside move. 

The Sensex scaled a record high of 38,487 on Thursday even as the Nifty50 marked its all-time high of 11,620.

The coming week is going to be volatile, as August series futures and options contracts expire on Thursday.


Let's take a look at the key events and developments that may influence market behaviour through the week:


Macro indicators
The government will June quarter GDP data on Friday and some analysts have projected it to come at around 7.6 per cent. For the quarter ended March 31 2018, the GDP growth print stood at 7.7 per cent. July fiscal deficit data will be out on Friday, when the infrastructure output data for July will also be released. Since the infra sector accounts for roughly 27 per cent of country's industrial output, a higher reading will be considered positive for the health of the rupee. RBI’s forex reserve data is also due on Friday, which may influence the course of rupee movement.


F&O rollover
The August series futures and options will expire on Thursday and rollover of positions will dominate proceedings through the week, leading to some volatility in the market. ""Muted rollover activity was seen in Nifty futures with Open Interest rising 0.20 per cent on Friday even as Nifty fell 0.2 per cent. On the other hand, short buildup was seen in Bank Nifty futures, where Open interest rose 2 per cent even as Bank Nifty itself fell 0.7 per cent,"" said a report by HDFC Securities. ""Nifty open interest put-call ratio fell sharply to 1.63 from 1.73. Among the options, Call writing was seen in the 11,600-11,650 zone,"" the report added.


Global cues
Last Friday, US President Donald Trump tweeted that China was ""not helping"" on denuclearisation of North Korea due to the trade dispute, inviting flak from Beijing, which termed the statement ""irresponsible"". Other than the ongoing trade war worries, investors will also watch how the politics shape up for Trump following myriad allegations. Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen told a federal judge he made illegal campaign contributions at the president's request to silence women alleging affairs with Trump. The US President also had double trouble after his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of tax and bank-related frauds, putting his presidency under threat.


Technical readings
On Friday, Nifty negated the formation of higher highs and higher lows of last four sessions and formed a small-bodied indecisive candle on the daily scale, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. He noted that the index still maintains its overall bullish bias on the weekly scale.

""The index has been trading in a rising channel with the support of its rising trend line. It has to hold above 11,550 to witness an upward move towards 11,635. On the downside, the immediate major support is seen in the 11,500-11,450 range,"" Taparia said.

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities said the small positive candle on the weekly time frame had an upper shadow, which signalled a choppy trend. “The short-term trend remains choppy, and a minor downward correction is likely next week,"" he said.


Last leg of earnings
Some companies are yet to come out with their June quarter earnings. Prominent among them is Jet Airways. The stock tanked 8.37 per cent to Rs 275.90 this week ahead of the company's board meeting next week, where it will consider cost-reduction initiatives and a turnaround plan along with June quarter results. On August 9, the airline's board of directors had deferred Q1 earnings announcement.

69,2018-08-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty scaled new highs of 38,736 and 11,700, respectively, on Monday on healthy gains in most sectors, led by bank, energy, IT and FMCG. 

Sustained capital flow, strength in the rupee against the US dollar, easing global crude prices and firm global cues gave a legup to the benchmark indices, which have seen record closing for nine times this month. 

Globally, markets rose to their highest levels in more than two weeks on Monday, as reassuring comments from the US Fed chief, easing trade war jitters and the Chinese central bank’s bid to stabilise the yuan lifted risk appetite, Reuters reported.

On Monday, the 30-share Sensex closed at fresh record high of 38,694, with a gain of 442 points or 1.16 per cent, while NSE’s Nifty50 jumped 135 points, or 1.17 per cent, to settle at a new peak of 11,691. It took 37 sessions for Nifty to climb to 11,700 mark from 10,700.

Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices trailed Sensex by small margins, finishing with gains of 1.07 per cent and 0.70 per cent, respectively. 

We walk you through key highlights of the day’s session: 


Who moved my Sensex
Most sectors contributed to the stocks rally, led by banks, energy and IT stocks. Among the heavyweights, Infosys contributed the most, followed by ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, State Bank of India (SBI) and ITC, in that order. These five stocks together contributed 232.59 points to the Sensex rally.

Volatile rupee 
The rupee appreciated by 20 paise to 69.71 against the US dollar on increased selling of the US currency by exporters amid a higher opening of the domestic equity market. Currency traders said weakness in the dollar against major global currencies overseas after comments from the US Fed Chairman in support of a gradual approach to raising rates supported the rupee. However, rupee fluctuated between gains and losses during the day and around 4 pm, it was trading above the 70-mark. 


Airtel’s strategic pact with Netflix
Shares of the company settled nearly 4 per cent higher at Rs 383 after reports that it had broadened its strategic pact with Netflix to offer a three-month gift subscription of the US internet entertainment company’s video streaming services to select postpaid and V-Fiber home broadband users. This is seen as a clear bid to differentiate its video content and retain premium data customers even as Reliance Jio Infocomm revs up to commercially launch its fast wired broadband services bundled with internet TV.


Sun Pharma sole Sensex loser
Sun Pharma stood as the lone loser in the Sensex index on Monday after reports of an inspection by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) at its Halol facility in Gujarat. The site produces multiple dosage forms – from tablets to ointments to injectables – and was cleared by the US drug regulator in June, almost three years after a comprehensive remediation process was initiated. Shares of the company settled 1.25 per cent down at 621.80. 


Global stocks bullish
World stocks rose on Monday on an ebb in trade war worries and after US Fed chairman Jerome Powell's positive outlook on economy at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. Powell had defended the strategy of gradual rate hikes to protect economic growth and control inflation. 


52-week highs & lows

58,2018-08-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks have been on an upward trajectory for five consecutive weeks now, despite less favourable global cues and a depreciating rupee.

During the week gone by, Sensex and Nifty rose 0.80 per cent and 0.75 per cent, respectively, with five of the 10 most valued companies – RIL, TCS, HUL, HDFC and Maruti – adding Rs 65,564 crore to their combined market capitalisation. On Thursday, Sensex scaled a record high of 38,487, while Nifty50 marked its all-time high of 11,620. 

This week is likely to be a volatile one, as August series futures and options contracts expire on Thursday. Moreover, there are some key macro data lined up for release during the week, including GDP numbers for June quarter, fiscal deficit data and infrastructure output data for July. All these factors will sway market this week.

However, analysts see stock-specific opportunities in pockets of the market. Based on their recommendations, here are 12 stock ideas that can potentially deliver healthy gains over the next 11-21 sessions. 


Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

BHEL | Buy | Target price: Rs 90 | Stop loss: Rs 74 
This stock has almost formed a higher bottom on the daily chart, taking support at the significant 50 DMA, which lies at around 72. The stock has been maintaining a positive bias. The RSI has also been on the rise, with the chart looking attractive. “We anticipate a decent rise from here on for the stock to scale Rs 88-90 levels in the coming days. With good volume participation, we recommend a buy rating on this stock,” Parekh said.


Cadila Healthcare| Buy| Target price: Rs 440| Stop loss: Rs 380 
This stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart at around Rs 332 level and has seen a decent bounce. It has moved past the previous peak of Rs 385, which is also the 200 DMA, thus signifying a positive bias. “We expect the stock to rise in the coming days. With RSI on the rise and good consistent volume participation, we recommend a buy rating on this stock,” Parekh said.


Gajendra Prabu, Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities

India Cements | Buy | Target price: Rs 134 | Stop loss: Rs 114
The stock has validated the Hammer Candle pattern formed on the weekly chart in the previous week (moved above the candle’s high), which is the confirmation of a bullish reversal. The price is in a larger upward retracement leg from the low of Rs 97, in which two legs were completed and third rising leg is on the cards. Apart from this, it has formed higher top and higher bottom in smaller degree, which is a bullish Dow signal. More upside is expected in the coming days. In addition, the price is well above the key moving averages of 21 and 50-day EMA; and this could add strength to the bulls.


Tata Chemicals| Buy| Target price: Rs 800| Stop loss: Rs 690
The stock price has validated an Engulfing Bull pattern on the weekly chart in the previous week, which confirms a bullish signal. The price pattern has completed a major three-wave decline from Rs 782 to Rs 648 with an irregular “Wave B”. In that move, the stock has formed a double bottom around Rs 648. Interestingly, that is the zone for change of polarity. Now, the stock is in a rising leg from the low of Rs 648, which could head towards a new lifetime high. In addition, the price is placed well above the important 21-day, 50-day and 200-day EMAs, and this could add further strength to the bulls. 


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA

Hindalco Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 250| Stop loss: Rs 200
This stock peaked in the last quarter of 2017 in the Rs 280-284 range and after forming a minor double top, it was in a sideways trajectory. The stock has been consolidating in a broad range after having stalled its upward move. It has been forming a good base in the Rs 195-210 zone. Currently, it rests at its 100-WMA after pulling back from those support levels. The RSI is neutral against the price, showing no divergence, but it is marking higher bottom and moving out of a pattern. The weekly MACD has shown a positive crossover and is now trading above its signal line, indicating a bullish signal. The prices have pulled back after forming a reversal candle near its pattern support. Some upward move in prices cannot be ruled out. “We expect the stock to test its upper range of the channel. Any move below Rs 200 will be negative for the stock,” Vaishnav said.


TVS Motor Company| Buy| Target price: Rs 620| Stop loss: Rs 520
This stock has exhibited strong signs of an end to the corrective move and signalled a potential trend reversal. After peaking out near Rs 795, the stock has witnessed a corrective move over the past few months, while making subsequent lower tops. It is also showing signs that point towards a likely trend reversal. While the stock saw a sharp corrective decline, On-Balance Volume or OBV did not fall. The bottom is forming in the Rs 530-550 zone, and the recent pullback from the immediate lows has been accompanied with higher volumes. A fresh buy signal has emerged over Stochastic on the weekly charts with a bullish divergence against the price. An upward price revision cannot be ruled out over the coming days. Any move below Rs 520 will be negative for the stock.


Jay Anand Thakkar, CMT, assistant vice president- equity research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

Pidilite Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,210| Stop loss: Rs 1,120

Pidilite has seen a breakout from the downtrend line resistance and is moving in an upward sloping parallel channel. Momentum indicator MACD is in buy mode, both on the daily as well as weekly charts. The stock seems to have completed a Wave IV correction and wave V up seems to have started. “Hence, we recommend buying this stock,” said Thakkar.


Axis Bank| Buy| Target price: Rs 664| Stop loss: Rs 620
Axis Bank has seen a breakout form the symmetrical triangular pattern on the monthly charts with a buy crossover in momentum indicator on the monthly chart, which is an absolutely bullish indication for the medium term. With this, the stock seems to have completed a Wave IV correction and Wave V up has started.


Lupin| Buy| Target price: Rs 945| Stop loss: Rs 864
Lupin has formed an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the daily charts, and seems to have completed the right shoulder of the same. The stock has again started forming higher tops and bottoms, which is positive in the short to medium term. It is likely to test the neckline of the Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the upside from here on. “Hence, we recommend buying this stock,” the analyst said.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

PowerGrid | Buy| Target price: Rs 207| Stop loss: Rs 184
After a multi-month correction from the high of Rs 226 registered in August 2017, this counter appears to have formed a durable bottom around Rs 174 last July. The subsequent rally from the low of Rs 174 to a recent high of Rs 194 also retraced 38.2 per cent, thereby creating a short-term bottom of Rs 184. If the trend has changed for good, then it should scale much higher levels in due course. Hence positional traders should buy this stock for an initial target of Rs 207 with a stop loss below Rs 184 on a closing basis.


Cummins India| Buy| Target price: Rs 798| Stop loss: Rs 735 
After a multi-quarter underperformance from the high of Rs 1,247 registered in August 2015, this counter appears to have hit a bottom last month at a low of Rs 613, as it tested the lower boundary of the two-year-old downsloping channel. Subsequent price action with sharp rallies suggests the counter is back on the radar of the bulls. Traders are advised to make use of the current correction to create fresh longs at current prices and add further on declines around Rs 740 for a projected price target of Rs 798. Stop loss is suggested for the trade below Rs 735 on a closing basis.


BHEL| Buy| Target price: Rs 97| Stop loss: Rs 75
This counter has registered a strong technical breakout on massive volumes above its 100-day moving average from where all the pullback rallies got sold off on multiple occasions in the past. Hence, sustaining above Rs 77 level can potentiality lift the stock to its logical target of Rs 99. Positional traders are advised to buy this stock for a target of Rs 97 with a stop loss below Rs 75 on a closing basis."
57,2018-08-27,PowerGrid,"Stock benchmarks Sensex and Nifty showed full of promise on Monday as they kicked off the week in style. 

The 30-share Sensex rallied over 442 points to 38,694.11 while the 50-share Nifty jumped 135 points to 11,691.95.

Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, we gathered five factors that are seen to have fuelled the current bout of rally.


Firm global cues: Asian peers extended their advance, taking cues from record highs on Wall Street. The dollar remained under pressure after the head of the Federal Reserve suggested that it would not speed up its pace of raising interest rates. Jerome Powell said the US economy was healthy and prices showed no signs of rising more than the bank's 2 percent target, adding that there appeared to be no risk of overheating.


FTSE push: India's weightage in FTSE Emerging Markets is set to rise to 12.21 per cent from 12.16 per cent, ET Now has reported. According to ET Now, L&T Infotech, Bajaj Holdings and Bandhan Bank have been added to the index. ICICI Prudential life and Petronet LNG have also been added to the index.


Sustained inflows: Foreign portfolio investors poured over Rs 2,000 crore in August so far. Their net investment stood at Rs 2,263.92 crore in July against net outflows of Rs 4,831 crore and Rs 10,060 crore in June and May, respectively. Domestic institutional investors invested over Rs 5,000 crore in equities so far this month. Their net investment stood over Rs 70,000 crore on year-to-date basis.


Positive outlook: Global credit ratings, research, and risk analysis firm Moody's Investors Service expects the Indian economy to grow by around 7.5 per cent in 2018 and 2019. However, the company expects the country's economy to grow at a higher rate of 7.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2018. “We expect the Indian economy to grow around 7.5 per cent in 2018 and 2019,"" Moody's Investors Service said in its Global Macro Outlook: 2018-19 (August 2018 Update) report.

Niti Aayog former vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has said rupee depreciation was long overdue, saying the appreciated currency had hurt the country's exports. Panagariya further said India's macroeconomic management is sound and there was no reason to worry.

The rupee on August 16 slumped to a life-time low of 70.32 against the dollar on strong demand for the greenback. Panagariya said he expects India's growth rate to cross the 8 per cent mark by third or fourth quarters of 2018-19.


All-round buying: Barring Wipro (down 0.09 per cent), other components of the BSE Sensex were in the green. Power Grid rallied 3 per cent, followed by YES Bank (2.14 per cent), State Bank of India (up 1.70 per cent), Bharti Airtel (up 1.40 per cent), ICICI Bank (up 1.39 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (1.37 per cent).

53,2018-08-27,PowerGrid,"What is the current status of the Kudankulam project? What is progress for Units 3 to 6 ? 

The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) is one of the largest nuclear power station in India. It is scheduled to have six VVER-1000 reactors with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW each. The Unit 1 of the plant was synchronised with the southern power grid in October 2013 and is generating electricity. The second Unit with capacity 1,000 MW had become critical for the first time in July 2016. It was connected to the grid in August 2016 and it started commercial operation in October 2016.

The construction of Units 3 and 4 are underway. The ‘first pour of concrete’ for Unit 3 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, which marks the beginning of the construction of the project, happened on June 29, 2017. The Units 3 and 4 Reactor buildings foundation slabs have already been made. The construction is on schedule. 

The delivery of equipment has already started. In March 2018 the first batch of equipment for turbine building of Unit 3 of Kudankulam NPP was completed and shipped out. Particularly, the first two high pressure heaters (HPH) were dispatched for turbine building of KKNPP. Also the reactor pressure vessel for KNPP Unit 3 will be delivered by the end of the current year followed by KNPP Unit 4 that will be completed next year. 

Last year, during the 18th annual India-Russia summit held in St Petersburg, both countries signed the general framework agreement for the construction of Units 5 and 6 of KKNPP and an inter-governmental credit protocol necessary for the implementation of the project was also signed. Currently intensive ground and infrastructural work is underway for Unit 5 and 6.


How is heavy equipment for KNPP transported from Russia to India?

Each shipment of heavy and/or oversized cargo is a unique technological operation. Russian experts have studied a number of different options for delivering such equipment to the site. Nowadays, the cargo is shipped to the port of Thoothukudi, and then delivered to the site by roads.At the same time, NPCIL is developing port infrastructure near the site of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The facility is likely to be commissioned this year. 


What are the enhanced safety features of KNPP?

VVER reactors are considered to be among the safest in the world, this technology is the base of the Russia’s nuclear power development program and contributes to the export growth. Over the 50 years of their operation the NPPs with VVER reactors (VVER-440, VVER-1000) have proven their reliability, stability and competitiveness in the international energy market, ensuring stable growth of the nuclear industry. The experience of successfully operating NPPs with VVER-type reactors has already exceeded 1,400 accident-free reactor-years.

The Russian nuclear power plant projects use light water reactors of the VVER type (water-cooled water-moderated shell-type reactors with pressurized water). At present, VVER nuclear power plants are under various stages of construction in Iran, Belarus, Hungary, Bangladesh and other countries. This type of reactors uses water both as a neutron moderator and as a reactor coolant.

On India’s request, additional safety measures are being put in place in Units 3 and 4 to withstand even higher seismic, climatic and technical impact. All power units are equipped with the modern diagnostics systems, which prevent the anticipated operational occurrences before they start. The main feature of the Indian project is a unique combination of active and passive safety systems that provide maximum resilience against external and internal impacts, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and even an aircraft crash. Therefore, we can firmly state that presently India possesses the safest NPP in the world.

Passive safety systems are able to function even under conditions of complete power failure ensuring complete safety even without the contribution of the active safety systems or (human) operational intervention. For example, the Passive Heat Removal System (PHRS) provides long-term heat removal from the reactor core in case of all the power sources’ shutdown. A molten core catcher (MCC) or a “melt trap” is designed to keep the molten core material inside and cool it down in case of a hypothetical accident that could lead to the core damage. A core catcher ensures the integrity of the containment vessel, preventing radioactive leaks into the environment, even in case of a hypothetical severe accident.

The huge attention has been focused towards preservation of biological diversity around KNPP and save local flora and fauna of the Mannar Bay. NPP cooling sea water intake structures are equipped with the special fish protecting facilities, which preserve not only fish but also fish food plankton. Sea water is supplied from the so called “bucket” constructed in the sea into the special facilities and systems which ensures that fish and plankton return to sea.


Rosatom’s fuel company TVEL has announced that it has now the new fuel TVS-2M for VVER-1000 reactors, which will be installed at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. What is the difference between the old fuel and a new one?
TVS-2M gives an opportunity to shift the nuclear power plant from operation in 12 months to 18 months fuel cycle. Right now, the fuel campaign consists of three cycles, each lasting for twelve months. After introduction of TVS-2M, we will have three cycles lasting for 18 months, so instead of three years, the fuel campaign will last for 4.5 years (54 months instead of 36 months). 

Secondly, TVS-2M fuel bundles have more advanced thermal-mechanical behavior during the whole fuel life. This fuel model is more robust, it has a higher stiffness. So during the exploitation in the reactor core a fuel bundle does not bow and preserves its initial shape. Thus, we have made the reactor operation more safe and reliable.


How many more units is ROSATOM planning to build in India?

The Strategic Vision adopted in December 2014 for strengthening cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy between Russia and India stipulates that at least 12 units of Russian design are to be commissioned in India within the next 20 years. As far as we know, the Indian government is actively searching for sites to build new power plants. In 2015, India declared its intent to allot a new site for the construction of power plant of Russian design with enhanced-capacity units. We are awaiting the new site to be officially presented by the Indian side to the Russian side and further signing of the contracts. Now we are holding talks on the design of the new nuclear power plant units as well as preparing the proposal regarding the localization of the equipment.


Are there any plans for to work together with India on other markets?
Besides the KNPP, we are working together with India for the construction of the first nuclear power plant in Bangladesh at Rooppur. This year in March the trilateral agreement was signed by India, Russia and Bangladesh. The document establishes the basis for the interaction of the Russian contractor ASE Group of Companies with Indian and Bangladeshi specialists in the implementation of the project. In particular, the parties plan to cooperate in personnel training, experience sharing and consulting support. Under the agreement, Indian companies will participate in construction and installation work, supply of non-critical materials and equipment for the project.

Bangladesh also signed two intergovernmental and inter-agency agreements with India, according to which India’s Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership (GCNEP) will provide training and consulting services for the implementation of the Rooppur NPP project.

India will join the project as a subcontractor. Indian construction companies will take part in tenders for construction and installation works. At the same time, the Indian party can provide consulting support and share experience with the Bangladesh specialists within the Rooppur NPP project.


Are there any other areas for cooperation between India and Russia in the field of peaceful nuclear energy?

The last few years have been fruitful in terms of identifying new areas for cooperation between Indian companies and ROSATOM's enterprise. We have also achieved success in developing and producing composite materials. The Umatex Group, another subsidiary of Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation, signed an agreement with Indian companies on localizing the production of carbon fabric in India. This will allow us to cut costs and export joint Indo-Russian products. The development and production of mass-market products made of composite materials is stipulated as well, including helmets and high-pressure containers. 

Furthermore, we are closely working on integrated security systems intended for organization of alarm security subsystems, monitoring of access control subsystems, monitoring of CCTV subsystems, performance of warning function. NIKIRET (branch of Production Company “Start” named after M.V.Protsenko”, a subsidiary of Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation) and CORE Energy Systems Pvt. Ltd. signed a cooperation agreement to promote technical security equipment (TSE) in India."

71,2018-08-28,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Benchmark indices posted record closing highs on Monday, ending up over 1per cent on strong cues from Asian markets after the US Federal Reserve affirmed the central bank’s gradual rate hike policy.

The NSE Nifty crossed 11,700 for the first time, setting a new lifetime high of 11,700.95 during Monday’s session. The index ended a shade below that milestone, up 134.85 points, or 1.2per cent, from the previous close at 11,691.95. The gain was its biggest rise in nearly two months. The Sensex posted its biggest single-day gain since May 31, and ended up 442.31 points, or 1.2per cent, at 38,694.11 after touching a record high of 38,736.88 in Monday’s session.

The local volatility index, India VIX, ended down 1.4per cent at 12.24.

The Sensex has hit record highs 23 times out of the 31 sessions since July 12, when it had hit a record high after a gap of over six months. Even as the rupee hit record lows, the indices have managed to maintain their supremacy as the best performing Asian market this year on the back of gains in select index heavyweights, easing oil prices and better-than-expected corporate earnings in the quarter ended June.

The advance-decline ratio was in favour of the bulls, as 1,432 stocks gained on the BSE compared to 1,294 stocks ending lower than their previous close.

Asian stocks gained following a fresh all-time high in US markets on Friday as the Federal Reserve reaffirmed a slow and gradual pace of policy tightening.

“It is a narrow rally led by a handful of stocks. Some corporate banks are joining the rally. The rally needs to broaden more for the gains to sustain,” said Pramod Gubbi, head of equities at Ambit Capital.

It is difficult to justify more gains in the stocks that have already rallied as valuations there have reached the top-end, said Gubbi.

Stability in foreign flows is also keeping the market afloat even as the Indian rupee continues to hover around 70 per dollar mark. Foreign Portfolio Investors net bought Indian shares amounting to Rupee252.52 crore on Monday, provisional data showed. Domestic institutional investors were also net buyers. They picked up Indian stocks worth Rupee1,117.24 crore on Monday, the data showed.

70,2018-08-28,PowerGrid,"Fuelled by global positive macro-economic inputs and further aided by strong global market cues, the Indian market saw a very stable and determined upward move on Monday and it went on to close at yet another new lifetime high. After seeing a positive start, the market strengthened further and saw a stable rally throughout the session.

The benchmark Nifty ended the day gaining 134 points, or 1.17 per cent.

As we approach Tuesday’s session, there is every chance that we will continue to see the market open in the positive as global markets remain strong. The domestic market continues to remain overbought, but the momentum continues to be strong.

We expect Nifty to face technical resistance at 11,720 and 11,778 levels, while supports should drift lower to 11,610 and 11,550.



The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart stood at 73.9250 and it remains in the overbought territory. A bearish divergence is seen on the daily charts, as the RSI did not mark a fresh 14-period high even as the Nifty went on to end at a fresh closing high.

Daily MACD remains bullish, as it trades above the signal line. On the candles, a big white body occurred. Apart from this, no major formations were observed. Pattern analysis shows a strong uptrend is in place. However, Nifty remains overbought and visibly overextended.

Overall, at a point where the market continues to mark fresh highs and shows no sign of consolidation or correction, there are important points that one needs to take note of at this juncture. Market breadth in the previous couple of sessions has been evidently fractured and this is not as robust as it should have been. An overbought market along with not-so-strong market breadth is certainly a factor that warrants caution.

While shorts should be obviously avoided, purchases should be limited to either defensives or sectors that were lagging earlier but now showing signs of some revival. Chasing momentum in stocks that have already run up should be avoided. A highly cautious view is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH:
Long positions were added in stocks like Power Grid, Adani Power, CG Power, ICICI Bank, PFC, Tata Motors, SBI, Bank of Baroda, Tata Steel, Bharti Airtel and TV18 Broadcast.

Take this: Those who had shown faith on country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki in the early days must be sitting on healthy profit today. The stock, which got listed on the bourses in July 2003, has rallied over 5,400 per cent in last 15 years. One major milestone for the stock was its entry into the elite Nifty50 club in 2004.

There are 12 other stocks which all got listed after Maruti and have seen similar fortunes after entering Club Nifty. They include TCS (listed in August 2004), UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), YES Bank (July 2005), Tech Mahindra (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infratel (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013). 

Data suggested that one of every four debutants of last 15 years, which made it to Club Nifty, gave handsome returns to investors.

Barring Coal India (down 17 per cent), all other stocks from Club Nifty have delivered positive return to investors since their listing. YES Bank has rallied nearly 3,200 per cent since listing, UltraTech Cement 1,551 per cent and TCS 1,528 per cent.

The Nifty topped the 11,700-mark for the first time ever this week coming from sub-1,500 level 15 years ago, logging a 750 per cent rise.

Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, Power Grid, NTPC, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Bharti Infratel have climbed 396 per cent, 96.30 per cent, 86 per cent, 110 per cent, 357 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto have soared 1,300 per cent and 805 per cent, respectively, since their listing in 2008.

JSW Steel, which on Tuesday qualified to enter the Club Elite, advanced over 3 per cent in early trade on Wednesday. NSE Indices said it will replace Lupin in the Nifty 50 index from September 28, 2018. 

“Change is the only constant and index structure is no exception. Over the years, the representation in Nifty50 has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy: new sectors have evolved, while some have lost relative importance in the New India,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market experts are looking bullish on most of the above-mentioned stocks. Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) with a target price of Rs 10,805. The automaker expects double-digit growth in FY19, driven by continued strength in rural markets. The company remains fully committed to launching fully electric vehicles in India in 2020, supported by access to technology from Toyota. In the interim, it will launch a strong hybrid vehicle. Shares of Maruti Suzuki traded at Rs 9,413 on Wednesday.

Country’s biggest IT major Tata Consultancy Services is among the preferred picks of brokerage Sharekhan. TCS recently reported higher-than-expected margin performance in Q1FY19, while Infosys and HCL Tech delivered on expected lines, according to Sharekhan.

BofAML recently upgraded Tech Mahindra to ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ and raised the target price to Rs 800 from Rs 600 earlier. “We expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 per cent over FY18-21. Such growth to provide more qualitative stock rally,” the brokerage said.

Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 475. “The strong cargo growth story remains intact, driven by inclusion of new ports (Ennore in FY19, Vizhinjam in FY20) and growth in logistics business. We also expect strong cash flows in FY19 and beyond, with capex peaking out and operations stabilising across assets. We view the current price as an excellent opportunity to own a superior cash-generating asset portfolio,” it said.

Motilal Oswal also has ‘buy’ ratings on Bajaj Auto, Coal India, NTPC and Power Grid."

86,2018-08-31,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity market continued to consolidate on Friday despite witnessing volatility, as a sharp plunge in the rupee along with weakness in global markets dented investor appetite.

Investors were on tenterhook as they keenly awaited June quarter GDP data scheduled to be released later in the day. Most analysts were estimating the GDP print to be at 7.5-7.6 per cent. A few have gone overboard to project 8 per cent expansion.

The domestic currency on Friday breached the 71-mark against the US dollar and traded near fresh all-time low levels through the day. The weakness in rupee can be attributed to the persistent demand for the greenback amid rising crude prices.

BSE benchmark Sensex extended its decline to a third straight session to close 45.03 points, or 0.12 per cent lower at 38,645.07. Sensex swung over 200 points during the session.

FM Arun Jaitley’s statement that India is likely to surpass the UK to become the world's fifth largest economy next year boosted sentiment. However, the report that the US President is planning to impose new tariffs on China not only capped upside but triggered profit taking too. Mostly sectoral indices traded in line with the benchmark index and closed flat,"" said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

Among Sensex stocks YES Bank shares fell the most even as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed CEO Rana Kapoor to continue in his present position till further notice. The stock settled 5.11 per cent lower at Rs 343.40.

0,2018-09-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Market kept its slate clean on Friday by rallying for the sixth straight week on the back of select heavyweights. But the rupee's rapid descent towards 71-mark against the dollar came as a rude jolt. 

The Sensex advanced 1.03 per cent to 38,645.10 for the week to August 31, from 38,251.80 in the previous one. The NSE Nifty added 1.06 per cent at 11,680.50, from 11,557.10 during the same period.

Rupee's diminished clout remains a big worryline. The slide is mainly a fallout of elevated crude prices, worsening current account deficit (CAD), spike in inflation and fears of foreign portfolio outflow.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes, according to Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management, show that the benchmark finished the week below the 11,700 level. However, the index bulls failing to take out 11,760 might be a point of concern on a short-term basis. Hence staying cautious on rise is advised. 

Breaking out 11,760 may unfold a fresh leg of upmove towards 11,880 levels. Further, Nifty broader trading range for the coming week is expected to be 11,880-11,520.

We see a tepid start to the day on Tuesday and expect some stability in the initial trade, but the market is expected to continue to trade with corrective undertone with the levels of 11,760 now acting as immediate top for the market. With levels of 11,650 and 11,760 acting as resistance, supports may come at 11,520 and 11,460 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 60.0479. The RSI marked a fresh 14-period low, which is bearish. A bearish divergence is also observed as the RSI has marked a fresh 14-period low, while the Nifty hasn’t.

The daily MACD too has shown a negative crossover and is now bearish trading below its signal line. On the candles, a big engulfing bearish candle has occurred. It remains significant as it has emerged near the resistance area and after an upmove. It can mark a potential top for the market and may temporarily stall the upmove.

Overall, in absence of any overnight global cues and as the technical indicators suggest, we may continue to see the market trading with corrective undertone.

What the market is witnessing is a classical correction after a sharp upmove and this broad consolidation is likely to be extremely healthy for the market.

We recommend remaining extremely light on exposures and avoiding shorts as the primary uptrend remains intact. All downsides should be utilised to make selective purchases. Overall, while remaining light on exposures, cautious approach is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Short positions are seen being added in stocks of South Indian Bank, CG Power, ITC, Tata Motors, Reliance, BEL, Powergrid, Suzlon, Escorts, Canara Bank, Infosys, SAIL and YES Bank.

2,2018-09-03,PowerGrid,"An exemption on road tax of up to 100 per cent, incentives to replace your old vehicle and charging stations across the city — the Delhi government is planning a host of measures to make electric vehicles popular in the capital.

The government’s comprehensive electric vehicle policy is now ready and will be made public very soon, said state transport minister Kailash Gahlot.

Though Gahlot didn’t mention the quantum of exemption on road tax for electric vehicles, he said it will be “substantial”. “Major incentives will be given for buying electric vehicles,” Gahlot told TOI, adding that infrastructure across the city to support electric mobility is also in the works. 

Since prices of electric vehicles range between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, you could save upwards of Rs 70,000 in road tax if you buy one such vehicle for, say, Rs 10 lakh. Road tax currently stands at 7 per cent for vehicles costing Rs 6 lakh or more.

Sources said major incentives are being planned for those who want to replace their old diesel or petrol vehicles with electric ones. 

A meeting chaired by Gahlot was held on August 27 to discuss steps that need to be taken to provide a robust support infrastructure in the city for promoting electric mobility. “All stakeholders, including the power grid, discoms and Indian Oil Corporation, were present,” Gahlot said. “We are planning charging stations across the city like the way we have petrol and CNG stations,” he said. The meeting was also attended by senior Delhi government officials, including those from the transport department.

In March, the Delhi government had announced the formulation of its electric vehicle policy in the Budget. According to sources, there are also plans to provide subsidy to those opting for electric vehicles as these are more expensive than diesel or petrol ones at present. 

“We have already seen many people opting for CNG-run cars, which are more environment-friendly. Electric vehicles, however, are cleaner than CNG, and that is why we are planning to give incentives to those buying them,” a government official said. An exemption of 50 per cent on road tax for CNG-run vehicles was also announced in the Budget. Sources said a cabinet note has been prepared on it and will be presented before the cabinet very soon. The incentives and exemptions on electric vehicles will be higher than those on CNG vehicles."

27,2018-09-06,PowerGrid,"The stock market on Thursday traded on expected lines, as it did attempt to gain some stability after six days of losing streak. However, this happened amid volatility.

The Nifty swung nearly 150 points in either direction, before ending the day with a gain of 59.95 points or 0.52 per cent.

With Thursday’s trade, the index has established its current trading range of 11,760-11,395, and the level of 11,395 will be very crucial level to watch out for the near term.

There are chances that the market may spend some time in this range before it take further directional call.

Friday is likely to once again see a stable start to the trade. The levels of 11,590 and 11625 will act as immediate resistance area on Friday. Supports may come in at 11,450 and 11,395 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 55.6154 and it remains neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. On the candles, a not-so-classic candle with a long lower shadow occurred. The shadow is not long enough to be called a classical long lower shadow.

However, with the previous session’s low not taken out, the market is in the process of finding some temporary bottom.

The pattern analysis suggests Nifty is attempting to find a temporary bottom after a sharp correction in the past couple of sessions. With the index trading a notch below the short term 20-DMA, it might act as support.

What we saw over the past couple of sessions was a sharp partial reversion to the mean and this was imminent, as the market had run ahead of its curve.

The rally that it had seen was too sharp and it was visibly overextended and overbought. Now there is a high probability that the market may oscillate in a broad 11,395-11,760 range for some time.

Our analysis for Friday’s trade remains on similar lines and we recommend staying away from creating short positions. In event of any downsides, select purchases may be made. While maintaining enough liquidity to absorb volatile moves, cautiously positive outlook is advised for the day.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Good technical set up is observed in stocks like Aurobindo Pharma, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, NCC, TVS Motors, Ashok Leyland, PFC, Wipro, PowerGrid, Reliance Industries, Biocon and NMDC.

“The high-level empowered committee during its first meeting has decided to preserve the three contracts vital to the power projects that can save the value of the projects and fetch fair deals,” said a government official on the condition of anonymity.

“If the government asks the public sector utilities to retain the contracts and they oblige, the projects will attract more investors and higher bids,” he said.

The panel also looked into reform proposals including doing away with the requirement of power generation plants having power purchase tie-ups to get coal and setting up a payment security mechanism to timely recover dues from the distribution companies, he said.

According to the report of the 40th Standing Committee on Energy, the total coal- based power capacity in the private sector is nearly 90,000 mw, of which 75,000 mw is operational. It is estimated that 60,000-65,000 mw of this capacity may be under financial stress.

The projects are stressed due to coal supply, lack of PPAs or regulatory issues. Plants such as Avantha Power (Jhabua), Avantah Power (Korba), Lanco Amarkantak Power and Lanco Anpara have coal supplies, but no or part PPAs.

While some like GVK Goindwal Sahib and Essar Power Jharkhand have complete PPAs or near full PPAs. A few projects like Lanco Anpara and GMR Warora have full PPAs and FSAs, but are stressed due to under recoveries and cost overruns. 

Of the 34 assets listed in the report, 14 have coal issues, eight have PPAs but no coal linkage, and three neither have PPA nor coal supply. There are three plants whose coal block allocations were cancelled, the report stated, adding lenders have exposure of approximately Rs 3 lakh crore to such assets.

On Monday, lenders are expected to file cases for a dozen unresolved assets to NCLT as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India circular. This follows a verdict of the Allahabad High Court refusing extension of the RBI circular deadline to complete resolution of private power plants outside IBC.

Essar Power, GMR Energy and RattanIndia Power have again approached the Allahabad HC seeking directions to RBI for extension of deadline to refer their plants to insolvency court by 60-90 days.

Similar cases have been filed in Madras, Punjab and Delhi high courts. Madras High Court will hear the plea of IL&FS and RKMPowergen on Monday while as per the February 12 circular lenders have to refer unresolved stressed assets to NCLT by Tuesday.

47,2018-09-10,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: On Monday, Indian equity benchmark Sensex suffered its biggest loss in terms of points since March 2018 on heavy profit booking across sectors, barring IT.

An unabated fall in the rupee, weak Asian peers and an uptick in global crude oil prices were the factors that hit market sentiments severely, while a strengthening US dollar aggravated capital outflow from the market.

The BSE Sensex plunged about 468 points, or 1.22 per cent, to settle at 37,922, while NSE’s Nifty50 tanked 151 points, or 1.30 per cent, to end the day at 11,438.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices suffered losses of over one per cent each.


Let’s walk you through the key highlight of Monday’s session...

Who dragged my SensexBarring four stocks – Axis Bank (up 0.99 per cent), Wipro (up 0.26 per cent), YES Bank (up 0.09 per cent) and TCS (up 0.07 per cent) – all other components of the 30-share index suffered losses. Sun Pharma, falling 3.72 per cent, stood as the top loser. In terms of index contribution, HDFC, Reliance Industries, ITC, HDFC Bank and M&M were biggest index losers. 


Axis Bank bucked the trendShares of the private lender jumped nearly 5 per cent to hit a 52-week high of Rs 676.90 on BSE, but cooled off later and settled at Rs 651.55, with a gain of 6 points, or 0.99 per cent. Shares of the bank rallied after Amitabh Chaudhry of HDFC Life was named its new CEO and MD to take office from January 1, 2019. Analysts see the development as game changer, as the appointment could reverse weakening of Axis Bank’s brand image.

Carnage in currency marketA persistent fall in the rupee dampened market sentiment. The local currency weakened further to hit a new low of 72.67 against the greenback, dropping nearly 94 paise in afternoon trade. Other than the turmoil in emerging markets, the major reason behind the fall in the rupee was strengthening US dollar and a surge in crude oil prices, which is threatening to disrupt India’s fiscal maths.


Trade war intensifiesAdding fuel to the trade conflict with China, US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened tariffs on a further $267 billion worth of Chinese imports. Subsequently, Beijing warned of retaliation if the US goes ahead with the new measures. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing would counter if the US takes any new step on trade. 


Stocks that plunged at least 10%Shares of Vas Infrastructure (down 20 per cent), Captain Technocast (down 14.68 per cent), IL&FS Transportation Networks (down 13.79 per cent), R&B Denims (down 11.25 per cent), IL&FS Investment Managers (down 10.99 per cent) and Citadel Realty & Developers (down 10.07 per cent) cracked over 10 per cent on BSE.


52-week lows & highsAs many as 80 stocks, including APL Apollo Tubes, Bharat Road Network, Century Plyboards (India), Syndicate Bank and Unitech, hit 52-week lows on NSE. However, 31 stocks, including Axis Bank, Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, JSW Steel, Mindtree and Usha Martin hit 52-week highs on NSE.

48,2018-09-11,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: After seeing buying at lower levels for weeks, domestic equity indices at last caved in on Monday, recording their worst point-wise fall since March 16.

The Nifty50 formed a Bearish Belt Hold pattern on the daily chart, which analysts said was a sign of weakness. 

That said, a number of stocks looked strong on the technical charts, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The momentum indicator signalled an upward crossover, meaning bullish signal, on at least 46 counters, hinting at possible upsides for these stocks. 

Some of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Many of these stocks were from mid- and small-sized stocks from IT, sugar and construction sectors.

Among them were IT firm Hexaware Technologies, sugar maker Triveni Engineering, life insurer Max Financial Services and pharma firm BAL Pharma. IT firms eClerx Services and Persistent systems also featured on the list, as did sugar stocks Sakthi Sugars and Ugar Sugar Works. 



Others included realtors DB realty and Puravankara, roads & highway stock Ashoka Buildcon and construction and engineering firm C&C Constructions.

MACD is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. 

Some 59 stocks showed bearish crossovers on NSE, including JP Power Ventures, BHEL, NHPC, Power Grid, HDFC, Equitas Holdings Strides Pharma Sciences and L&T.



That said, the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call based on it, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation matrix. 

Market veterans say the MACD alone may not be good enough to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

The Nifty50 decisively fell below its 20-day moving average on Monday, as the bulls lost steam. A Bearish Belt Hold candle indicated that the bears were holding a grip, even as the index formed multiple Hammer patterns in last three sessions.

Should the index hold below 11,500 level, it would witness selling towards the recent swing low of 11,400. It may face resistance around the 11,550 mark, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. 


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Max Financial Services shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock tended to show an upward momentum and vice versa.

56,2018-09-11,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Extending its losses to the second consecutive session, headline indices Sensex and Nifty suffered massive losses on Tuesday on all-round selling as the rupee hit a fresh record low.

Lingering trade war worries, wobbly crude oil prices and turmoil in emerging markets weighed on sentiments. Sensex settled 509 points, or 1.34 per cent, down at 37,413 while Nifty plunged 151 points, or 1.32 per cent, to close at 11,287.

FMCG, telecom and consumer durables stocks were worst hit. Pharma, auto, bank and financial also reeled under selling pressure.

Domestic equity investors have lost around Rs 4,14,121.84 crore in two sessions as the Sensex erased about 977 points and the Nifty 302 points. Broader BSE Midcap (down 1.36 per cent) and Smallcap (down 1.37 per cent) indices fell in sync with Sensex. 


Let’s walk you through the key highlights of the session:

Who dragged the SensexTata Steel, falling 3.46 per cent, was the top loser in the 30-share index. PowerGrid, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Motors suffered losses of over 3 per cent each. In terms of index contribution, HDFC Bank, ITC, RIL, ICICI Bank and TCS were the top index losers while Coal India (up 1.73 per cent), NTPC (up 0.36 per cent), Infosys (up 0.31 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 0.26 per cent) and Asian Paints (0.26 per cent) were the five stocks that managed to end with gains. 


Mayhem in the currency martAfter recovering in the morning session, the rupee saw sharp a drop in afternoon deals and traded 19 paise down at 72.63 around 3.55 pm. Turmoil in emerging markets, firming US dollar and a surge in crude oil prices put pressure on the domestic currency. The relentless slide in the rupee has analysts rushing to rework their forecasts. DBS Bank is now predicting the domestic unit to slip as low as 75 to the dollar.


China stocks near 2016 lowThe Shanghai Composite slipped 0.18 per cent in Tuesday’s session to touch the low of 2016. Worries of an ever-intensifying trade war between China and the US have dealt a heavy blow to Chinese stocks. After the US President announced on Friday that China may face tariffs on virtually all exports to the US, China warned retaliation.

61,2018-09-12,PowerGrid,"The selloff in the domestic equity market has dragged the benchmark Nifty over 3 per cent down in September so far. The index slipped to 11,287 on September 11 from 11,680 on August 31.

In the process, more than 20 stocks in the Nifty50 index have slipped below their 200- day moving average (DMA). The list included Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Eicher Motors, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco Industries, HPCL, IOC, Maruti Suzuki, Power Grid, Tata Steel and Vedanta. 

On the Nifty500, as many as 344 stocks or as much as 69 per cent of the index pack, now trade below their 200-DMAs, reflecting intense selling pressure across sectors. 

Other stocks trading below this crucial support line include ACC, Aditya Birla Capital, Aegis Logistics, Ashoka Buildcon, Avanti Feeds, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bajaj Electricals, Birla Corporation, Emami, Engineers India, Finolex Cables, Godrej Properties, Indiabulls Housing Finance and MMTC, among others. 

Moving averages normally help market participants analyse an emerging trend in a stock or an index. They provide useful information on support and resistance points.

Usually, a trader or investor uses three major DMAs or daily moving averages, that of 50, 100 and 200 days. When a stock trades above all the DMAs, it is said to be in a continuing uptrend. 

During corrective moves, stocks often come off their highs and slip below moving averages. Shallow corrections make stocks test their 50-DMA or 100-DMA, but any serious correction may cause a stock not only to test the 200 DMA but also slip below it.







“Without doubt stocks quoting below their 200-day moving averages are sentimentally weak, suggesting that they are in a long-term downtrend. However, as the bull market remains intact at this point, if any scrip from the largecap space or midcap space with promising fundamentals is trading below its 200-day moving average, it can be considered as an investment opportunity,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

“We advise traders to read 200 DMA only as one a tool to gauge long-term trends, but not as a trading tool, unless a particular scrip has a history of testing its 200- day moving average and bouncing back. Often, we find scrips or indices yo-yoing around these averages which don’t help take a near-term trading call,” Mohammad said.

NSE’s Nifty index traded almost flat at 11,300 in morning deals on Wednesday. 

In the recent corrective move that the market has seen after marking a high at 11,760, there were many stocks ruling at or below their 200-DMAs. These stocks present an attractive opportunity for value purchase. While doing so, investors need to exercise some discretion, said Milan Vaishnav, Technical Analyst, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory.

“Not all such stocks that rule below 200-DMA may offer value buying opportunity. While attempting to make a value purchase, one will need to remain highly sector specific and pick stocks only from those sectors which are showing an improvement on the relative momentum front,” Vaishnav said."

72,2018-09-13,PowerGrid,"A day after Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan accused Odisha of delaying NTPC’s proposed power plant in Talcher, the state government has hit back with a counter charge — that the central government is pushing the state, and its consumers, to pay high cost for power.

“The tariff of power intimated by NTPC for the first year of operations is in the range of Rs 3.40 per unit, which is much higher than the Rs 2.70 per unit indicated in the review meeting held by the chief secretary on July 28, 2018,” state power minister Susanta Singh pointed out in a letter to RK Singh, the central minister of state for power, new and renewable energy, 
on Wednesday.


On Tuesday, Pradhan, minister of petroleum and natural gas, had written to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, suggesting that the state government was sitting over an important approval to NTPC’s Rs 9,785 crore brownfield plant.

BJP members raised the 15-month delay from the state’s high-level clearance authority in the Assembly on the eve of Patnaik's investors' meet in the New Delhi.

In his letter to RK Singh, the Odisha power minister suggested a “win-win solution for NTPC and Odisha” that would facilitate early setting up of the proposed 1320 MW plant.

He said NTPC could commit to evacuate power through the state transmission network, saving the state Power Grid Corporation’s “very high transmission charges” in the range of Rs 0.60 to Rs 0.80 per unit, in the state’s estimate.

In addition, Odisha should also be allocated power from NTPC’s other plants within the state, he said.

“Odisha was being allocated power from NTPC’s Barh-I and Barh-II plants (in Bihar) instead of the Kaniha and Talcher plant within the state, costing it Rs 5 more per unit,” Singh said in the letter to the central minister. “If the above issues are not resolved, Odisha would end up paying higher cost for power from NTPC to the extent of Rs 500 crore per annum for the next 25 years. You would agree that such enormous financial burden amount to almost Rs 12,000 crore on the power consumers of Odisha. It can be avoided if Government of India agrees,” it said.

ET reviewed a copy of the letter.

The war of words between the Centre and state comes days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to Odisha on 
September 22, which includes a stop at Talcher to kick off the revival of a long-idled fertiliser project.

Pradhan, who has been monitoring the progress of the coal gasification-based fertiliser plant in his home state, in his letter to Patnaik had claimed power from NTPC’s new plant (considering its availability of land and coal) would be far cheaper than currently available.

Susanta Singh, in his letter to R K Singh, also addressed the charge of state causing delay in the project. He pointed out that without the state’s “proactive assistance” for permits related to land, water, environment, road and rail, etc., it wouldn’t have been possible for NTPC to run its plants optimally and even set up a new thermal power plant at Daripalli in Sundargarh. The same facilitation was being extended to the new project, he claimed, and suggested that the Centre address the state's concerns with the similar “time bound” consideration.

“You would be happy to note that the state project monitoring group (SPMG) under the chairmanship of the chief secretary reviews the progress of such projects every month. As a result of which the projects are progressing smoothly with the active cooperation of all arms of the state government,” he wrote. 


Back in 2013, when Odisha was short of power, Patnaik had written to the Centre, asking for 500 MW power from this proposed project to be allocated to Odisha. 
NTPC has chosen to not comment on the matter. Its board had recently approved Rs 9,785 crore investment for the project to be built next to its existing plant in Talcher. The power ministry PSU had applied to Odisha government’s high level clearance authority for its nod on April 19, 2017."
71,2018-09-13,PowerGrid,"Kolkata | Mumbai: The rupee sank to yet another intra-day low, hitting 72.92 to the dollar, before recovering, but the sharp volatility underscored expectations of further interest rate increases by the central bank. The currency ended at 72.19, having closed at a record low of 72.70 on Tuesday.

Stocks also rebounded after a sharp selloff in the previous session as the Indian currency rose. The rupee has fallen about 4% against the dollar in 10 days and 11.5% this year, with about half of that since August 1, making it one of the worst-performing emerging market currencies.

The currency revival came amid reports that PM Narendra Modi is to hold a meeting this weekend to assess measures aimed at shoring up the rupee. The slump defies logic and the government and RBI will strive to curb the fall, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said.




Reserve Bank rate action
“No fundamental rationale for rupee to depreciate to levels we saw till yesterday,” Garg tweeted. “It reflected overreaction of market operators. Government and RBI will do everything to ensure that rupee does not slide to unreasonable levels. Today’s correction seems to reflect that realisation.”

The Bloomberg Implied Volatility index, which measures market swings, eased to 8.19% at the end of Wednesday’s trade, having been at close to a threeyear high of 8.51% on Monday. The index has climbed nearly 200 basis points (bps) since August. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The sharp fall of the local currency is pushing commodity prices up. Those price pressures will feature heavily in the deliberations of the Reserve Bank of India monetary policy committee in early October, although consumer inflation cooled to a 10-month low of 3.69% in August.

“Weakening rupee means that imported inflation will feed into domestic inflation which will prompt RBI rate action,” CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis told ET.

RBI raised the repo rate by 25 basis points in August while keeping its monetary policy stance neutral, signalling that it would tweak its policy rate in line with market conditions.

“Strong intervention and selling by exporters led to sharp appreciation in the currency today,” said VK Sharma, head of capital market strategy at HDFC Securities. “News of an economic review meeting chaired by Prime Minister over the weekend also helped the sentiment.”

Analysts said the current volatility is being caused by global factors over which RBI has no control, such as interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and a global trade war.

“Global investors are reassessing emerging market risk now and its implications for various asset classes,” said ICICI Bank’s group executive and head for global markets, B Prasanna. “This has primarily caused implied volumes to rise, coupled with the dramatic fall in the rupee’s value against the dollar over the past fortnight or so. The implied volumes had stabilised lower in the earlier years when extended foreign fund inflows had kept it well supported. Now the volumes have edged higher as a direct result of this global re-assessment.” The ongoing volatility in the financial markets and trade war concerns have impinged upon India’s macroeconomic fundamentals, a Bank of Baroda research note said.

The stock market oscillated between gains and losses for the better part of the session but speculation that the government will take steps to arrest the decline prompted traders to cover short positions. Even as the market recovered, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued to sell. Provisional data showed FPIs sold Indian stocks worth a net Rs 1,086 crore on Wednesday and domestic institutional investors were net buyers to the tune of Rs 541.4 crore. FPIs have sold shares worth more than Rs 1,000 crore in each of the last three sessions.

The Sensex ended up 0.8% from Tuesday’s close at 37,717.96 points while the Nifty ended up 0.7% at 11,369.90. The Nifty lost 2.6% and the Sensex fell 2.5% in the past two days, weighed down by the plummeting rupee, surging oil prices and renewed global trade war worries.

Power Grid Corporation of India, Adani Ports, ITC, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Hindustan Unilever were the top gainers on the Sensex on Wednesday, gaining between 2.3% and 3.4%."
73,2018-09-14,PowerGrid,"BHUBANESWAR: A day after Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan accused Odisha of delaying NTPC’s proposed power plant in Talcher, the state government has hit back with a counter charge — that the central government is pushing the state, and its consumers, to pay high cost for power.

“The tariff of power intimated by NTPC for the first year of operations is in the range of Rs 3.40 per unit, which is much higher than the Rs 2.70 per unit indicated in the review meeting held by the chief secretary on 28 July 2018,” state power minister Susanta Singh pointed out in a letter to R K Singh, the central minister of state for power, new and renewable energy, on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Pradhan, minister of petroleum and natural gas, had written to Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, suggesting that the state government was sitting over an important approval to NTPC’s Rs 9,785 crore brownfield plant.

BJP members raised the 15-month delay from the state’s high level clearance authority in the assembly on the eve of Patnaik's investors' meet in the New Delhi.

In his letter to R K Singh, the Odisha power minister suggested a“win-win solution for NTPC and Odisha” that would facilitate early setting up of the proposed 1320 MW plant.

He said NTPC could commit to evacuate power through the state transmission network, saving the state Power Grid Corporation’s “very high transmission charges” in the range of Rs 0.60 to 0.80 per unit, in the state’s estimate.

In addition, Odisha should also be allocated power from NTPC’s other plants within the state, he said. “Odisha was being allocated power from NTPC’s Barh-I and Barh-II plants (in Bihar) instead of the Kaniha and Talcher plant within the state, costing it Rs 5 more per unit,” Singh said in the letter to the central minister. 

“If the above issues are not resolved, Odisha would end up paying higher cost for power from NTPC to the extent of Rs 500 crore per annum for the next 25 years. You would agree that such enormous financial burden amount to almost Rs 12,000 crore on the power consumers of Odisha. It can be avoided if Government of India agrees,” it said. ET reviewed a copy of the letter."
80,2018-09-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty staged a stellar show on Friday on across-the-board buying fuelled by healthy macroeconomic indicators. 

Domestic investors embarked on an all-round buying spree after inflation data showed the economy is in a good shape. 

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday showed inflation based on wholesale prices eased to a four-month low of 4.53 per cent in August on softening of food prices. The wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.09 per cent in July and 3.24 per cent in August last year.

Earlier this week, government data showed retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. 

The rupee, too, was on a recovery path in anticipation that the Prime Minister may announce some steps to curb its fall at an weekend review. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was trading 35 paise higher for the day at 71.93.

Positive global cues also influenced the sentiment. Asian shares rose on Friday as the US and China prepared for a new round of trade talks on the tariff row, while a decisive interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank helped support global risk appetite, Reuters reported.

Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley raised the Sensex target for September 2019 to 42,000, citing that the earnings cycle was at the cusp of turning. However, it highlighted the election outcome in 2019 is a key risk for the market.

The 30-share Sensex surged 373 points, or 0.99 per cent, to settle at 38,090, with only two stocks - Coal India (down 1.42 per cent) and Infosys (down 1.01 per cent) – ending as losers. 

The Nifty50 index jumped 145 points, or 1.28 per cent, to close at 11,515, with four stocks – HCL Tech, Coal India, Infosys and GAIL – ending in the red. Reliance Industries finished flat. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices outperformed Sensex, gaining 1.62 per cent and 1.38 per cent, respectively. For the week, Sensex slipped 0.78 per cent and Nifty 0.64 per cent.

India’s retail inflation decelerated to a 10-month low in August while factory output remained robust in July. Consumer inflation eased to 3.69 per cent in August, government data showed, falling below the RBI target of 4 per cent and July’s reading of 4.17 per cent."
81,2018-09-15,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: The stock market rose for the second straight day on Friday, taking cues from the rebound in the rupee amid expectations that the government will soon announce measures to stem the slide in rupee and stocks.

The Sensex closed above 38,000 and the Nifty edged past 11,500 on Friday, erasing most of the week’s losses that emanated from worries about the impact of a weaker rupee on the economy. The Sensex rose 372.68 points or 0.99 per cent to close at 38,090.64 while the Nifty climbed 145.30 points or 1.28 per cent to end at 11,515.20. Vedanta, PowerGrid, Asian Paints and NTPC gained 3-6 per cent. Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth ?1,090.56 crore, reversing their recent selling spree.

The rupee gained 0.45 per cent to close at 71.86 after recovering from a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday. Financial markets were shut on Thursday. Analysts said in addition to expectations of intervention by the government and the RBI, the rupee’s bounce was also driven by the Turkey central bank’s decision to raise interest rates to 24 per cent in a bid to curb rocketing inflation and prevent a currency crisis.

“The rupee could take some respite amid a cocktail of external and internal factors,” said Anindya Banerjee at Kotak Securities. “While Turkish lira shows some signs of stabilising, the authorities back home are expected to come out with some measures that could check further slide.” The crash in Turkish lira by as much as 50 per cent against the dollar has been one of the main triggers for the sell-off in emerging market currencies and stocks including India’s.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strong opponent of raising interest rates.





The rupee has fallen 11.1 per cent so far this year, sparking panic in the government and the market over the pace of the slide. The country’s forex reserves slipped below $400 billion as on September 9 because of the RBI’s efforts to curb the fall in the rupee.

Some traders expect authorities to come up with a NRI-bond investment programme, which would boost the dollar reserves and prop up the rupee. Dealers are now expecting the rupee to trade in the broad range of 71-73 in next few weeks. The direction of the stock market will depend on the moves in the rupee and crude oil prices. “It will be too early to conclude that the worst is over for the markets and the rupee,” said Nilesh Shah, managing director, Kotak Mutual Fund.

“Oil, US interest rates and the politics here will play a big role in the market direction.”

MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose 1.2 per cent on Friday after the US and China looked set to initiate fresh talks on trade after months of escalating dispute. Korea’s Kospi rose 1.4 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1 per cent.

Oil rose on Friday after prices fell by the most in a month on Thursday. Brent crude was up 5 cents at $78.23 a barrel after falling 2 per cent on Thursday. The benchmark had risen to $80.13 — its highest since May 22."

As per latest reports US President Donald Trump is expected to announce another set of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

A fall in the rupee despite government's efforts to stem its decline further depressed Dalal Street investors. 

The domestic currency once again plunged below the 72 level despite making a sharp comeback on Friday. The unit hit an intraday low of 72.68 against the US dollar. 

""Nifty started the week on feeble note and lost over a per cent, mainly pressurised by global cues. It opened gap down and remained under pressure till the end. The news of possibility of further escalation of trade war between the US and China didn't go well with the markets. Also, weakness in the rupee further dented the sentiment. Mostly sectoral indices traded in line with the benchmark index and closed lower,"" said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking.

The BSE Sensex tanked 505.13 points, or 1.33 per cent to 37,585.51. A sharp fall in index heavyweights Reliance Industries, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ITC and Infosys dragged the 30-share index lower. Only 5 shares managed to close the session marginally higher while the remaining 26 wallowed in the pool of red.

Sun Pharma dipped 2.85 per cent to Rs 646.15 and was the top index loser whereas PowerGrid was the top performer with gains of 0.70 per cent. Other stocks that closed in the green were TCS, Adani Ports, IndusInd Bank and Tata Steel.

The NSE barometer Nifty dropped 137.45 points, or 1.19 per cent, to 11,377.75 with 36 constituents settling lower and 14 higher. In the 50-share index Bajaj Finance was the top loser while BPCL the top gainer.

The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap shed 0.76 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively to outperform Sensex.

In the sectoral space only Nifty IT and Nifty Realty shut shop on a positive note. Nifty Realty gained 1.13 per cent to close at 269.15 points.

Financials, bank, pharma, FMCG and auto stocks slipped up to 1.50 per cent.

Elsewhere, the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 0.2, while Germany's DAX dropped half a percent. France's CAC 40 and Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent respectively."
88,2018-09-18,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark Nifty50 traded flat in early trade on Tuesday in follow-up to Monday’s selloff that erased entire gains seen in the last two sessions of the previous week.

While a flareup in the US-China trade war hurt investor mood, technical charts threw up a gloomy outlook. 

With the NSE barometer trading below its 20-day SMA and filling Monday’s bullish gap area of between 11,430 and 11,380 levels, further correction in the index looks imminent. 

That said, many stocks looked strong on the charts, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD. The momentum indicator signalled an upward crossover, or bullish signal, on at least 71 counters, hinting at possible upsides in these stocks. 

Some of these counters have also been witnessing strong trading volume of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend. 

Among the stocks that witnessed bullish signals were OMCs IOC, BPCL and HPCL, PowerGrid, Syndicate Bank, Indiabulls Real Estate, Allahabad Bank and Tata Power. 

Others included Wockhardt, Uttam Galva Steels, CanFin Homes, DCM Shriram and PC Jeweller, among others. 



The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa. 

Some 45 stocks showed bearish crossovers on NSE, including Tata Motors, Infosys, FirstSource Solution, SBI Life Insurance, Glenmark Pharma, KPIT Technologies and Hudco. 



That said, the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call based on it, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation ratio. 

Market veterans say the MACD alone may not be good enough indicator to help take an investment call. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend. 

For the Nifty50, daily strength indicator RSI and momentum indicator Stochastic both are in the negative terrain, which supports a weakening trend, said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Axis Securities. 

On Monday, the index settled 137.45 points, or 1.19 per cent, lower at 11,377. As long as the index stays below 11,450 level, chances are that it may drift towards 11,333 and then 11,250 levels, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in feels the upside for the Nifty50 is capped at 11,520 and a fresh leg of upward momentum is unlikely unless the index clears the said hurdle.

Monday’s price action, he said, has the potential to send the Nifty50 towards its recent corrective swing low at 11,250 level.

A close look at the stock chart of IOC shows whenever the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, the stock has showed an upward momentum and vice versa. 

On Monday, the stock rose 0.81 per cent to close at Rs 156.50 on NSE."

ET Now quoted LIC chairman VK Sharma as saying it would ensure that IL&FS does not collapse. He did not rule out raising stake in the ailing IL&FS.

Following this, bouts of bargain hunting and value buying emerged in most sectors, lifting Sensex some 400 points to its intraday high of 36,705. Eventually, the 30-share pack settled 347 points, or 0.96 per cent, up at 36,652, with 20 stocks ending in the green. 

The Nifty50 finished 100 points, or 0.91 per cent, higher at 11,067, with 35 stocks advancing and 15 stocks declining.

99,2018-09-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty snapped a five-day losing streak on Tuesday to end almost a per cent higher. The session was marked by high volatility, as indices swung wildly during the day only to settle in the green.

The BSE Sensex gained 0.96 per cent, or 347.04 points, to 36,652.06 while its NSE counterpart Nifty jumped 100.05 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 11,067.45.

In the 30 share index, 10 stocks settled lower while the remaining edged higher. PowerGrid was the worst index performer while Hindustan Unilever was the top gainer.

On BSE, three out of every five stocks ended lower, signalling underlying bearishness.

BSE FMCG, BSE Financials, BSE Bankex, BSE Auto and BSE Healthcare were leading sectoral gainers. 

However, BSE Utilities, BSE Realty and BSE Energy were among the worst performing indices.

Volatility index India VIX eased 5.30 per cent to 16.5025.


Factors that led to market rally:

LIC Chairman soothes concerns over IL&FS IL&FS of late has become market’s pain point. The company has defaulted over five of its obligations since August, put its headquarters on the block, and its MD & CEO of the financial services arm has since resigned. 

The Friday's stock market crash was in part attributed to the IL&FS controversy.

But in the latest development, LIC Chairman VK Sharma has come out to say that they will ensure IL&FS does not collapse. He did not ruled out raising stake in teh ailing firm. He assured that LIC will take all possible steps to avoid contagion spreading to the market.

LIC holds over 25 per cent stake in IL&FS. 


Rupee puts up some fightThe domestic unit gained over 30 paise against the US dollar from day's low of 72.96. At the time of writing this report the rupee was trading at 72.63.


Buying in banking & financial stocksBuying in banking and financial stocks pushed the domestic equity indices higher. The Nifty Bank index jumped 1.44 per cent while the Nifty Financials index rose 1.90 per cent. Kotak Mahindra Bank was the top gainer in the Nifty Bank index. 

A recovery for the banking stocks was on the cards.

""We need to note that the Nifty has become nearly oversold while Nifty Bank trades very much oversold on the short-term charts. The market has ended a notch below 100-DMA mark of 11,028. However, this remains within its filter and we can still, though purely theoretically, expect some recovery and expect the level of 100-DMA being held as support,"" Milan Vaishnav, Consultant Technical Analyst at Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services had said on Monday.

The banking and financial stocks account for a third of Nifty weightage.


What experts say:

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare BrokingThe bulls staged a smart comeback post five straight session of losses with Nifty Index gaining ~0.9% to close at 11,064. The markets witnessed considerable volatility during the day, swinging both ways however, positive statements from LIC Chairman on IL&FS and news of successful raising of funds by Indiabulls Housing finance boosted investor sentiments.

We maintain our cautious stance on the Indian markets as volatility is likely to remain high in the near term. On the global front, US FOMC meet scheduled this week, crude oil and currency movement would be actively tracked by the investors. We would advise investors and traders to remain selective in stock picking.


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesAfter a volatile trade, market bounced back towards closing backed by renewed buying in financial & Pharma stocks. Continued weakness in rupee invited investors’ attention towards export oriented sectors and at the same time keeping fiscal path on edge. Domestic fund flow continued to add liquidity in the market due to value buying opportunity after the recent correction."

101,2018-09-26,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: India and Russia are expected to conclude an ‘action plan’ for expanding civil nuclear energy partnership during their annual summit here on October 5.

The action plan will focus on a second site for Russian nuclear plant in India besides localisation of components for nuclear power plants under the ‘Make in India’ programme, bolstering cooperation for existing nuclear power plant in Kudankulam and initiatives in third countries, ET has learnt.

 Putting an action plan in place for expanding civil nuclear partnership was a key item on the agenda during foreign minister Sushma Swaraj’s visit to Moscow last week, officials said. Currently, Russia is the only country that is constructing a nuclear power plant in India.

Russia-supported Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) is one of the largest nuclear power stations in India. It is scheduled to have six VVER-1,000 reactors with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW each.

The unit 1 of the plant was synchronised with the southern power grid in October 2013 and is generating electricity. The second unit, with a capacity of 1,000 MW, had become critical for the first time in July 2016.

 It was connected to the grid in August 2016 and started commercial operation in October 2016. The construction of units 3 and 4 are under way. The ‘first pour of concrete’ for unit 3 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, which marks the beginning of the construction of the project, took place on June 29, 2017.

 Foundation slabs for reactor buildings of units 3 and 4 have already been made. The construction is on schedule, officials said. In March this year, the first batch of equipment for turbine building of unit 3 of Kudankulam NPP was completed and shipped out. Particularly, the first two high pressure heaters (HPH) were dispatched for turbine building of KKNPP.

 Also, the reactor pressure vessel for KNPP unit 3 will be delivered by the end of the current year followed by KNPP unit 4 that will be completed next year.

During the India-Russia summit last year held in St Petersburg, both the countries signed the general framework agreement for the construction of unit 5 and 6 of KKNPP and an intergovernmental credit protocol necessary for the implementation of the project was also signed. 

Currently, intensive ground and infrastructural work is under way for unit 5 and 6. Besides the KNPP, Russia is working with India for the construction of the first nuclear power plant in Bangladesh at Rooppur.

 This year in March, the trilateral agreement was signed by India, Russia and Bangladesh. The three sides plan to cooperate in personnel training, experience sharing and consulting support. Under the agreement, Indian companies will participate in construction and installation work, supply of non-critical materials and equipment for the project."
102,2018-09-26,PowerGrid,"BENGALURU: Wind power tariffs climbed in the latest auction of 1,200 MW of projects, reflecting concerns by developers over higher costs of transmission.

The winning tariffs in the auction held today by the Solar Energy Corporation of India, were in the range of Rs 2.76-2.77 per unit. The lowest tariffs at the previous wind auction held in April were Rs 2.51-2.52 per unit.

Adani Green Energy won 300 MW with a bid of Rs 2.76, while Torrent Power got 115 MW at the same tariff. Riyadh-based Alfanar and Sitac RE won 300 MW at Rs 2.77 per unit, while Ecoren Energy and ReNew Power got 175 MW and 10 MW, respectively, at the same price.

The increase in tariff was largely attributed to worries by developers about inadequate transmission facilities. Locations with wind speeds high enough to produce wind energy are limited, as are transmission substations operated by Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL).

“There are not that many sites still available that are close to PGCIL substations,” said a wind developer who did not want to be identified. “Locating projects at some distance from substations increases transmission costs and hence the higher tariff.”

Developers also figure that transmission facilities at the best wind energy locations are already fully loaded and may not be able to carry additional power unless their capacity is increased.

The auction allows developers to set up projects anywhere and link them to the inter-state transmission system. Tamil Nadu and Gujarat top the list of eight states in India that have sites with the best wind speeds, but many of their prime locations are already taken up.

Others in the industry said tariffs had fallen too low and were now becoming realistic.

“Developers have been getting feedback from banks telling them bluntly that they had made crazy assumptions in their eagerness to lower tariffs and win projects and financial closure will not be possible at the prices they had committed,” the developer said.

The uncertainty in the industry was reflected in the poor participation at the original auction, where 2,000 MW of projects were offered. The auction was cancelled in August after only four technical bids were received for 1,200 MW. The offer was then scaled down to 1,200 MW, after which the auction attracted total bids for 2,290 MW."

108,2018-09-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity market came to a yet another uninspiring end on Thursday, as traders squared off positions on the expiry of September series future and options contract.

A weak rupee and tepid global cues along with firm oil prices caused further pain to investors on Dalal Street.

The BSE benchmark Sensex shut shop at 36,324.17, down 218.10 points, or 0.60 per cent while NSE Nifty settled the day 76.25 points, or 0.69 per cent lower at 10,977.55.

A poor show by bank and auto stocks was the reason behind Sensex’s 200-point fall. YES Bank was the worst performing stock in the 30-share index. It was followed by Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, ONGC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank.

TCS gained the most among Sensex stocks to settle 2.16 per cent up at Rs 2,187.80. Among other index leaders were Coal India, Asian Paints, Power Grid, Infosys and HUL.

Midcaps and smallcap stocks underperformed benchmark Sensex and lost nearly 2 per cent.

Among sectoral indices, Nifty IT index emerged to be the sole gainer amid a weakening rupee.

Pharma, realty, bank, financials, and auto indices shed up to 2.75 per cent.


What caused the fall?
F&O expiry: Volatility was the hallmark of Thursday's trade, as traders squared off positions on the expiry of September series F&O contracts.


No end to rupee's troubles: The rupee lost nearly 30 paise from its intraday high level despite government's effort to control current account deficit and strengthen rupee.

The government on Wednesday increased import duties on 19 items, including jet fuel and air conditioners, in a bid to check the widening current account deficit resulting from high crude oil prices and falling rupee.

The domestic currency was trading at 72.64 against the greenback at the time of writing this report. It had appreciated 20 paise against the US dollar at the open.


Oil prices gain 1%: The oil prices jumped over a per cent on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supply once US sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in just five weeks' time. The most-active December Brent crude futures contract was up 59 cents at $81.38 a barrel, just off Tuesday's four-year high of $82.55, Reuters reported.




Weak global cues: Poor performance by Asian and European markets rubbed off on domestic shares too. 

Europe's share markets took a tumble as a report that Italy's long-awaited budget was facing a delay compounded an already groggy global mood after the third US interest rate rise of the year. The STOXX 600 was down 0.5 percent while the euro skidded all the way down past $1.17 in the currency market, according to a Reuters report.

In Asia, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended lower. Japan's Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high but eventually ended down 1.0 per cent.

What experts say:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesThe Feds 25bps rate hike was in line with expectation whereas outflow of foreign funds and higher oil price weighed on the sentiment. Raising of import duty for essential goods, liquidity constraints with NBFC and F&O expiry added volatility in the market. This pressure is likely to continue till the financial market stabilizes and confidence reverts with accommodative valuation.


Jayant Manglik, President, Religare BrokingNifty slipped below the psychological mark of 11,000 as selling pressure resumed on the F&O expiry day. The news of rate hike by the US Fed fell in line with the market expectation and thus failed to attract any major reaction. However, the decline continued in banking and NBFC stocks which later joined by the others.

Markets are currently struggling mainly due to sentimental dent despite reaffirmation of liquidity support by the apex bank and other related agencies. The continuous fall in NBFC and banking counters is adding to that pressure. We reiterate our view to reduce position on bounce and waiting for further clarity. Also, we recommend keeping hedged positions on stock specific front and avoiding highly volatile counters."
109,2018-09-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended losses to a second session in a row on Thursday, on sustained selling in bank, financial and auto stocks, as investors’ risk appetite remained subdued amid expiry of September series futures & options contracts.

The Sensex opened in the green and traded with gains for some time before giving up the gains amid weak global cues and a fresh slide in the rupee against the US dollar. 

A rise in global crude oil price, rupee’s weakness and listless trading in peer markets in the wake of US Fed’s rate hike also hit sentiment back home. 

Most emerging market stocks and currencies fell on Thursday after US Fed hiked policy rates by 25 basis points and signalled another rate hike in December. The US central bank foresees three more rate hikes next year and one in 2020, Reuters reported.

Equity barometer Sensex suffered a loss of 218 points, or 0.60 per cent, to settle at 36,324, with 17 stocks ending in the red and 13 in the green. NSE’s Nifty50 finished 76 points, or 0.69 per cent, lower at 10,977, with 19 stocks gaining and 31 losing.


Let's walk you through the highlights of Thursday's session:

300 stocks at 52-week lows on NSEAs many as 310 stocks, including Tata Motors, Vodafone Idea, Hudco, APL Apollo Tubes, IndiGo, Jet Airways (India) and JMT Auto, Karur Vysya Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Punjab & Sind Bank hit 52-week lows on NSE. Meanwhile, Monnet Ispat & Energy, Deepak Nitrite, Gangotri Textiles, Prakash Steelage and Ruchi Infrastructure featured among the 10 stocks that touched their 52-week highs on NSE.


Sensex movers and shakersYES Bank (down 9.14 per cent), Maruti (down 3.68 per cent), Tata Motors (down 3.32 per cent), Axis Bank (down 2.79 per cent) and ONGC (down 2.49 per cent) finished the day as top losers in the Sensex pack. TCS (up 2.16 per cent), Coal India (up 1.39 per cent), Asian Paints (up 0.97 per cent), PowerGrid (up 0.93 per cent) and Infosys (up 0.88 per cent) were among the top gainers. 


Crude oil on the boilTight supply ahead of US sanctions on Iran kept the oil market boiling. A Reuters report said crude oil prices rose nearly 1 per cent on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supplies once US sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in five weeks. Opec did not indicate any plan to increase output at its meeting last Sunday, which is causing oil prices spiral up. 


Rupee sees seesaw tradeRupee swung between gains and losses. The government attempts to stem the fall in the rupee and keep current account deficit in check have not helped so far. The government on Wednesday raised import duty on a range of items including air-conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, footwear, jewellery, furniture fittings and tableware besides imposing it on aviation turbine fuel to try and boost the health of the rupee and keep CAD within the target range. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 4 paise higher at 72.57.


Midcaps, smallcaps bledBSE Midcap and Smallcap indices cracked 2.19 per cent and 1.97 per cent, respectively. Edelweiss Financial Services (down 10.35 per cent), Reliance Capital (down 7.94 per cent), PNB Housing Finance (down 7.29 per cent), IIFL Holdings (down 7.05 per cent), Max Financial Services (down 6.37 per cent) and Voltas (down 6.28 per cent) were the top losers in the Midcap index. In the BSE Smallcap index, Adlabs Entertainment (down 20 per cent), SREI Infrastructure Finance (down 17 per cent), OM Metals Infraprojects (down 10.80 per cent), Thangamayil Jewellery (down 10.68 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (down 10.36 per cent) and GOCL Corporation (down 9.25 per cent) led the losers.


YES Bank slipped furtherShares of YES Bank plunged 9.14 per cent to close at Rs 203.20 on BSE. The stock has been under pressure of late amid uncertainty over its next CEO after RBI has cut short Rana Kapoor's tenure to January 31, 2019. The bank’s board has requested RBI for a extension for Kapoor and formed a five-member panel to find a successor to the founder CEO. The scrip had gained 1.84 per cent on Wednesday after four consecutive sessions of drubbings.

This comes as the company has backed the push towards data localisation in India, and is competing with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the space in the country. 

Alibaba had launched its first data centre in India in January this year. 

Alibaba said an availability zone is a physical area with independent power grids, and each one is made up of one or more data centres. The new zone will ""offer product lines such as elastic computing, storage, database, network, application services and big data analytics to support the requirements of local governments and enterprises,"" the company said in a statement. .

It said the dual availability zones will further enhance the level of security of Alibaba Cloud’s data centers in India. 

Alibaba's focus with its cloud business in India is to meet the demand for cloud computing services among the growing small and medium size businesses.

111,2018-09-30,PowerGrid,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday energy is essential for financial development and its paucity does not let any nation come out of poverty.

Claiming that the day is not far when India will overtake Britain's economy, he said while 13 crore families received gas connections in the country in 60 years, his government gave connections to 10 crore families in the last four years.

Modi was addressing a gathering after inaugurating the Mundra LNG Terminal, Anjar-Mundra and the Palanpur-Pali-Barmer gas transmission projects at Anjar in Kutch district of Gujarat.

""Energy is essential for development. Paucity of energy does not let any nation come out of poverty. If one needs freedom from poverty, wants financial development and a self-sufficient country, energy is necessary. Without it, even a mobile phone cannot be charged,"" he said.

Modi said several prime ministers and chief ministers came and went, but he was fortunate to get the opportunity to inaugurate the third LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal.

""Gujarat is the gateway and hub for LNG and the epicentre of energy. As the third LNG terminal is dedicated to the country, all of them will fulfil their responsibility of sending energy to the east coast,"" he said.

He said there was a time when people were happy with 'kachcha' roads, but now people want modern development.

Now, people want railway, highway, i-way, gas grid, water grid, power grid, optical fibre network. In a way people want modern infrastructure, he said.

""In 60 years, 13 crore families received gas connections in the country. In four years (since coming to power), we gave connections to 10 crore families,"" Modi said.

The prime minister said his government's aim is that in the coming days no family would have to cook on wood.

""The day is not far, when the country's economy will overtake Britain's economy,"" he added."

3,2018-10-08,PowerGrid,"The power sector is showing signs of recovery after a few years of poor performance due to excessive supply, low prices on power exchanges, slow policy implementation and lack of power purchase agreements (PPAs). 

In the last two years, the BSE Utility index has underperformed the Sensex by over 1.8 times and over 61% of constituent stocks of the BSE Utilities index have delivered negative returns. The current recovery is led by a widening demand and supply gap. Power demand peaked to nearly 10GW this year but with no new capacity addition, supply has lagged. 

Moreover, power consumption is rising in states like UP, MP and Bihar and that is likely to improve the sector’s plant load factor (PLF). PLF is the ratio between the actual energy generated by a plant and its maximum possible generation capacity. A supply glut and lack of demand from industrial consumers over the last few years had created a demand-supply mismatch. This resulted in stranded capacities and falling PLFs in the thermal power sector. 

With improvement in demand, the PLFs are expected to rise. Rising PLFs will boost prices at the power exchange and will be positive for long-term PPAs. Although the share of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are also rising, the demand cannot be met without the support of conventional energy sources. 

On the policy front, thanks to the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), the financial health of state electricity distribution companies (discoms) have improved over the last couple of years. The scheme has helped discoms pare down losses to Rs 19,000 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 51,600 crore in 2015-16. On the other hand, supply of coal to the power sector is improving and is evident from the rising inventory of power plants. Availability of coal will take care of fuel related challenges and will provide a boost to the power sector. 

Brokerage houses like SBICap, Reliance Securities and Emkay are positive on the sector as past underperformance has made valuations attractive. Most companies in the sector have witnessed a modest cut in their 2018-19/2019-20 financial estimates, despite considerable correction in share prices. 


Sector finding favour with analysts

The Indian markets are turning volatile due to a host of macroeconomic factors like oil prices, weak currency and worsening government finances. Power sector stocks could prove good defensive picks as macro concerns have minimal impact on the sector. Twenty two of the 32 companies on the BSE Utility index are covered by Bloomberg analysts. There are a total of 344 recommendations on these 22 stocks. Of these, 237 (68.9%) are buy, 61 (17.7%) are hold and 46 (13.4%) are sell recommendations. 

Let us look at the five stocks that have decent buy recommendations and substantial one year growth potential


Tata PowerThis company’s core business is generating, transmitting and distributing power. Ashika Stock Broking is bullish on the stock because of the company’s focus on enhancing its portfolio of non-fossil fuel based power and efforts to reduce debt. The company has undertaken steps to revive its troubled 4,000 MW Mundra plant, which will improve its fundamentals going forward. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the stock price may gain 34% over the next year 


CESC
This power utility company is engaged in the generation and distribution of electricity. Emkay is bullish on CESC due to its attractive valuations. The brokerage house expects the pending demerger process to be value accretive and unlock value for the company’s business verticals. In addition, impending turnaround in Spencer Retail, a CESC subsidiary, will provide further growth trigger. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the stock price may grow by 31% over the next one year period.


NHPC
A government enterprise with Mini Ratna status, it is engaged in electricity generation using hydroelectric plants. According to a report by Motilal Oswal, lower under recoveries and capital cost approvals are likely to boost earnings in future. In addition, the company has low regulatory risk with high growth potential due to the large untapped water energy potential in India. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the stock price may gain by 28% over the next one year.


Power Grid CorporationThe Navaratna PSU is engaged in power transmission with responsibility of planning, implementation, operation and maintenance of the Inter-State Transmission System. According to a report by Reliance Securities, Power Grid is least exposed to operational risks and offers a safe bet in the high growth power transmission sector. The company’s earnings are likely to grow by 20% CAGR over the next two years, aided by higher capitalization, huge capex pipeline, steady regulated RoE and healthy order book.


NTPC
This PSU with Maharatna status is engaged in electricity generation and allied activities. SBICap Securities is bullish on the stock as it believes the company has enough levers to defend its RoE and it remains best placed to address issues of PPA and fuel unavailability. The brokerage house expects the company’s strong capacity addition pipeline to drive growth in profitability over the next two years. According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, the stock has a potential to grow 13% over the next year."

Bajaj Finance| Buy| Target price: Rs 2,420| Stop loss: Rs 2,180
This stock formed a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is quite a positive signal for the short term. “Momentum indicators have also showed a buy crossover. We recommend buying this stock for a target of Rs 2,420 with a stop loss at Rs 2,180,” Thakkar said.


IRB Infrastructure Developers| Buy| Target price: Rs 146| Stop loss: Rs 128
This stock seems to have completed a clear Five Waves falling structure and has formed a positive weekly close, which is quite positive for short-term trend. “The stock has good support at the lower end at Rs 128.

Cummins India| Buy| Target price: Rs 727| Stop loss: Rs 657
This counter appears to have made a short-term bottom around Rs 642 level ahead of the market and formed a Bullish Engulfing pattern on the weekly charts, perhaps pointing towards the beginning of a short-term uptrend. Sustaining above Thursday’s low of Rs 661, the stock is expected to retrace at least 50 per cent of its last leg of fall from the high of Rs 800 and test its 200-day moving average. Therefore, it looks like a good opportunity for positional traders to buy it for an initial target of Rs 727, with a stop of Rs 657.


ITC| Buy| Target price: Rs 297| Stop loss: Rs 260
Recent correction almost pushed this stock back to where it had started a decent upward move in the recent past from the lows of Rs 259 – 322 levels. This proves a better entry point once again. Friday’s strong rally accompanied by a Hammer formation on the weekly chart is pointing towards the beginning of a short-term uptrend. Hence, sustaining above the recent lows if the pullback materialises in the broader market, then this counter shall retrace at least 62 per cent of its entire fall from the recent high of Rs 322. Positional traders should buy the stock for a target of Rs 297 with a stop at Rs 260.


State Bank of India| Buy| Target price: Rs 290| Stop loss: Rs 257
This counter appears to have bottomed out around Rs 253 on September 21 itself, and for last couple of sessions, it was consolidating around Rs 260 level. Hence, positional traders are advised to make use of this consolidation as on any pullback attempt, it can initially target Rs 280 level and thereafter rally towards Rs 290 level. The stop loss for this trade should be at Rs 257.


Gajendra Prabhu, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities

ICICI Bank| Buy| Target price: Rs 350| Stop loss: Rs 300
This stock has validated the Doji candle pattern formed on the weekly chart in the previous week (moved above candle’s high), thus confirming a bullish reversal. It has witnessed a trendline breakout, which is a bullish development. The price is on course to make higher highs and could possibly make a new lifetime high, as the stock is in the internals of Wave V. In addition, the stock is placed well above the 21, 50 & 200-day EMAs, which can add strength to the bulls. “Traders may look to buy the stock at current market price and add on dips till Rs 310 for an upside target of Rs 350 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 300 on a closing basis,” Prabhu said.


PowerGrid| Buy| Target price: Rs 205| Stop loss: Rs 180
The stock has completed a major Three Wave decline from Rs 205 to Rs 182, which is a major “Wave B”, and now it is in the process of “Wave C” upward, which could ideally make a new higher high above the previous swing high of Rs 205. The stock is rebounding from 75 per cent retracement of last rising leg started from Rs 174 to Rs 205. In addition, the stock has formed a hammer candle on the weekly chart, which is a bullish reversal formation. “Traders may look to buy the stock at current market price for an upside target of Rs 205 over the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 180 on a closing basis,” Prabhu said.


Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Mahindra & Mahindra| Buy| Target price: Rs 840| Stop loss: Rs 715
This stock has seen a steep correction in last one month from the peak of Rs 976 to show signs of bottoming out at Rs 715-720 levels. Currently, it is making a positive bullish candle formation to signify strength. It has the potential to trigger further upside movement in the coming days. The RSI has also entered the highly oversold zone and shown a trend reversal to give a buy signal. “With consistent volume activity seen on the counter, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 840, keeping a stop loss of Rs 715,” said Parekh.


Voltas| Buy| Target price: Rs 560| Stop loss: Rs 480
This stock has witnessed a decent correction from Rs 636 to bottom out at around Rs 475 and has seen a bounce to signify upside movement with strength.

9,2018-10-18,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Despite the massive government push towards electric mobility, e-car sales plunged 40 per cent to a low of 1,200 units in FY18 over FY17, while e-two-wheeler sales zoomed 138 per cent to 54,800 unit during the same period, says an industry report. 

As of March 2018, there were 56,000 electric vehicles on the roads in the country, of which e-cars were a paltry 1,200 units, while the rest 54,800 units are two-wheelers, according to the data from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles, the apex industry lobby for the e-vehicles industry. 

In FY16, 20,000 electric two-wheelers were sold in the country, which increased to Rs 23,000 units in FY17, according to the data. In the same year, 2,000 e-cars were sold and remained stagnant in FY17. 

In FY16 there were only 22,000 electric vehicles on the roads, which rose to 25,000 in FY17 and to 54,800 units in FY18 and rose to 56,000 in FY18, show the data. 

According to Sohinder Gill, director corporate affairs at the society, the rising numbers indicate that people are accepting e-vehicles as an economical as well as a cleaner mode of transportation. 

""Most manufacturers have started using lithium-ion batteries, which has increased the performance of e-two wheelers and has helped in gaining consumer confidence. But the absence of adequate finance mechanism, price gap between an e-two-wheelers and petrol variants, awareness among citizens are challenges which need immediate redressal,"" Gill said. 

He blamed the dip in sales of e-cars to the ""lack of infrastructure, ambiguity over policy, which still remain the major deterrents for growth."" 

But he sounded confident about the volumes picking up this year saying this year also looks positive especially for the electric two-wheeler segment and we anticipate the sector to perform better than last year. 

It can be noted that the Centre is pushing electric mobility under Energy Efficiency Services, which had ordered 10,000 e-cars. The first phase of delivery of 500 units has been completed by Tata Motors and Mahindra. But the government organisations which picked them up are said to be unhappy with their performance due to low durability of the batteries. 

The EESL is an energy service company set up by the Centre and is the world's largest such PSU. Fully owned by the government owned, it is a joint venture of state-owned NTPC, Power Finance Corporation, REC and PowerGrid."

""Market will inch further lower and banking and financials could lead the decline. Any decline below 10,100 in the Nifty would trigger a fresh fall,"" said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking. 

The Sensex plunged 181 points, or 0.53 per cent, to end the day at 34,134.38, with 10 stocks in the green and 21 (with Tata Motors DVR) in the red. The Nifty came off 58 points, or 0.57 per cent, finishing at 10,245.25, with 16 stocks advancing and 33 declining. One stock remained unchanged.

10,2018-10-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Snapping a losing streak of two consecutive sessions, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty saw a positive opening on Monday after its Asian peers rebounded amid geopolitical concerns around Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brexit.

A fresh spell of buying in select bank and financial stocks lifted the market. But IT, auto, metal and telecom heavyweights remained subdued.

The outlook for the broader market remains uncertain, but analysts see stock-specific opportunities across sectors. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are top 12 stocks that are expected to log gains over the next three weeks. 


Aditya Agarwala, Technical Research Analyst, YES Securities (India)

Gujarat Fluorochemicals| Buy| Target price: Rs 935-980| Stop loss: Rs 860
On the weekly chart, Gujarat Fluorochemicals has broken out of a triangle pattern neckline placed at Rs 886, triggering resumption of a bullish trend. Moreover, a sustained trade above Rs 892 with healthy volumes can take the stock higher to Rs 935-980 levels. The RSI has turned upwards after taking support at the lower end of the bullish zone i.e. 47 level and has formed a positive reversal, suggesting bullishness on the counter. “The stock can be bought in the Rs 892-896 range for targets of Rs 935-980, keeping a stop loss below Rs 860,” Agarwala said.


NIIT Technologies| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,300-1,360| Stop loss: Rs 1,200
On the weekly chart, NIIT Technologies has taken support at the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level and turned upwards suggesting bullishness. On the daily chart, it has broken out of a channel pattern indicating higher levels in the coming trading sessions. The RSI has turned upwards after forming a positive divergence suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions. “The stock can be sold in the Rs 1,235-1,240 range for targets of Rs 1,300-1,360, keeping a stop loss below Rs 1,200,” Agarwala said.


Anand James, chief market strategist, Geojit Financial Services


Federal Bank | Buy| Target price: Rs 89-93 | Stop loss: Rs 75
Having fallen over 47 per cent from record peak seen 12 months back, this stock is back into the primary uptrend after having turned from the 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement. Ideally Rs 89, the 200 DMA, level can be set as the target with a stop loss placed below Rs 75.


Bank of Baroda| Buy | Target price: Rs 107| Stop loss: Rs 97
The selling spree is showing several signs of losing steam, and a reversal attempt is in play supported by positive oscillators. “Ideally, this should stretch beyond Rs 115, but a limited upside view with Rs 107 as an objective looks better with a stop loss placed below Rs 97,” James said.


Vaishali Parekh, senior technical analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Jubilant Foodworks| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,430| Stop loss: Rs 1,150
The stock has bottomed out at around Rs 1,080 level after the decent correction and has bounced back currently to just move past the significant 200-DMA, indicating a positive bias and has strength and potential to carry on the momentum still further upside. ""The RSI has recently indicated a trend reversal and has signalled a buy and with good volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 1,430, keeping a stop loss at Rs 1,150,” Parekh said.


Hindustan Unilever| Buy| Target price: Rs 1,720| Stop loss: Rs 1,480
This stock has taken support near the significant 200DMA moving average which lies near Rs 1,515 level and has witnessed a bounce back to indicate strength and the revival is anticipated to continue still further upside. “The chart looks attractive and with the indicators looking favourable and with good consistent volume activity witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 1,720, keeping a stop loss at Rs 1,480,” Parekh said.


Mazhar Mohammad, chief strategist for technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in 

Power Grid Corporation of India| Buy| Target price: Rs 203 | Stop loss: Rs 185
This counter is displaying a lot of strength as it registered two positive closes when the entire market was under fire in last two sessions. Besides, its closing price is almost flat around Rs 188 in last three weeks on the weekly chart. This is clearly pointing out that bulls are reluctant to give up their bets on this counter for reasons best known to them. Hence, on a pull back its initial targets can be Rs 203. “Positional traders should buy into this counter with a stop below Rs 185 on closing basis,” Mohammad said.


Bharti Airtel | Buy| Target price: Rs 325 | Stop loss: Rs 279
Bharti’s chart is looking quite interesting as it is moving almost flat in a narrow range of 295 – 282 levels for last seven sessions, that too, after a vertical fall from the highs of Rs 397 for last five weeks. This kind of price behaviour may be suggesting that selling might have dried up and hence a relief can be expected as long as this counter sustains above Rs 282. “Positional traders should buy into this counter for a target of Rs 325 with a stop below Rs 279 on closing basis,” Mohammad said.


Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities

Adani Enterprises | Buy | Target price: Rs 188 | Stop loss: Rs 154
After witnessing a sharp weakness in the month of September 2018, the stock price has shifted into a smart upside bounce in the last couple of weeks. A decent bounce in last few sessions is indicating a near-term bottom reversal for the stock price. The weekly 14-period RSI is showing a positive indication, which is suggesting a continuation of upside momentum for near term. Volume rose in the last two weeks, in line with the upmove in the stock price. “One may look to buy Adani Enterprises at current market price (Rs 168.55), look to add more on dips down to Rs 159, hold for the upside target of Rs 188 over the next 2-3 weeks, with a stop loss at Rs 154,” Shetti said.


Hindustan Zinc| Buy| Target price: Rs 315| Stop loss: Rs 265
The downtrend in this metal stock seems to have completed. After showing a bullish hammer type candlestick pattern in the previous week, the stock price has witnessed a sharp upside bounce in last week. This pattern is signalling an upside reversal in the stock price. We also observe a formation of higher bottom formation at Rs 265, compared with the last bottom of July 2018. Volume and momentum oscillators are showing positive indications for the stock price ahead. “Buying can be initiated at current market price (Rs 285), add more on dips down to Rs 272, for the upside target of Rs 315 for the next 2-3 weeks. Place a stop loss at Rs 265,” Shetti said.


Jay Thakkar, CMT – head technical and derivatives research: AVP equity research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries| Buy| Target price: Rs 640| Stop loss: Rs 590
This stock has closed in the positive territory in the last trading week and with that, a reversal from downside is quite likely. A minimum retracement level comes to Rs 640. The stock has also reversed well from the lower end of the falling channel. ""We recommend buying this stock with a target price of Rs 640 and a stop loss of Rs 590,” Thakkar said. 


Wipro| Buy| Target price: Rs 340| Stop loss: Rs 313
The stock seems to have formed a Wave 4 on the daily charts and Wave 5 up seems to have started. The stock has also provided a breakout from the falling channel and it has managed to close above it which is also a positive sign. The hourly momentum indicator has come into buy mode with a positive divergence."
16,2018-10-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: A sharp selloff in global stocks, sustained capital outflows amid rupee's precarious health and rising clout of the US dollar kept the bulls at bay on Tuesday.

Indian market extended its fall to the fourth consecutive session, mirroring the weakness in global stocks. A mix of negative leads such as Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation, worries about Italian budget, the Brexit uncertainties and global trade concerns proved to be a dangerous cocktail.

In Asia, Hang Seng plunged 3 per cent while Shanghai Composite, Nikkei and Taiwan indices suffered losses of over 2 per cent each. 

Back home, the benchmark Sensex settled down 287 points, or 0.84 per cent, at 33,847, with 16 stocks declining and 15 advancing.

The NSE Nifty ended with a loss of 98 points, or 0.96 per cent, at 10,146.80. A total of 22 stocks were in the green and 28 in the red.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell by 0.89 per cent and 1.21 per cent, respectively.


Let's take a look at highlights of Tuesday's session.

TVS reports flat growthTVS Motor Company today reported a flat growth in profit at Rs 211.31 crore for the quarter to September. The two-wheeler firm had posted a profit of Rs 213.16 crore in the same quarter last year. Analysts in an ETNow poll had estimated the profit figure at Rs 210 crore. Revenue from operations jumped 22.85 per cent to Rs 4,993.47 crore in Q2 FY19 over Rs 4,064.72 crore in Q2 FY18. The stock closed 3.75 per cent up at Rs 536.05 today. 


NPA pain for Bajaj FinanceGross NPAs of Bajaj Finance for the September quarter rose to 1.49 per cent from 1.39 per cent in the June quarter while loan losses and provisions rose to Rs 315 crore against Rs 221 crore in the year-ago period, the company said in a BSE filing. However, consolidated profit jumped 54 per cent year-on-year to Rs 923 crore for the second quarter. The scrip closed 1.63 per cent down at Rs 2,083.95. 


Global stocks roll downGlobal markets hurtled towards their lowest level in a year today. Following a share decline on Wall Street, heavy selloff emerged in Asian markets which took European markets under its ambit. Emerging market stocks and currencies took a beating on Tuesday as concerns over Italy's budget, Brexit talks and Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's killing kept investors' appetite for risk in the doldrums, Reuters reported. 


Rupee in a tight spotThe rupee lost vigour today, which made market players nervous. The domestic unit swung between gains and losses throughout the day. After falling by 27 paise to 73.83, it turned flat, only to resume on a downward trajectory. A slight fall in crude oil after Saudi Arabia's assurance of playing a ""responsible role"" in energy markets brought a some respite to the domestic unit. 


Who dragged my Sensex down?IT, pharma, energy, bank and FMCG stocks were the top casualties of Tuesday's selloff. Infosys, TCS, Sun Pharma, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, SBI, HUL and ITC emerged as the top drag on Sensex, in that order. Sun Pharma and Asian Paints were the top percentage losers, falling up to 5.21 per cent. Wipro, TCS and Infosys declined over 3 per cent. By contrast, IndusInd Bank, PowerGrid and HDFC climbed up to 2 per cent in the Sensex heatmap.

On the other hand, Veerhealth Care (up 18 per cent), AYM Syntex (17.72 per cent), CNI Research (15.42 per cent) and Kavit Industries (12.62 per cent) stood up to market sentiment and won the day. 


Sectoral losersIT (down 2.79 per cent), technology (down 2.48 per cent) and healthcare (down 2.34 per cent) stood as the top three sectoral losers on BSE. Barring power and realty, all sectoral indices suffered losses today. Gains in shares of PowerGrid, Suzlon, NTPC, BHEL, Oberoi Realty, Godrej Properties and DLF kept the power and realty indices in the green. 


Over 300 stocks at 52-week lowsAs many as 316 stocks, including Infibeam Avenues, Indian Bank, India Cements, IL&FS Transportation Networks, IIFL Holdings, DHFL, GIC Housing Finance, Dish TV, Dilip Buildcon, DB Corp, CRISIL, Container Corporation of India (Concor), CG Power and Industrial Solutions, Canara Bank, Blue Star, Bharat Forge, Bajaj Corp, Grasim Industries, Dalmia Bharat and Asahi India Glass hit 52-week lows on the BSE today.

The NSE Nifty opened in the negative zone on Tuesday and slipped below the previous swing low of 10,138 by correcting towards the 10,100 level. However, it recovered from the day’s low and formed a Doji candle after the decline of last three sessions.

The index has corrected by around 600 points from the swing high of 10,710 to 10,102 zones. Nifty may remain under pressure in the short term, but if it manages to cross and hold above the 10,200 level, then a bounce could be seen towards 10,250 and then 10,333. However, a hold below 10,138 could open the further decline towards 10,000-9,952 zone.

On the option front, maximum Put OI stood at 10,000 followed by 10,100 strike, while meaningful Call OI congestion is at 10,500 followed by 10,400 strikes. We have seen Call writing at 10,200 followed by 10,300 strike, while Put unwinding is seen at all immediate strike prices. Option band signifies an immediate trading range between 10,000 and 10,350 levels.

India VIX fell down sharply by 10.87 per cent to 19.03. During the session the volatility index made a high of 22.35, but cooled off even as the market remained weak. This hints towards an early sign of consolidation in the market. However, VIX has to go down below 17-16 levels to rescue the bulls after the sharp cut of the last two months.

Bank Nifty index opened negative, but managed to hold its opening lows and recovered by around 200-250 points from the lower levels. it closed negative but formed a small bullish candle, as it closed higher than the opening levels. Bank Nifty has remained resilient for the most part of the month, as Nifty traded down by 7 per cent, while Bank Nifty is almost flattish on a month-on-month basis.

Now, the index has to hold above the 25,000 level to witness a bounce towards 25,250 and then 25,500, while supports seen at 24,750 and 24,650 levels.

Nifty futures closed at 10,182 with a loss of 0.49%. Longs were seen in Indiabulls Housing Finance, TVS Motor, HDFC and Max Financial Services while shorts were seen in KSCL, Power Grid, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, ONGC, Ambuja Cement, KPIT and Ceat.

14,2018-10-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The bears seem to have gained an upper hand on Dalal Street. A sharp drop in the Nifty50 over the past three days has pushed the index below the 10,250 mark, making traders wonder whether it is headed for sub-10,000 level. 

But technical charts are giving mixed signals across counters. At Monday’s close, momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, reflected weak bias on as many as 46 counters on NSE, signalling a major downturn in these stocks.

The charts also showed some 19 stocks were poised for a rally. 

These counters have also been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, adding further credibility to the emerging trend.

Among the stocks that looked weak were largely NBFCs, small banks and companies from the construction, infrastructure and real estate sectors. 

They include NCC, Indiabulls Real Estate, RBL Bank, HDFC, Bharat Financial, AU Small Financial, Ambuja Cements, MEP Infrastructure and Heidelberg Cement, among others. 

Sugar stocks Bajaj Hindustan and Dhampur Sugars, healthcare stocks Marksan Pharma and Dr Lal Pathlabs and consumer stocks Bata India, Kansai Nerolac and Manpasand Beverages too looked weak on the technical charts. 



The MACD is known for signalling trend reversal in a traded security or index.

MACD is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Nineteen stocks, including IOC, Biocon, Power Grid, Allcargo Logistics, DCM Shriram and Ajanta Pharma, showed bullish crossover on the daily charts.

Coffee Day Enterprises, Va Tech Wabag, Tube Investments, V Mart Retail and Birla Corporation were among the stocks that looked firm . 


Agencies
MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation and it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ call using a single valuation ratio.

Market veterans say traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic along with MACD to confirm an emerging trend and take an investment call.

On Monday, the Nifty50 faced resistance at the 10,400 level, but managed to respect its resistance in the 10,180-10,250 region. 

“In terms of wave structure, the pullback that started from the 10,138 level is subdividing into lower degree waves. At present, Nifty is in Wave B of the pullback, and Wave C i.e the next leg of the pullback, is expected on the upside. Hence, it is expected to head towards 10,760-10,800 before breaching the recent low of 10,138,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan said . 


Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of Indiabulls Real Estate shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock tended to show an downward momentum and vice versa.

On Monday, the stock fell 1.86 per cent to Rs 74 on NSE."

What made market sentiment dull?

1. 
Rout in global equities
Global stock markets were firmly on track for their worst month since the financial crisis. Japan's Nikkei closed at it lowest in nearly seven months on Thursday while the broader Topix hit a fresh one-year low, dropping 3.1 per cent to 1,600.92. A rout in technology stocks on Wall Street in overnight trade triggered the global market selloff.

2. 
Uninspiring earnings
Indian companies are on course to miss their earnings target yet again. Out of the 51 companies on the BSE 500 index that have come out with their second quarter results so far, profits of 28 have missed analysts’ expectations, stoking worries about further delay in the much-awaited earnings recovery and sharp cuts in forecasts, ET reported.

This kept investors on edge as they were eyeing earnings revival to lift the domestic stock market.

3. 
F&O expiry
Volatility rose during the day as investors squared off their positions amid the expiry of October futures and options contracts. 

4. 
Rupee weakness
The rupee was trading lower on Thursday amid selling of currency by banks and importers. The domestic unit was 10 paise lower at 73.25 against the greenback.



What experts are saying:

""After a day of upmove, the selling pressure resumed on Dalal Street as the Indian equity benchmark indices ended the derivative monthly expiry session sharply lower by 1 per cent at 10,125, led by negative Asian cues and muted domestic sentiment. We maintain our cautious view on the Indian markets in the near term. While there could be some intermediate bounces, selling pressure could resume at higher levels. Movement of crude oil prices, currency and global developments would be closely monitored in the coming sessions. Domestically, the corporate earnings season so far has not been encouraging. With more results likely to be announced over the next two weeks, stock-specific volatility would continue to remain high. We advise traders and investors to remain selective in stock picking.""

""Headwinds from global market and expiry-led volatility dragged the market to negative terrain. However, market tried to gain some support from the lower levels led by benign oil price and yield. The results season is gaining pace whereas the deviations in earnings as compared to consensus is influencing investors’ sentiment."""
21,2018-10-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: A wave of selling pressure, triggered by depressed global cues amid worries over earnings and economic growth, hit local stocks real hard today.

Geopolitical uncertainty around the US and Saudi Arabia, a falling rupee, the F&O rollover and sustained FII outflow all ganged up to pin the market down, a day after it scored healthy gains.

The Sensex plunged 344 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 33,690 while the Nifty went down 100 points, or 0.98 per cent, to 10,124.90 today.

Midcaps and smallcaps too buckled under pressure, falling up to 0.98 per cent. 

Let's get today's market ground report.


Who moved my Sensex?As many as 23 stocks fell in the Sensex kitty of stocks. Among the losers, Bharti Airtel was in the lead, with a loss of 6.60 per cent. It was followed by Vedanta, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, YES Bank and HDFC. Wipro, on the other hand, jumped 3.30 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex gainers. Other than that, only Coal India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, PowerGrid, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto and Tata Consultancy Services could manage to settle in the green.


Rupee gives up The domestic unit settled 12 paise lower at 73.27 against the dollar today. Traders said increased demand for the US currency from importers and a lower opening of the domestic equity market weighed on the local unit. Despite steps taken by the government and the RBI, the rupee's slide remains unabated, posing a threat to India's macroeconomic mathematics. 


Global markets mixedA sell-off in the US stocks sparked panic in Asian markets and most of them suffered heavy losses. However, they managed to limited their losses as investors looked forward to corporate earnings. The Shanghai Composite closed the day flat. European stocks turned green ahead of a rate decision by the European Central Bank.


Maruti on a bumpy roadIndia's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India on Thursday reported a 9.8 per cent fall in net profit for the quarter to September. Operating profit stood at Rs 2,710.1 crore, down 9.5 per cent over the same period last year, on account of increase in commodity prices, adverse foreign exchange movement and higher sales promotion expenses partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Shares of the company closed at Rs 6,724.70, down 0.65 per cent on the BSE today.

Top gainers & losers of the dayInfibeam Avenues (down 18.01 per cent), Dish TV India (down 17.17 per cent), MCX (down 14.17 per cent), Linde India (down 9.72 per cent) and Jubilant FoodWorks (down 9.71 per cent) stood as the top five BSE losers today.

On the downside, Nifty looks poised to test its crucial support in the 10,000-9,952 zone with the possibility of breaching it and heading lower,” said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst at Sharekhan."
23,2018-10-30,PowerGrid,"Power Grid, a top defensive bet in the power sector, has been losing out to NTPC, another state behemoth, over the past few months.

Investors have trimmed their positions in the transmission company recently and moved to power generator NTPC as earnings growth at the former could drop significantly with reduction in government capex. But the latter’s profit should expand in double digits.

In the past two quarters, mutual fund holdings in Power Grid have fallen to 7.3 per cent from 9.3 per cent while in NTPC, they are up from 8.7 per cent to 10.2 per cent.

NTPC’s less leveraged balance sheet is giving more comfort to investors who believe the company is best positioned to acquire some of the distressed assets in the sector. NTPC’s net debt to equity is 1.1 and analysts believe the company can take about Rs 50,000 crore of additional debt.

With increasing leverage, NTPC’s return on equity should improve, thus helping the company with higher multiples. Currently, analysts expect NTPC’s net profit to jump 51% in the next three years (FY18-FY21), with 17% in the current fiscal. Earnings will be driven by project commissioning.

It has 20 GW under construction (around 45 per cent of the existing standalone capacity) and is expected to commission 5GW in each of the next four years. NTPC’s stock is trading at 1.2 times FY19 estimated book and 11
times the earnings.

In comparison to NTPC, Power Grid is relatively more levered at 2.2 times net debt to equity. Orders in the first half of FY19 were down 51 per cent year on year. With central elections approaching, government capex is expected to remain low. Analysts expect future capex to stabilise.

Furthermore, Power Grid is more focussed on capitalizing the existing capital work in progress. This will cause earnings growth to fall to around 5 per cent from 20 per cent odd after FY19, say analysts.

Given these reasons, NTPC’s stock has outperformed Power Grid’s by 2 per cent in the last six months. This gap is expected to widen as more investors prefer NTPC to Power Grid."

What made markets stumble?


1. Weak technical outlook: Technical experts expect 10,290 level to be the immediate resistance for the Nifty50 in the near future. They were expecting weakness to resume if the index fails to break above the said level. On Tuesday, the index hit a high of 10,285, giving the bulls a chance to regain ground. 


2. Europe a drag: Even as reports suggesting Chinese regulators pledging support to boost liquidity in mainland stock market helped Asian markets recoup losses by the end, trading in European shares was fairly tepid, which weighed on the domestic market. Earlier, US stocks had settled lower in overnight trade on intensifying Sino-US trade fight. 

3. Heavy selling in RIL, private lenders: Owing to heavy selling, Reliance Industries fell by around 3 per cent, or 30.90 points, at 1,056.9 points.


4. Unabated FPI selloff: The net FPI outflows has almost doubled to Rs 25,2579.89 crore, signalling risk aversion.

""Investors turned stock specific in the ongoing result season while maintaining a cautious view due to upcoming state elections.

ET Now, citing sources, today reported that the RBI Governor Urjit Patel might offer to resign if Section 7 of RBI Act is invoked to transfer reserves. 

Section 7 of the RBI Act empowers the government to consult and give instructions to the governor to act on certain issues that the government considers serious and in public interest.

The market had developed cold feet in early trade, on reports of an aggravating spat between the government and central bank. Media reports indicated RBI Governor Urjit Patel might resign if Section 7 of RBI Act is invoked to transfer reserves. 
However, the government, sensing the nervousness in the market, clarified that it respects RBI’s autonomy and recognises its essentiality in governance.

FMCG major Dabur India reported a 4.10 per cent rise in consolidated profit at Rs 377.55 crore for the second quarter, helped by growth of the core business in the domestic market. But the numbers failed to impress the market and the stock fell 2.41 per cent to Rs 385.40 on BSE.

Put writing was seen at strike price 10,200 followed by 10,300 while minor Call unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. 


Technical viewThe Nifty formed a large bullish bar at the end of the day. The hourly chart shows that the index today formed an inverted H&S pattern & broke out on the upside. The benchmark index also achieved the conservative pattern target on the upside. The larger picture shows that the volatility can continue going ahead & it can result into a wedge pattern formation. The recent bounce back seems to be a part of the unfolding pattern. Hence, the bounce is unlikely to develop into a larger structure on the upside. On the higher side, 10,440 shall be the key hurdle where the bears can look to come back. Overall, the Nifty is expected to test the crucial support zone of 10,000-9,952 in the short term, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

30,2018-10-31,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks overcame an early hiccup as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 2 per cent in a session that was marked by high volatility.

The 30-share BSE index signed off October with a gain of 551 points, or 1.63 per cent, at 34,442. The session was so choppy that the index saw a swing of as much as 876 points during the day. 

The NSE Nifty shut shop at 10,386.60, up 188 points, or 1.85 per cent. 

Both indices had moved into negative terrain early during the day, only to reverse losses after the government softened its stance amid its ongoing tussle with the RBI.

IT and financial stocks were the largest contributors to the index's rally.

In the 30-share BSE pack, HDFC, with gains of 5.51 per cent, was the best performer. It was followed by IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Axis Bank, YES Bank and Sun Pharma, which rose 3-4 per cent.

Coal India was the worst laggard. Tata Steel, Maruti, Adani Ports, Kotak Bank and Power Grid were among other losers.

In the Nifty sectoral indices, all indices barring Nifty Media ended the session in the positive terrain.

Let's see what all drove market optimism today.

1. Govt blinks, says RBI autonomy essential
The government on Wednesday toned down its approach, saying it respects the central bank’s autonomy as it sought to calm investors worried about a growing public brawl. This came as an assurance for the stocks and the rupee that were hit this morning when reports about a possible resignation by RBI Governor Urjit Patel surfaced.

2. Firmness in global stocks
Global stocks ended a tumultuous October on a positive note which in turn buoyed investor sentiment back home. October was a grim month for investors across the globe as worries over the Sino-US trade, global economic growth, higher US interest rates and company earnings kept investors on the edge.

""After a volatile start, the market sharply rebounded led by clarity over independence of RBI by the government. The rupee pared some losses while strong global cues and stock specific actions supported the market to remain positive. Signs of rising oil supply and gradual consolidation in yield may ease liquidity concerns. However, the focus will be more on the results outcome as there is a fear of further downgrade in earnings in H2FY19."""
29,2018-10-31,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Extending the losses to the second session, shares of Coal India suffered a loss of over 4 per cent in early trade on Wednesday post reports of stake divestment by the government in the state-run PSU. 

The government has decided to divest a 9 per cent stake in Coal India through a two-day offer for sale starting Wednesday, which is expected to fetch the Centre about Rs 14,000 crore at the floor price, including a greenshoe option. 

Of the total 9 per cent stake selling, the centre has decided to sell 3 per cent through an offer for sale with a greenshoe option and to sell another 6 per cent to financial institutions and retail investors at a floor price of Rs 266 per share, ET reported. 

At present centre holds 78.32 per cent in Coal India which is 3.32 per cent short of the 25 per cent mandatory public holding mark. This 3.32 per cent in the company needs to be divested by the government in order to comply. 

Shares of the company were trading at Rs 266.05 apiece, down 3.57 per cent around 9:50 am. The benchmark Sensex was flat at 33,890 at that time.

Coal India, along with Tata Steel, Adani Ports and PowerGrid featured among the top losers in the Sensex index. As many as 19 stocks were incurring losses in the Sensex kitty, compared with 12 gainers."
27,2018-10-31,PowerGrid,"The government is looking to execute at least two mergers among central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) in the power sector to step up the disinvestment process and meet its target.

It may kickstart the process with top power generation company NTPC taking over hydropower firm SJVN, a senior government official said.

“Some blue-chip CPSEs have shown interest in acquiring smaller CPSEs where they feel synergies exist,” the official told ET. “Also there are some CPSEs which can achieve efficiencies of scale if they combine their strengths.”

NTPC has already evinced interest in taking over SJVN, in which the government holds 63.79% stake, he said, adding that there could be a possible merger between power sector financing firms Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC Ltd. The government holds 65.64% in PFC and 57.99% in REC Ltd.

The government expects to raise around Rs 21,000 crore at existing market prices if these two deals work out in this financial year, the above quoted official said. The government has so far raised Rs 10,028 crore from disinvestment in the current fiscal against the target of Rs 80,000 crore.

The other firms where synergies are being explored include NHPC Ltd, North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd, and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.



“The administrative ministry and the respective CPSEs are doing their evaluation. We will also suggest some possibilities,” a finance ministry official told ET.

A senior executive with a state-run company, however, said NTPC may face some hurdles in its bid to acquire SJVN. “It may not be an easy route as the Himachal Pradesh government holds 26.85% in the firm,"" the person told ET.

The department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) on Tuesday floated expression of interest for engagement of advisors for merger & acquisition in the power sector. DIPAM said it looks to engage one adviser in the process of (up to) two M&A in the energy sector.

Some experts don’t agree with the government’s move to push disinvestment through PSU mergers. “If the government is looking to meet its deficit targets by forcing these firms to buy its stake in other companies, in the long run it may impact the profitability of these firms, which should be a larger concern,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Container Corporation of India.

Last year, ONGC bought the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, but HPCL is yet to recognise ONGC as its promoter and has only one member from ONGC on its board."
3,2018-11-19,PowerGrid,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."
4,2018-11-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Led by gains in index heavyweights Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, BSE benchmark Sensex staged a fag-end rally on Tuesday. The global market setup remained positive amid hopes of a resolution in US-China trade war.

The 30-share pack settled the day 186 points or 0.46 per cent higher at 40,470 while NSE Nifty ended just shy of the 11,950-mark, up 56 points or 0.47 per cent higher at 11,940.

On BSE, the advance-decline ratio continued to remain in favour of the bears, indicating underlying weakness in the market.

Broader market too remained weak, with both midcap and smallcap indices underperforming benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap shut shop 0.05 per cent lower while BSE Smallcap rose 0.30 per cent.

Shares of RIL scaled all-time high at Rs 1,514.95 with firm's market capitalisation crossing Rs 9.50 lakh crore mark.

On the other hand, shares of YES Bank tanked 2.66 per cent and was the top loser. Firm promoters Rana Kapoor, Morgan Credits and YES Capital sold remaining 0.8 per cent stake in the private lender. The promoter entities now hold a token 900 shares in the lender.

M&M, Tata Steel, TCS, Tata Motors and Vedanta were among other top index losers.

Among the main board stocks, shares of Vodafone Idea surged 35 per cent to Rs 6.02 on Tuesday after the firm said that it would hike tariffs from December onwards.

In the sectoral space, 11 of 19 BSE sectors ended in the green, with telecom leading the charge on the back of gains in Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel. BSE Telecom rose 8.52 per cent. It was followed by Energy that gained 2.38 per cent.

Metals and auto declined the most, shedding 0.94 per cent and 0.74 per cent, respectively.


Expert Take
“Market turned positive due to buoyancy from telecom stocks supported by tariff hike plans. Positive vibes also witnessed in PSU banks having exposure to distressed assets. Gains in Pharma, energy and infra stocks pushed markets higher while losses in Auto, metals and consumer stocks limited the gain. Fear of downgrade in FY20 earnings due to slow pace in consumption demand and industrial growth may consolidate the market in the near term,” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

1,2018-11-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government is well within its rights to waive penalty and interest on dues that telecom companies owe following the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), senior advocate Harish Salve said in a legal opinion to Bharti Airtel.

If the government is of the view that burdening the telcos with immediate recovery of arrears will result in impairing their operations and that a larger public interest will be served by revisiting the imposition of penalty and high interest rates, “there is nothing in the judgment of the Supreme Court that would prevent the government from acting appropriately”, Salve said in his legal opinion which has been annexed in an Airtel letter to communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, also marked to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

He said the government could also allow more time for payment of the principal amount of the shortfall.

Salve’s legal opinion on the SC order that backed the government stand on including non-core items of revenue while computing AGR, were cited by Bharti Airtel in the November 18 letter, a copy of which was also marked to principal secretary to the PM, PK Mishra, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba. Gauba is heading a panel of top officials set up to suggest ways to restore the sector’s health.

Salve added that Bharti Airtel would be “well advised” to approach the government to make out a case to revisit the imposition of penalty in the larger grounds of public interest.

Referring to the inclusion of components such as trade discounts, discounts on prepaid tariffs and forex fluctuations in the computation of AGR, Salve in his legal opinion said that in the past, the telecom tribunal headed by a retired judge had held that the demands of the government were “illegal”. He added that the tribunal examined 13 heads of income and held that most of them could not be included in AGR.

The legal opinion of retired Supreme Court judge, Justice AK Sikri, were also annexed in Airtel’s letter to the government.



Sikri backed Salve’s legal opinion and was cited in the letter as saying, “This would demonstrate that the dispute raised by the TSPs (telecom service providers) was not frivolous. It cannot be said that the view of the Supreme Court in this case is the only possible view or that the view of the tribunal is totally absurd. In my view, no case for penalty was made out.”

Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the telcos worst affected by the order, are expected to file review petitions this week. They have appealed to the government for relief.

Airtel faces licence fee, spectrum usage charge, interest and penalty dues of over Rs 41,000 crore and has sought a waiver of penalty and interest, which together contribute to almost 75% of its estimated liabilities.

Airtel also wants interest to be levied only from the date of the AGR judgment and a 16-year payment period for the dues after a moratorium of two years. It said if interest must be levied, it must be at rates of government securities plus a small spread, say 1%, to compensate the government for notional loss of interest. It has even proposed keeping SUC outside the ambit of the demands because it was not part of the SC order.

It said companies such as Power Grid Corporation of India, GAIL and RailTel, which possess telecom licences to offer internet and national long-distance services, should be treated at par with telcos. According to Airtel’s estimates, these non-telecom companies would be liable to pay the government close to Rs2.27 lakh crore in dues after the SC’s order.

The company said failure to provide relief would allow for a “possible bankruptcy” of licensee companies and the loss of millions of direct and indirect jobs. It also predicted there would be bad loans for Indian banks running into a few lakh crore rupees and a ripple effect on vendors, retailers, kirana shops and related services like advertising and transportation, which could again lead to the collapse of more companies."
0,2018-11-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is seeking legal opinion on the wider impact of the Supreme Court’s order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), including whether it is applicable on a larger group of non-telecom companies holding telecom licences, and if so, the process to be adopted to raise demands from them for its dues.

“We are taking a legal opinion on the order’s wider ambit… we will actively work on the matter as legally advised after the telcos’ issue is addressed,” an official said.

Lawyers say that several companies — including GAIL, Power Grid Corporation, Delhi Metro, RailTel, among others — that are non-telcos but hold telecom licences to provide a range of offering such as internet services, national and international long-distance services and VSAT services, could fall under the DoT’s wider licence fee ambit. This, after the Supreme Court, in its order, equated gross revenue — for arriving at AGR — with “total revenue of licensee company”. Further, the court held that revenue arising out of non-telecom activities, with certain exceptions, will have to be included in gross revenue.

The official added that clarity is needed since there is ambiguity on the wider impact of the judgment. “Some companies likely to have been impacted by the judgment might not even know that DoT may raise demands and issue notices,” he said.

A second official said the government is dealing with a peculiar situation where even public sector units with telecom licences could be staring at huge liabilities. “This could be a case of revenue going from one pocket of the government to another,” he said and added that individual companies were assessing the situation and would work with their administrative ministries to resolve this matter. One particular option would be to take cabinet exemptions for such cases.

The DoT last week issued notices to mobile companies and internet service providers (ISPs) to compute and pay the amount that they now owe the government on account of the Supreme Court verdict.



The apex court has mandated that the dues be paid up within three months of the October 24 order. Telcos are staring at licence fee, penalty and interest dues of nearly Rs 93,000 crore, as per DoT’s submissions to the apex court, but are seeking relief. Including spectrum usage charges, the dues go up to over Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

Industry estimates similar dues on non-telecom companies may amount to nearly ?2.28 lakh crore, if calculated since the time of getting their respective licences. These companies till now have been paying miniscule amounts as licence fee, if at all, to the DoT.

Government officials expect the non-telecom companies too to seek a clarification on the SC order’s ambit. The DoT has already ordered its nodal bodies to issue notices to ISPs, along with telcos and virtual network operators.

A senior official of association representing ISPs in India, warned that if the ambit of the judgment were to be widened, the impact could run into a much higher figure. “If it includes everyone, then there’s no end to who may be asked to pay and how much. Many of the licence holders under ISP category were not legally obliged to pay any licence fee before 2014, but now they may have to,” he added."

6,2018-11-21,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Central public sector undertakings (PSUs) will acquire more than two lakh hectares to set up 47,000 mw of green power units under a new plug-and-play model, aimed at accelerating solar capacity expansion by derisking projects from land acquisition and availability of transmission corridors as well as reduce tariffs by up to 20 paise per unit.

Under the new model, PSUs under the power and renewable energy ministries will acquire the land through fully-owned SPVs (special purpose vehicles). The land may be purchased outright or leased from state governments and private land owners. State governments too can take full ownership of SPVs in suitable cases.

Central utilities such as PowerGrid will set up the transmission infrastructure for these locations. This will result in a hassle-free staging arena — called ‘ultra-mega renewable energy power parks’ hosting aggregate capacity of 4,000 mw each — for promoters without having to worry about stumbling over land acquisition or transmission issues. The projects within a park will be given out on the basis of tariff-based bidding.




“Land acquisition and power evacuation are the two main risks for renewable energy projects. Where you have land, transmission may become an issue and vice-versa. The new model de-risks the projects and reduces financing cost for promoters. Naturally, the tariffs will come down,” power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said in response to a TOI query.

Renewable energy secretary Anand Kumar said making the state government a stakeholder will cushion projects from transience in land laws. “This is a transparent system, removes inefficiencies in the land acquisition eco-system and promises a stable administrative and fiscal outlook for projects,” he said, adding the PSUs can earn by taking part of tariff revenue as rent or can opt to sell out at a later stage.

Singh said the PSUs were in the process of forming SPVs, with promising outcomes in Gujarat and Rajasthan. “I spoke to the Rajasthan chief minister and he has agreed to offer more attractive terms for land. The state cabinet is expected to clear the proposal shortly. Gujarat too has offered land in Dholera,” he said. Kumar said SECI (formerly Solar Energy Corporation of India) will bid out the 4,000 mw Dholera project by December 31.

The model envisages individual projects of 2,000 mw within a park. But projects in multiples of 600 mw will also be allowed in multiple locations in cases where new transmission lines have to be laid. In cases where transmission links already exist, projects will be allowed in multiples of 250 mw. Floating solar projects too are covered under the model, wherein the minimum size could be be 50 mw."

14,2018-11-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Extending losses for the second straight session, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty slipped on Friday dragged mainly by IT and telecom stocks as investors exercised caution and avoided long positions amid mixed global cues.

Analyst said that fall in IT stocks amid reports of changes in US work visa requirements aimed at protecting American workers fuelled the overall weakness in the market. Also, concerns over delay in US –China trade deal and Fed minutes fueled negativity in global markets.

Analysts said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on developments around the US-China trade deal and India’s July-September GDP data due next week. The GDP data which is due on 29 November is likely to indicate whether the slowdown in the Indian economy has deepened. Analysts expect markets to remain rangebound in coming days and feel midcap stocks may see more traction.

Meanwhile, NTPC was among the top gainers on BSE gaining nearly 4 per cent in trade after Morgan Stanley upgraded the power major to ‘Overweight’ from ‘Equal-Weight’ with a target price of Rs 152.

Aiming at maximum possible use of clean and renewable energy within the zone, the Eastern Railway (ER) has set a rapid growth path for utilising solar energy from 30 million watts in 2018 to 300 million watts in 2020, ER spokesperson Nikhil Chakraborty said.

""At present, rooftop solar plants, commissioned by the Eastern Railway, generate 55 million watts and process is on to increase the capacity by another 245 million watts by 2020 to achieve the target for 'Mission 300 million watts solar plants' by 2020,"" he said.

Chakraborty said that achievement of the goal of generating 300 million units (30 megwatts) will accrue a saving of Rs 12 crore in revenue expenses per year at present rate of tariff.

Technical analyst- Inst. desk, Ashika stock broking
Where we are: Status quo continues at the Dalal street, as Nifty despite multiple attempts failed to stage a breakout of the sideways trading range. The level of 12000 remains a strong psychological resistance for the index. On the other hand, Nifty Bank remained buoyant and staged a relative outperformance in the week gone by while the IT index which was trading sideways also declined sharply in Friday’s trading session. Sectoral positioning still indi-cates market participants are not risk-averse at this point.


What is in store: On the weekly scale formation of the “Doji “candlesticks pattern for the last three weeks indicates indecision and absence of a directional trigger. The index failed to stage a breakout of its prevailing range i.e. 11800-12000. However, price after a reversal from its intermediate high now stays near the 61.80% Fibonacci ratio of the above range; thus, some respite may take place while for a directional trigger one must wait for any decisive sign of range breakout. The level of 11800/11700 remains a key support pivot in the short term. In the Nifty Bank index from the relative strength point of view and throwback to key breakout zone, the addition of a long position is advised on a dip up to the 30800 (Spot) level.

What traders can do: In general phase of indecision results in whipsaw trades thus we expect a rise in the volatility is likely. On the stock-specific front, we recommend the addition of longs in Maruti, Power Grid & L&T expecting upside of 6% & more with stop loss of 3% while follow-up correction in Tata Elxsi may take place."

22,2018-11-25,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The Committee of Secretaries (CoS) set up to suggest relief measures for the telecom sector has been ‘disbanded’, a top government official said, indicating that the two-year moratorium on spectrum payments is possibly all that the sector will get for now.

“They (telcos) have been given a two-year moratorium (from spectrum payment), they’ve got relief of Rs 42,000 crore,” the official said, adding that nothing more should be expected. When asked specifically if the CoS had been disbanded, the official said “yes”.

On whether a new inter-ministerial panel could be constituted to provide relief for the Rs 1.47 lakh crore adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues, the official said, “No, it is a SC-defined matter”.

This official also appeared to rule out any relief for non-telecom companies including staterun units such as Power Grid, Gail and RailTel that have been affected by the AGR order.

“...why didn’t they (non-telcos) fight (in court), who asked them not to do it? Elementary accounting procedure is that if there are pending dues, then contingent provision should have been kept in books of accounting. It is their statutory obligation,” he said.




COAI Still Hopeful
The government, on the recommendations of the CoS, last week cleared a two-year moratorium on payments for spectrum bought in auctions, a move aimed at providing cash flow relief to carriers such as Vodafone idea ( Rs23,920 crore) and Bharti Airtel (Rs 11,746 crore).

But the government didn’t reduce the 8% AGR that the telcos pay as licence fees, as was widely expected. Neither did the panel nor the government provide any relief on the AGR-based dues that mobile phone companies face after a recent Supreme Court order. Carriers need to pay the dues in less than three months.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who face combined AGR dues of over Rs 89,000 crore to be paid in less than three months, have filed review petitions seeking a review of penalties and interest on the dues, and questioning some components of the non-core items that the court said should be included while computing AGR of telcos. If forced to pay the whole amounts, the telcos say they have doubts over continuing as going concerns.

“We trust this does not mean the government has ceased to look at the long-term relief and sustainability of the industry. We hope these issues will continue to be looked at and decided upon by DoT through existing channels of decision making,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). COAI represents all private telecom operators.

Analysts last week said the sector needs more measures.

“While deferment of spectrum auction payment is in line with our expectations, no decision on licence fees reduction is clearly negative…We note that if the Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel face challenges in paying the annual spectrum payment of Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 6,000 crore, respectively, then it will be more challenging for them to pay AGR dues of Rs 53,000 crore and Rs 35,600 crore immediately,” Credit Suisse said in a report.

Telecom companies have also asked the government to reduce their total incidence of tax and levies from the present levels of 33%, and reduce spectrum usage charge to 1%, respectively. ET had reported previously that the DoT may ask the finance ministry to refer the pending issue of refunding input tax credits of telecom companies worth Rs 36,000 crore to the GST Council, which the telcos have been asking for as well."
16,2018-11-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) will “fight” any attempts by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to seek additional licence fees on the basis of a recent Supreme Court ruling, beyond the amounts that the state-owned enterprise has already paid, a senior official said.

The official at the power transmission provider said the Supreme Court order did not apply to non-telecom companies like PGCIL and therefore it would stand by its earlier assessment of licence fee.

“It should have been specified in the contract,” the official said, on the licence fee that the company has to pay to the government based on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR).

The official said PGCIL would not make any further payment to the DoT, and added that it had already paid Rs 59 crore as license fee. “We will fight it,” he said, when asked about the options that the company had in front of it, including exploring a legal recourse. “Transmission income added as miscellaneous income in the demand is unjust.”

PGCIL sees telecom business as an opportunity to leverage its existing power transmission network. It had also been entrusted with the responsibility of implementation of System Coordination and Control projects in various regions for better overall coordination and effective management of interconnected grid networks.

Telecom services contribute about 2% to the company’s revenue, while power transmission accounts for nearly 95%. The company made Rs 742 crore in 2018-19 from its telecom business, which puts the licence fee at Rs 59 crore.

PGCIL is one of the several companies in the country which, lawyers say, could be affected by a wider interpretation of the apex court order of October 24, where it had said all revenue belonging to a telecom licensee — not just revenue from telecom services — should be accounted as gross revenue, for calculating AGR.

Following this, Bharti Airtel, in a November 14 letter to telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, sought that all telecom licence holders, even if they were non-telecom companies, should be treated at par with the mobile phone companies while seeking additional licence fees. Airtel estimated that PGCIL should be liable to pay an additional Rs 43,544 crore in licence fees, interest, penalty and interest on penalty.

Airtel further said DoT should demand licence fees, penalties and interest on penalties from about 40 such non-telecom licence holders, demands from whom could be nearly Rs 2.28 lakh crore. Telecom licensees pay 8% of AGR as licence fee to the government. The order mandated licence holders to pay in three months.

The DoT on its part has issued notices to all licence holders to give their own assessment of licence fee and pay it within the stipulated time frame, even as it takes a legal opinion on how to deal with non-telecom companies.

PGCIL has ISP (Internet Service Provider)-A and National Long Distance (NLD) licences, which the official said are different than those that fall under the ambit of the Supreme Court’s order.

When PGCIL signed the licence agreement with DoT, it was clear that only telecom revenues would be considered for the purpose of calculation of licence fee, the official said.

PGCIL maintains separate accounts for ISP and NLD licences and makes provisions every year. Even miscellaneous income from these businesses is accounted for, the official added.

But some legal experts say that any entity with a telecom service licence, including Internet service providers, satellite communication providers, cable operators and even companies in the power, steel and railway sectors, may be liable to pay AGR-based fees."

30,2018-11-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Real-time power market is expected to kick in from April 1 next year, following which consumers including discoms or captive users can buy power at exchanges just one hour before delivery, said a senior official on Wednesday.

At present, the consumers including discoms or captive users can buy power one day prior in Day Ahead Market (DAM) at power exchanges where trading is done for two hours daily from 10 am to 12 noon.

""We are hoping that real-time power market will kick in from April 1, 2020. The hearing (of stakeholders) on the draft regulation on real-time power market is complete,"" Central Electricity Regulatory Authority Commission (CERC) Chairman P K Pujari told reporters on the sidelines of the 22nd India Power Forum 2019 here.

Pujari further said ""it is not that real-time power market will kick in immediately after the finalisation or approval of the regulation by the CERC. In order to bring it, we have to put a system in place. So we have to give time. There is need for a software (trading solution) for that and people need to be educated about that.""

The main purpose of introducing real-time power market is to deal with the renewables interference and better portfolio management by discoms, gencos and other consumers.

With more and more renewable energy capacity being added to power grid, there would be need for sudden ramp up and down sizing of supply.

Consumers including discoms can plan their energy supplies in a better way and gencos would be able to increase or decrease their output accordingly.

A senior Indian Energy Exchange official told that under the proposed draft regulation, there would be 48 session of half an hour each in a day. That means the trading of electricity would be done round the clock.

The official further said that after the closing of hour-an-hour session, the power delivery can be scheduled at an interval of one hour.

Thus, if a consumer buys power in a session between 1:30 pm to 2 pm then the power supply can be scheduled as early as 3 pm the same day."
28,2018-11-27,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The Union cabinet will soon consider what would be the country’s first exchange traded fund for corporate bonds, Bharat Bond ETF, a government official has said. “The product is ready to be rolled out... It will soon go to cabinet for approval,” the official told ET. It is likely to be rolled out in mid-December, the person said.

The ETF will have bonds of some central public sector units as underlying.

The move is part of the government's efforts to enhance depth in the bond market and draw retail investors to the debt products.

More than a dozen PSUs’ bonds would form part of proposed ETF, said a person familiar to the deliberations on the matter. PSUs likely to be part of the bouquet include National Highways Authority of India, Indian Railways Finance Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, Nabard, Exim Bank, Nuclear Power Corporation, REC and Power Grid, the person said.

The government official quoted earlier said the minimum size of investment for ETF will be kept at 1,000 units, providing ease of access to investors.

Net asset value of the ETF, also to be traded on exchange, will be declared several times during a day and the portfolio will be visible to investors.

PSUs participating in the ETF will be using the vehicle to raise funds now and subsequently use it as part of annual fund raising as well, the official said.

“The idea is to deepen the market for all stakeholders,” the person said, adding that further bond issuances by PSUs will bring liquidity in the corporate bond market.

The ETF would offer returns upwards of 7 per cent, higher than fixed deposits and tax-free bonds, the official said.

The proposal was first announced by late Arun Jaitley in his 2018-19 budget speech. “The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management will come up with more ETF offers including debt ETF,” he had said.

Edelweiss Asset Management is the asset manager for the proposed debt ETF, which seeks to cater to borrowing needs of CPSEs and other public sector entities."

32,2018-11-28,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Rajasthan Electronics & Instruments Ltd (REIL) and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) have bagged a significant chunk of orders for setting up more than 2,500 e-vehicle charging stations in about 90 cities across the country. No private sector company has qualified. 

About 50 bids were received from private companies for tenders floated under the Centre’s second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (Fame-II) scheme, but the companies did not qualify as they had to bid through nominated agencies for the states, sources said. 

Two of the private bidders told ET declined to comment till the results of the tenders are made official. 

""We will evaluate the results and the documents once an official statement about the results is made,"" an executive at one of the private bidders said. 

Of the Rs 10,000 crore Fame II scheme, Rs 1,000 crore has been earmarked as subsidy for setting up the charging stations. 

The Department of Heavy Industry received a total of 100 bids from public and private companies in response to tenders for setting up public charging stations for electric vehicles. 

EESL emerged as the qualified bidder for setting up about 600 charging stations in about a dozen cities, while REIL won 1,000 tenders. NTPC is likely to get contracts for 200 charging stations, while PowerGrid may qualify for about 10 charging stations. 

A senior EESL official said the company would set up charging stations in a dozen cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Noida and Chandigarh. 

REIL will set up the charging infrastructure in about 50 cities. 

Urban local bodies of Dehradun, Guwahati and Tirupati; and municipal corporations of Navi Mumbai and Bhubaneswar also could bag some of the contracts. 

About 1,000 charging stations will be set up in about seven cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, with populations of over four million, sources said. 

The focus of the Fame II scheme is electrification of public and shared transportation and laying of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. 

The government targets to set up one charging station for every three km in cities and every 25 km on both sides of highways. The tariff for supply of electricity to electric vehicle public charging stations shall not be more than the average cost of supply plus 15%, according to the power ministry’s guidelines. The states will fix a ceiling on service charges for the public charging stations. 

Early last year, the ministry had issued a notification clarifying that setting up charging stations for electric vehicles will not require a separate licence under the Electricity Act, 2003. 

The power ministry issued guidelines in December last year for charging infrastructure, under which it asked public charging stations to install both Japanese and European charging platforms."

39,2018-11-30,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: The government will likely need sizable privatisation income over the next five years given the fiscal pressures, with BHEL, GAIL India, Hindustan Zinc and NALCO likely to be the possible candidates, according to foreign brokerage CLSA.

PSU stocks with limited scope for privatisation such as ONGC, NTPC, Power Grid, Indian Oil Corporation, and Coal India, may continue to face selling pressures.

“The government has earned $12 billion via PSU stock sales through ETFs in the last three years and fear of more such sales will put supply pressure in the market on non-disinvestment candidates,” said CLSA.

However, the chances of the government concluding the BPCL privatisation before the end of the current financial year is challenging, the brokerage said.

“The experience of three previous successful cases back in 2001-2002 shows that privatisation is a time-consuming process and takes 6-16 months between global tender and deal consummation, thus, concluding the BPCL privatisation before Mar’20 is challenging,” said CLSA.

CLSA said weak tax collection growth and stimulatory measures by the government have created a fiscal shortfall of over ₹2 lakh crore in the current financial year. The government has set a fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of the GDP for the current financial year.

The brokerage believes that the disinvestment target may only grow going forward especially if more tax cuts happen and as other potential non-tax revenue sources are already constrained.

“Even assuming a 50-70 bps (basis points) relaxation, the current year’s record $15bn (billion) disinvestment target may only grow, especially if more tax cuts happen,” said CLSA.

The brokerage said the government’s total holding in listed PSUs is $174 billion of which financials account for $61 billion and those are unlikely to be disinvested in the near future.

Sale of SUUTI holdings is an easier option, but the government only has about $4.8 billion in the two stocks – Axis Bank and ITC – which can be easily sold, said CLSA."

1,2018-12-03,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian stock market extended gains for a sixth straight session on Monday, despite profit booking at higher levels, as respite over trade war truce between the US and China were offset by jump in crude oil prices.

The stocks witnessed an early morning euphoria, thanks to the US President Donald Trump and Chinese premier Xi Jinping, who negotiated a 90-day trade war truce at Saturday’s G20 dinner. 

The BSE Sensex, however, closed up just 46.70 points, or 0.13%per cent, at 36,241 as market sentiment took a hit from a sharp surge in crude oil prices and depreciation in the rupee against the US dollar.

Below are some of the factors that moved the market on Monday:


Rupee depreciation
The rupee depreciated amid strengthening dollar against currencies overseas. At 4.30 pm, the domestic currency was trading at 70.36, down 78 paise.


Crude on the boil
Oil prices rallied 5 percent on Monday after the US and China consented to a 90-day ceasefire in their exchange war, and ahead of the Opec meet this week that may lead to a supply cut. Brent crude oil futures were up $2.89 per barrel, or 4.9 percent, at $62.35 a barrel, while WTI crude futures were at $53.41 per barrel , up $2.48 per barrel, or 4.9 percent.


Bullish global cues
Stock markets worldwide rejoiced US-China truce. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.8 per cent. China's CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares surged 2.6 per cent. In Japan, the Nikkei was up 1.3 per cent to a six-week high. The truce also triggered a surge in European indices.


RBI monetary policyThe speculation clouding the RBI panel’s three-day meet on interest rate expectations also kept the market sentiment mixed and investors cautious. Experts are of the view that the RBI may not change the benchmark lending rate (repo) despite moderation in economic growth and easing inflation, PTI reported.

2,2018-12-04,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: In line with most Asian peers, Indian equities halted its march on Tuesday, breaking the winning streak of six sessions, as the euphoria over the trade truce between the US and China faded and doubts surfaced over the two countries’ ability to resolve differences. 

Moreover, investors chose to remain on the sidelines ahead of RBI’s money policy outcome and results of state elections. 

A spike of oil and gold prices in global markets lured investors toward safe haven assets, whereas rupee's precarious movement made them frown. Oil prices rose more than 1 per cent on speculation of an output cut by Opec even as the dollar’s weakness boosted gold.

Sun Pharma falls 3%Shares of Sun Pharma fell for the second day in a row to close 2.75 per cent lower at Rs 442.80 on BSE, as the company’s attempt to address investors’ concerns did not cut much ice. India’s largest drugmaker said it would work towards re-establishing credibility and corporate governance, which could include review of some past decisions such as a $250 million loan to employees and others and a possible buyout of a domestic company classified as related party. In the last two sessions, the stock has slipped 10 per cent. 


RCom extends gainsShares of Reliance Communications rose for the third consecutive day on reports that its arm Reliance Realty issued a Rs 1,400 crore corporate guarantee to the telecom department (DoT), in line with a Supreme Court order, paving the way for an early closure of the Anil Ambani-led telecom company’s pending spectrum sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm.

On the flip side, Ashok Leyland, Axis Bank, Tata Chemicals, BEML, Gati, Raymond, Siyaram Silk and LIC Housing Finance featured among the 76 stocks that showed bearish crossovers on BSE.

Earlier on, sentiment got a leg-up on reports that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is looking to buy 10 per cent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

Crude oil prices lay low due to ambiguity over a cut in output by Opec. A stronger rupee had a big bearing, too. 

Asian and European markets were in a better shape after US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the three-year tightening cycle is coming to a close. IMF chief Christine Lagarde's comments that the US is not likely to see an economic contraction in the near term added to the buying momentum. 

However, there were worries that the US-China relation may turn into a sordid saga due to the arrest of a senior Huawei executive.

11,2018-12-07,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities got a shot in the arm on Friday, reversing their three-day losing streak, as strength in global markets, a strong rupee and depressed crude prices made the pitch conducive to go higher. 

A surge in Kotak Bank shares on reports that Berkshire Hathaway was planning to pick up stake in the lender too lent a hand. The lender, however, in a BSE filing clarified that it was unaware of any such plans.

Healthy buying in banking, financial and auto stocks added to the rebound.

Investors went the distance after US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the three-year tightening cycle is coming to an end. IMF chief Christine Lagarde's remarks the US is not likely to see an economic contraction in the near term put more life in stocks.

On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth of Rs 72.47 crore Thursday. However, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 389.78 crore, provisional BSE data showed.

Let's check out the market movers and shakers on Friday.


Strong gains in rupee
The domestic unit rebounded after posting significant losses in Thursday's session and gained nearly 45 paise against the US dollar, given a sharp decline in global crude oil prices.

""Indian equity market had turned cautious during the week, profit booking was evident in anticipation of the final outcome of the state elections, a precursor of the general election. Domestic market rebounded today along with global market, which has lightened up, hoping for a resolution of US-China trade war. OPEC's decision to delay the final resolution to cut oil output caused prices to fall, boosting sentiment in India."""

13,2018-12-10,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The finance ministry is looking to push through at least two more M&A deals among the state-run companies in the energy sector after Power Finance Corporation’s acquisition of REC Ltd last week, as it makes a year-end dash to meet its disinvestment target.

The plans revolve around power generation major NTPC becoming an energy sector holding company by acquiring three or more public sector firms from the government, two government official said on condition of anonymity.

In the first phase of the plan, NTPC Ltd will buy the central government’s 64% stake in SJVN Ltd, which at current valuation would fetch over Rs 6,500 crore. Simultaneously, NHPC could acquire from the government the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd, making it a strong portfolio of hydro power firms, one of the officials said.

The next phase could involve bringing transmission companies such as Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. into the fold along with NHPC to create a power sector behemoth under NTPC, the official said.

“So, essentially, NTPC becomes the holding company, with all these entities under its umbrella, but each company will have its own management control,” the official told ET.

The idea of separate management control as being followed in all the cases of M&A among state-run companies will ensure continuity, the person said.

Other smaller central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) such as Damodar Valley Corporation could also be a part of this plan, the person said.




So far, the government has raised Rs 32,997 crore of the targeted Rs 80,000 crore from disinvestment this fiscal. The second official said the government is confident of completing at least the first phase of the plan in this fiscal.

“This is not being carried out with the sole of idea of disinvestment but for creating stronger entities which can also compete globally,” the official said. Similar linkages are also being explored in the oil sector, he said.

Last week the cabinet approved of the sale of government’s entire 52.63% stake in power sector financier REC Ltd to state-run PFC. The government will raise around Rs 14,000 crore from the stake sale.

The department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), which administers the disinvestment programme, has selected ICICI Securities as an advisor for up to two deals in the energy sector.

The government’s strategic sale programme hasn’t picked up any steam.

Dipam secretary Atanu Chakrabarty had recently expressed confidence that the government will be able to meet its target. He also said that there is substantial interest in state-run helicopter service provider Pawan Hans where government is looking to sell its 51% stake. “Pawan Hans (PHL), for which an RFP (request for proposal) has been invited, has got substantial competitive interest,” he had said."

21,2018-12-17,PowerGrid,"Power Grid is going through a slow growth phase now and its lacklustre results for the second quarter of 2018-19 were not a surprise for the market. The company’s second quarter year-on-year (y-o-y) revenue and net profit growth was just 14% and 8% respectively. Margin compression, triggered by the 38% y-o-y jump in employee expenses, was the key reason for Power Grid’s lower net profit growth.

Despite the company entering a slowdown phase, analysts believe that its earnings may pick up because of its order book of more than Rs 85,000 crore. This provides clear revenue visibility for the next 2-3 years. As power transmission is the main bottleneck for the central government’s initiative to provide power to all, this bottleneck offers a good opportunity for companies such as Power Grid. Since its execution skills are time tested, more orders from transmission and distribution (T&D) segment are also expected in the coming years.


Analysts’ views-
Buy: 27
Hold: 5

However, as the long-term outlook of transmission segment is linked to the rise in power demand, its growth rate may taper off once again after the current phase of transmission expansion happens. Once the growth expected in the next 2-3 years is over, Power Grid’s capital expenditure will also come down and this will increase its free cash flow—operating cash flow will exceed new capital expenditure requirements. Power Grid is a high dividend yield stocks and its dividend yield ratio may go up further because of increased free cash flow. In other words, Power Grid is slowly shifting from being a growth stock to being a value stock.

The company’s relative underperformance compared to the Sensex over the past year has brought down its valuation to inexpensive levels and this is another reason why analysts are getting bullish on the counter. Analysts believe that Power Grid’s relatively stable financial performance makes it a safe bet amid pre-general election market volatility. Since the company’s current price-to-earnings ratio is low compared to its historical average, the downside risk from current level is also limited. Though there are fears that its return on equity (ROE) may be fall in future, this negative news has already been priced in and investors need not worry about it.

35,2018-12-17,PowerGrid,"Our understanding is autos are going to lead from the front. The metals pack is also showing a lot of promise, Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities, told ETNow.

Edited excerpts:


ET Now: Are you advocating buy through the close out of 2018?

Sanjiv Bhasin: I have been bullish on the market and proved correct and we are now closer to 11,000 rather than 10,000. All that pessimism is over. For the Indian market, the lesson of 2018 is buy the fear and sell the greed. There is still a lot of fear around and people are waiting for corrections. They have been caught napping if they have been tracking the other asset classes or the other indices where China is in a bear market and the US is having problem of its own. 

India becomes a sweet spot on the back that oil is in a bear market. We have got bond yields, rupee and most of the uncertainties on governance on the RBI over with. The next 3-4 months can be pleasantly surprising because we think earnings are going to be a catalyst, along with flows because we have again seen foreigners turn to buy. Locally, we have had the backbone of this market being the retail investor and the SIP. Put your money where your mouth is. I still think midcaps can outperform in the next few months and that is what we are advocating to buy, select midcaps in most sectors where outperformance is on the cards. 


ET Now: When it comes to Tata Motors, has the view now changed, with recent news coming in that they are looking at downsizing in order to turn profitable and getting in some serious cost control measures. Do you sense that Street would give this stock perhaps a rechance?


Sanjiv Bhasin: Like you said, most of the pessimism of autos may be in the price and if you are looking for elections and beyond, then relatively Tata Motors can outperform. The other caveat being if the pound in which they have an unhedged position starts to stabilise, you could see some mark to market return. But we still think autos are going to lead from the front. If I could select three names, it would be Bajaj Auto, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland is my dark horse because we think this month onwards before the budget they will see much of their inventory getting cleared and we think that the 15-year norm will change which will help them gain market share in MCV and LCV segments.


ET Now: Suppose from 10,000, there are a few sectors which have really done well and there are a few sectors which have not yet performed. Any churning you would recommend to portfolio holders or mutual fund managers where you feel that this sector has run up substantially, you do not see further upside from current levels which does not mean that you are negative on that space but there is more attractive sector now which has not done so far so good.


Sanjiv Bhasin: IT should be given an avoid unless you want to be in fully priced stocks where we do not think earnings will be a catalyst. But yes, if I could stick my neck out, I am very bullish on the metals pack. We think the pessimism is overdone, protectionism in US will see again 2019 being a very good year for results. Locally we have seen steel prices harden. The basket of JSW, Tata Steel, Vedanta and Hindalco is looking excellent. 

PSU banks are going to report very good numbers starting from State Bank, Can Bank, Indian Bank. Corporate banks are already leading from the front like Axis and ICICI and a Federal Bank if you can put the midcap basket. Autos I just suggested four names. I am very bullish on the gas utilities. MGL, IGL, GAIL all are looking excellent on the charts and so a whole host of stocks. As for power stocks, the CERC new guideline will be very very positive for some of the PSUs. I would be sticking my money on CG Power to be dark horse for 2019.


ET Now: Are you more bullish on the power space?


Sanjiv Bhasin: We have had our top picks and we have made money in that. If you recall, we were very bullish on the power financiers before the merger talk came. PFC and REC gave almost a 30 per cent return. We still think that today’s review petition is very very positive for the likes of NTPC and Power Grid. The only caveat here is that there is a government to manage its own balance sheet is seeing merger of some stocks to raise necessary cash.

In this power space, you can pick up some of the power producers or you can see some of the utilities. So Calcutta Electric looks very good to us. Reliance Infra has sold its arm to Adani Power so that could be another good play to be with, but our outperformer here would be a small company called CG Power which we think is selling some of the over leveraged assets in Europe and where return on equity could sharply improve in 2019."

Just check out what factors drove the market rally today.



Strengthening rupee
The domestic currency gained 33 paise against the US dollar today on account of a drop in crude oil prices and selling of foreign currency by banks and exporters. The rupee was trading at 71.64 against the greenback at the time of writing this report.


Improvement in financial climate
A recent report by CARE Ratings stating that the investment climate in India has improved lifted investor sentiment back home. Improved gross fixed capital formation and higher government expenditure refined the financial climate, the report stated. It also highlighted rising government’s spending in sectors like infrastructure, housing and defence. 


Firm global markets
Asian markets ticked up on Monday as investors cautiously looked to whether key policy events in the United States and China could allay concerns about slowing global economic growth. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.25 per cent. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares dipped 0.3 per cent, but managed to stay above November low.


Nov trade deficit narrows, exports rise 
India's exports grew 0.80 per cent to $26.5 billion in November. Exporters attributed the marginal export growth in November to high base effect as the foreign shipments in the comparable month of the previous fiscal were quite high at $26.29 billion. At the same time, the November trade deficit narrowed to $16.67 billion due to a fall in gold imports. This uptick in exports and a slight decline in deficit augur well for the economy.


Oil on the defensive
Oil prices steadied on Monday after slipping by around 2 per cent last week, but remained under pressure because of oversupply and concerns over the prospects for global economic growth and fuel demand. Brent crude oil was down 10 cents a barrel at $60.18 per barrel by 0945 GMT. US light crude was down 5 cents at $51.15.

But the gains were capped as global growth concerns weighed and participants took profit. 

Sentiment got a lift from strength in the rupee and a sharp decline in global oil prices. The possibility of the US Federal Reserve hiking rates less aggressively nudged investors to buy more.

The US Fed meeting, which kicks off today and will conclude on Wednesday, is being keenly tracked for the course of future rate hikes.

Let's check out the factors that moved market today.


Rupee at near 3-week high
The rupee touched a near three-week high against the dollar on lower crude prices and expectations of fewer US rate hikes in 2019 as markets looked forward to the outcome of a crucial Federal Reserve meeting. The rupee was at 70.89 against the dollar, after hitting 70.84, its highest since December 7. The 10-year government bond yield fell below 7.4 per cent as crude oil declined.


Oil drops on oversupply concerns
Oil prices fell 4 per cent on Tuesday, dropping for the third consecutive session on reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record US and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in global stock markets. US crude oil fell $2.04, or 4.1 per cent, to a low of $47.84, its weakest since September 2017, Reuters reported.


Possibility of fewer Fed rate hikes
The US Fed meet starts today, with the FOMC decision due on Wednesday. Although it is widely expected that the Fed will raise rates this month, analysts are calling for two more hikes in 2019 compared with three in September on worries over a potential recession there, according to a Reuters poll.



Expert-take:
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Market reversed from the day’s low despite weak global market as oil prices slid further and a drop in bond yield raised investor’s confidence. Global market traded on a negative note due to concerns of slowdown in the world economic growth. Strong rupee and fall in yield are easing the liquidity concerns of the market."

38,2018-12-18,PowerGrid,"The change of language to paid-up equity capital from paid-up capital tilted the scales against Kotak Bank, said Chakri Lokapriya, CIO & MD, TCG AMC. He told ETNow that the recent spate of farm loan waivers will only spark a competitive race. 


Edited excerpts:


Tata Motors was the top winner in the market. Yes, it is still down nearly 60 per cent in all of 2018 and perhaps the biggest disappointing story the D-Street has had in the last decade. They are tying up with BCG, they are looking at a turnaround plan of as large as $3.2 billion. Could this really make the market want to give Tata Motors a second chance?

You are right, Tata Motors is down about 60 per cent and makes it a very inexpensive stock. At current levels on one hand, you have operational issues with demand slowing down. They have to cut costs, they are going to cut about 2.5 billion pounds worth of costs. On the other hand, you have a slightly more unknown issue which is because of Brexit. Given the nature of Brexit, what will they do to their suppliers who are in various parts of EU? 

Now if there is no clear negotiation and Brexit timetable is met, then a lot of their costs with the suppliers spread across the EU is likely to go up significantly. And you cannot relocate plants or find new suppliers to sort out order that easily. So demand and cost uncertainty will continue to weigh on the stock. Even though the stock is down about 60 per cent odd, we will still stay away for some time. 


How should one read into the Kotak Mahindra episode, there was a media report that Berkshire Hathaway is talking to them and the stock went up, then they went to court against RBI and the court said look nothing doing, you are going to follow RBI as your regulator, do not come crying to us. Despite that communication, which came from the court, the stock has not really cracked back to original levels. What are markets betting on, what is the thought according to you?

Well, we think of Kotak actually. If there is any weakness, you should use it to buy. Second, as far as the RBI is concerned, they said paid up capital, they changed the language and said paid up equity capital. Now changing is like changing the rules of the game midway. From a legal perspective, Kotak has a very strong case. 

Come January 17, when they meet again this is likely to be a topic which will probably, hopefully buy them some more time. Even post the dilution, the valuation looks even more attractive. 

It is a different question that what will they do with the extra capital because then they would not need capital for the next few years to come. But the valuation itself becomes far more attractive post the capital raising of the Rs 23,000 crore odd. The court will likely see merit in Kotak’s current stance. 



 NTPC and Power Grid held out very well after the draft tariff regulations came about for 2020-24. Is this a space you would be willing to look at?

The regulations largely leave the situation unchanged. Capital structure of 30:70, equity debt is largely the same, ROA 15.5 per cent and the only thing that they have kind of played around with is the plant load factors adjusting it for maintenance. This means largely it is not going to make much of an impact to their earnings and cash flows. Cash flows will probably get a little bit tougher because of the new coal arrangements that they have. From that perspective, Power Grid and NTPC stocks though inexpensive are unlikely to rerate much upwards. 



The current loss of incumbent governments has been largely because of rural distress and I guess everyone has recognised that. Farm loan waiver has been a tool which has been used by various political parties in order to attract rural votes and I get a sense that in the run-up to the general election, this will only amplify and multiply.

You are absolutely right about that and if you look back at whether it is Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat elections last year, there were farm loan waivers and now that Madhya Pradesh has announced, you will get into a competitive kind of a bidding where just about this is going to be a poll strategy. 

And like you rightly pointed out it is going to be borne by the states rather than by the banks and again as you pointed out now, we are already seeing infrastructure slowing down, 20,000 kilometres worth of road projects were announced for 2019, of which only about 900 kms has actually been executed. 

While the order book will look strong, the execution is what drives earnings and that is not going to be seen at least in the run-up to the elections. So from that perspective yes, infrastructure and road companies do not have an earnings per se. We are likely to stay away from them. 



Where is your leaning when it comes to pharmaceuticals and what are the names you are completely avoiding right now?

In pharmaceuticals, we are still like export names, still about 60-70 per cent goes to the US and also kind of being a staple kind of a product and demand is unlikely to come down whether the US economy does well or bad. So earnings are intact. If anything, there will be an acceleration of earnings because last year's FDA problems are not going to be there next year. We like Dr Reddy’s in spite of the uncertainty of its new product launch. We still like Cadila and Cipla at these levels because the earnings growth for the next year is accelerating.



Why do you like Cadila?

Cadila has both -- a good export component as well their domestic bit are also improving. And earnings, for all these companies you are likely to see an earnings acceleration next year.


You are not worried about what they are trying to do with Zydus. Zydus has gone and acquired a big brand and Cadila in a sense is ringfencing them, some would argue that big brother is actually subsidising the small brother to acquire this big acquisition.

Yes, indeed. That is a concern. It is a big concern and I think there will be some kind of a restructuring post that because they are unlikely to keep a consumer company and a pharma company under this -- so that will happen. But despite that I think we still have a good -- because the valuations are not demanding at all."

42,2018-12-20,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Central power utilities such as NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India are bound to gain from Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s draft norms for 2019-24, but it may translate into more expensive electricity for consumers.

Shares of NTPC have gained 5%, and Power Grid Corporation of India jumped by over 7% after CERC maintained the return on equity and tariff structure in the proposal even as it tightened the operating norms. The regulator has sought public comments till January 15 after which it will conduct public hearing by end-January before finalising the norms.

“The guidelines for FY19-24 period are favourable for power generators, as the regulator has maintained status quo on most of the parameters as against expectation of a lower return on equity (RoE) and change in debt-equity ratio in favour of debt. We estimate the annual fixed cost to decline by 1.4%, as per the new guidelines, largely driven by the changes in the working capital norms,” India Ratings &Research said in a note.

The regulators have left the return on equity unchanged with the base rate at 15.50% for thermal generating station, transmission system including communication system and run of the river hydro generating station, and 16.50% for the storage type hydro generating stations. CERC has tightened the working capital norms by lowering the normative inventory and receivable period allowed by 10 days and 15 days, respectively.

The regulator added that power generators would write off equity in the plants that have completed useful life, which could be 25 years for thermal power, and recovered depreciation in excess of debt repayment till date. Brokerage Motilal Oswal said that the write-off of regulated equity assets that have outlived their useful life will impact NTPC the most in the near-term, as almost 15 gigawatts of its capacity has completed over 25 years of useful life. “There is an impact of around Rs 5-6 billion on profit after tax for FY20-21 as gain from gross calorific value norms is offset by write-off of equity for old plants,” the brokerage said."

Govt to seek interim dividend from RBIThe government will seek an interim dividend from the Reserve Bank of India, department of economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said, which should help it tide over finances as it tries to meet the budgeted fiscal deficit. The demand of the government will be independent of a committee being set up to review the economic capital framework of the central bank to determine the appropriate level of reserves it should hold.


Fed raises rates,
but trims rate hike hope for 2019
The Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs for the fourth time this year, by 25 basis points, ignoring a stock-market selloff and defying pressure from President Donald Trump, while dialing back projections for interest rates and economic growth in 2019. By trimming the number of rate hikes they foresee in 2019, to two from three, policy makers signaled they may soon pause their monetary tightening campaign. Officials had a median projection of one move in 2020


Rajasthan unveils farm loan waiver
The new Congress government in Rajasthan on Wednesday announced a farm loan waiver for farmers who have taken loans from nationalised banks and cooperative banks, a day after new Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh did the same. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who took oath on Monday, said the government would completely write off loans taken from cooperative banks, while for nationalised and other banks the waiver would be for loans up to Rs 2 lakh as on November 30, 2018.


Farm loan waivers make banks nervousHaving barely emerged from the corporate bad debt hangover, banks are worried about the next threat — farm loan waivers. With Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi challenging PM Narendra Modi to waive farm loans across the country, bankers believe it is a danger if implemented. “It is a deadly poison. It’s a wrong way of addressing the real issue,” United Bank of India’s managing director Ashok Kumar Pradhan said. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh — which saw a change in government after the recent state elections — as well as Assam have waived loans of farmers. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have outstanding farm loans amounting to ₹1.1 lakh crore


Niti Aayog plans 8% growth over 5 yearsNiti Aayog, the government’s think tank, has pitched for an average 8% growth over the next five years to lift India to a $4-trillion economy in its 75th year of independence, proposing a strategy for a New India by 2022. A document unveiled by finance minister Arun Jaitley and Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar on Wednesday detailed 41 key areas, recognising progress made and identifying constraints on the path to achieve these goals. It broke down the 41 sectors into four broad categories: drivers, infrastructure, inclusion and governance.


Sebi makes parent firms accountableParent companies may have to keep a watch on the audit process of subsidiaries. Securities and Exchange Board of India plans to make it mandatory for auditors of parent companies to review the work of all the auditors of subsidiary companies before approved by the board. A Sebi panel is working on this proposal following the IL&FS crisis, said a person familiar with the development.


MPC
opted for wait and watch in last review
The Monetary Policy Committee would be on a ‘wait and watch’ mode and go through inflation data carefully before it gets into interest rate action, with deputy governor Viral Acharya saying that while tightening possibilities may have eased, but not totally eliminated, reflecting the cautious mood. Out of the six committee members, only Ravindra Dholakia voted to change the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral, arguing that Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) own downward revision of inflation forecast needs a policy response.


Tax axe on startups may be liftedThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is examining the angel tax issue and could issue a clarification that lifts the threat of this levy and associated penalties hanging over startups. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) said the government will ensure there is no harassment of angel investors and startups.


BPOs may stay out of tax ambit
India aims to keep business process outsourcing (BPO) service providers out of the ambit of the goods and services tax (GST), ensuring that they won’t face 18% tax. A directive, being given the finishing touches by the law review committee of the GST Council, is likely to draw a clear distinction between back office support service providers and intermediaries, said two government officials aware of the move.


Power firms gain will be consumers’ painCentral power utilities such as NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India are bound to gain from Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s draft norms for 2019-24, but it may translate into more expensive electricity for consumers.

46,2018-12-20,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: State-owned power utility Power Grid Corporation Thursday said that it has got shareholders' approval to raise shareholding limit of Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) to 35 per cent from 30 per cent at present.

The special resolution to increase in shareholding limit of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), including Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), limits in PowerGrid to 35 per cent is approved with the requisite majority, a BSE filing said.

At present, the FPIs/FIIs holding in PowerGrid is about 24 per cent. 

Considering past FPI interest in the company stock, investor feedback in various fora and to attract foreign investments and have more headroom available for FPIs to invest in equity share capital of the company, it is proposed to increase the investment limit of FPIs from 30 per cent to 35 per cent of paid up equity share capital of the company, the power firm said in the proposal.

The company had increased the limit of FPI holding in equity shares of the company from 24 per cent to 30 per cent in the year 2013 with approval of shareholders.

Shareholders also approved the special resolution to alter the objects clause of its memorandum of association, to invest and/or act as Project Management Consultant in energy projects, to develop smart grid infrastructure and to develop electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

As per the proposal approved by the shareholders, considering growth prospects of the company, it had planned to diversify its business into other business fields like Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure, Data Centre, Mobile Tower Infrastructure services, etc.

The company is already having experience in telecom, railway electrification, Smart Grid and project management consultancy."
47,2018-12-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government will soon auction power transmission contracts worth over Rs 8,000 crore connecting renewable energy projects in western and northern states while it has deferred a decision on lines worth Rs 5,500 crore.

Minutes of a meeting of National Committee on Transmission (NCT) held on December 4 showed that contracts worth about Rs 3,500 crore have been awarded on nomination basis to Power Grid Corp (PGCIL). Private sector firms such as Tata Power, Adani Power Transmission, L&T Infra, Torrent Power, Kalpataru Power Transmission and Megha Engineering had earlier bid for such contracts.

The government has also compressed the timeline for implementing the projects to 18 months while setting September 2020 as the target completion date for some projects.

Power transmission companies have welcomed the move but have demanded the government to half the auction timeline from the planned 140 days to 70 days. The companies have also said the government can auction transmission lines instead of deferring them and a green signal can be given later to the selected company to match the schedule of generation projects.

“The transmission sector has made great progress by the government's commitment to competition,” said Ved Tiwari, CEO of global infra business at Sterlite Power. “The government just needs to address two things—compressing the bid timelines and planning the projects in time, as is done in other sectors like highways and renewable energy projects. If the projects can be targeted to be implemented in 18 months, there is no reason why auction process shall take five months. Also, the government can plan and bid out the transmission projects and serve a notice to proceed when the generation projects are getting ready.”

The committee deferred the Rs 5,500-crore contracts due to lack of clarity on the status of the renewable energy generation plants. Electric Power Transmission Association has asked for auction of these projects. “We note that the decision on transmission projects worth Rs 5,525 crore have been deferred by the NCT citing a lack of stage-II LTA connectivity application from RE projects. This could potentially create an avoidable urgency situation in the upcoming months, defeating the very purpose of planning these schemes in the first place. We urge the empowered committee to consider implementation of these schemes instead of deferment,” it told ET.

“We strongly reiterate that the bidding timeline of five months for tariff-based competitive bidding projects can easily be crashed to about 70 days (about two-and-a-half) by following a single-stage, two-envelope process that is already being practised for selection of renewable energy developers by SECI, and also has been notified by the power ministry under the gazette notification dated April 17, 2006,” it said."

53,2018-12-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Strong gains in energy and IT counters helped Indian equity market edge higher for a second straight session on Thursday. The global market sentiment remained upbeat on account of a record rally in US stocks overnight and weak global crude oil prices.

However, signs of weakness in Dow Jones and S&P500 futures led the markets to cut some gains in the second half.

4,2019-01-03,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks opened Thursday's session in the negative zone, tracking weak global sentiment after US stock futures fell and most Asian markets traded lacklustre.

The US stock futures fell on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple added to worries about slowing global growth, Reuters reported.

A fall in the rupee even as crude oil prices declined further in global markets too impacted the mood. 

The Indian currency opened 11 paise down at 70.29 against the greenback amid buying in American currency by banks and importers.

The softer manufacturing PMI also played its role in aggravating the selling in sectors. The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index declined to 53.2 in December from 54 in November. A reading of over 50 on this survey-based index indicates expansion, while a figure below that reflects contraction.

India’s power sector is undergoing a noteworthy change, and this has redefined the industry outlook. Demand for electricity is seeing a steady growth with a pick-up in the economy, especially manufacturing activity, as well as favorable government policy. The government has implemented various progressive measures to maximise power generation capacity and improve distribution.

India has made great steps in raising access to electricity; as more than 13 crore people joined the power grid since 2013. Also, a close look at the index of electricity showed it has been growing considerably in core sector data. Per capita electricity consumption, which was a mere 16.3 units in 1947, has increased to 1,122 units in 2016-17. 

Below in the graphical representation of the various index in the core sector.






Government initiatives like 24x7 power, power to all households by March 2019 and UDAY, which has improved viability of discoms to buy more power to serve more customers and the CEC initiatives that include linking of deviation settlement mechanism (DSM) prices to DAM prices at the exchange average clearing price, have helped the sector witness robust growth.

In 2018, power demand has increased 8 per cent to 177GW. However, the coal supply chain has tightened up. On the contrary, coal-based power generation capacity in India, which currently stands at 190.29GW is expected to reach 330-441 GW by 2040.

Meanwhile, the government is hopeful of higher output next year from already allocated mines and plans to further allot 10 mines to Coal India. The government targets to increase renewable capacity to 175GW in FY22, and further to 275GW in FY27 from current 72 GW.

Moreover, the railway ministry has also decided to electrify its entire broadgauge network. In order to achieve this target, India needs to add more renewable capacity, improve fuel-supply chain for coal and gas plants and efficient utilization of existing capacity. Total installed capacity of power stations in India stood at 346.62 GW as of November 2018.

Electricity demand in the country has increased rapidly and is expected to rise further in the years to come. Electrification is increasing with the support of the government schemes like DDUGJY (Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana) and IPDS (Integrated Power Development Scheme). The government has also delicensed the electrical machinery industry and allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector.

India’s power sector is forecast to attract investments worth Rs 11.56 trillion between 2017 and 2022 in thermal, hydro, nuclear and renewable segments.

In order to further boost the sector, there is an urgent requirement for reforms relating to prioritising efficient coal allocation and delivery, promoting competition in coal and electricity supply, rationalising energy prices and using incentives to promote more efficient power generation and delivery.

Besides, other reforms already proposed such as re-designing of real-time market, ancillary services regulations and linking of DSM prices with exchanges prices, if implemented, will help absorb more renewable in the grid going forward.

India’s rapid growth over the past decade has increased power demand, which is still largely unmet. With the robust outlook of the sector, it is expected that India will see foreign participation in the development and financing of generation and transmission assets, engineering services, equipment supply and technology partnership in nuclear and clean coal technologies going forward. Going forward, NTPC, NHPC, PTC India, Torrent power and Adani Power are some of the stocks that may give good returns.

13,2019-01-09,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The power ministry has recommended ‘maharatna’ status for Power Grid Corp of India Ltd (PGCIL), the country’s largest power transmission company, according to an official.

‘Maharatna’ status allows state-run firms greater financial autonomy — they can decide on investments of up to 15% of their net worth in a project without government approval.

In comparison, ‘navratna’ companies such as Power-Grid can invest only up to Rs 1,000 crore without government approval.

If the proposal is approved by the Centre, PGCIL will become the eighth ‘maharatna’ public sector undertaking — and the second in the power sector — after Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, Indian Oil Corp, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Coal India Ltd, NTPC Ltd and Steel Authority of India Ltd. PowerGrid had applied for ‘maharatna’ status after it achieved the qualifying parameter of average annual turnover of Rs 20,000 crore for three years, the official cited earlier said.

The company’s consolidated net profit in 2017-18 was Rs 8,198 crore compared with Rs 7,451 crore in the previous year, while total consolidated income was Rs 30,431 crore against Rs 26,283 crore in 2016-17. In the last three years, its total income has grown at 20.05%, profit after tax at 18.28%, and gross fixed assets at 14.41%.

Investors are on wait and watch mode and holding their bets ahead of crucial December quarter numbers. 
Bandhan Bank and TCS are the two companies whose number will influence the mood of the market today.

Around 9:25 am, the BSE Sensex was flat at 36,209, while the Nifty index was 11 points down at 10,844.



The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were outperforming Sensex by trading 0.37 per cent and 0.28 per cent up, respectively, at that time. 

Asian shares took a breather on Thursday after an extended rally, as markets awaited more news on US-China trade talks that have raised hopes of a deal to avert an all-out trade war between the economic giants, Reuters reported.

Oil prices fell by 1 per cent in global markets, giving a leg up to the Indian rupee. Dollar's weakness against it peers on account of increased selling of the greenback by exporters and banks, too, improved the rupee slightly.

After opening 6 paise down, the rupee was trading 12 paise higher at 70.35 against the US dollar in early trade today.

Tata Motors, YES Bank, NTPC, Tata Steel, ONGC and Infosys were trading among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

Credit Suisse has cut FY19E EPS by 12 per cent on the stock.

IT heavyweight TCS is set to announce its December earnings today. 

Centrum Broking expects TCS’ revenues to grow 1.8 per cent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms and dollar revenues to grow 1 per cent as cross-currency headwind is likely to cut it by 80 bps. “Ebitda margin may be at 28.5 per cent for Q3FY19, which represents a 60 bps improvement QoQ on a sequential basis.

17,2019-01-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices on Monday extended losses for a third straight session on fall in bank, financials, IT and metal stocks amid weak global cues.

Chinese export data aggravated fears of a slowdown in the global economic growth and most Asian and European markets suffered losses.

D-Mart cracks on tepid Q3 numbersShares of Avenue Supermarts plummeted 11.04 per cent to close at Rs 1,395.75. The stock fell as the company on Saturday reported a modest 2.1 per cent YoY rise in profit growth, mainly due to a drop in gross margin on account of price cuts, while slow store additions added to investors concern. 


Jet up 16% as chairman Goyal may step downReports that founder and chairman Naresh Goyal was likely to step down from the board of Jet Airways gave a boost, with the stock closing 16.13 per cent higher at Rs 294.40 on the BSE. A media report quoting sources, suggested that Jet was likely to finalise a resolution plan with its lenders this week. As per the report, Goyal would trim his stake to 20-25 per cent from 51 per cent and would agree to capp his voting rights to 10 per cent. 


Infosys investors cheer Q3 numbersThe IT stock climbed 2.52 per cent to Rs 700.90 as many foreign brokerages maintained a ‘buy’ post optimistic management commentary.

CLSA said Infosys reported a stellar revenue growth with a small miss on the margin front.


YES Bank rallies on new CEO buzzShares of YES Bank closed 6.22 per cent up at Rs 195.40 as Ravneet Gill, CEO, Deutsche Bank, India, has joined the race to succeed Rana Kapoor as the private lender’s next chief executive.

Tata Motors climbs 1% on block dealShares of Tata Motors closed with a gain of 1.11 per cent at Rs 182.30 in an otherwise weak market after reports of block deal on the counter. Bloomberg reported that 20 lakh shares of the automaker changed hands in a block deal during the session.


J&K Bank advances after good Q3 showShares of Jammu & Kashmir Bank closed 3.03 per cent up at Rs 37.40, buoyed by bank's healthy December quarter numbers.

Capital Goods top sectoral loserWith a loss of 1.93 per cent, the BSE Capital Goods index emerged as the top loser among the sectoral indices.

16,2019-01-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Banking and financial stocks pulled equity indices lower on Monday, taking the overall market fall to the third straight session. 

Indian markets fell in line with global peers after China's December exports unexpectedly fell, pointing to weakness in the world's second-largest economy, sparking fears of a global growth slowdown. 

Weak macros in the form of a losing rupee and poor factory output growth did not help the cause of the bulls. 

The BSE Sensex dropped 156 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 35,854 while its NSE counterpart Nifty slipped 57 points, or 0.53 per cent, to settle at 10,738. 

In the Sensex heatmap, seven ended higher while 23 ended lower. YES Bank was the lead gainer with a rise of 5.98 per cent following the appointment of Brahm Dutt as the non-executive chairman of the bank. Reports were also doing rounds that Ravneet Gill, CEO of India, Deutsche Bank AG, is in race to succeed Rana Kapoor.

Infosys gained 2.54 per cent post its December quarter results. 

However, L&T shed the most at 2.64 per cent. IndusInd Bank, Vedanta, Power Grid, NTPC and TCS were among other top losers, declining up to 2 per cent.

Jet Airways surged 16 per cent and was one of the top performers on the BSE following reports that founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal is likely to step down from the board of the embattled company and give up majority control. 

Meanwhile, Avenue Supermarts with a fall of over 11 per cent turned out to be the biggest loser after as its profit for the December quarter came in flat as against a growth of 10-18 per cent as expected by analysts. Slow store addition added to investors' concerns. 

Both midcap and smallcap indices fell in step with the Sensex, weakening 0.49 per cent and 0.44 per cent, respectively.

BSE Capital Goods, Utilities, Metals and Power were the worst sectoral performers, declining over 1 per cent each. IT was the sole sector that rose today while BSE Teck remained unchanged.

Factors that dragged markets lower:

1. 
Weak Chinese data 
Latest data from China showed imports fell 7.6 per cent year-on-year in December when analysts had predicted a 5 per cent rise, while exports dropped 4.4 per cent, confounding expectations for a 3 percent gain, according to Reuters. 

This heightened concerns of a global growth slowdown and dented investor sentiment across the globe. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific ex-Japan shares lost around 1 per cent while index of Europe's leading 300 shares slipped 0.7 per cent in early trade and Germany's DAX and France's CAC fell around 0.6 per cent.

2. 
Rupee trades lower
The rupee weakened further against dollar and lost over 40 paise to hit intraday low of 70.89. At the time of writing this report, the domestic unit was down 30 paise at 70.83 against the greenback.

3. 
Factory output fizzles out
Industrial output growth dropped to a 17-month low of 0.5 per cent in November on account of contraction in manufacturing sector, particularly consumer and capital goods. The previous low was in June 2017, when IIP growth contracted by 0.3 per cent.


Expert-view:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 

""Early hiccups to Q3 results due to mixed outcome from IT and bank blue-chips negatively influenced the domestic market. Additionally, sharp fall in IIP and headwinds from global market due to slowdown in the world economy, US shutdown and Brexit impacted sentiment. Consolidation in domestic market was broad based as FIIs were on a selling mode while DIIs were on the sidelines due to concerns over oil prices, weak rupee and fiscal deficit."""
24,2019-01-15,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Strong buying across sectors, led by IT, energy and metal, boosted equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty as both snapped their three-session losing streak with stellar gains.

Moreover, robust gains in Asian stocks after Beijing signalled more stimulus to prop up its staggering economy bolstered the positive sentiment.

A fresh spell of buying emerged across the sectors, which sustained throughout the session. Sensex closed the day 465 points, or 1.30 per cent, up at 36,318.33, with only three losers - Maruti Suzuki (down 0.72 per cent), ICICI Bank (down 0.23 per cent) and Power Grid Corporation (down 0.03 per cent).

23,2019-01-15,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Buying in index heavyweights RIL, Infosys and TCS helped domestic key indices snap their three-day losing run and end over 1 per cent higher on Tuesday. 

It was a splash of green across most Asian markets, which closed nearly 2 per cent higher. European looked good in opening trade, buoying sentiment back home. 

Global stocks strengthened after China signalled more stimulus measures in the wake of poor December trade data to soften the blow from an ongoing dispute with the US. 

Moreover, a drop in inflation to 18-month low in December rekindled hopes that a rate cut by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may be round the corner.

What gave the market the adrenaline rush today? 


China stimulus move and global market rally: Beijing signalled that more stimulus measures are on the way, a day after the world's second-largest economy posted weaker-than-expected December trade data. This sparked a rally in global stocks. The upbeat sentiment did not escape Indian equities, which rose in line with their global peers.


Hopes of rate cut: Retail inflation in December plunged to an 18-month low, opening door to a policy easing by the RBI. Market players turned evidently bolder. 


Buying in index heavyweights: Buying was witnessed in index heavyweights - RIL, Infosys and TCS. They together contributed over 250 points to the total Sensex gains. RIL and Infosys rose over 3 per cent whereas TCS surged over 2.50 per cent.


Robust DII inflows: Sustained buying by domestic institutional investors (DII) improved risk-on appetite. On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) offloaded shares worth Rs 732.46 crore on Monday while DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 527.49 crore. DIIs have poured nearly Rs 1,800 crore in domestic equity market in the past five trading sessions till January 14. 


Expert-take:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Market rallied supported by tax cut plan in China and ease in domestic CPI inflation to 2.19 per cent (December). Fall in 10-year yield amid moderation in inflation provides room for RBI to ease monetary policy. Nifty IT outperformed led by revised revenue outlook. FIIs remain in selling mode due to global growth concern, which will make investors stay cautious in the market.

Let's see which factors are at work.

1) 
Rate cut hopes: Sentiment remained upbeat after government data showed that retail inflation dropped to an 18-month low of 2.19 per cent in December 2018, creating more space for the RBI to cut interest rate in its monetary policy review next month.

2) 
Firm Asian cues: On the global front, Asian markets are rallying at this point of time as markets recovered from the impact of weak economic data in Europe and China on Monday that sparked concerns about slowing global growth. Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanghai advanced up to 1.50 per cent in the morning trade.

4) 
Robust DII inflows: Sustained buying by domestic institutional investors (DII) added to risk-on appetite. On a net basis, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) offloaded shares worth Rs 732.46 crore on Monday while DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 527.49 crore. DIIs have poured nearly Rs 1,800 crore in domestic equity market in the past five trading sessions till January 14.

25,2019-01-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: More than 70 years after Independence, an engineering feat by state-run transmission utility PowerGrid has made it possible for India’s northernmost areas in Jammu & Kashmir to plug into the national electricity network to bring ‘one-nation-one-grid’ closer to reality.

On Saturday, PowerGrid and Jammu and Kashmir power department switched on the Alusteng-Alunday stretch of the 350-kilometre Srinagar-Kargil-Leh transmission line tracing some of the world’s highest mountain ranges and inhospitable terrains separating the Kashmir Valley from the frontier districts of Ladakh and Kargil. Sources told TOI power flowed for four hours through the 220-Kv (kilo-volt) line and its four sub-stations connecting Leh with the northern grid at Alusteng near Srinagar.



""This is a milestone for our country. We have now connected our northernmost areas to the national grid. It is a milestone for the people of Ladakh and Kargil. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone on August 12, 2014 and it was commissioned during this government’s tenure. This is commitment to people’s welfare,"" power minister RK Singh told TOI.

The project is expected to dramatically improve the quality of life with 24X7 power supply in the strategically important region, which sees long and harsh winters with temperatures dipping to 50 degrees below freezing. Assured power supply is expected to energise economic activity and employment through winter tourism. Environment will get respite from millions of litres of diesel that is burnt by the defence and civil establishments to run generators.

Leh and Kargil towns have been getting power since 2013 from two NHPC hydel projects, built at a combined cost of nearly Rs 2,000 crore at Nimmoo-Bazgo and Chutak, respectively. Built as part of India’s strategy to exploit the potential of Indus before it enters Pakistan, the hydel stations were running at sub-optimal levels in the absence of grid connectivity. The Srinagar line will allow the stations to run at full capacity, feeding surplus power into the northern grid during summer and draw 100-150 MW in winter when reduced flow impedes generation.

In the long term, the line will help Ladakh-Kargil region emerge as India’s power house by allowing evacuation of power from proposed solar projects with aggregate capacity of 7.5 GW (giga watt).

Due to their isolated locations, Ladakh and Kargil have remained 95% power deficit regions. Habitations, including district headquarters Leh and Kargil, till recently received five hours of power supply in the evening from diesel generators and a few micro hydel projects."

Optimism stemming from Q3 earnings of blue chips, including RIL and HDFC Bank, and positive global cues created positive vibes. 

World markets did not disappoint as investors felt that China will come out with more stimulus measures to revive its economy. The world's second biggest economy grew 6.4 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis, Reuters reported. 

Monday's trade remained stock-specific as out of a total 31 stocks, including Tata Motors DVR in the Sensex index, only 11 posted gains and 20 suffered losses. 

However, the gains in the likes of RIL (up 4.36 per cent), Kotak Bank (up 2.42 per cent), Infosys (up 1.61 per cent) and HDFC Bank (up 0.72 per cent) gave Sensex a lift of 192 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 36,578.96.

RIL m-cap surges Shares of Reliance Industries extended their gains to the second consecutive session today. In the two-day rally, the stock has jumped almost 9 per cent while its market capitalisation rose by Rs 63,862 crore to Rs 7,82,505.28 crore on Monday, from Rs 7,18,643.5 crore last Thursday. The scrip closed 4.36 per cent up at Rs 1,234.50 on the BSE. Positive comments from top brokerages, following a strong December quarter earnings, have sparked strong buying in the stock.


Kotak Bank's Q3 in line
Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank settled 2.42 per cent up at Rs 1,267.30 after the private lender reported a 23 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in standalone profit at Rs 1,291 crore for the December quarter, slightly better than Rs 1,273 crore anticipated by analysts in an ETNow poll. The bank reported a healthy growth in net interest income (NII) while gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) eased on a sequential as well as yearly basis. 


HDFC Bank hits a sweet spot
Domestic as well as global brokerages maintained their bullish view on HDFC Bank after it posted 20 per cent growth in net profit for the third quarter ended December.

Revenue jumped 21.9 per cent at Rs 1,310.5 crore on a year-on-year basis.


LIC wraps up IDBI Bank buy 
In a BSE filing, IDBI Bank said LIC has completed acquisition of 51 per cent controlling stake in the bank, making it the lender's majority shareholder. The Cabinet had approved the acquisition of controlling stake by LIC as a promoter in IDBI Bank through a combination of preferential allotment and open offer of equity in August last year. However, the report failed to lift shares of IDBI Bank as the scrip closed 3.17 per cent down at Rs 56.50 on BSE, extending the losses to the third successive session.


Wipro slips 2%
Shares of Wipro closed 2.51 per cent down at Rs 337.50 as the company lowered margin guidance for its IT services business in the range of $2,047 million to $2,088 million for the March quarter, which translates into a flat 2 per cent sequential growth. Citi has advised that one should adopt a 'sell into strength' approach on the stock. Global brokerage CLSA has also retained sell rating given lack of convincing acceleration in growth. 


L&T shares wilt 
Shares of Larsen & Toubro closed in the red after market regulator Sebi turned down its Rs 9,000 crore share buyback offer. The scrip closed 0.31 per cent down at Rs 1,314.20. In a regulatory filing to stock exchanges on Saturday, L&T said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked it not to proceed with the proposed buyback of up to 6.1 crore shares at a price of Rs 1,475 per share, aggregating Rs 9,000 crore.


Hindustan Zinc shares slide 
Shares of Hindustan zinc closed 1.56 per cent down at Rs 268.15 after it reported a nearly 4 per cent fall in its net profit on a yearly basis. Net profit declined nearly 4 per cent to Rs 2,211 crore against Rs 2,298 crore a year ago. 


Energy pack wins big
With a gain of 2.68 per cent, the BSE Energy index led the pack of sectoral gainers. However, only seven out of the total 27 components of the index managed to log gains. Nevertheless, the index jumped, thanks to gains in heavyweight Reliance Industries. 

On the other hand, BSE Realty index fell 1.22 per cent, leading the pack of sectoral losers. Losses in shares of Indiabulls Real Estate (down 5.12 per cent), Prestige Estates Projects (down 2.98 per cent) and DLF (down 1.69 per cent) dragged the index most.

38,2019-01-23,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government has opened 52 new coal mines since coming to power in May 2014 to fuel its flagship village and household electrification programmes without tripping the system, officials told TOI.

These 52 mines represent 86% growth over the number of mines added in the five-year period between 2009 and 2014, when most projects were stuck in red tape, especially pertaining to environment and forest clearances, before the NDA government took over.

The officials said structural reforms in the government's functioning since 2014 made it possible to quickly open such a large number of coal mines, a cumbersome process involving approvals and permissions from various statutory authorities.



The new mines have added 164 MT (million tonne) to India's annual coal production capacity, marking 113% increase over capacity added during the 2009-2014 period. Since 57% of power is generated in India by burning coal, these mines allowed the government to rapidly move towards universal electricity access without creating shortages.

This is borne out by data in the Central Electricity Authority's latest annual report, which shows demand-supply gap narrowing to 0.7% in 2018, down by 90% from 2009-10 level, and energy supply rising 120% over the 2004-2005 period. But for these new mines, this would not have been possible as the electrification drive has been pushing up demand for power by 5-6%.

On December 19, coal and railway minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament in a written reply that all-India coal production stood at 433.9 MT during the April-November period of 2018-19 financial year, indicating a growth rate of 9.8%. During the same period, state-run Coal India Limited's production stood at more than 358 MT, marking a growth rate of 8.8% over the previous corresponding period.

In April, the government completed the task of hooking up all the 18,452 un-electrified inhabited villages to the national power grid under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. It is now in the process of bringing power to all households without electricity by giving free connections under the Saubhagya scheme. So far, 91.9% of the 2.48 crore households identified without power have been electrified."

39,2019-01-24,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Key equity indices Sensex and Nifty traded flat in the opening deals on Thursday, tracking lacklustre global cues as political uncertainty in the US and worries about weakening global economic growth weighed on investor sentiment.

Asian shares were subdued this morning with major indices trading marginally lower. 

The rupee traded with a nominal gains against the US dollar which failed to give any fillip to market. The domestic unit opened 7 paise higher at 71.26 against the US dollar on account of some selling in American currency by banks and exporters. 

After jumping about 70 points in the opening deals, Sensex gave up gains soon, falling over 40 points. 

Around 9:30 am, the 30-share Sensex was 31 points, or 0.09 per cent, down at 36,077.41, while Nifty was 11 points, or 0.10 per cent, down at 10,820.90. 

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were up 0.08 per cent and 0.03 per cent, respectively, at that time.

Tata Motors, Infosys, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra and Coal India were among the top losers in the Sensex index, each falling over 1 per cent.

ITC, on the other hand, climbed over 1 per cent and was leading the pack of Sensex gainers around that time. 

Shares of Power Grid, NTPC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp also traded with gains.

Among the sectoral indices, BSE Realty climbed over 1 per cent on gains in shares of DLF, Oberoi Realty, Sunteck Realty, Prestige Estates Projects and Indiabulls Real Estate.

BSE Metal index, on the other hand, fell over 1 per cent, with all components in the red. Jindal Steel & Power, Coal India, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Nalco were among the top losers in the index. 

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 775.82 crore crore worth of domestic stocks on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 583.77 crore, data suggested.

41,2019-01-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian headline indices Sensex and Nifty soared higher in opening deals as sentiment got a leg up from corporate earnings and firm Asian peers.

Asian stocks rose across the board on Friday, buoyed by gains in US technology shares while investors awaited several key events next week including US-China trade talks, Reuters reported.

Rupee's gain against the US dollar also influenced the mood. 

Sensex surged nearly 280 points and Nifty breached 10,930 in early trade on an all-round buying. 

Around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was 231 points, or 0.64 per cent, up at 36,426, with 27 stocks in the green and only four in the red.

The Nifty index was 70 points, or 0.64 per cent, up at 10,919, with 42 stocks advancing and eight declining.



BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices climbed up to 0.39 per cent.

Shares of YES Bank rallied as much as 10 per cent, leading the pack of Sensex gainers, after the lender on Thursday named Ravneet Singh Gill as the managing director and chief executive officer to succeed Rana Kapoor, whose term ends on January 31.

However, the bank posted a 6.96 per cent dip in net profit at Rs 1,001.85 crore for the quarter ended December 2018. It had posted a net profit of Rs 1,076.87 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2017-18.

Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech, Axis Bank, Sun Pharma and Power Grid, too, were among the top gainers in the Sensex index. 

Shares of Hero MotoCorp and ICICI Bank were trading in the red.

The CBI on Thursday booked former ICICI Bank head Chanda Kochhar on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and abuse of official position for “dishonestly sanctioning loans to the Videocon Group”. 

All sectoral indices were in the green, with BSE Telecom jumping nearly 2 per cent on gains in shares of Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, Sterlite Technologies, HFCL and ITI.

42,2019-01-28,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Index heavyweights played spoilsport on Dalal Street on Monday, dragging the benchmarks lower by over a per cent lower. This was the second day of fall for the key indices.

Markets shrugged off favourable macro cues in the form of plunging crude oil prices and a strengthening rupee. Other Asian and European peers too slipped ahead of the crucial US-China trade talks and Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

The BSE Sensex shut shop with a loss of 369 points, 1.02 per cent, at 35,657 while the NSE Nifty came off 119 points to settle at 10,661.

Market at a glance:


Who moved the Sensex?
Among Sensex stocks, only seven advanced while 23 slipped. TCS was the top gainer, rising 2 per cent. Coal India, L&T, Power Grid and Asian Paints followed. YES Bank was the top index drag, falling 5.46 per cent. Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Hero MotoCorp and Sun Pharma slipped up to 5.40 per cent.


IL&FS fears still persist
Most of the financial stocks bled on fears of continuing exposure to IL&FS. Even housing finance companies witnessed a similar fate, with Deewan Housing Finance slipping 11.64 per cent. 


Canara profit soared, but stock fell
Canara Bank posted a 152 per cent YoY rise in net profit at Rs 318 crore for the December quarter as against Rs 126 crore reported in the corresponding quarter year ago. However, the stock slipped 5.23 per cent in today's session.


ZEE Entertainment rebounds
The shares of ZEE Entertainment rebounded today after the company said it has reached a deal with lenders on pledged shares. The company said 96-97 per cent of the lenders have agreed not to invoke shares if the shares fall further. After the agreement, the company has not pledged further shares as collateral after Friday’s sharp fall, said CEO Punit Goenka said in an investor call. The stock closed the session 16.64 per cent higher.


Mid, smallcaps have a sob story
Midcaps and smallcaps shed nearly 2 per cent in today's session and underperformed the benchmark Sensex. Midcap index closed 1.84 per cent lower while smallcap index was down 1.99 per cent.


Sectoral view
Basic materials, healthcare and finance each shed over 2 per cent. Only IT and teck managed to close in the green today. 


Factors behind the fall


Weak global markets
Major European bourses fell, mirroring a retreat for Asian stocks as concerns over Chinese growth outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the US government shutdown late last week. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul all losing ground, according to Reuters. 


Crucial US-China trade talk
The crucial US-China trade talks are scheduled to take place later in the week and the investors have assumed cautious positions until any further announcement. 


Financial stocks bleed
Financials and bank stocks plunged the most today as fears of IL&FS default continue to plague market. IB Ventures was the worst drag in the NSE Financials index while all stocks ended in the red in the Nifty private bank index. 


Poor Q3 show
The December quarter earnings failed to impress investors and this acted as one of the major forces behind a dent in investor sentiment. Among key results, HDFC, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv are among top companies expected to report quarterly numbers.


Expert-take:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 
""Market slid below 10,700 mark as uncertainty over global trade negotiation and US Fed policy later this week added volatility. Any progress in US-China trade deal and a dovish view from FOMC meet amid global growth concern may provide respite to the investor’s dilemma. Additionally, weak set of earnings from auto major and selling in banks marked the tone of domestic indices.""

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking
""Domestic benchmarks opened on a negative note with the market breadth in favour of the sellers. A majority of the sector indices were trading in the red while mid-cap and small-cap shares underperformed its larger peer. Market breadth was in the ratio of 1:4 in favor of the sellers and the market ended 1% lower. The rupee appreciated against the dollar as crude prices declined by 1.8 per cent to trade at $60.5 per barrel. The upcoming week will be crucial because of the Budget presentation, US Fed policy meet and the resumption in the US-China trade talks.""

Viral Berawala, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund
""Global markets sold post comments by the US president that another shutdown is an option if agreement with Democrats is not reached. Indian markets also reacted to this negative cues with all sectoral indices in the red with Nifty Pharma being the biggest loser followed by Bank Nifty. Markets are also worried about the government straying from its fiscal consolidation path in the interim Budget."""

The campus which houses over 3,000 R&D employees will draw 88% of its power requirement from a solar farm in Kalburgi district in Karnataka, about 500 km away from the city.

In December 2018, Samsung R&D Institute in Bengaluru, which is also Samsung’s largest R&D centre outside of Korea, adopted the green energy solution through ‘energy wheeling’.

Samsung R&D Institute initiated the process of going solar in March 2016 as part of its Go Green Initiative to increase usage of non-conventional energy sources for its campus. This would reduce itss reliance on the traditional power grid, making that energy available for other uses, the company said in a press release.

 “Our switch to solar power is an embodiment of Samsung values of being a socially and environmentally responsible citizen. Through this initiative we have not only reduced our dependency on conventional sources of energy but we will also have a positive impact on the environment by reducing our carbon footprint and passing on a greener planet to the next generation,” said Dipesh Shah, Managing Director at the institute."

2,2019-02-04,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: It's stock specific action that saved the day for Dalal Street on Monday. 

Strong gains in Reliance Industries in the late afternoon session turned it around, which helped key domestic indices offset their losses earlier in the day. Heavy buying in RIL came despite caution ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy review. 

This was the third straight day of gain for the Sensex and Nifty. However, BSE advance-decline ratio signalled underlying bearishness in the market.

The Sensex closed the day 113 points or 0.31 per cent higher at 36,583 while NSE Nifty settled the day at 10,912, up 19 points or 0.17 per cent. Among Sensex stocks, only 12 ended the day in the green while 18 in the red.

RIL contributed 139 points to the Sensex's upside. ONGC, Bajaj Auto, Kotak Bank, TCS, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Maruti, HDFC and HUL surged up to 3.03 per cent.

However, lacklustre European markets kept domestic bourses on a tight leash.

Broader indices dropped into the red. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap came off by up to 1.17 per cent.


Market in a nutshell:


RIL throws a lifeline
Oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries proved to be the white knight today. The stock ended the day up 3.45 per cent at Rs 1,219.15. 


Private banks recover
Most private bank stocks languished early on. As the day progressed, they witnessed sharp recovery though. Bank stocks had taken a knock on Friday as well on fears of higher market borrowing by the government. 


The loser's pack
Power Grid was the worst Sensex performer, with a loss of 3.13 per cent. Other losers include YES Bank, Sun Pharma, NTPC, M&M and ITC, which lost by up to 3.10 per cent.


Midcaps, smallcaps suffer
Midcap and smallcap indices did not measure up as they declined 0.82 per cent and 1.17 per cent, respectively. 


Sectoral watch
Riding on the back of gains in RIL and ONGC, the energy index logged the highest gains on the BSE. The index climbed 2.24 per cent. Consumer Durables, oil & gas, bankex and IT were among other indices that rose too. Meanwhile, utilities and power declined over 2 per cent each and were the worst sectoral performers.


Global cues
World stocks remained near two-month highs on Monday with the dollar and oil chalking up gains though some European bourses struggled as momentum from last week's US employment and manufacturing data bounce started to fade. The pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.1 per cent in early trading with Paris' CAC and Frankfurt's DAX both slipping around 0.2-0.3 per cent.


Expert-take:


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesMarket rallied from the day’s low, led by a few set of domestic focussed companies, oriented towards consumption and private banks. This is in line with the Interim Budget while additionally, market is also looking at the upcoming RBI policy, hoping for a change in stance from ‘Calibrated Tightening’ to ‘Neutral’. Overall, it continues in a range of 10,980 to 10,600 on the Nifty.

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice BrokingWhile the market traded in the red for most of the day, it made a strong recovery in the late afternoon session and turned positive. Strong buying in index heavyweight stocks like Reliance, TCS and HDFC Bank supported the market. However, gains were capped amid negative sentiment across the broader market. Small and mid cap indices managed to recover some losses... The rupee was under pressure as crude rose by more than $3 over the weekend to trade at $63.4 per barrel. In the ongoing earning season, stock specific movement continues to dominate the market trend.


Viral Berawala, CIO, Essel Mutual FundGlobal markets continued with the risk on rally seen in the past few days as investors await fresh catalysts following solid American economic data on Friday and inconclusive trade talks in Washington. The Nifty traded in the green recovering from its lows with private banking stocks seeing some recovery today after Friday's fall on fear of higher borrowing by the government. Pharma and metal were the big losers of the day. Midcap and smallcap indices continued to underperform large cap indices as seen in the last few days. Indian markets would keenly watch the RBI MPC meet outcome this week and global cues for further direction."

6,2019-02-07,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: RBI's decision to slash repo rate by 25 basis points in its bi-monthly policy meet failed to charm investors as key domestic indices settled flat on Thursday, but not before witnessing deep swings.

The Reserve Bank, led by new Governor Shaktikanta Das, changed the monetary policy stance to 'neutral' from the earlier 'calibrated tightening', hinting at lower rates if inflation remains under control. 

The Sensex ended 4 points lower at 36,971, reversing its five-day winning streak. The NSE Nifty ended in positive territory for the sixth straight day, up 7 points at 11,069.

Gains in Sun Pharma, ITC and Bajaj Auto were offset by losses in RIL and HDFC duo. In the 30-pack Sensex, 11 scrips lost and 19 looked up.


Here's a glance at how the market stacked up today.


The winners
Sun Pharma was the top gainer on the Sensex as it ended 4.48 per cent higher at Rs 434, buoyed by solid numbers from its subsidiary Taro Pharma for the December quarter. Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Coal India, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and M&M were among others that advanced. Most of the rate-sensitive auto stocks gained on RBI's decision to lower rates.


The loser pack
Reliance Industries was the worst performing in the Sensex bag, followed by Power Grid, HDFC, L&T, IndusInd Bank and NTPC. These stocks declined up to 1.50 per cent. 


ADAG stocks bleed
The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group stocks lay bruised and battered for another day, plunging up to 28 per cent.

Market turned volatile after the announcement of RBI's monetary policy as investors started booking profit from the recent rally. Market has gained well in the last one week by 5 per cent while 10,950–10,850 will be the immediate support. The change in stance to neutral was in line with expectations, but rate cut was a surprise.

At least 12 Nifty companies reported their highest quarterly profits this earnings season. They included Reliance Industries, TCS, Asian Paints, Titan, HDFC Bank and Bajaj twins Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv.

Most of them also reported highest-ever sales for a quarter. While not all of these companies are a outright ‘buy’ calls, analysts do fancy most of these counters, earnings reviews by analysts showed. 

This season Reliance Industries became the first private sector firm to report Rs 10,000 crore quarterly profit. The number of analysts recommending a ‘buy’ rating on the stock has jumped to 12 from nine a month ago, Reuters data showed. Analysts recommending a ‘sell’ rating on the scrip fell to two from four. The scrip has topped Nifty50 performance chart, rising 17 per cent in last one month.

RIL’s consolidated profit for the quarter stood at Rs 10,251 crore, beating Street estimate by 7.7 per cent. Sales were highest ever at Rs 1.71 lakh crore.

At FY20 PE multiple of 13.6 times, the scrip looks attractive, says YES Securities.

“RIL is our top pick in the oil & gas space, as we see benefits from refinery-petchem integration playing out in a tough macro environment and RJio and retail scaling up operations,” IIFL Institutional Equities said in a note.

Analysts are painting a rosy picture for Asian Paints too.

The number of brokerages recommending ‘outperform’ rating on the stock has jumped to 15 from 12 a month ago. The company’s record profits and sales were fuelled by nearly 20 per cent volume growth, which was the highest the company has witnessed since FY11.

“Though near-term headwind in the form of general elections could pose a challenge, Asian Paints’ long-term theme of market shift from unorganised to organised hands and premiumisation remain intact,” Reliance Securities said.

Bajaj Finance managed to impress Street with a 54 per cent jump in quarterly profit. JM Financial said the NBFC is well-positioned to deliver sustainable profit growth driven by strong customer acquisition, increasing rural footprint with diversified product offering, rising contribution of fee income, superior asset quality and a well-capitalised CAR of 21 per cent. 

Analysts have showed faith in ITC, as the scrip has slipped 2 per cent in last one month. Citi says Dalal Street may be missing the point that the margin lever for a business is price, and not volumes. Cigarette volume recovery builds the base for price hikes, they said, adding that the company’s diversification drive will pay off soon.

“High cash generation has enabled ITC to invest aggressively in other fast-growing businesses, enabling it to diversify into other, non-stringent segments. We expect revenues and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 10.2 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, in FY18-21E,” said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. 


Others
Tata Group firm Titan is another stock analysts are positive on. This jewellery maker has given guidance for 22 per cent growth in jewellery business in FY19. The number of brokerages recommending an outperform rating on the stock has increased to 17 from 14 a month ago. Calls recommending a hold rating on the stock have fallen to 3 from 5.

Brokerages are not that bullish on another Tata Group firm, TCS.

December quarter sales and profit of India’s most-valued listed firm came in at Rs 37,338 crore and Rs 8,121 crore, respectively. The target price for the stock has been cut by up to 16 per cent, as the software major’s margins failed to cheer investors despite record sales and profit.

Another IT firm Wipro has seen brokerages raise price targets on higher-than-expected margin growth in December quarter. But increased price targets are not enough to trigger ‘buy’ calls. Most brokerages have either retained ‘sell’ or ‘neutral’ rating on the stock due to muted guidance for fourth quarter, as growth continues to lag peers.

The numbers of analysts giving buy ratings on the stock has fallen to one from two a month ago, while analysts with ‘hold’ ratings has jumped to 17 from 15 and those with ‘underperform’ rating have risen to 10 from 9.

7,2019-02-08,PowerGrid,"Troubled-KSK Mahanadi Power Company may get a shot in the arm as the Uttar Pradesh power distribution company is considering committed cash payments to the company in exchange of a discount on price of power purchased; but the development can potentially be a roadblock for the former’s suitor, Adani Group.

The Gautam Adani-led group had emerged as the best bidder to acquire three stressed power projects, including KSK Mahanadi, out of the seven projects that were considered for resolution outside of the insolvency code. But in a new development, UPPCL, which buys a third of the power generated from KSK Mahanadi is considering committed cash flow to the company which will help the latter meet its financial commitments, in lieu of a 32 paise per unit discount from February 1. The discount on power price could impact Adani’s acquisition plan and may need some recalculation of valuation, industry experts said.

Emails sent to Adani Group and KSK remained unanswered.

UPPCL management had expressed concerns as low supplies from KSK Mahanadi, which runs a power plant in Chhattisgarh, had resulted into high delivered cost. To which the management of the beleaguered power company said that the short supply has led to high penalties for the unit which has translated into higher delivered cost.

KSK Mahanadi told UPPCL that as a result of non-payment from them, the power generator was unable to meet their payment obligation with Power Grid Corporation of India, which operates the transmission lines and were unable to buy sufficient coal.

In a meeting held at UPPCL office on January 31, the management of the state agency and KSK Mahanadi chalked out a plan to help increase the power supply for the unit and make it competitive

“UPPCL agreed that there is a need to provide sufficient cash flow by which the plant can meet its obligation towards its operations, viz, transmission charges to PGCIL and coal and operation and maintenance payments which was hampering dispatch, although the plant was technically available,” the minutes of the said meeting stated.

UPPCL will pay the company Rs 43 crore for payment to PGCIL, and commit cash flow of Rs 1,075 crore -Rs 1,220 crore in monthly instalments of Rs 150 crore – Rs 300 crore between February and June. A source directly involved in the negotiations told ET that the proposal is yet to be approved by UPPCL since it has to assess whether its own cash flows can support this payment schedule. UPPCL also said it will look at payments to the company on “priority basis.”

KSK Mahanadi is also exploring other options to arrange finances to supplement the bill payment by UPPCL and give a bill discount of Rs 500 crore by the end of March.

The 3,600 mw Mahanadi Power Company has so far commissioned 3,135 mw and sells power to Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The company has reportedly accumulated debt of Rs 17,194 crore, even as cash flows remained muted. The project was the the biggest project of Hyderabad headquartered- KSK Energy Ventures, accounting for 80% of the company’s total capacity. But in May last year, lenders to the project and its supporting special purpose vehicles, invoked the pledged shares in KSK Mahanadi, and it seized to be a subsidiary of KSK Energy Ventures."

9,2019-02-08,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Headline Indices Sensex and Nifty opened in the negative territory on Friday as the sentiment was sombre due to disappointing third quarter number by Tata Motors and weak global cues.

Tata Motors, India’s largest automaker by revenue, posted its highest quarterly loss of Rs 26,961 crore due to a one-time impairment charge of Rs 27,838 crore on account of its dominant UK-based Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit, which has been hit by a sales slump in China and faces headwinds such as Brexit.

13,2019-02-11,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Owing to stable economic growth, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has maintained a stable outlook on the infrastructure sector, except thermal power, for financial year 2020.

According to the rating agency, despite reasonable energy demand, fuel supply-related issues and constricted demand restrain plant load factor (PLF) of thermal plants to around 62 percent.

""We have maintained a stable outlook on the infrastructure sector for FY20 mainly on the back of stable economic growth, which underpins road and airport traffic volumes,"" its director Global Infrastructure Siva Subramanian said.

While maintaining a stable outlook for the road sector, Ind-Ra, Subramanian said economic growth-driven traffic and inflation-led toll rates revision support the toll roads sector.

""2019 being an election year, we do not see many road projects being tendered on the hybrid annuity model (HAM). On the contrary, we will see more of EPC projects. Also, along with the economic growth, we have also witnessed a growth in traffic,"" he said.

In few assets, corridor specific issues such as embargoes on sand/iron ore mining and local political issues dented traffic, could lead to slower recovery.

""However, with peak order book to revenue ratio, FY20 would be a litmus test for some developers. While availability-based roads are stable, mushrooming minor maintenance issues and increased oversight standards reinforce timely maintenance. Therefore, financial health of the operation and maintenance operator remains a key monitorable for the investors/developers,"" Subramanian said.

For the airports, he said, the sector continues to witness strong passenger growth, however, capacity constraints at many airports could start affecting their operational parameters.

Ind-Ra expects ratings of solar projects to inch up in FY2020, especially for projects with strong counter parties, on timely construction completion and demonstration of stable operations.

Maintaining a negative outlook for the thermal power sector, the agency noted that plants dependent on availability-based payments will remain at risk of coal availability, given the sticky inventory level of about 10 days across all major plants in the country.

For transmission sector, Ind-Ra expects stable performance backed by demonstrated availably levels in the past, to claim full revenue as per transmission services agreement.

""However, some under performance is seen in payment realisation from Power Grid Corporation in April-September 2018, and realisation below 95 per cent for the whole of FY2019 may have some negative rating implications, if improvement is not seen for a prolonged time period,"" he added."
11,2019-02-11,PowerGrid,"Wind developers have begun acquiring more expensive private land in Gujarat for central government projects as the state continues to go slow on leasing out land to them.

Over the past several months, Gujarat has been giving preference to projects bid out by the state-run discom GUVNL and being reluctant to lease out revenue land to the winners of auctions conducted by central agencies.

Since Gujarat is one of the best wind-producing states, half of the 7,000MW of wind projects auctioned last year by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a nodal agency under the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE), are expected to come up there.

The developers are also finding it difficult to get all the private land they need for their projects at one spot and are distributing the projects far and wide. Each megawatt of a wind project takes about 0.75 acre. “We have identified about 50 locations for projects we’ve won where we will buy private land. Revenue land in one location costs about Rs 10 lakh, while private land costs five times as much,” a developer, who had won a recent SECI auction, said on the condition of anonymity. “Private landowners know that we are facing this issue in Gujarat. So, they are raising the prices.”

Another developer said: “We have begun the process of talking to our contractors about acquiring private land.”

The state government had earlier said the matter would be resolved once its land policy on renewable energy projects was finalised. The policy, which was released last week, has provided clarity on how future projects should be built, saying that they should all be constructed at designated wind, solar or wind-solar hybrid parks, and not at randomly leased sites as before. But there has been no change on-ground so far, and the developers are worried about failing to meet their deadlines.

“MNRE should tell us which are the most suitable areas (within the parks), and we’ll agree to that,” said a senior Gujarat government functionary dealing with the issue.

Developers who had managed to get government land for part of their projects and begun construction, are unsure whether they will get the remaining land or will be forced to relocate the entire project to another spot.

“Developers who have built part of their projects in Gujarat, can always take the rest to somewhere else in the country. The ministry should be able to take care of these problems. This isn’t our responsibility. We were not consulted when SECI held its auctions,” the official said.

Instead, the official was worried about the responsibility of providing transmission facilities also falling on the state. “Who will build the transmission lines for the SECI projects? That again will be a problem. Developers’ demands won’t end with land.”

Another developer said that since SECI projects are connected to the Central Transmission Utility (CTU), the state will face no problem. “It is the responsibility of the developer to get the transmission from Power Grid (PGCIL),” he said."

While India’s largest HDFC AMC was seen buying PSU stocks such as Union Bank, NTPC, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC and Punjab National Bank, second largest fund ICICI Prudential added shares of Power Grid, NHPC, GAIL, SBI and HPCL. SBI Mutual Fund, the third largest, bought fresh shares of SBI, NTPC and ONGC, among others, data compiled from database Ace Mutual Fund showed.

PSU stocks have had a poor start to 2019, with the benchmark BSE PSU Index falling 4.58 per cent in January and another 3.26 per cent so far in February. This was against a 0.52 per cent rise in BSE Sensex in January and 0.79 per cent jump so far this month. Analysts say some of the PSUs look very attractive due to lower valuations.

HDFC AMC bought 76.49 lakh shares of Union Bank in January, as the exposure of its schemes to the PSU bank rose to Rs 398 crore at the end of January from Rs 348 crore last month. This was HDFC’s top buy in January in terms of number of shares purchased.



Out of the top 10 stocks HDFC AMC bought (in terms of number of shares) during the month, five were PSUs.

Their valuations relative the Nifty were compelling at a 50 per cent discount, it said. 

ICICI Prudential bought 2.14 crore shares in NTPC, raising total holding to 43.21 crore at the end of January, up 5.2 per cent in a month. Its holding in ONGC jumped 7.78 per cent, or by 2 crore shares, to 25.70 crore shares. In value terms, it held Rs 6,000 crore worth of NTPC shares and Rs 3,900 crore worth of ONGC shares as of January 31.



In BHEL, the fund house raising its holding by 50 per cent. IOC and Coal India were the other PSUs where the fund raised its holding. 

""Coal India is a proverbial value play with 8.5 per cent dividend yield. December quarter earnings will be the best in 18 quarters. At 11 times PE, I have never seen it cheaper. Obviously, there is an overhang that the government may sell some of its stake. But PSU stocks such as ONGC, NTPC, GMDC and Coal India are trading at abysmal levels. Once we are through these elections, PSUs will create a lot of wealth in the second half of 2019. Because they will then be focussed on governance,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL told ET Now. 



SBI MF was seen buying shares in SBI, NTPC and ONGC during the month. “Concerns over rising fiscal deficit, cross-holdings and PSUs being called to do national duties were the key reasons for the de-rating. However, a lot of the bad news is in the price, and select PSUs now offer favourable risk-reward, especially as we see the risk of slowing domestic flows driving a market derating,” CLSA said in January note."
18,2019-02-13,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Positive global sentiment and favourable macroeconomic data prints cheered the domestic equity market on Wednesday, helping benchmarks Sensex and Nifty register healthy gains in opening deals.

India’s CPI inflation rose at a milder pace than anticipated in January and remained well below the Reserve Bank of India’s target for the sixth straight month, which strengthened views that the central bank could again cut key interest rates at its next policy review in April. 

Sensex jumped over 220 points whereas Nifty topped 10,890 in early deals as a fresh spell of buying emerged in most sectors. Annual retail inflation for January rose 2.05 per cent, its slowest pace since June 2017 

Industrial production jumped to 2.4 per cent in December 2018 from 0.5 per cent in November 2018, driven mainly by a spike in the manufacturing index, which rose to 2.7 per cent against -0.4 per cent month-on-month. 

Easing retail inflation gave a fillip to the rupee too. The domestic currency extended its gains into the seventh straight session as it opened 21 paise higher at 70.50 against the US dollar.

Elsewhere, Asian stocks edged up to hit a more than four-month high on Wednesday, amid optimism that the US and China might be able to hammer out a deal to resolve their nearly year-long trade dispute, Reuters reported.

Around 9:25 am, Sensex traded 162 points, or 0.45 per cent, higher at 36,315, while Nifty50 was up 47 points, or 0.43 per cent, at 10,878. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices up 0.44 per cent and 0.39 per cent, respectively, at that time.

Sun Pharma, ITC, Power Grid, Vedanta, ONGC and Tata Motors were leading among Sensex gainers. On the other hand, Hero MotoCorp, Bharti Airtel, Infosys, Axis Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra were in the red in the Sensex index.

Most sectoral indices were in the green, with BSE Realty and FMCG rising over 1 per cent. BSE Telecom, on the other hand, fell 1 per cent due to losses in shares of index majors, including Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 467 crore worth of domestic stocks on Tuesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 123 crore, data suggested."
19,2019-02-13,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Stock indices continued to fall on Wednesday, despite opening on a positive note, shrugging off bullish global cues and firm macroeconomic data back home.

Key indices traded higher for most of the session, only to give up gains in the last hour of trade, as index heavyweights came under heavy selling pressure. Lack of earnings revival, spike in crude prices and bearishness in broader markets continue to hit mood.

BSE Sensex ended the day 120 points or 0.33 per cent lower at 36,034 with 20 stocks in the red and 10 in the green. Its NSE counterpart Nifty shed 38 points or 0.35 per cent to settle at 10,794. 


Market at a glance:
Gainers & losers>> RIL, L&T, ICICI Bank and SBI were the major drags on Sensex.

>> ONGC was the worst performing stock by shedding 2.84 per cent, followed by SBI, Power Grid, L&T and YES Bank.

>> Tata Motors was the top index gainer. The scrip rose 2.18 per cent. HDFC, HCL Tech, Infosys, ITC and HDFC Bank were among other index that settled higher. 


Stock WatchCG Power shares declined 32 per cent in intraday trade to settle 29.63 per cent lower after the company said its consolidated net loss widened to Rs 150.18 crore for December quarter.

HEG too ended with significant losses even as the firm posted stellar Q3 earnings on Tuesday. The scrip closed at Rs 2,212.70, down 7.92 per cent on the BSE.


Minnows fall againBoth midcap and smallcap indices fell in line with benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap index slipped 0.52 per cent while BSE Smallcap shed 0.38 per cent. 


Sectoral WatchBarring IT, teck and realty, all other sectors on the BSE witnessed losses with BSE Oil & Gas leading the losers. The index shed 2.11 per cent. OMC stocks declined following a rise in crude oil prices. BSE Capital Goods, BSE Energy, BSE Consumer Durables, BSE Power and BSE Metals were other losers and shed over a per cent each.


Factors at play:>> 
Earnings disappointment
Barring a few names, most of the companies reported subdued December quarter numbers, denting investor sentiment. Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President at Sharekhan said that overall growth numbers did not meet market expectations. 

>> 
Nifty slips below 50-DMA
Nifty slipped below the crucial 50-DMA at 10,816. Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA at Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services had said on Tuesday that any breach of this level will open some more downside. 

>> 
Crude oil rises 
Brent oil prices rose on Wednesday, after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper cut to its production, while US futures gained on a decline in domestic oil inventories. Brent crude futures rose 88 cents to $63.30 a barrel by 0950 GMT, while US crude oil futures gained 66 cents to trade at $53.76 a barrel.

>> 
Rupee snaps gains
On a rise in crude oil prices, the rupee snapped its six-day winning streak and slipped against the US dollar. The domestic unit had opened over 20 paise higher against the dollar.


Expert Take:
Despite cooling of CPI inflation in January to 2.05 per cent and pick-up in Industrial Production for December 2018 by 2.4 per cent failed to create positive momentum in the market. Given mixed Q3 results, market is factoring further earnings downgrades, leading to outflows from FIIs and DIIs- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

We continue to maintain a cautious stance in the near term with lack of any major positive triggers and uncertain global cues. On the domestic front, investors would focus on last leg of Q3FY19 earnings season and WPI data. Further, investors would keep an eye on the progress of trade talks between the US and China, behaviour of crude oil prices and fluctuation in currency. We advise investors to focus on fundamentally sound companies with strong financials and healthy prospects- Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking"

Tepid corporate earnings and lacklustre US retail sales did not help matters much. Global cues too did not paint a rosy picture.

Uncertainty over US-China trade deal further kept risk appetite at bay. 

The BSE Sensex fell as much as 365 points during the day on broad-based selling across sectors, but recouped much of the losses to end 67 points lower at 35,809. This was the seventh straight day of loss for the 30-share index. The barometer ended 2.03 per cent lower for the week. 

Meanwhile, its NSE counterpart Nifty ended the day at 10,724, down 22 points.

Global shares lay low amid disappointing data from the world's two biggest economies - the US and China. Rising crude, a falling rupee and a possible escalation in tension between India and Pakistan after the latest terrorist attack hit investor sentiment hard. 



Market at a glance

Among Sensex stocks, 12 settled higher and 18 in the red. Sun Pharma was the top loser with a fall of 3.94 per cent, along with Tata Steel, Vedanta, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Finance and SBI. 

NTPC, Power Grid, ONGC, RIL and L&T looked up though, rising up to 4.13 per cent. 

Shares of pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories plunged as much as 29.78 per cent to Rs 1,872.95. The shares had last hit this level on October 15, 2001. However, the scrip recovered ground to end 4.17 per cent lower on the NSE. 

Jefferies said the 11 observations found under Form 483 on company's Bachupally manufacturing unit includes four repeat observations, including one repeated from 2015 and 2017. The observations are around lack of thorough investigations, written records lacking details, employees not being trained and lack of infrastructure. 

Metals and healthcare were the worst hit on the BSE today, declining over 2 per cent each. On the other hand, power and utilities were the leading sectoral performers, gaining over 2 per cent each. 

Midcaps and smallcaps suffered more than the Sensex. BSE Midcap ended 1.18 per cent lower while BSE Smallcap was 0.83 per cent down.



Factors that moved markets:


Rupee slide continues
Rupee continued to slide against the US dollar on Friday amid rising crude prices and fears of a possible escalation in geopolitical tensions here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday warned Pakistan of a strong response to a car bomb attack on a military convoy in Kashmir. The domestic unit declined 29 paise in intraday session to hit a low of 71.44. It had settled at 71.15 on Thursday. 


Boiling oil cools
Brent crude oil prices slipped away from 2019 highs above $65 per barrel reached earlier on Friday as economic concerns countered Opec-led supply cuts and a partial shutdown of Saudi Arabia’s biggest offshore oil field, according to a Reuters report. Brent rose as far as $65.10, pushing past the $65 mark for the first time this year, before falling back to $64.69 by 0751 GMT. That was still 0.2 per cent above the last close.


Weakness in global markets
Asian stocks fell on Friday, retreating from four-month highs after data out of China raised concerns over deflationary pressures building in the world's second-biggest economy. The equity markets had already been under pressure after weak US retail sales figures triggered fresh doubts about the strength of the world's largest economy, stated a Reuters report.


Emergence of low-level buying
After declining nearly a per cent, the benchmark indices saw low-level buying with NSE flagship Nifty recovering from near 10,600 levels while the BSE Sensex rebounded from 35,500 level. ""A negative candle was formed today with long lower shadow. This daily candle is resembling a bullish hammer, but not a classical one. Hence, today's pattern is signaling an emergence of some buying interest from near 10600 level,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC securities.



Expert-take
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Market slid due to broad-based selling across sectors as rising yield and weak rupee cast cloud over investor’s sentiment. Volatility may continue due to lack of positive triggers in the domestic market while rising oil prices will impact domestic macros in the near term. Global markets turned negative due to obstacles in the US-China trade deal."

The Nifty50 index opened in the positive on Friday, but failed to hold previous day’s high of 10,792 and drifted sharply towards the 10,620 mark. However, it recovered sharply from lower levels and managed to reclaim the 10,720 level. The index has been making lower highs and lows for last six sessions and needs to negate the same to get a short-term trend reversal after the recent decline of around 500 points from its swing high of 11,118.

The index formed a Hammer candle on the daily scale and a Bearish Belt Hold candle on the weekly chart. The candle setup suggests overall weakness, but the daily setup shows every meaningful dips could be bought into. Now, Nifty has to negate the formation of lower highs by moving above 10,785 to witness a bounce towards 10,850 and then 10,929 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 10,630 and then 10,580 levels.

Put writing was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,500 while there was Call writing at 10,700 and 10,800 levels. The options band signified a lower shift in the trading range to 10,650-10,929 zone.

India VIX moved up 3.91 per cent to 16.39 level. However, it needs to cool down with a hold below 16 to get any recovery from the support zone.

Bank Nifty formed a bearish candle on the weekly as well as daily scales and drifted towards the major support at 26,666. It has been making lower highs and lows from last six sessions and needs to negate the same to get a short-term reversal. If it manages to hold above 26,850, then a bounce could be seen towards 27,000 and then 27,150-27,350 zone while support is seen at 26,666 and then 26,400 levels.

US stocks dropped half a per cent after the country's retail sales dropped 1.2 per cent in December, recording biggest drop since September 2009. This led Atlanta Fed slash US December quarter GDP forecast to 1.5 per cent from 2.7 per cent earlier. 

The domestic currency depreciated 11 paise against US dollar in early trade on rising crude oil prices and foreign fund outflows. Rupee had shed 36 paise against the greenback yesterday. 

At 9.27 an, the BSE Sensex was trading 53 points, or 0.15 per cent, lower at 35,824. Nifty50 dropped 23 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 10,723. 

Sun Pharma declined 1.94 per cent to Rs 432.10 and was the top index loser. It was followed by Hero MotoCorp, Vedanta and Tata Motors, which fell 1.70 per cent, 1.55 per cent and 1.38 per cent, respectively. 

ONGC gained 3.33 per cent to Rs 136.50 on strong third quarter results. Power Grid, NTPC and Infosys added 2 per cent, 2 per cent and 0.75 per cent, respectively.

Jet Airways shares fell 2 per cent. Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal is set to lose control of his beleaguered airline after the board approved a proposal allowing a consortium of banks to become the largest shareholder. The stake of Goyal, who founded the airline in April 1992, could drop to as low as 20 per cent from 51 per cent now while Etihad Airways — along with a partner — may eventually become the biggest shareholder."

  because there is demand increase in the market after implementation of Saubhagya scheme, Rajeev Sharma, CMD, Power Finance Corporation, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


You have received CCI’s nod for acquiring 52% in REC. What would be the impact on the financials due to the acquisition?
I do not see negative impact on my financials. Very recently, we have received approval from Reserve Bank of India also. So, all regulatory approvals are in place for this deal. As there are rumours in the media, our capital adequacy is increasing and we have reached 19% capital adequacy ratio. In tier-1 capital, we are having 16% and we are trying to maintain better capital adequacy ratio through various means like tying up with various banks for tier-2 capital and we are regularly monitoring our ongoing projects which we have funded. Once they are commissioned, the risk weight comes down to 50%. 

Similarly, in the advances where state government guarantees are there, we are trying to expedite those state government guarantees because risk weight comes down to 20%.


There are concerns that this acquisition is going to lead to an increase in leverage for PFC since you are resorting to borrowings to fund this acquisition. What is the mix of debt and equity?
Time and again I have clarified that it will be through repayments of our existing loans and for the rest, we will get debt from the market. I do not see any impact on my quality of assets, rather it is improving and we are settling the stressed assets because there is demand increase in the market after implementation of Saubhagya scheme. So, load is increasing in the system and these stressed assets are likely to get better rates now. We have very recently resolved one Ratle hydro project which was a hydro project in J&K of GVK Group. We have settled with the developer which is regularly paying back to us and in Q4, we will be reversing around Rs 600 crore provision which was made for this account. 

Similarly, in some other assets like SEGA, DAN Energy and Essar Transmission, we are likely to get 100% principal. We are seeing a positive movement towards resolution of these stressed assets.


Could you share with us the rough estimates of the funds you would be requiring for the acquisition? How is it going to impact your return ratios as well as CAR?
Actually the amount will be decided in accordance with SEBI guidelines and the final decision will be taken by the committee chaired by the honourable finance minister. We will come to know the exact amount only then. However, we do not see any impact on regulatory requirements of capital adequacy. We are fully aware that once we raise more than 10% of our own funds from the market, my tier-1 capital will be reduced by that amount but even after that, we will be in a comfortable position to meet the regulatory requirements of capital adequacy for our own future as well as ongoing business.


You have already made a 52% provision for stressed assets for PFC. By how much will this provision rise due to RECs acquisition?
REC is a consortium partner in most of the private sector projects. So, most of the stressed assets of REC is also with us and they have also made a provision around 48% in all these stressed assets. I do not see any further provisioning required either in REC case or in PFC case because we have made a provisioning of 52%. Rather, I am expecting that some percentage will be reversed after resolution of these stressed assets and as I explained earlier, the demand in the system is increasing after implementation of the Saubhagya scheme.

These stressed assets will fetch a better rate in the market. In one case, we were getting around Rs 3,500 crore but now a new bidder has come and he is offering me around Rs 4 crore per megawatt. So, we are getting a better rate. That is why in most of the cases we are expecting to get a better price for these stressed assets.


What is the quantum of assets that you see getting resolved and the possible provision write back as well for both PFC and REC?
Our loan asset book is roughly Rs 3 lakh crore, out of which 82% is government utilities and so there is no stress at all. In the remaining 18%, private sector 8% is also perfect. They are regularly paying back to us. So in 90%, there is no stress. Remaining 10% we have stress but these all assets are at various stages of resolution and in some cases, we are getting a good rate.

Therefore I am expecting that 52% provisioning which we have already made in all these stressed assets may be reversed. It is very difficult to specify at this stage. One asset I already said is Ratle. Of three other assets -- SEGA and DANS Energy are two hydro projects in Sikkim. We are likely to get the principal amount and similarly, in case of Essar Transmission, we are likely to get principal amount back. So we are quite comfortable. 

In all other remaining stressed assets we are making sincere efforts along with our consortium partners to resolve them amicably and to get a better rate.


 Is there going to be an open offer to minority shareholders?
It is not there but as I told you that we are already going ahead with the proposal in accordance with the SEBI guidelines and whatever approvals were required have been received already. Now REC is taking the consent from the foreign currency lender and that is pending now.


Rating agencies have said that depending on REC’s rating, PFC rating may get impacted. How would you assuage these concerns?
We are regularly in touch with these rating agencies. As you may be aware, domestic rating has been maintained AAA by CRISIL and Icra and we are regularly interacting with them and we are sharing with them our efforts and initiatives to maintain our rating like we are offloading our investments. PFC GEL has already been merged with PFC, a notification has already been issued by Corporate Affairs Ministry. 

Similarly, our investments in Power Grid we have offloaded some of it as in in NHPC and at the right time we will offload our investments in Coal India Ltd when we get a better price. We are trying to address the concerns of rating agencies. We are regularly in touch with international rating agencies as well as domestic rating agencies and we have explained to them very clearly the efforts being made by PFC in this direction."
36,2019-02-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity barometer Sensex witnessed a positive opening on Tuesday, underpinned by a fresh spell of buying in most sectors after Asian shares jumped to near 4-month high.

The bullishness in Asian equities emerged on hopes that Sino-US trade talks were making progress and expectations of policy stimulus from central banks, Reuters reported.

A new round of US-China trade talks will take place in Washington today, with follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week, the White House said on Monday. 

However, a surge in global crude oil prices capped the gains of the benchmarks. 

US oil prices hit a three-month high on Tuesday due to production cuts led by Opec. 

Sensex jumped 100 points in early deals, while Nifty inched up by 27 points. Around 9:25 am, the Sensex kitty was 51 points, or 0.14 per cent up at 35,550 with 23 stocks in the green and eight in the red. 

The Nifty index was 22 points, or 0.21 per cent, up at 10,663, with 37 stocks advancing and 13 declining. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.48 per cent and 0.46 per cent up, respectively at that time.

Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, Mahindra & Mahindra and ICICI Bank were leading among the Sensex gainers. On the flip side, Tata Motors, Hindustan Unilever, TCS, Infosys and IndusInd Bank were among the losers in the Sensex pack.

Among the sectoral indices on BSE, BSE IT and technology were trading with nominal losses. Meanwhile, BSE Realty jumped over 2 per cent on strong gains in shares of Prestige Estates Projects (up 7 per cent), Oberoi Realty (up 4.36 per cent), DLF (up 3 per cent) and Sobha (up 2.75 per cent). 

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 1,240 crore worth of domestic stocks on Monday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 2,337 crore, data suggested."
37,2019-02-20,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s recent rate cut hasn’t, at least so far, translated into lower cost for companies raising long-term funds in the bond market.

The differential, or spread, between corporate and the benchmark bond yields has expanded to 131 basis points, among the highest since the 2008 world financial crisis, show data from Bloomberg. A large number of paper supplies that crowded the market ahead of the end of the financial year may have widened the spread, market participants said.

“Many companies including public sector units are rushing to borrow ahead of the financial year-end as they may have borrowing targets to meet,” said A Balasubramanian, chief executive of Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund.

“We are taking advantage of increasing spreads as we are expecting the differential will contract next financial year amid a softer interest rate regime,” he said. “With the demand remaining the same, it has checked corporate bond yields from falling even after the policy rate cut.”

The central bank earlier this month cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point.

Housing Development Finance Corporation, REC, National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development and LIC Housing Finance are some of the companies that raised money in the past three-four weeks. Several others including PowerGrid Corporation and Power Finance Corporation are in talks to sell long-term bonds before March 31.

“Owing to oversupply in corporate bonds, spreads for even quasi-sovereign PSUs have risen to 100 bps over corresponding government bonds,” said Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Mutual Fund.

“While fiscal deficit has been optically compressed, government spending via borrowings from these entities has virtually crowded out private sector borrowing from the bond market,” he said. “Also, due to this, the benefit of falling CPI (consumer price inflation) and repo rate cut is non-existent for commercial borrowers.”

The differential between top-rated public-sector companies and the benchmark yield is in the range of 100-105 basis points, while that between top-rated private companies and the sovereign gauge is more than 130 basis points, dealers said.

Excess supply of state government bonds, too, are eating into the demand.

“State government bonds are relatively yielding higher, wooing investors,” said Ajay Manglunia, executive vice president at edelweiss financial services. “Investors are also preferring SDLs (state development loans) due their inherent safety factors while companies nearing close of financial year end are in need of raising required money. A combination of both and risk aversion for some sectors have kept corporate bond yields elevated. RBI’s latest rate cut weighed little and it was momentary on corporate bonds even if the benchmark sovereign yields rallied,” Manglunia added.

The gap between SDLs and corporate bonds is about 15-20 basis points."
38,2019-02-21,PowerGrid,"Sovereign wealth funds GIC Holdings Pte Ltd of Singapore and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) are investing $550 million of fresh primary capital in Greenko, India’s largest renewable energy firm.

This will be the third round of capital infusion by the two, making the Hyderabad-based company the biggest recipient of foreign capital in the clean energy space in the country, said several people with knowledge of the matter. After this, the two principal sponsors of the company would have put a total $2 billion in the 13-year-old company, with GIC, the largest shareholder with a 60% stake, alone infusing $1.4 billion. With $3.2 billion of debt, Greenko’s enterprise valuation will swell to $5.2 billion.

Set up in 2006 by first-generation entrepreneurs Mahesh Kolli and Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, Greenko will end fiscal 2019 with 4.8 GW of operational renewable assets across wind, solar, hydroelectric power in 13 states and an expected Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $500 million. The founders own a quarter of Greenko, and ADIA, the remaining 15%.

Greenko and ADIA declined to comment. GIC did not respond to ET's questionnaire.

The funds will be used primarily toward Greenko’s new initiatives such as building another 5 GW integrated renewables for round-the-clock supply through energy storage contracts.


Agencies
The company is installing three new projects in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra by 2021.


STRATEGIC SHIFT 
This is part of Greenko’s pivot from a generation-focussed company to a more holistic solutions provider striving to feed peak grid demand through clean energy sources. In India, with increase in renewable energy supply from a variety of new sources, existing grid infrastructure cannot absorb more than 15% of supply. Coal, the dominant source of power in the country, cannot satisfy demand that peaks in summer.

Renewable supply also remains unpredictable, being dependent on the vagaries of nature.

In most countries in the west, gas acts as a cushion. But the lack of domestic supplies robs Indian utilities of this flexibility. Greenko plans to use solar power to cater to peak demand during 6-10 am. Solar energy generated during non-peak hours between exismid-day and evening will be used to pump water into reservoirs. That will be release 6-11 pm to generate energy to supply to the national or state power grids. Globally, around 100 GW of energy is generated this way but the method is primarily meant for nuclear energy load management in developed markets in Europe.

In Australia, following recent blackouts, Elon Musk-led Tesla has been involved in a 100 MW battery storage facility that may see the installation of its Powerwall 2 batteries and solar panels on up to 50,000 homes by the summer of 2022. The Powerpack system will charge up when demand and electricity rates are low and discharge when they are high. But while Tesla is looking at a 1-hour storage duration, Greenko is looking at eight hours.

For a company that has grown through acquisitions, the focus on greenfield and storage will be unique, said industry observers as the government maintains its 200 GW target for green energy supply in the country.

Last year alone, Greenko spent close to $1 billion to acquire Orange and Skeiron Renewable Energy Pvt, a private company belonging to Suzlon promoter Tulsi Tanti’s family. It had also sought to acquire Anil Ambani’s Mumbai distribution business for $2.1 billion. In an earlier interaction with ET, Greenko CEO Chalamalasetty said it was “aiming for 20 GW of storagebased energy contracts and our future capex is focussed on that."""
39,2019-02-21,PowerGrid,"Lack of earnings growth has been a major concern for most retail and savvy investors for the past couple of years, which is why it has become difficult to spot ‘alpha’ in Indian market. But all’s not lost.

ET Intelligence Group sifted through the financial performance of companies in the BSE 500 index for the past 13 quarters. A query was run to look for companies which have consistently delivered growth in all three key parameters of financial performance — revenues/sales, operating profit and net profit — for this period.

We arrived at a list of ten companies which have consistently shown growth on these parameters on a yearon-year comparison in the 13 quarters ending December 2018 quarter.



Interestingly, these companies are also trading at attractive valuations when compared with their historical valuations due to the recent volatility in the markets.

In addition to this, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimates, these companies also have high visibility of earnings in the coming years, indicating that they are going to perform consistently in the future. Some of these companies include Caplin Point Laboratories, Sundram Fasteners, IndusInd Bank, Can Fin Homes, Page Industries, Power Grid Corporation and Gruh Finance."
40,2019-02-21,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The market is telling you what’s on the investor’s mind: While low PE stocks continue to bleed, so-called growth stocks have been among the top gainers in an otherwise depressed market.

Looks like investors are in no mood to chase value at the moment. And given the pre-election uncertainty, the trend is unlikely to change for now. 

The disconnect between price and value in ’growth’ and ‘value’ stocks is such that many of the growth stocks are trading at expensive valuations, even on FY2021 earnings estimates, while many value stocks are ruling at inexpensive valuations, even on FY2019 basis, said Kotak Securities. 

Out of the 49 BSE 200 stocks that have gained between 10 per cent and 60 per cent in last 12 months, half had PE multiples in excess of 40, data compiled from AceEquity suggests.

Shares of HUL and Nestle India have gained 30 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively. The two FMCG stocks have managed to sustain high price multiples in last 12 months, even as the benchmark BSE200 has declined 2 per cent in the same period. 

Shares of United Breweries are up 28 per cent; Jubilant Foodworks has gained 34 per cent and Bajaj Finance 56 per cent while Pidilite Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur India have risen up to 25 per cent in last one year.

And look at the low PE stocks: oil firms ONGC, BPCL and HPCL, power firms NTPC, REC, Power Grid, Torrent Power, NBFC stocks Dewan Housing and Reliance Capital, metals & mining companies Vedanta, Coal India and NMDC are down up to 77 per cent during this period.


What disappointed
Calendar 2019 has an even worse record: none of the 40 stocks that quoted single-digit PE as of December 31, 2018 are in the green. 

Analysts say poor returns by these stocks are either reflecting the poor growth prospects and, in many cases, concerns over corporate governance.

“Stocks quoting low PEs at this point mostly belong to heavily-indebted firms or companies with unstable earnings. As such, the pressure on stock prices are further dragging their valuations. Low PE in no way suggests a stock is cheap and that it is a better company to bet on for the future,” said Sameer Kalra of Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing.

Among the top 10 BSE200 losers so far are three ADAG group stocks Reliance Power (down 63 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (down 62 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 35 per cent). These stocks have been hammered after two lenders sold shares pledged with them by the promoters.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have dropped xx per cent. Company’s CEO Harshil Mehta resigned earlier this month. A news portal recently alleged that the NBFC was involved in a financial scam as big as Rs 31,000 crore. The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

“Certain so-called value companies have found new ways to disappoint investors on corporate governance, thereby making the valuation argument largely redundant for such stocks,” Kotak Securities said.

Graphite electrode makers Graphite India, HEG are seeing tough days as electrode prices have softened due to weak global steel prices, increased Chinese imports into India and select trade restriction placed by the US.

Adani Power and IDBI Bank have been posting losses. Nalco has seen 58 per cent plunge in Q3 earnings, while Vedanta has been in news on concerns over corporate governance.

In contrast, among the top BSE200 stocks this year are from IT sector, where firms do offer earnings guidance at the end of each quarter. Two are private lenders, and one is consumer-oriented firm (Titan Company, which too offers guidance on its jewellery business).


Smart money chases growth
Smart money will always chase growth even at the higher premium, Kalra said. “For good retail and institutional investors, growth has always been a key criteria as cleaner growth is much more sustainable. Growth is what makes them give premium valuations to stocks. Consumer stocks are a case in point. They always trade at a higher premium as they are high cash flow businesses and there is high earnings visibility. It’s easy to estimate growth simply by looking at volumes,” he said. 

Kotak Securities said: ""The market seems to have taken a permanent view on the future of most companies, thereby effectively segregating companies into long-term winners; which are companies with superior business models, trustworthy managements and good corporate governance practices where no price or valuation may be too high to own the stocks, and long-term losers; which are companies with inferior business models and poor governance practices where no price or valuation may be too low to avoid the stocks.""


Election & demand for qualityElection dates are likely to be announced over the next three weeks. In a study of past three general elections, Elara Capital found that volatility usually rises sharply ahead of Lok Sabha elections and cool off only after the election outcome. In a study of the 2004 -2018 period, the brokerage found that quality stocks tend to outperform in an uncertain market.

The brokerage says by high quality, it refers to companies with RoCE of greater than 15 in each of last five years, net debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive free cash flow (FCF) yield for at least four out of last five years and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) either stable or increasing. Within the BSE200 universe, there are 34 companies that fit the bill.

The brokerage has recommended 15 of them, which include Castrol India, Cyient, Eicher Motors, Gillette India, GSK Consumer, Infosys, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Oracle, Sun TV Network and Tata Elxsi.

41,2019-02-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Following the crowd usually takes you nowhere in the stock market. True!

But what do you make of the stocks that figure in portfolios of one after another mutual fund scheme? At the end of January, there were 78 stocks that were part of the portfolios of at least 100 mutual fund schemes, including ETFs, data from Ace Mutual Fund showed.

Don’t forget domestic institutional investors have become one of the key market drivers in recent years, having managed to cushion severe corrections every time there has been a big selloff by the overseas portfolio investors. 

Foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in Indian market, having offloaded shares worth over Rs 34,000 crore since January 2018. DIIs poured in some Rs 1,15,000 crore in the same period.

Not surprisingly, the list of 78 stocks includes the usual suspects. HDFC Bank is part of at least 535 mutual fund schemes; ICICI Bank 528 schemes, State Bank of India 465 schemes and Axis Bank 450 schemes.

State Bank of India recently posted a net profit of Rs 3,955 crore year-on-year for December quarter against a net loss of Rs 2,416 crore posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Some 412 schemes held the stock at the end of January, 2018 and 452 at the end of December, 2018. 

Global brokerages Jefferies and Nomura have ‘buy’ rating on SBI with price targets of Rs 365 and Rs 375, respectively.

Anand Rathi Financial Services is bullish on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,420. “Considering the opportunistic macro conditions, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality and management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership and robust return ratios. We continue to be positive on the company from a medium to long-term perspective,” the brokerage said.

Among others, IT major Infosys, FMCG giant ITC and engineering conglomerate L&T were owned by more than 400 schemes as of January 2019.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on L&T with a target price of Rs 1,570. The brokerage believes domestic economic fundamentals will favour the company in the medium term. However, elections can have a temporary slowdown impact. Major sectors are anticipating capex growth going forward, it added. 

Also on the list are Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Consultancy Services, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HUL, which were held by over 250 schemes.

Corporate banks, IT and consumer sectors delivered strong performance in December quarter, while auto and cement sectors disappointed the market.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal is positive on Maruti Suzuki and Kotak Mahindra Bank with price targets of Rs 8,131 and Rs 1,350, respectively. The brokerage has also increased weightage of Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank in its model portfolio.

The mutual fund industry’s asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 23.40 lakh crore in January 2019 compared with Rs 22.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. However, equity and equity-linked saving schemes saw Rs 6,158 crore inflow in January 2019, compared with a Rs 15,390 crore inflow in the year-ago month.

The slowdown in inflows has been attributed to uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming general elections and a prolonged depression in domestic stocks.

Despite the fall in inflows, equity fund managers stayed put on stocks like HCL Technologies, Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank, Titan, GAIL (India), Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma. There stocks featured in the portfolios of more than 200 schemes as of January 2019.

Among others, Coal India, Power Grid, Hero MotoCorp, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Cipla, Motherson Sumi, Cummins India, Petronet LNG, Britannia Industries, Grasim, Bajaj Finserv, M&M Financial Services, Hindalco, YES Bank, UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, The Federal Bank, Dabur India, MRF, ACC, Exide, Eicher Motors and UPL were other companies that were owned by at least 100 mutual fund schemes as of January 2019.

The Central government has asked its biggest state power producer and transmission company to form a joint venture that would take over electricity distribution in some areas from financially troubled state retailers, according to people familiar with the plan.

The proposed venture between NTPC Ltd. and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. would manage challenging distribution areas where the retailers, known as discoms, face power theft and other difficulties, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to media.

Neither company, nor India’s power ministry, responded to emails and phone calls seeking comment.

As part of the plan, the JV would be expected to charge discoms a fee for services that would include seeking power theft prevention, sourcing cheaper power and improving billing and collections.

Reviving India’s ailing distributors is seen as key to extending electricity access, especially in the countryside, where low power usage makes distribution a loss-making business. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was partly elected on a commitment to bring power to every home, has stepped up efforts to strengthen the country’s fragile retailers ahead of a general elections expected this year.

Short on cash, state utilities often delay payments for electricity purchases or don’t buy enough power needed to service their customers, creating financial stress for generators and lenders.

A national distribution company may face challenges if state governments are reluctant to cede control of local distribution. Regional authorities often require discoms to sell power below cost, mainly because its politically popular."

India has drawn global attention since it started awarding wind power projects at record-low tariffs, spurring optimism that renewable energy could supplant the nation’s abundant coal resources in electricity generation.

But about half of the more than one gigawatt of capacity awarded in the country’s first auctions in 2017 are incomplete, almost five months after their commissioning deadline, according to JN Swain, managing director at state-owned Solar Energy Corp. of India, the agency tasked with implementing the country’s renewable energy targets.

The South Asian nation has awarded some of the world’s lowest green energy tariffs and became the biggest auctioneer of solar and wind capacity last year, according to Bloomberg NEF. But the delays are a check on bringing to reality those rock-bottom power rates achieved via auction, the preferred method by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to achieve its goal of installing 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022.

SECI has conducted a total of six rounds of wind auctions since 2017, awarding 8.4 gigawatts of capacity. A large chunk of that capacity auctioned over the last year may take longer than expected to get off the ground, just like the first projects, Swain said in an interview in New Delhi last week.


BloombergWind projects have been delayed by problems obtaining land to build the projects and gaining access to the power grid. Wind projects have been delayed by problems obtaining land to build the projects and gaining access to the power grid, according to Swain. These issues have also held up other energy developments in India, such as nuclear power plants and oil refineries.


‘No Different’
“The issues faced by wind developers are no different from that faced in any other sector,” Swain said in a follow-up message. Those issues are “difficulties in aggregating land and getting right of way for transmission lines. The nature and scale is same for all sectors.”

Of the five companies winning a total capacity of 1,050 megawatts in the first auction, only a unit of Singapore-based Sembcorp Industries Ltd. has been able to commission its 250-megawatt project, according to SECI and the company. Other winners -- including Mytrah Energy Ltd., ReNew Power Ltd. and turbine maker Inox Wind Ltd. -- have struggled to start up, according to SECI.

India awarded projects in its first federal wind auction in 2017 at 3.46 rupees (5 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour. Tariffs dropped to as low as a record 2.43 rupees in Gujarat state auctions later that year.


World’s Cheapest
According to BNEF analyst Atin Jain, the levelized tariff in SECI’s third and fourth auction, in February and April 2018, were near $20 per megawatt hour, the cheapest in the world and 6 percent below the levelized lowest bid in a recent Saudi Arabian auction.

Many wind power projects are being delayed because of transmission issues, according to Vinay Rustagi, managing director at renewable energy research firm Bridge to India. The time taken to set up adequate transmission capacity is about three to four years, while a solar or wind project can be built in less than two years.

SECI expects that 3 gigawatts of capacity, out of the 4 gigawatts awarded through the third and fourth auction rounds, will be delayed as developers are finding it difficult to secure land in Gujarat state, Swain said. ReNew Power and Mytrah Energy’s projects in the first round are also delayed because of land access issues, he said.


‘Lose-Lose’
“Land issues are a lose-lose situation for the entire wind ecosystem,” said D.V. Giri, secretary general of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association, adding that delays cause power sale agreements between states and SECI to be violated and equipment inventory to pile up, hurting manufacturers. “Such a situation will not be viewed favorably by the global investor community.”

ReNew Power has commissioned 226 megawatts out of 250 megawatts it won, spokesman Pradeep Wadhwa said in an email. Approval to use land for the remaining capacity has been granted and construction has begun, he added.

Mytrah Energy didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Inox Wind, meanwhile, said its projects in the first round have not been commissioned because the central grid is not ready for it to connect. In addition to its own 250-megawatt project, it’s also building 50 megawatts of capacity won by Adani Green Energy Ltd., which didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“Inox Wind can’t do anything until the central grid is ready,” Devansh Jain, the company’s executive director, said during an earnings call earlier this month, adding the deadline for commissioning was Oct. 5. “So what does the deadline do? The deadline is of honestly no use.”"

5,2019-03-06,PowerGrid,"Edelweiss Securities has a hold call on ABB India with a target price of Rs 1,325.

The current market price of ABB India is Rs 1,244.45.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when ABB India price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage:

Robotic and automation drive overall performance: Strong double-digit growth across segments given healthy order backlog resulted in overall revenue jumping 15 per cent YoY. Management expects traction in robotics in automation to continue (nearly 30 per cent YoY growth in CY18). Gross margin expansion led to EBITDA margin growing 250bps YoY to 11 per cent.


Order inflow steady; exports and services growth healthy: Order intake of exports and service business jumped 50 per cent and 27 per cent YoY, respectively, driving 16 per cent growth in CY18 order inflow. Despite the slower pace of reforms given impending elections, management expects growth to be driven by the government’s consumption and infrastructure spending.


Outlook and valuation: A comprehensive product profile implies ABB can exploit multiple growth opportunities across sectors. While we remain upbeat on the transition of companies to automated processes, we believe this will be gradual. Additionally, we await further clarity on valuations of ABB’s power grid business."

Here's a quick glance at factors for today's market rally.



Pre-election rally
According to market experts, investors are factoring in a win for the government in power in the upcoming elections, which set off a rally in domestic markets. Ashish P Sommaiyaa of Motilal Oswal said the market is already in a pre-election rally. 

""Different people have their different opinions, but I do not think the market as an aggregate is going to leave all of this for suspense on May 23. The market will have its own process of discounting which we are already seeing because there are trends which are available and everybody is aware of what they are reading or what they are picking up,"" Sommaiyaa said.



Foreign inflows keep growing
Overseas investors have pumped in a net Rs 2,741 crore into the capital markets in the first five trading sessions of March, mainly due to positive sentiment. As per analysts, the change is triggered by domestic as well as global factors and the trend is likely to continue for some time, according to PTI. 



Rupee flexes its muscles
The rupee rose as much as 21 paise to 69.94 against the dollar on Monday after selling in American currency by banks and exporters. The domestic unit logged gains of 78 paise last week. The appreciation in the rupee is mainly on account of strong FII buying. 



Dovish Fed comments
US Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday reiterated that the Fed would continue with its 'wait-and-see' approach on rate hikes and will make sure not to shock financial markets as it stabilises its bond portfolio. Powell said it does not see problems in the US economy that warrant an immediate change in its policy.



Global markets go up
Asian shares inched up on Monday as Chinese markets rebounded on hopes of more policy support for the slowing economy, but surprisingly weak US employment data raised doubts about the strength of the global economy and limited gains. European shares were seen rising, with spread-betters expecting Britain's FTSE to rise 0.7 per cent, France's CAC 0.6 per cent and Germany's DAX 0.5 per cent, Reuters reported. 


Expert view
The recent surge is largely reflecting buoyancy on the local front despite signs of slowdown in global economy. The breakout in the benchmark index, after four-month long consolidation phase, has further boosted sentiment. Amid all, we feel stock selection is the key, as participation is limited mainly to the quality counters.

14,2019-03-11,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has advised banks against giving loans to Infrastructure Investment Funds (InvITs), leaving them with no options for debt financing. This will make it nearly impossible for these trusts to refinance projects; important to the model which aims at efficient financing for infrastructure projects.

Banks and insurance companies invest in units of InvITs but are not lending to InvITs. What makes things more difficult is that the central bank has refinancing of rupee loans with external commercial borrowings on its negative list.

“We believe RBI has advised some banks through email that they should not provide lending facilities to InvITs. This is making things difficult for us as this has been one of the largest source of capital,” Harsh Shah, CEO India Grid Trust.

An InvIT offers an opportunity to promoters of projects to sell their stake in completed projects to the trust, which in turn can raise long-term and tax-free funds from unit holders. The financial instrument generated a lot of interest among investors but as it is a new instrument, investors are still only warming up to it.

Recently, Sebi increased the leverage limit for InvITs to 70% of assets from 49% earlier in an attempt to give fillip to these trusts.

Some banks had sought clarity on the issue of lending to InvITs; their contention was that Sebi allows InvITs to raise debt so they may like to consolidate debt at trust level by raising fresh debt. Trust has better debt servicing capacity and funds don’t carry the default risks associated with project financing. RBI advised them not to lend to these trusts, according to sources directly involved.

On February 22, top executives of InvITs met the joint secretary of infrastructure policy and finance division at the Department of Economic Affairs, seeking help on bank financing. They wanted insurance regulators to issue clarification allowing investment in debt securities. RBI allows banks to extend credit subject to ratings, and money used via ECB is allowed to be used for refinancing. InvITs tried to assuage RBI’s concerns on double financing, infrastructure financing, and evergreening of loans.

“With banks, insurance companies and even international investors not able to subscribe to debt securities of InvITs, we are unable to raise debt for optimum tenures and rates. We are hoping that it’s resolved soon as debt instruments are an important part of the capital structure for infrastructure projects. InvITs, with their better quality assets, ratings and predictable cash flows, could have benefited from refinancing. But as of now, that's almost stopped,” Shah said.

Currently, there are three InvITs, India Grid InvIT Fund (sponsored by Sterlite Power Grid Ventures), IRB InvIT Fund (sponsored by IRB Infrastructure Developers) and IndInfravit (sponsored by Larsen & Toubro’s arm IDPL)."

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) purchased Indian stock worth Rs 3,810.6 crore while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued to book profits and offloaded equities worth Rs 1,955.55 crore, provisional data showed.

“Political sentiment seems to have improved a little bit. Interest in the market also seems to have risen, especially in midcaps,” said Shiv Diwan, head of sales at Edelweiss.

Bloomberg

The market’s confidence that the next government will be led by the BJP has increased following the recent border skirmishes. This was indicated by the Nifty breaching the psychological mark of 11,000 on Wednesday last week and ending above the level for the fourth session in a row on Monday. Political uncertainty had risen in the months following December, when the BJP lost state elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The Nifty has gained 2.2 per cent in the past month.

Three opinion polls released this month — the first since the India-Pakistan border tension — show that the BJP has clawed back some of the lost electoral ground and is inching closer to the half-way mark, said Nomura. “BJP’s perceived toughness on national security appears to have bought it an additional 30-40 seats in the general elections from when these agencies last conducted polls in January 2019.”

Money managers also said that macro headwinds that were a significant source of concern for markets earlier are not such a big worry now as crude oil prices have stabilised and the interest rate scenario is benign.

“If there is a stable government post elections, the rally can continue. Mid-caps are still looking attractive relative to large-caps,” said Upadhyaya. Investors should build equity allocations in the next two to two-and-a-half months, he added.

Diwan of Edelweiss said he would be cautiously optimistic.

“The market rally may continue for a bit. Around 11,400-11,500 levels, the (Nifty) index would trade at 18 times, which is one standard deviation above average multiples. The market could stabilise at that level,” said Diwan."
16,2019-03-12,PowerGrid,"ET Intelligence Group: The new Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) tariff regulations for the period 2019 to 2024 are better than what the Street anticipated. NTPC, India’s largest power producer, would be the biggest beneficiary given that it has the maximum share in the country’s power agreements.

Analysts expect NTPC earnings to rise up to 8 per cent FY20 onward against earlier concerns of earnings downgrades if the regulations were not in favour.

NTPC shares have gained 15 per cent in the past one month in anticipation of positive regulations after the draft proposal was made in December.

Shares of Power Grid and NHPC have also gained 10 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, in the same period. While the new regulations are only marginally positive for power transmitters, the Street is relieved that the new proposals do not contain major negatives.

From all the regulations, the most prominent and impactful regulations include no reduction of equity for older plants, permission to allow pass through of coal handling losses, incentives on making higher power generation during peak hours, and higher allowance on the operational and maintenance expenses.

According to the previous guidelines, power plants that surpassed their useful life (generally 25 years) had to reduce their equity to the extent of depreciation. Given that power is charged at a tariff arrived by considering a fixed return on equity, reduction in equity would lead to lower realizations for the generator. As the oldest power producer, NTPC has more than 20 per cent plants that are beyond useful life, according to analysts.

The regulator also allows recovery of O&M expense of 8-10 per cent, for both power generator and transmitter, also a positive for Power Grid. The producer will also get incentives of up 65 paise per unit in peak hours and 50 pasie on nonpeak hours if the capacity utilization is more than 85 per cent.

Another positive is that the regulator has allowed the loss of 85Kcal per gross calorific value coal between unloading and firing point. Earlier, the generator had to bear the loss on fuel damage from unloading to firing point leading to under recoveries.

While there are certain negatives too, the positives far outweigh them. For instance, NTPC alone will save Rs 700 crore to Rs 900 crore annually from FY20 onward, according to the analysts.

On Monday, stocks of three state owned power companies NTPC, Power Grid Corp of India and NHPC closed at Rs 151.3, Rs 194.4 and Rs 25.3. Consensus target prices for these stocks are Rs 187.3, 226.7 and 27.6, according to Bloomberg."

25,2019-03-13,PowerGrid,"BJP chief Amit Shah is keeping late hours, working well into the night at the party's new headquarters in central Delhi. Outlining PM Narendra Modi's leadership and the government's record of corruption-free governance as key election issues, Shah told TOIthat voters will back BJP. He shrugged off a challenge from the SP-BSP alliance in UP, saying if alliances directly translated into public support, no alliance would ever lose. Excerpts:


What is your assessment of the odds at the end of BJP’s term in office as a majority government?
This is my first interview after declaration of elections. For BJP, elections are a mega festival of democracy. It’s an opportunity to take our ideology and the work done by the government to the people. I want to say just one thing to the people of our country, that the elections will be fought on issues and agendas. And people should be careful and alert about those who distract their attention and spread confusion. BJP and the NDA coalition will, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, return with a bigger mandate than it now enjoys. It will be a majority government that will be strong and tackle the problems of the country.



Can you elaborate on why this should be so? Five years ago, UPA’s record and Narendra Modi’s candidature made a difference. Now there is incumbency and fulfilling expectations is always difficult.I will come to this later. To start, let me elaborate on the issues BJP will highlight in the election. First, only a stable government can do good for the nation and deliver development. By stable government, I mean one with a full majority. Then, only a strong leader can resolve the problems of the people. In Modiji, we have given India a ‘mazboot’ leader. India is poised to be among the top five economies of the world. Who can secure the country is a big issue. The election should be on this issue. Who can protect the country should be debated. Then there are 50 crore deprived, poor, Dalit and Adivasi people who were not touched in the last 70 years. There is need for a government that improves their standard of living. Lastly, there should be a government that brings glory and pride to the nation on the world stage. We will go to elections on these seven issues. Our leader Modiji has worked on these lines and has gained the trust of the people.







The opposition says there are no jobs and farm distress has risen and things have become worse.
The opposition should answer just how many families did not have a bank account before 2014. Today, there are 30 crore bank accounts. How many people had cooking gas? Now, 6 crore poor have connections and so do 7 crore others. Now, gas cylinders have reached 13 crore. Some 10 crore (households) did not have toilets. Now the task of providing toilets to 8 crore families is complete. Some 2.5 crore families have been allotted houses. There were some 2.3 crore people who did not have electricity. Today, almost all have power. There is a scheme for health insurance up to Rs 5 lakh a year; till now, in just four months, 15 lakh people have benefited. The opposition should address these facts instead of speaking in a roundabout manner. They should answer, those who ruled for 55 years... how all these things were not done earlier? Why were they done in 55 months? Because when Modiji and BJP say it will be done, it is not merely a slogan. We have made a meaningful change in the lives of 50 crore people.

As far as employment is concerned... so far, there has not been any system of statistics (collection) that is so perfect to get an accurate measure of employment. But highways are being built at twice the speed, railways is spreading (tracks) at 2.25 times the previous speed, the power grid expanded by 2 lakh km, 8 crore toilets and 2.5 crore houses were built, irrigation capacity has increased, more than 13 crore have got Mudra loans. I am ready for a debate at any chowk in the country to argue that no other government has done more to generate employment.


On the issue of farm distress, there is a situation that production has been high, but prices are low. Should more attention have been paid to developing market avenues and other such measures?A lot has been done. There are 500 or more e-mandis. The support price is 1.5 times the cost of inputs. Neem-coated urea, soil health cards, assistance in floods and drought. The coverage of drip and micro irrigation has increased four times. Irrigation projects stuck for 35 years and more have been completed. There is an annual honorarium of Rs 6,000 as a gesture of solidarity with the ‘annadata’. A lot of work has been done. The agriculture budget under UPA was Rs 1.21 lakh crore. Now, it is Rs 2.11 lakh crore. This shows how much importance we accord to agriculture.


Is ‘55 months against 55 years’ going to be your campaign theme?
This is not just a campaign theme. It is time that elections are not decided on the basis of bare slogans. It is time to fight elections on the basis of issues. Casteism, nepotism and appeasement. These issues dominated elections from the ’60s till 2014. Our democracy is now sufficiently mature and the people have accepted politics of performance. I think the issues I have outlined earlier are the ones that the people want to discuss.


You mentioned appeasement and here your opponents accuse you of divisive and polarising politics.
I do not understand... is giving Haj subsidy polarisation? Or removing it and making everyone equal polarisation? Is subjecting Muslim women to the ills of triple talaq for vote bank politics polarisation? Or is it polarisation to ensure that they get the same rights as other women in this country? I think the definition of polarisation should be decided. Instead of minority and majority politics, if we try and give the same rights to all, it is not polarisation. This is the core value of our Constitution. We have moved the country in this direction.


You spoke of national security. You have been accused of using national security like a shield to cover failures and politicising the sensitive issue.Wait a minute! Are you saying that we had a say in determining the timing of a terror attack? Can anyone in this country decide and predict when such attacks are launched? This was decided by enemies of the country. Terrorists decided to do Pulwama. Since when did delivering a fitting reply to a terror attack become politicisation of security? If only people levelling such charges had stood like a rock with our military, there would have been no politicisation. Those who raised doubts on the capabilities of our military stand isolated today. They need to introspect. When you display political will and respond, then this creates an image or perception about the leadership in the public mind. This happened during Bangladesh (war) and also in 1965.


The charge against you is that you tossed up the number of 250 dead in the strike on Balakot without basis.
This is not the case. You get to know from several sources. There are discussions at various levels. I am not a part of the government. I spoke on the basis of information available in the public sphere. I think that the reaction of Pakistan’s parliament, its media and of course the incursion of its air force (across the LoC) prove that the air strikes caused heavy damage. Why would they otherwise send 20 planes? Has it happened before? In fact, the terrorist organisations in Pakistan are also talking of damage. It is only our opposition that needs proof.


You said BJP will improve its majority. But you are at saturation in many states. The law of nature is that you will decline...
The law of nature does not have to hold true each time. Laws of physics don’t necessarily apply to real life political situations. There are elections where a party increased its seats when an improvement did not seem possible. Here, your performance decides the result. We will do well in West Bengal, improve in the northeast and Odisha and even in the south. So, there are areas where we can grow.


You have allied with regional parties earlier in states like Andhra Pradesh/ Telangana and Odisha. You do not seem to have sought such allies?
Every party decides its strategy. The manner in which our organisation has expanded across the country... the popularity Modiji enjoys... we would want to garner votes from all over.


Among your allies, your partner in Maharashtra is always at odds and criticises BJP. Won’t lack of trust hurt in a such a key state?Did you feel they will not come with us? But they have. They will be part of the alliance now and part of the government later. It is not undemocratic to express one’s difference of opinion.


Uttar Pradesh is certainly a big challenge for BJP. You are up against three major challengers.
Not three, but two. One party has zero seats in Lok Sabha, the other has five. The third party has zero. Earlier, when SP and Congress came together, there was much discussion that this is unbeatable. The results showed that BJP got more seats in UP (in 2017 assembly) than any party since Independence. If alliances directly translate into public support, no alliance would ever lose. BJP now has a strong organisation and the popularity of Modiji has increased several fold over 2014. Law and order has been fixed, development is picking up pace. People of UP are experiencing, after a long time, that there can be sabka saath, sabka vikas. We are 73 in UP, we will be 74 and not 72.


So you are saying an alliance is not two plus two?The alliance itself shows they are nervous. Otherwise, why should people who can’t stand one another suddenly find virtues in each other? Alliances are never two plus two.


You feel the prime minister’s popularity has increased. But BJP lost three states and the winning margin in Gujarat shrunk.See, this may not be a good way to analyse things. In 2014, we had six governments and now we have 16. Our geographical spread increased from 12% to 50%. We had 2.4 crore workers, today there are 11 crore. Our programmes have touched the lives of 22 crore families. We have their blessings. So 11 crore workers, 22 crore families... to form a government we need 17 crore votes. We are in a very strong position and have an organisation that can convert the popularity of the prime minister into votes. No one has anything to say against Modi sarkar. We have so much to say that we can exhaust ourselves. We have provided a taint-free government.


But Congress accuses the government of corruption, as in the Rafale deal.
Those who keep speaking lies will suffer. Just levelling allegations of corruption will not make them stick. The reputation and record of those to make such claims matters. The CAG and the Supreme Court do not agree with you (Congress) but to go on will only boomerang. They deliberately created a scandal over a crucial defence purchase to distract attention from the corruption that enjoyed state patronage under UPA. They are aware of the steps we have taken — setting up an SIT on black money, demonetisation, the surgical strike on shell companies, laws against black money and fugitive economic offenders, and dismantling of inspector raj, just to name a few.

Demonetisation has brought assets and properties worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore under the I-T scanner. To take just one instance of crony capitalism and phone banking culture that flourished under UPA, total loan disbursements from banks which had stood at Rs 18 lakh crore in 2008, ballooned to Rs 52 lakh crore in 2014. As against this, the enactment of IBC has helped us recover Rs 3 lakh crore from defaulters. Those who defrauded banks for decades with impunity are now scared to come back.


Your opponents say the economy has suffered due to disruptions like notebandi and it is stalling.
We are the sixth largest economy and about to replace Britain in the fifth position. We were at the 11th spot in 2013-14. Inflation has more than halved. Fiscal deficit is half of what it was and current account deficit has come down from 5.6% in 2012-2013 to 2.5%. Direct tax collection has surged from Rs 6.38 lakh crore to Rs 12 lakh crore and indirect tax collection has jumped from Rs 64 lakh crore in pre-GST days to Rs 1.2 crore lakh crore under the new scheme. Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, number of those filing I-T returns almost doubled, rising 3.79 crore to 6.86 crore. There has been 25% increase in I-T returns in the last financial year alone. You take any indicator: threefold increase in patents, registration of trademarks, which increased from 60,000 in 2013-14 to 2.5 lakh in 2017-18, jump of 42 places in ease of doing business, Moody’s rating, and you can see the effort to build the foundation of ‘Naya Bharat’ and its results.


You undertook big reforms like GST but this resulted in disruption and unhappiness.
I do agree that there were teething troubles. But the government has decided that there is no need for registration till a threshold of Rs 40 lakh, this exempts 80% businesses. Similarly, those with Rs 60 lakh turnover do not need to pay income tax, means 90% businessmen are out of the net. This is a big thing. Direct and indirect tax revenues have risen as have the number of people with PAN who are assessees. I think no amount of disinformation will work.


There are several states where BJP will be face to face with Congress. Last time, you won this contest. But now Congress is back in three of these states. Will this not change things?
These were assembly elections. We got more votes in Madhya Pradesh, we polled 47,000 more votes. In Rajasthan, the difference was just 1,88,000 votes or 0.5%. In Chhattisgarh, of course, we suffered a heavy defeat which is a cause for concern. I think in terms of organisation, these are strong states for BJP. The issues in a national election are different. The central issue in the elections is who will be the PM? Opposition does not have a leader, it is directionless.


There is speculation on the extent candidates will be changed...
This happens every time. All political parties do this (change candidates). That is possible this time too. But I think that is not the ‘mudda’. It is not who will be the MP. It is a matter for a constituency. But the questions for the public mind are the ones I have outlined.


You feel that there is a national issue, but the opposition’s strategy seems to be to make this contest one about states and alliances.
In the end, won’t you consider whether the country’s military is to be strengthened? Who will keep the nation secure? A decisive leader or a group of 22 leaders? The Lok Sabha election can never be on these lines. Modiji is among the most popular PMs in the world. He works 18 hours every day. He is a clean and empathetic leader. He is a decisive leader who will not allow India’s honour to be lowered. His foreign policy has earned India respect all over the world. The people identify with this.


The opposition feels the PM’s appeal has waned and seems to be confident that its charges will dull it further.They delude themselves because they also want to become PM. The only problem is that they cannot without winning the election. And do you think that we will let their falsehoods go unchallenged? Our cadre, our party, our leaders will be in the poll arena with a narrative which is in line with their experience of Modi government. I am confident about our performance. We have done nothing that will make us lower our heads. We will go into the elections seeking the blessings of people with humility and with our head held high because we have done nothing to embarrass them.


In 2014, the BJP campaign had several firsts like social media, missed call campaign, ‘chai pe charcha’. What’s in store this time?
All that will be there. There have been some big outreaches. We have visited beneficiaries of our schemes. Then there was ‘mera ghar, BJP parivar’. Our efforts have resulted in a huge number of social media impressions like 160 and 200 crore. The biggest effort is to be in touch with 22 crore beneficiaries of our programmes. With humility we say — you have got cooking gas, you have got a house — there are many who are waiting, so please support us so that we can complete the task. The youth, farmers, women believe in Modiji.


In the Madhya Pradesh elections, there was concern over the rights of Dalits (in view of SC ruling) but there was also resentment among the general categories.A big step for the general category is the 10% quota legislated by the government. This has been done without reducing the reservation for SC, ST, OBC. Providing reservation to children of poor families is to address their needs and help their future. This has been done in a very good manner.


How will you describe your policies towards the middle class?
The income of those earning up to Rs 5 lakh is non-taxable. Small and middle businessmen are part of the middle class. There is relief for them in GST. Cost of medicines is controlled. Inflation is largely under control, value of savings has gone up. We have also met expectations that the pride of the nation will be enhanced under Modiji.


There are reports of discontent in tribal populations in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. This might hurt your prospects.
Tribals live in areas where minerals are found. Have they benefited from this? We have set up a district development fund to ensure that they benefit from this wealth. No one factor is so overwhelming. Bamboo is now grass and a farm product. The contributions of tribals to national life has been acknowledged. The way the government has been run must be compared with the past 10 years under UPA marked by corruption, policy paralysis and compromising national security for political vote banks. We have delivered on about 90% of the promises we made.


It is now clear that the Ayodhya case will not be resolved soon. Will this not disappoint your supporters?
We are clear that there should be a grand temple at Janmasthan in Ayodhya and this should be at the earliest. I only want to ask — does the opposition want a temple there? It should clarify before the elections. We are now trying to return 42 acres of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas.


What about the negotiation process that has been ordered by the court?
That is okay, it is a legal process. If everyone agrees and there is a consensus, why would we object? But we want a temple there at the earliest."

RInfra hits a bump
Shares of Reliance Infrastructure fell 3.59 per cent to close the day at Rs 124.90 after it signed a definitive binding agreement with Cube Highways and Infrastructure III Pte for 100 per cent stake sale of Delhi-Agra (DA) Toll Road.


IDBI Bank meet on borrowing

BoI eyes cash call
Media reports suggested that Bank of India is looking to raise at least Rs 400-500 crore from sale of a non-core asset by March-end. On Thursday, MD and CEO Dinabandhu Mohapatra told reporters that the process to sell non-core asset is on and the bank has already floated request for proposals (RFPs). 


DHFL gains 3%

37,2019-03-15,PowerGrid,"High on confidence, stock benchmarks zoomed by more than 1 per cent on Friday, only to surrender the early gains towards the end. 

Banking and IT drove the show, which marked a positive close for the fifth straight session.

It was a flying start by all means and the bulls looked invincible except towards the fag end when there was a bit of a scare. Ultimately, the bulls had the last laugh. 

Risk appetite took on shine on unabated foreign capital inflows, a strengthening rupee and positive global shares.


Market at a glance 
The 30-share Sensex settled higher 269 points, or 0.71 per cent, at 38,024.32. The 50-share Nifty climbed 84 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 11,426.85.

Week on week, the BSE barometer was up 3.7 per cent and the NSE gauge 3.5 per cent. Both put up their best weekly show since November 30.

Kotak Bank kept a big lead over its nearest peer, surging the most by 4.31 per cent. HDFC Bank and TCS contributed too. ONGC and PowerGrid notched up handsome gains. 

In the sectoral landscape, energy, banking, auto and IT pulled all the strings, accounting for much of the upside. Energy proved to be the showstopper, with a gain of 2 per cent.

The worry surfaced as broader markets threw up conflicting signals. While BSE Midcap rose 0.5 per cent, Smallcap took a knock of 0.34 per cent. 


What all went into the market's sizzling show today? 


Here are the major factors.


FII inflows: FIIs are pushing the buy button as they double down on India theme. Overseas investors have invested nearly Rs 29,000 crore in Indian stock market year-to-date till March 14. They purchased shares worth Rs 14,400 crore during the first quarter of last year.

PSU banks: Credit rating agency ICRA gave a thumbs-up to PSBs. Its latest report stated that public sector banks are likely to report net profit of Rs 23,000-37,000 crore in 2019-20, after four years of consecutive losses. Net profit may be supported by fall in gross non-performing assets (GNPAs). 

BSE Bankex was up 1.5 per cent, with Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI, Federal Bank and Bank of Baroda rallying 2-4 per cent.


Robust export projections: India’s exports are projected to touch an all-time high of $330 billion in 2018-19, braving global challenges such as protectionist measures, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said Thursday. 

“With respect to exports, this year has been particularly good for us. We are likely to touch an all-time record and go past our earlier peak which was in 2013-14 at $314 billion and we hope to reach about $325-330 billion this year,” Wadhawan said. 


Positive global cues: Gains in key Asian markets further backed up the market. Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanhgai advanced up to 1 per cent after a report that more progress has been made in US-China trade talks and UK lawmakers voted to delay a potentially chaotic exit from the European Union.


Other factors: Strengthening rupee and receding geopolitical tensions offered more tailwinds. The rupee was trading 27 paise higher at 69.08 against the dollar in afternoon trade. Going with some equity experts, the market is also looking positive ahead of the 2019 general elections.

38,2019-03-16,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Indian stock indices continued their pre-election rally momentum for the fifth straight session, with the Nifty ending above 11400 and the Sensex closing above 38000 level.

However, profit booking in the last hour of trade led to indices off their session highs.

The Sensex ended up 264.43 points, or 0.7 per cent, to close at 38024.32. During the session, the 30-stock index hit a high of 38254.77, or up 1.3 per cent, from the previous close. The Nifty gained 83.60 points, or 0.7 per cent, to close at 11426.85 after hitting the day’s high of 11487 intraday. The index was up 1.3 per cent at its day’s high.

Gains in the broader market were relatively modest with the BSE MidCap index ending up 0.5 per cent. The BSE SmallCap index slipped into the red in the last hour of trade and ended down 0.3 per cent. Bank Nifty hit a fresh record high of 29520.70 before ending at 29381.45, up 1.58 per cent from its previous close.

Foreign portfolio investors continued to pour funds into the Indian markets, with net purchase of Rs 4,323 crore on Friday as per provisional data, the highest in a day since February 22, when the net purchase figure was Rs 12,100 crore due to ING Group selling its remaining stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. Domestic institutional investors continued to book gains, offloading shares worth Rs 2,130 crore.

Kotak Mahindra Bank gained 4 per cent. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Consultancy Services, NTPC and SBI were the other top gainers, up 2-3 per cent.

Hindustan Unilever ended down 2 per cent at Rs 1,698.65, as the worst performer on the Sensex.

“We have seen money flow coming from FIIs and political opinion seem to have swung in favour of current government. This has given excitement to markets. But what is needed for sustainability of these gains is growth momentum,” said Vinit Sambre, head of equities at DSP Mutual Fund. “Few sectors such as automobile, infrastructure, etc., are showing slower growth and GDP is also slowing. Without fundamentals catching up, the rally may fizzle out,” said Sambre.

Indian markets were the best performers within the Asian region in the week ended Friday. The preelection rally has helped sentiments as opinion polls suggested that the BJP-led coalition is likely to return to power after general elections outcome on May 23.

The Sensex gained 3.7 per cent during the week and the Nifty gained 3.6 per cent, while markets in Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan ended up 0.1-2.8 per cent.

“Market has turned sharply. One should wait for correction to buy,” said Nischal Maheshwari, CEO-institutional equities and advisory at Centrum Broking.

Maheshwari said the banking and financial services sector will continue to do well. Investors should look at sectors such as construction space where there is good earnings visibility but the stocks are available cheap, said Maheshwari."

44,2019-03-18,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Stocks wriggled out of a tough situation on Monday and ended positive for the sixth straight session, saved just in time by a rally in banking shares.

Market participants factored in an accommodative stance by the US Fed at its next policy meet, which added to the appeal of equities.

A narrowing trade deficit and FII buying offered more tailwinds. Rupee's superb show against the dollar, up by as much as 50 paise, prompted more buying. 

Benchmark indices saw a gap-up start, but traders locked in gains soon after. 

Heavyweight RIL and select private stocks contributed most to Sensex's rally. The BSE benchmark settled up 71 points, or 0.19 per cent, at 38,095. NSE Nifty closed at 11,462, up 35 points, or 0.31 per cent.

Factors at work

Rupee rallyThe rupee continued its climb against the dollar amid firm foreign inflows in Indian equities and weakness in the greenback. The local currency rose as much as 50 paise to 68.59. According to a Reuters poll, analysts are bullish on the rupee for the first time in nearly a year.


Global markets stay upbeatGlobal stocks rose to their highest in five months and the dollar dipped on Monday as traders began to price in an accommodative stance from the US Federal Reserve at its policy meeting this week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3 per cent, hitting a five-month high. MSCI's All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 per cent on the day.

42,2019-03-18,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Extending their winning streak to the sixth consecutive session, Indian equity benchmarks opened with solid gains on Monday, as investors bought shares across sectors. 

Investors’ risk appetite increased after government data showed a drop in India’s trade deficit to hit a 17-month low in February on a sharp fall in import of oil, gold and electronic goods.

Sustained FPI flows, rupee's continuous rise against the US dollar, easing crude oil prices and hopes that the US Fed will stay dovish in its policy review later this week boosted sentiment.

Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

BHEL | Buy | Target price: Rs 75 | Stop loss: Rs 63

Further, it has also completed a bearish AB=CD pattern, indicating bullishness building up in the stock.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Federal Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 97 | Stop loss: Rs 87
With Bank Nifty making new lifetime highs, this counter is well placed to be a catch-up play with the larger trends. After almost a vertical move from the lows of Rs 78, this counter appears to be on the pause mode for the last four sessions and sooner rather than later it should resume its upmove with an initial target placed at Rs 97. 


Raymonds | Buy | Target price: Rs 885 | Stop loss: Rs 799
This counter has been consolidating for the last couple of sessions after the steep upmove witnessed by it from the lows of Rs 674–835 levels. Momentum shall pick up once again on a close above Rs 835. In such a scenario, it can test its interim top placed around Rs 885 level. 


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

ONGC | Buy | Target price: Rs 165 | Stop loss: Rs 150
The stock has broken bullish continuation pattern along with higher volumes on the daily chart. The sharp pullback from lower levels of Rs 150 has formed a hammer pattern which indicates a trend reversal. 


Torrent Power | Buy | Target price: Rs 270 | Stop loss: Rs 248
On the daily chart, a flag pattern is seen after a recent run-up from lower levels of Rs 230. This consolidation makes the trend healthier for the next leg of upmove. The volume, which has been dry, seems to be rising now while RSI shows momentum to remain strong and up with a reading of 63. 


Kkunal Parar, Senior Technical Research Analyst, Choice Broking 

IDFC First Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 62.15 | Stop loss: Rs 47
On the weekly chart, the stock has given a breakout from the neckline of its cup & handle pattern formation with an increase in volume, which suggests a bull run. The stock may surge from its current level. On the daily chart, the stock has a given breakout of its flag pattern formation which is a continuation pattern and indicates an upside move in the counter.


M&M | Buy | Target price: Rs 733 | Stop loss: Rs 675
On the weekly chart, this stock has formed a bullish Harami pattern, which is a reversal formation and suggests that the trend may reverse in the counter. On the daily scale, the stock has given a breakout of its falling trend line which suggests a robust upside movement in the counter. Furthermore, the stock has closed above its 200-day exponential moving average which shows northward movement in the counter.


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities

Kotak Mahindra Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,440 | Stop loss: Rs 1,270
Kotak Mahindra Bank is one of the strongest stocks in the market currently. Last week, the stock broke out of the Rs 1,198-1,315 trading range on the back of above average volumes. This augurs well for the uptrend to continue. Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily momentum readings too are in rising mode and not overbought.

39,2019-03-18,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty registered a gap-up start to Monday's session on hopes that the US Fed will sound dovish in its policy meet next week.

A fall in India's trade deficit print to a 17-month low in February, on a sharp decline in import of oil, gold and electronics, was seen as a major positive by investors. 

Besides, rupee's continuous rise against the US dollar, sustained FPI inflow, easing crude oil prices and positive global cues boosted the risk appetite of investors. 

The rupee opened 18 paise higher at 68.92 against the US dollar and global crude oil prices eased on concerns over fall in global demand.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 4,323.49 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with NSE suggested. 

Sensex jumped about 300 points, while Nifty topped 11,510 in early deals. 

Around 9:25 am, the BSE benchmark Sensex was 261 points, or 0.69 per cent, up at 38,285. The NSE Nifty was 77 points, or 0.68 per cent, up at 11,504 at that time. 

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.61 per cent and 0.51 per cent up, respectively. 

Shares of Power Grid, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints and HDFC Bank were among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

Analyst calls

• Emkay Global has a sell rating on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 18,000. Royal Enfield volumes suffered a 10 per cent year-on-year decline over November 2018 and February 2019 despite the absence of negative one-off factors such as production losses due to labor strikes, said Emkay. 

• Citigroup has a neutral rating on Info Edge (India) with a target price of Rs 1,715. Info Edge reported muted EBITDA growth in the third quarter owing to elevated ad spends across recruitment, property and matrimonial businesses, said Citi. 

 • Kotak Securities has downgraded KNR Constructions to add from buy and revised target price to Rs 282 from Rs 239. The company has bagged around Rs 10 billion worth of new projects in the last one month and is on track to meet its guidance of adding Rs 20 billion of new orders in 3-6 months timeline, said Kotak Securities. 

• HSBC has initiated coverage on Aster DM Healthcare with buy rating and target price of Rs 205. Aster is among the largest healthcare providers in the Gulf Cooperation Council and India through its hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, said HSBC. The firm has estimated Aster’s GCC EBITDA to double in five years despite the current macro weakness in the region. 

• CLSA has a buy rating on Sadbhav Engineering with a target price of Rs 340. While the stock is up 45 per cent in the last one month led by risk on rally, CLSA sees more legs to the stock. One of the key catalysts is potential divestiture of 9/11 of 12 operating NHs in favour of a global strategic investor, said CLSA.

NSE's Nifty ended at 11,354, down 103 points, or 0.90 per cent, where only 13 stocks advanced and 37 declined. 

Besides the global selloff, fatigue seems to be overtaking Indian equity markets after an 8-day rally.


Market in a nutshell
Finance and banking proved to be key drags on the Sensex. HDFC and index heavyweight RIL together shaved off more than 100 points. 

Vedanta was the worst hit, dropping 3.28 per cent. Tata Motors, YES Bank, M&M, ICICI Bank and HDFC landed on the losers'side. 

ONGC ducked the selloff, up 4 per cent. Coal India, PowerGrid, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank were in a pool of green.

In the sectoral space, only utilities, oil & gas and power notched up gains. Telecom was left licking its wounds, coming off by over 2 per cent. Realty declined 1.83 per cent.

Midcap and smallcap indices lost 1.06 per cent and 1.16 per cent, respectively.


What factors led to the selloff


Global recession fears
Investors lapped up safer assets amid concerns of slowdown in global economy and recession fears in the US. The US yield curve inverted on Friday for the first time since mid-2007, the strongest indication of a possible recession for the world's largest economy. 

MSCI's index for emerging market shares fell 1.4 per cent, on track to record its biggest one-day fall this year, with indices falling across the board led by Asia, Reuters reported. 


Questions loom over Brexit
After suffering two defeats, the British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying her best to get the deal cleared by the British parliament which is weighing various possibilities, including a no-deal Brexit to Brextension and even exit from Brexit. Political turmoil in Britain over the country's exit from the European Union remains a sticky issue for risky assets.


Advance-decline ratio on a downhill
The advance-decline ratio has remained tepid, despite the recent rise in the market, suggesting only a few stocks were pulling the benchmark indices higher. It's not a healthy sign. On Monday too, declines outnumbered advances 3:1. The number of stocks that have declined has beaten the gainers on the BSE over the last week with the ratio being below 1 consistently.


Expert Take
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
Lingering concerns on global economic slowdown dragged down the domestic indices. The consolidation was broad based where mid and smallcaps underperformed. US bond yield has fallen as risk appetite of investors to equities reduced due to fear of a looming recession. Consolidation may extend in the near term. However, domestic macro-economic sentiment remains strong. Stability in oil prices and increase in FIIs inflow in expectation of earnings revival and formation of stable government reflects the strength of the market.

Though the domestic equity market is reacting to the global uncertainties and volatility, the low-interest rates and weak inflation globally are actually favourable for the domestic bond market and would consequently mean a positive rub-off on equities."
56,2019-03-26,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Led by gains in banking stocks and index heavyweight RIL, domestic markets kicked off Tuesday's trading session on a positive note. Fresh fears over US recession that plagued Asian peers didn't dampen the sentiment back home but still remains an overhang.

The Asian shares were shaky on Tuesday after US Treasury yields plummeted to their lowest levels since late 2017, further below short-term interest rates and adding to fears of a US recession. 

However, former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said that the US Treasury yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point, but it does not signal a recession.

Mild gains in rupee along with consistent inflows from foreign investors lent the much needed support to the market. Rupee opened 4 paise higher against the US dollar. “Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 68.70 and 69.20,” brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Moreover, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 150.40 crore worth of domestic stocks on Monday, data available with NSE suggested.

At around 9.35 am, BSE benchmark Sensex was trading 102 points or 0.27 per cent higher at 37,911 while its NSE counterpart Nifty eyed the 11,400-mark. The 50-pack index was trading 38 points or 0.33 per cent higher at 11,392.

""Once this corrective phase is over, Nifty could resume its prevailing uptrend. Levels of 11,180-11227 could act as a crucial support levels from near term perspective, also sustenance above for the same is essential to keep structural outlook positive,"" YES Securities said in a note.

In the Sensex pack, 21 stocks traded in the green while nine were in the red. ONGC with gains of over 2 per cent topped the gainer pack, followed by Coal India, NTPC, Vedanta, Sun Pharma and Reliance. 

Infosys, on the other hand, topped the loser board plunging 1.56 per cent. Among other losers were TCS, Power Grid, Bajaj Auto, HDFC Bank and ITC.

In the Nifty pack, 35 constituents were advancing while 15 were declining. 

On the BSE sectoral front, barring IT and teck, all other sectors showcased bullishness. Realty, oil & gas and energy rose the most by 1.54 per cent, 1.26 per cent and 1.08 percent, respectively.

Furthermore, BSE Midcap and BSE Small cap too breathed fresh, rising 0.50 per cent and 0.55 per cent, respectively."
55,2019-03-26,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Indian stock indices fell nearly 1 per cent on Monday, logging their biggest one-day decline in over six weeks, as fears of a recession in the US sparked a sell-off across global markets.

The Sensex declined 355.7 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 37808.9 and the Nifty fell 102.6 points, or 0.9 per cent, to close at 11,354.2, ending at their lowest level in a week.

The US markets on Friday suffered their worst day since January when the yield on 3-month treasuries rose above the rate on 10-year treasury yields for the first time since 2007. An inverted yield curve has been historically associated with an upcoming recession. German manufacturing data contracted for the third straight month, adding to fears of a global growth slowdown.

“With recent data coming from Germany and the US, bond markets are suggesting rising fears of a growth slowdown. The Fed has also gone off the tightening cycle. So all these factors are making markets fear a global economic slowdown,” said Neil Kansari, senior portfolio manager at US-based Sands Capital Management.

Flows by foreign portfolio investors moderated sharply in the wake of the global market sell-off. FPIs net bought local stocks worth Rs 150.4 crore on Monday, provisional data showed. FPIs have bought local stocks worth nearly Rs 2,000 crore on an average every day in March till Friday. Their total inflows this month is about Rs 29,500 crore. DIIs net sold local stocks worth Rs 12.5 crore.



All sector indices on the NSE ended in the red, with media, bank, auto and real estate stocks losing the most.

Vedanta, Tata Motors, YES Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra and ICICI Bank were the worst performers in the Sensex with a fall of 2-3 per cent. Coal India, ONGC, and Power Grid Corporation of India gained the most on the Sensex, ending up 2-4 per cent. Mid- and small-cap indices on BSE also shed 1 per cent. Defying the weakness in the broad market. Jet Airways (India) ended up 15.46 per cent at Rs 261 on NSE as the top midcap index performer after principal promoters Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal stepped down from the company’s board.

The volatility gauge, India VIX, gained for second consecutive session, ending up 2 per cent at 16.6.

Yet, India fared better than other Asian markets on Monday, which fell 0.9-3 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 sank the most. In Europe, markets in France, Germany and the UK were down 0.3-0.6 per cent in mid-session.

“India is one of those isolated countries where global growth matters but on a relative basis it is much more a domestic economy. While India is not immune to global stock market volatility, the ability of the Indian economy to do reasonably well even in a weaker global outlook is better than countries which are export-driven in our view,” said Kansari.

With Monday’s second straight day of declines, India's benchmark have retreated further from record high levels. The Sensex had scaled an all-time high of 38,989.6 on August 29 and the Nifty had touched a record high of 11,760.2 on August 28.

Indian markets had been showing signs of fatigue over the last week after a pre-election rally that saw the Sensex and the Nifty surging about 8 per cent from their February lows on rising bets that the current Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition will return to power for the second time.

The advance-declines ratio has been in favour of declines for seven out of the last eight trading sessions. About 1,930 stocks fell on the BSE on Monday, while 747 advanced and 190 were unchanged from their previous close.

Market strategists believe Indian equities could lose more of the recently made gains if the recession fears deepen.

“As recession fears rise, markets may rally in the short term on expectation that global central banks will be more dovish. But ultimately if recession happens, there may be a big fall in markets across the globe,” said Piyush Garg, chief investment officer at ICICI Securities."
59,2019-03-27,PowerGrid,"If you are someone who owns listed physical shares, you won't be able to transfer them after March 31 without first dematerialising them. After March 31, listed companies' physical shares will need to be 'dematerialised' to be sold or transferred. Consequently, after March 31, unless dematerialised, these shares would become technically 'illiquid'. 

The capital markets regulator had extended the previous deadline of December 5, 2018 for transfer of listed shares in physical. In a December 3 press release regarding the extension of the deadline, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) stated that it had ""received representations from shareholders for extension of the date of compliance."" 

The reason for this may be the fact that a lot of people still own equity shares in physical form, especially senior citizens. As on December 31, 2018, almost 4 percent of the total number of shares of the 30 Sensex companies were still held in physical form. That is 418 crore shares still in non-demat form. When 
ET Online did the story in November last year, there were a total of 423 crore shares held in physical form among the 30 companies that constitute the Sensex. Then, too, there wasn't a single company in the benchmark index where all shares are dematerialised. 

Sample this: a company like ITC has 375 crore shares in physical form in total, which is a whopping 30 percent of its total equity shares. Others are better off, Bajaj Auto l has 6.18 percent in physical form, Tata Steel has 1.9 percent, and HUL 1.7 percent. Coal India has the least number of non-dematerialised shares (5289 shares that is 0.000085 percent). And a slightly far away second is Power Grid with 41,973 shares held physically, which is 0.000802 percent. 

Now, since data on shareholding pattern is released when companies announce their quarterly results, we can only tell after March 31, 2019, (end of the Jan-Mar quarter) to see if investors have indeed dematerialised all their shares. 

So, if you are someone who hasn't dematerialised their physical shares here is a look at what will happen to those shares and how you can dematerialise the shares before the March 31 deadline. 


Why are there so many physical shares?
On June 8, 2018, Sebi notified the amended Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements regulations saying that except in the case of transmission or transposition of securities, listed companies will not be allowed to process requests for the transfer of shares shall not be processed unless the securities are held in the dematerialised form with a depository.

Most of these shares have been purchased decades ago before the Depository Act was passed and since the investors intended to hold them long-term, they did not see any reason to pay for a demat account.

These are some of the reasons why people still have physical shares. 



These are legacy shares held by many families, where certificates have been inherited from forefathers.
Investors who have changed their names.
Investors who have moved abroad and become NRIs.
Joint holders and combinations created for IPO subscription now difficult to bring back together.
Joint holders who are no more, with no nomination or documents needed to claim the shares.


What will happen to these shares after March 31?According to Sebi, no transaction for transfer of securities of a listed company, at a stock exchange or an off-market transactions between buyers and sellers, can happen in physical certificate form. So, all shares held in physical after March 31 will become illiquid except for transmission and transposition. Transmission (transfer to heirs in case of death of owner) would be possible in case of inheritance but the new owners will have to dematerialise the shares if they wish to sell or further transact in them. 


How to convert to demat?The first step is to open a demat account if you do not already have one. The demat account will have to be opened in the names of all the holders of the shares in case of shares which are held jointly and the order of holding (first and second) in the demat account will have to be the same as that of the shares. For opening of a demat account all the KYC verification procedures will have to be completed for all holders, incorporating the contact details, address, email, bank account for electronic transfer of dividends and such details of the investors. The second step is to complete the Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF) for the physical shares, along with all the required documents. Normally, separate demat forms need to be filled in for shares of different companies.

""If the company whose shares are being held has not joined a depository, and therefore does not have a unique number (ISIN), such shares cannot be dematerialised. Except these, all other physical shares can be converted into electronic entries, which make it easy to sell, pledge, transfer and otherwise easily transact with them,"" wrote Uma Shashikant, chairperson of the Centre for Investment Education and Learning, in a recent column.


Opening a demat accountDemat accounts can be opened with any depository participant (DP) in India. A DP is a financial services firm that ties up with a depository and becomes a participant. Shares dematerialised with a particular DP are held in demat account of the client and allotted unique Client IDs. 

The securities in the demat account are held by the depositary participant (DP) with any one of two depositories in India. There are two Depositories - National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and the Central Depository Services India Ltd (CDSL). The Depository where your shares will be held in demat form will depend on which one your financial services firm has tied up with. The address of your demat account therefore would include the client ID and the DP-ID after that.

Some of the DPs operating in India include Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank etc.


Charges: As with any financial service, the fees and transaction charges play an important role while selecting a DP. In addition to the account opening fees (which the DP some times waive off) and the annual maintenance fee, , the transaction charges are important. So, base your decision on whether you are going to trade very often or buy and stay invested for a longer duration. (As a retail investor, it is advisable to invest rather than to trade.) DPs have various kinds of pricing plans on offer for demat accounts. For example, it can be 0.50 percent or minimum of Rs 25, on both buy and sell transaction values."
60,2019-03-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Stock heavyweights dragged key benchmark indices down on Wednesday even as the market latched on to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation. 

The Sensex spurted over 200 points during Modi's speech that India has shot down a live satellite in space.

The market reversed its course and ended lower, erasing early gains. 

Global shares were off-colour, hoping that central bank action in the world's biggest economies could temper some of the slowdown in world growth, even though bond yields continued to flag recessionary fears, Reuters reported. 

Volatility remained high ahead of the expiry of March futures and options series. 

The BSE Sensex came off some 350 points from its intra-day high. The 30-share index closed at 38,133, down 101 points, or 0.26 per cent. Reliance Industries alone was responsible for half of the losses. 

The broader Nifty ended at 11,445, down 38 points or 0.33 per cent. However, the Nifty Bank index hit fresh record highs and settled above the 30,000 mark for the first time ever. 


Market Bulletin
As many as 20 Sensex compnents declined while 10 advanced. NTPC with a loss of 2.25 per cent sank most, followed by Tata Motors, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, HDFC and RIL. 

On the other hand, YES Bank looked up, up 5.62 per cent. IndusInd Bank, SBI, Bajaj Auto and Vedanta registered solid gains. 

Bucking the trend, midcap and smallcap indices jumped 0.59 per cent and 0.64 per cent, respectively.

In the sectoral space, energy, power and utilities faltered, declining around 1 per cent each. However, bankex was the top sectoral performer. 

In stock-specific action, ICICI Prudential Life surged over 9 per cent after its offer for sale (OFS) issue by promoters received a strong response from non-retail investors. The OFS was oversubscribed 3.96 times on March 26, the first day of subscription that opened only for non-retail investors. The retail quota was subscribed 37 per cent on Day 2 so far.


A round-up on factors


F&O expiry
Volatility stoked worries on Dalal Street as investors squared off positions ahead of March derivatives expiry on Thursday. India VIX spiked 3.57 per cent. 


Global markets flat
European shares, which broke four straight days of losses on Tuesday, held steady though bank shares rose 1 per cent after comments by European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi signalled more assistance for banks via a cheap loans programme. However, MSCI's all-country world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down around 0.1 per cent.


Selling in index heavyweights
Index heavyweights -- RIL, HDFC duo and TCS -- caused much of the damage. Losses in the blue chips offset any gains by bank stocks. RIL along with HDFC and HDFC Bank wiped off over 100 points from the Sensex. 


Expert Take

Banking space has outperformed with a significant margin while auto and metals have underperformed in the recent past. We continue to maintain a positive bias for the broader markets with bouts of correction to be used for accumulation. For the near term, support on the downside is seen at 11,200 levels while targets are seen at 11,800-12,200.- Sahaj Agrawal, Kotak Securities

Market gave up opening gains ahead of F&O expiry and on worries over global economic growth as US 10-year yield slid further. However, the bank index remains in positive trajectory in expectation of ease in liquidity crunch and pick-up in credit growth by FY20. India is likely to continue its outperformance among emerging markets due to FIIs inflow, expectation of revival in earnings growth and political stability.- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"
61,2019-03-27,PowerGrid,"It is more to do with bottom-up stock picking at this stage and there is no specific value in a sector, said Jigar
   
   
   Shah, CEO, Kim Eng Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. UltraTech among largecaps and Odisha Cement and Star Cement among midcaps are his favourites. In auto, he is bullish on Mahindra and Bajaj Auto.Edited excerpts:


Do FIIs like the private bank space and is there a clear indication that FIIs are buying these names?
Yes, they like private banks because of the weightage in the index and also the opportunity to get the market share from the public sector banks. Now even NBFCs are in a sweet spot. Their capital adequacy is better and also their worries on the recoveries, etc, are now gone. They should be getting some good recoveries now. 

Everything favours the private banks. Their ALMs are good and on the whole there is demand for not only the larger banks like ICICI, Axis, HDFC but also IndusInd and Yes are back in favour. Even smaller private banks are being watched quite closely by the investors.


What do you do with these private banking names? Are the valuations there attractive or should one be careful after the recent move in the last one month ?
We will have to take a view of a couple of years from now, particularly when we are looking at names like ICICI and Axis where the ROE expansion is yet to take place. But clearly, the promise is much better than it was in the past two years and some amount of rally has taken place but there is steam in these stocks and corrections would be meaningful points of entry.

As for HDFC or IndusInd, these banks already reflect the confidence of investors and the performance and valuation both are going hand in hand. In terms of some of the smaller private banks like Federal Bank and Yes Bank, there is opportunity and they can get serious re-rating if the performance is good and especially in case of Yes Bank, the new management garners better confidence among investors.


What are you tracking? We are looking for value in a market that seems to be on an overall upmove?
It is more to do with bottom-up at this stage and not finding specific value in a sector. But some of the stocks where we find value in largecaps include Power Grid which is looking very attractive at the current valuation. It is trading around 1.5 time book with the risk-on ROEs not being there anymore. 

The other stocks that we like among largecaps are Mahindra and Bajaj Auto which are trading at the lower end of their valuation band over the years and they promise to do better compared to their peers. 

In the midcaps, there are a few other alternatives. In terms of the BFSI space, Edelweiss is looking quite attractive after the correction. JM Financials is also looking good. 

Mahanagar Gas is another good story where the earnings growth is quite stable and there are many other catalysts in place to lift that growth. So, there are quite a few names here in these spaces plus there are some names in tech which we like that is Mphasis, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech.


There have been other trends in the market that have started to emerge in the rally. Are you looking at real estate or any other ancillary plays?
The best way to play that would be through cement which I feel should post much better Q4 compared to Q3, perhaps a good year-on-year growth in Q4 and the valuations have also come off. 

Cement in recent months has underperformed. I would think that cement stocks present a good opportunity. UltraTech looks good among largecaps. That is our pick and in the midcaps we like Dalmia Cement now called Odisha Cement and Star Cement. Cement sector is a good one to bet on given the stability and record compared to property companies where there could be many moving parts.


What is your take on aviation? 
We do not formally cover the sector and I can only give a general opinion that in the current environment, clearly IndiGo and to some extent SpiceJet will be better off. IndiGo’s balance sheet is better than many others and they would be able to take benefit of the ongoing situation. That is my limited comment on the sector."
57,2019-03-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty registered a strong opening on Wednesday in the light of positive sentiment in global markets ahead of a new round of US-China trade talks. 

US stocks climbed overnight and Treasuries declined, showing signs of an ebb in investor concern over economic slowdown. 

The US and China look set to begin their new round of talks on Thursday. 

US and Chinese officials resume high-level trade talks this week as they close in on a deal that could just be the first step in the long road to economic peace, a Bloomberg report said.

Sustained FPI inflow has been a major factor that has infused bullish sentiment in the market lately. 

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 999.02 crore worth of domestic stocks on Tuesday, data available with NSE suggested. 

Sensex jumped over 220 points and Nifty topped 11,530 in early deals. 



Around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was 196 points, or 0.51 per cent, up at 38,429, while the Nifty index was 48 points, or 0.42 per cent, up at 11,531.

Midcaps and smallcaps climbed in sync with Sensex as their sectoral indices on BSE were trading 0.63 per cent and 0.48 per cent higher, respectively, at that time. 

IndusInd Bank, YES Bank, Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma and Larsen & Toubro were among the top gainers in the Sensex index, jumping up to 4 per cent.

58,2019-03-27,PowerGrid,"If one is happy in the sense of not playing the high beta cyclical stocks and being content with 10% kind of a 
  
  
  compounded story over the next few years, stocks like NTPC, Power Grid offer value, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, said in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


What is your take on movers like DLF? Do you look at it from an investment perspective or do you think yesterday’s pop was a knee-jerk reaction to QIP plans?
The kind of actions DLF has initiated are steps in the right direction. The leverage on their balance sheet needs to come down as they are operating out of regions like NCR Gurgaon where the inventory levels are abysmally high. So, new launches are unlikely. The existing sales probably needs to pick up velocity and at the same time the leverage component is eating into whatever cash flows they are generating. 

On the annuity side, it is a pretty solid business. We have probably seen annuity businesses specifically in real estate doing pretty well over the past few quarters and that has probably held up where the residential part of the business has shown a lot of stress.

The kind of expectations that one has with capital raising for deleveraging the balance sheet and reducing the interest burden gets justified to a certain extent but the structural issues in terms of demand coming back significantly and the expectations of inventory getting liquidated over the next few quarters and regulatory moves in terms of lower GST rates need to get panned out. From April 1st, without input tax credit, what kind of an impact that has in terms of overall demand needs to be seen. We do not hold DLF in a portfolio and think what really is a hold is something like Godrej Properties where new launches are pretty solid as are the EBITDA margins and the leverages comparatively manageable.

The recognition in terms of projects at hand and on the revenue front should start getting reflected on the cash flows as well. I am being very selective on the pocket and the sector in particular.


What are your thoughts on the big deal that is brewing -- Tata GIC picking up a big stake in GMR?
The enterprise value that probably comes through what GMR probably expects from the airport business. It is one of their best businesses and a cash cow in terms of airport and aeronautical revenues and the expectations of monetisation of the land bank both at Delhi, Hyderabad and even at the Goa. When you are talking about a stake sale happening in the core part of their businesses, the enterprise value for their other businesses is something that one really needs to look at.

When you are talking about GMR Energy or road assets, the combined value is significantly less compared to what the enterprise value for the airport business might be. 

The high leverage on the balance sheets has certainly created flutters in promoter camps and deleveraging has become a must. There is almost Rs 23,000-crore odd debt on their books which needs to come down drastically.

A large part of the move in terms of the expectations of this announcement and what probably comes out of the press conference might still play out on the stock price, but after that it is going to be back to what happens to the other assets. Therein lies the weak point of GMR. 

Fundamentally, there is no justification even if the stock moves higher from the current levels because the cash flow remains extremely weak for the other businesses and a large part of the good news would probably come in the price. An up move is expected if this announcement does happen at this point of time.


Just looking at the way some of these beaten down power ancillaries have moved like NTPC, REC and PFC. Although REC took a bit of a breather yesterday, the day before saw a solid move coming in here. Is there anything from investment perspective that interests you?
This could be attributed to the CPSE buying that is probably expected to take place. You are probably looking at a structure and improvement in the dynamics of how this business works. One really needs to give it a lot of time because all these power related stories are long gestation projects. 

The government has given for the government run utilities the regulated ROEs. The regulated ROEs of 15.5% for power companies is extremely encouraging. At the same time. when you are talking about the capitalisation and the capex trends, that also is expected to continue over the next few quarters.

Capitalisation to capex ratio remaining healthy and expectations of regulated ROEs staying above 15.5%, augur well from a balance sheet perspective and that also probably points to the fact that there will be a steady 8% to 10% earnings growth. 

If one is happy in the sense of not playing the high beta cyclical stocks and being content with 10% kind of a compounded story over the next few years, stocks like NTPC, Power Grid offer that kind of value."

62,2019-03-28,PowerGrid,"British Airways, Postal Life Insurance and Philips India are among the about 100 entities that have sought to be part of the resolution process of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services as financial creditors. The companies said that their provident funds have invested in the bankrupt IL&FS and contend that they stand to suffer grave injury, which would be detrimental to public interest if they were excluded from the process.

“Around 100 intervening petitions have been filed in the National Companies Law Appellate Tribunal to allow them to be party in the IL&FS case,” said a person in know of the matter. “These are PF accounts of Philips India, SAS employee provident fund trust, British Airways Cabin Crew Pension Fund, PLC staff fund and superannuation fund.” PF investments are unsecured and these investors want to be part of the resolution process as financial creditors to protect their company’s and their employees’ interests in these companies.

Provident funds of companies are estimated to have invested Rs 15,000-20,000 crore in IL&FS group entities. The government superseded the IL&FS board on October 1 and appointed new members after the company, with a debt of Rs 91,000 crore, defaulted on loan payments. IL&FS has since put its group assets on sale, including energy and road projects, to monetise the investments and repay their creditors.

City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra, Ambuja Cements, Indian Oil Corp., Titan, Power Grid and Indian Postal Life Insurance are among those which want to be part of the resolution process as financial creditors. The petitions were filed over the past two months.

66,2019-03-28,PowerGrid,"By Soumya Malini & Arun Mukherjee 

(Kolkata’s Arun Mukherjee, who dropped out of college to turn a full-time investor at an early age, and Soumya Malani, a London School of Economics alumnus, have come to be known as smallcap aficionados within India’s investor community. They would show up at most AGMs, visit the remotest factories of a company and go chasing end-users to understand their experience with a product in their passionate hunt for good smallcaps. Arun and Soumya share their experiences with such companies from the ground in this space every now and then.) 
The power sector can be broadly categorised into four segments, power generators, grids and power distributors.

Let’s start with companies like BHEL which constructs power plants. Valuations of this kind of companies depend on their order books/capex cycle. Then comes the power generation companies such as NTPC and JSW Energy for whom profitability primarily depends on utilisation given for PPAs. One major advantage of such companies now is that the cost of coal is getting passed on, which wasn’t the case earlier.

Third segment consists of the grids, such as PowerGrids of the world, which are like nodal distributors from state to state. Last segment belongs to guys like Tata, CESC and Adani (earlier Reliance Energy), which manage last-mile distribution. It would be prudent to note that the grids get a stable ROE kind of return while the last-mile guys get an upside on volume growth.


Basic Thesis: It takes 3-4 years to set up a new power plant. Demand has been growing steadily at 7-8 per cent a year, which is in line with real GDP growth. Capacity addition was growing at around ~15 per cent for three years in a row i.e. FY11 to FY13, which led to overcapacity and supply glut. Supply addition has slowed down to 2-3 per cent over the past six years, so utilisations are inching higher for power generating companies.

PSU companies get preference in PPAs (power purchase agreements), hence the PLF (plant load factor) for them would always be higher than that of their private counterparts. On an average it would be close to 80 per cent. Which is why PSU generation companies have higher utilisation rates.

Let us consider a simple back-of-the-envelope three-year thesis on any operational power generation private company assuming PLF at 60 per cent and no increase in tariff. So revenues and Ebitda can go up by 50 per cent for private sector power companies on the same capacities with interest and depreciation either reducing or remaining constant. So for example, a JSW Energy would see revenues at Rs 13,500 crore by FY21 and Ebitda at a minimum of Rs 4,000 crore. Interest@ Rs 800 crore given the debt repayment schedule and constant depreciation at Rs 1,100 crore would give a profit before tax of Rs 2,100 crore and profit after tax of Rs 1,500 crore. If valued at approximately seven-times Ebitda, the market-cap would automatically double. 

That’s the broad thesis for all such companies in the power sector. The same model can be applied to any power generation company.

First to benefit will be the power generation companies over the next 2-3 years. Post which when the next round of capex starts, guys like BHEL will benefit. For distribution and grid companies, it will be business as usual with steady growth. As in, no earnings inflection. They should see a steady 6-8 per cent growth on existing assets. New assets, of course, will come in at a 14-16 per cent ROE.

As a thumb rule for thermal power generation plants, it costs Rs 4.5-5 crore for each MW capacity. So a 1GW plant will have a capex of Rs 4,500-6,000 crore. So if you notice a capex of say Rs 7,500- 8,000 crore per GW, just understand that it is capex gold plating (which means inclusion of costly and unnecessary features and refinements in capital projects.)

An interesting choice, if asked to name, could be Gujarat Industrial Power. The company with 800 mw capacity is quoting an enterprise value of around Rs 1,700 crore. Replacement cost of assets would be like Rs 4,000-5,000 crore. So in good times we might see a much higher valuation as the capacity gets utilised. As it is a PSU, we can assume no management concerns. In the private segment, Jindal Steel and Power or JSW Energy may offer higher upsides because of higher leverage.

Empirical evidence shows barring commodities, no sector which created wealth in the previous bull cycle got repeated in the later bull markets. Power as a sector hardly created any wealth over the past 15-18 years. Let alone creating wealth, they have been wealth destroyers. Most of the companies are quoting at a huge discount to their replacement costs of assets. They are severely under-owned and hated bets. But things are changing operationally for sure.

The next five years can well belong to some of the quality stocks from this space. Few of the companies even come with highly attractive dividend yields, which protect their downsides. Valuations look pretty attractive and with clear signs of early tailwinds, we should definitely watch out for some of these power stocks."

0,2019-04-01,PowerGrid,"It took a good seven months for the flagship Sensex to hit a new all-time peak of 39,017 on Monday. But that has a jarring note. 

An aerial view of Dalal Street shows more patches of red than green despite this smart rally. 

The index earlier hit a high of 38,989.70 on August 29. 

The upside is mainly being driven by buying in select private banks, including Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, which jumped 11-19 per cent since August last. 

There were other bright spots, too. Bajaj Auto (up 8.50 per cent), Asian Paints (up 7.18 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 5.30 per cent), HCL Technologies (up 5.28 per cent) and Infosys (up 5.26 per cent) showed their mettle. 

Similarly, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI, Larsen & Toubro, Power Grid, Bajaj Finance and HDFC advanced up to 4 per cent during the same period.

“The rise in equity markets currently looks like a catch-up rally just before the 2019 general elections, especially in the case of private banks which are making new highs. NBFC stocks which took a beating post the IL&FS crisis have bounced back. However, concerns still remain, especially with regard to smaller NBFCs. On the global economic front, concerns stay with regard to rising oil prices and slowdown in the global economy which may impact investor sentiment,” said Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

The sore point is the rest 16 stocks, including Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki in the Sensex pack, dived up to a staggering 34 per cent.

Analysts believe that higher chances of repo rate cut by RBI this week, unabated inflows by foreign investors and hopes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi retaining power lifted sentiment.

However, oil remains the joker in the pack. Wild movement in the rupee, US-China trade woes, tensions between India and Pakistan, corporate governance issues and the stubborn liquidity crisis at a leading NBFC roiled the outlook.

The broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices are still down by over 7 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, since August-end levels. 

Take this. Close to 66 per cent of stocks in the midcap space are flashing red. 

Among top movers and shakers, DHFL, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Power, Reliance Capital and Varroc Engineering tanked over 45 per cent in the past seven months while Muthoot Finance, Adani Power, Divi’s Laboratories and The Indian Hotels Company went up 20-50 per cent. 

After the recent run-up in select largecaps, experts are turning positive on the midcap space. 

“Two-three months ago, we were talking about 60 per cent allocation in largecaps and 40 per cent in midcaps. Today, I am close to 55-45 per cent in terms of how the allocation should be. So, midcaps have gone up, from say about 30-35 per cent to 45 per cent,” said Sunil Subramaniam, MD and CEO, Sundaram Mutual, in a recent chat with ETNow. 

Brokerage firm Elara Capital expects returns from midcaps to exceed 15 per cent in 2019 as against a fall of 15.3 per cent in the previous year.

Smallcaps are no better. Companies like Ashapura Intimates, Punj Lloyd, Infibeam Avenues, Rolta India, LEEL Electricals and Reliance Communications lost up to 97 per cent in the smallcap space. Nearly 700 BSE smallcaps are still below their August 2018 levels. 

Sugar stocks added a dose of sweetness though, featuring on the list of top gainers. Dhampur Sugar Mills, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Balrampur Chini Mills rallied up to 160 per cent. 

Sectoral data suggested that the recent buying was not broad-based. Barring BSE Bankex (up 7 per cent) and Oil & Gas index (up 1 per cent), rest of the sectoral indices faltered. Auto, Metal, Telecom, Healthcare and FMCG declined 6-24 per cent during the past seven months.

What went wrong with the market? It looked like a record close was in the making. But that was not to be as the index kept pitching down before making a feeble recovery in the end. 

Investor darling private bank stocks let Street down, pulling the Sensex lower on a day when the gauge notched up an all-time high of 39,115.57. 

It turned out to be a litmus test of investor confidence.

While the 30-scrip Sensex ended higher by 198 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 38,872, the broader NSE Nifty hit 11,655, up 32 points, or 0.27 per cent. 

Analysts said markets could not stand up to the strong resistance at 11,700 levels.

Auto major Tata Motors scored big time, jumping 7.37 per cent, after the company's British luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover on Friday reaffirmed expectations of a financially better fourth quarter. 

Vedanta (up 2.86 per cent), Bharti Airtel (up 2.73 per cent), Tata Steel (up 2.66 per cent), Maruti (up 2.57 per cent) and Reliance Industries (2.09 per cent) all pulled higher.

IndusInd Bank, M&M, Axis Bank, Power Grid and HDFC lost heavily.

In the sectoral space, metals rallied the most, followed by IT and teck. However, realty, consumer durables and bankex were among those that dropped the most.

Midcaps and smallcaps extended their winning spree to the fifth straight session, rising 0.52 and 0.78 per cent, respectively.

There are quite a few factors. Take a look.


MSCI defers GDR exclusion: In a big relief to the Indian markets, MSCI deferred its decision to exclude the shares being offered through Global and American Depository Receipts (GDRs, ADRs) while calculating foreign ownership limits (FOL).

The measures that stood postponed could have led over $1 billion outflow of overseas funds from India. Hectic negotiations between Indian government officials and MSCI have led the global index provider to postpone its decision, sources told the ET.


US-China trade talks: China's statement on Sunday that the country will continue to suspend additional tariffs on US vehicles and auto parts after April 1 was lapped up, too. This is seen as a goodwill gesture following a US decision to delay tariff hikes on Chinese imports. 

The two sides wrapped up two days of trade negotiations in Beijing last week. In a statement, the White House said, “The two parties continued to make progress during candid and constructive discussions on the negotiations and important next steps. The United States looks forward to the meetings planned with Vice Premier Liu He and the Chinese delegation in Washington next week.” 

The development raised hopes that the two largest economies may soon mend their strained ties.


Highest-ever GST collection: The government has collected highest ever GST for March crossing the Rs 1 lakh crore mark. The government mopped up Rs 1,06,577 crore, of which CGST is Rs 20,353 crore, SGST Rs 27,520 crore, IGST Rs 50,418 crore (including Rs 23,521 crore collected on imports) and cess Rs 8,286 crore (including Rs 891 crore collected on imports).

The macro numbers calmed investor nerves somewhat. Data released last week suggested that the current account deficit widened to 2.5 per cent of GDP in third quarter from 2.1 per cent a year ago, primarily on account of a higher trade deficit.


RBI rate cut hopes: An overwhelming majority expect a quarter percentage point reduction in the repo -- the rate at which banks borrow short-term money -- when the central bank concludes its monetary policy review on Thursday. Repo rate is now set at 6.25 per cent. 


Foreign inflows: Foreign portfolio investors pumped Rs 33,980.56 into domestic equities in March, double the Rs 17,219 crore in February. The numbers are highest ever for a single month.

The flows are such that Nifty50 soared 7.7 per cent last month to snap its 3-month losing streak. It posted the best monthly performance since March 2016. Nifty Bank surged over 13 per cent last month, its best monthly show since March 2016.

“My guess is buying by FII is likely to continue even post-election,” said Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC, in an interview with ETNOW. 

Meanwhile, the seasonality factor shows the Nifty surged in each of the last three years while Nifty Bank gained in each of the last 7 years during April."

Election optimism, hopes of another rate cut by RBI and strong FII inflows propelled BSE benchmark Sensex to a record closing high on Tuesday, a day after it scaled all-time peak of 39,115.

Domestic markets kept tracking the rally in global stocks all throughout. 

Overseas markets hovered near their six-month highs although crude's ascent to $70 a barrel proved to be a major overhang. 

Setting aside the oil worries, the rupee staged a comeback and jumped 19 paise to 68.97 against the dollar. The domestic currency slipped as much as 20 paise earlier in the morning.

The factors that did the talking


Hopes of RBI rate cut
According to market analysts, the wide consensus remains that the Reserve Bank of India will go for another 25 bps rate cut in its first bi-monthly policy meet outcome on April 4, shortly before India goes to poll. 

""The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI is likely to opt for a 25 bps rate cut, given that inflation in Q4 FY19 is tracking 2.5 per cent, below RBI’s 2.8 per cent forecast while growth has been slowing. Nevertheless, we believe the RBI will refrain from more aggressive easing, given the uncertainty around the monsoon outlook, the inclination towards populist fiscal policies around elections, and the need to assess transmission by banks.""



Global markets upbeat
World stocks hovered just under a six-month high on Tuesday as Brent inched up towards $70 a barrel for the first time since November, Brexit fatigue sapped sterling and the dollar showed signs of gaining strength again. 

Most European bourses posted slight gains early on, helped by Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100, which climbed as much as 0.5 per cent as exporters cheered the fourth fall in sterling in the last five days. Chinese blue-chips scored a 10-month high having leapfrogged Colombia to the top of the leaderboard of world share markets, Reuters reported.



Rupee rebounds
The domestic currency made a smart bounce on Tuesday. It was some 20 paise higher after slipping by the same value in the opening trade. Besides FII inflows, hopes of an RBI rate cut are what fed the rupee bulls.

Going with market experts, this was an important judgment as the circular was a big overhang on the power sector and lenders to the sector. “SC says RBI rules on defaulting companies are illegal. The court declared Feb 2018 RBI circular on NPAs ‘ultra vires,” ETNOW repoted.

The RBI circular had earlier directed banks to refer any loan account over Rs 2,000 crore under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) if it is not resolved within 180 days of default.

Power, shipping and sugar companies have challenged the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) February 12 circular which has identified about 30 companies, which have loans over Rs 2,000 crore and are stressed. Many of them were power companies and they have already challenged the RBI's circular in various courts.

Earlier this month RBI defended the February 12 circular, telling the SC that intention behind the circular was to give banks more powers in resolving stress and the 1-day default rule is to ensure banks & borrowers put a risk management framework in place. SC has reserved its verdict.

The prominent corporates where payments are due are Adani Power Maharashtra (Rs 9,463.29 crore), Damodar Valley Corpora (Rs 9,756.42 crore), Jaiprakash Power Ventures (Rs 8,719.16 crore), KSK Mahanadi Power Company (Rs 14,165.12 crore), Jindal Thermal Power (Rs 5,594.21 crore), Prayagraj Power Generation (Rs 9,883.28 crore), Jaiprakash Power Ventures (Rs 8,719.16 crore), GNR Chhatishgarh Energy (Rs 5,325.28 crore) and DB Power (Rs 5,930.56 crore) among a host of others, according to IANS.

16,2019-04-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Stock market kept its head above water all throughout Friday as traders bet on another interest rate cut by the RBI amid hopes of a trade deal between the US and China.

Though there were some signs of headway in US-China trade talks, it was the downward revision of growth outlook by RBI that held back the bulls from going higher.

The positive close came after two successive days of losses.

Risk sentiment got a shot in the arm after a news report that India grabbed the lion's share of capital inflows into Asia on optimism about the upcoming elections.

While BSE benchmark Sensex finished higher by 178 points or 0.46 per cent at 38,862, the broader NSE Nifty hit 11,667, up 68 points or 0.59 per cent.

For the week, Sensex ran up by 189 points, or 0.5 per cent and Nifty 42 points, or 0.36 per cent. 


Here's a quick market check.

Select heavyweights made their presence felt, with TCS, Infy and HDFC duo accounting for much of the gains.

Tata Steel took the lead in the Sensex heatmap, up more than 3 per cent. Vedanta and Bajaj Finance also closed higher. SBI, PowerGrid, Hero MotoCorp, NTPC and Sun Pharma were among the big losers, dropping up to 1.46 per cent.

From the sectoral perspective, realty, metal, oil and gas and financials kept the investors glued to their counters. 

In broader market, BSE Midcap and Smallcap scored higher than benchmark Sensex, rising up to 0.72 per cent.

There were quite a few factors behind the Sensex's journey today. Here they go.


Trade clouds recede a bitUS President Donald Trump on Friday infused some life into the long-drawn trade talks when he said something very ""monumental"" is likely in the next four weeks. High level trade talks are going on in Washington to hammer out an agreement that has so far remained elusive. Hopes of a breakthrough egged on investors to get on with buying.


Another rate cut coming?There is a growing buzz that RBI is still not done with its rate cutting cycle. Even analysts see more policy easing in coming days. In fact, the governor on Thursday said there is room for more rate cuts, with positive real interest rates of nearly 3 percentage points and a benign inflation outlook. 


Foreign inflow rush Overseas investors bought $4.96 billion worth of Asian shares in March, data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesian and Vietnam showed. What cheered investors back home was Indian stock markets received $4.89 billion, the biggest since February 2012, on expectations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come back to power in the over-a-month-long polls that commence next week. On the back of solid flows, Sensex and Nifty gained about 7.7 per cent last month, the highest among emerging markets.

What about the factors?


Global markets sluggish
World stocks stalled on Monday after a strong recent run as potential flashpoints including a crucial Brexit summit and central bank meetings loomed. Investors began to look ahead to an earnings season that may be disappointing, Reuters reported.

Signs of further stimulus from China helped Asian shares touch seven-month highs, but the enthusiasm was fleeting.

MSCI's world equity index was flat and European shares slipped 0.2 per cent as weak data from Germany and investor caution ahead of a string of political and monetary policy events held the market back.


Oil hits 5-month high
Oil prices rose to their highest level since November 2018 on Monday, driven by OPEC supply cuts, US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and fighting in Libya as well as strong US jobs data. Brent and WTI both hit their highest since November at $70.83 and $63.53 a barrel, respectively, early on Monday. 

The rise in crude prices triggered a fall in oil stocks and resulted in a weak rupee.


Caution ahead of elections, earnings
Market participants took cautious positions ahead of the general elections and earnings season which are both slated to kick off this week. After a sharp rally in the last couple of months, investors are taking profits amid uncertainties. 


Expert take


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 

















Domestic markets started this week on a weak note, given global cues on account of drag in US-China trade deal and Brexit delays. Investors have turned cautious, given the rise in oil prices and sharp rally in the last couple of months leading to premium valuation of key indices. Additionally, general elections and start of Q4 earnings season is adding to the cautiousness. We may see some profit booking in the near term, given sharp run-up in markets."""

22,2019-04-11,PowerGrid,"ICICI Prudential Asset Management, the country’s second largest money manager by assets, largely betted against the wind on Dalal Street all through March, as the benchmark indices climbed record highs.

Under the stewardship of CIO S Naren, the fund house offloaded shares that were on a high, like Axis Bank, ITC, BoB and focussed instead on stocks that were out of focus of the broader market.

The fund house increased stakes in as many as 75 companies from across sectors in March, even as it lightened positions in 145 others. 

Ahead of the earnings season that kicks off on April 12, ICICI Prudential AMC added additional 5.28 crore shares of NTPC, followed by NBCC (1.06 crore) and SBI Life Insurance (1.05 crore). 

Shares of NTPC rallied 15 per cent last month, while those of NBCC climbed nearly 26 per cent. 

The two stocks have also drawn attention of top domestic brokerages. Religare Broking has a ‘buy’ call on the state-owned construction company NBCC with a target price of Rs 80. “NBCC’s asset-light business model will help it maintain high returns,” the brokerage said.

JM Financial is bullish on NTPC with a target price of Rs 195. NTPC has added around 1.27 GW of thermal capacity to commercial operations (through acquisitions in Kudgi, Bongaigaon and Barauni) at a standalone level. 

“Our interactions with NTPC management suggest that, 2.2 GW of capacity is expected to commercialise in the next few days, implying a net capacity addition of 2.8 GW by FY19 end (at standalone level), while addition at a consolidated level can be 5 GW,” JM Financial said in a report on March 28.

ICICI Prudential AMC also focussed on the IT majors during the quarter. It bought 41.62 lakh additional shares of Infosys and 14.19 lakh of Tech Mahindra during the month.

Nifty climbed nearly 8 per cent during the month, as hopes of prime minister Narendra Modi’s return to power and sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors kept the market upbeat through the month.

Infosys is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter earnings on April 12. Kotak Institutional Equities expects a steady quarter for IT firms with Infosys, TCS and HCL Technologies projected to post strong growth while Wipro and Tech Mahindra are likely to disappoint.

The fund house also bought over 10 lakh shares each in Tata Steel, Marico and Bajaj Corporation. 

According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the demand environment remained stable for Marico during October-December quarter with good offtake growth. Rural traction remained intact, exceeding urban growth in the traditional channel. Newer channels (modern trade and e-commerce) are growing robustly. The brokerage firm has ‘Buy’ rating on Marico with a target price of Rs 460.

In the midcap space, ICICI Prudential added 3 to 10 lakh shares of NBFC player Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services, chemicals maker Tata Chemicals, quick service restaurant operator Jubilant FoodWorks and battery major Amara Raja Batteries.

In the insurance space, it bought shares of insurance firms HDFC Life Insurance and SBI Life. 

Maruti Suzuki, Natco Pharma, Hindalco, Exide Industries, TVS Motor and Vedanta were among other stocks in which ICICI Pru bought additional shares during the month.

On the other hand, it offloaded stakes in nearly 145 companies. Among them were Vodafone Idea, BHEL, ITC, Power Grid, ONGC, Bank of Baroda, Coal India, Axis Bank, Indian Oil Corporation, Nalco and PVR.

With average asset under management of Rs 3.21 lakh crore, the asset manager was holding nearly 550 stocks in various schemes as of March 31."

33,2019-04-12,PowerGrid,"Prabhudas Lilladher has an accumulate call on Siemens with a target price of Rs 1,221.

The current market price of Siemens is Rs 1,176.70.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Siemens price can reach the defined target.


View of the brokerage-

Large order opportunity continues to be elusive: SIEM’s order inflow was up 8 per cent YoY in FY18 (adjusting for HVDC order) mainly on account of growth in base orders (<than Rs 1bn size, up 28 per cent YoY). Historically, large orders were part of Power & Gas and Energy Management segments. However, both the segments witnessed a decline in order inflow during FY18 (-7 per cent/-25 per cent) mainly due to lack of opportunities in thermal power generation and decline in Power Grid Capex in the transmission infrastructure. SEB’s capex has been mainly in lower range 200-400 KV, resulting in growth of base orders. Also, private sector (75 per cent of SIM’s sales) capex continues to be muted which makes large order opportunity elusive from near to medium term perspective. However, order inflow in other businesses is stabilizing which will continue to provide a steady visibility for SIEM.


Mobility business intact due to global deal rejection by EU: SIEM’s management indicated that the Mobility business (revenue contribution/EBIT Margin – 8 per cent/10.3 per cent in FY18) remains the same post EU commission blocked the proposed Siemen-Alstom’s mobility merger. Any new structuring of the segment would depend upon Siemens AG (Parent’s) revised arrangement.


Transforming into a complete solution-based provider: SIEM is transforming itself from a product company to a complete solution provider which will help customers find solutions for business challenges. The company is currently executing 100 digital projects with 150 clients. It has started to see benefits of MindSphere Application centers enabling clients 1) reducing ramp-up/ramp-down time, 2) improving product life; and 3) reduction in power consumption. Below is one of the orders received by SIEM from Vedanta which gives us some clarity on the kind of work done under digital solutions."

36,2019-04-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Gains in bank stocks and index heavyweights propelled Sensex and Nifty to new closing highs on Tuesday. Persistent buying by foreign institutional investors is the driving force behind market’s rally.

At the same time, hopes of earnings recovery in March quarter that has eluded Dalal Street for a long time and Met Department’s forecast of a near-normal monsoon this year buoyed investor sentiment. 

Market will remain shut on Wednesday on account of Mahavir Jayanti. 

The 30-pack index settled at 39,276, up 370 points or 0.95 per cent. The index hit fresh record high of 39,364 during intraday trade. Meanwhile, NSE Nifty hit the 11,800 mark for the first time today. It settled at 11,787, up 97 points or 0.83 per cent. 

The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood at 1:1.


Market at a glance:In the Sensex kitty, 26 stocks closed in the green and four in the red. IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, ONGC, L&T and Maruti Suzuki were the top performing stocks, rising up to 3.96 per cent. 

PowerGrid, Infosys, Tata Motors and Coal India were among stocks that ended in the red. 

Midcap and smallcap stocks underperformed benchmark Sensex. The BSE Midcap index rose 0.12 per cent while BSE Smallcap 0.37 per cent.

Barring realty, all other indices ended in the green. BSE Bankex was the top sectoral leader, rising as much as 1.62 per cent. Consumer durables, telecom and finance too gained over 1 per cent each. 


Factors:
MonsoonIndia Meteorological Department with its prediction of a near-normal monsoon offered some relief to Dalal Street after private weather forecaster Skymet last month predicted below-normal monsoon. IMD on Monday said that the country is likely to have ‘near normal’ monsoon this year with well-distributed rainfall, which could be beneficial for the agriculture sector. 


Firm foreign inflowsSustained inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued to support market mood. FIIs have poured over Rs 65,000 crore in the domestic equity markets so far this year till April 15.


EarningsA first start to the earnings season further strengthened market sentiment. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys gave a smart start to the earnings season on Friday. While Infosys reported a 10.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,078 crore and guided for 7.5-9.5 per cent revenue growth in FY 2019-20, TCS posted 17.7 per cent growth in March quarter profit at Rs 8,162 crore.


Global cuesStocks inched higher on Tuesday as reassuring data about the health of China's economy helped investors shrug off disappointing bank earnings in the United States, while volatility in European markets took another leg lower. European shares followed their Asian counterparts and opened marginally higher, leaving the Euro STOXX 600 within a whisker of eight-month highs. Germany's DAX gained half a percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 also strengthened. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged up 0.1 percent in early European trade.

Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty scaled fresh life-time close highs on Tuesday, as sentiment remained upbeat for the fourth session in a row on “near-normal” monsoon forecast and optimism over firm corporate earnings.

Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking said, “We remain cautiously optimistic on the Indian markets and expect consolidation in the near term given the recent rally. Further, earnings outcome of Nifty heavyweights (Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank) this week may provide further direction to the markets.”

On the global front, China GDP data, US-China trade talks as well as corporate earnings will provide cues to the investors. In addition, INR vs USD and oil price movement are the other key factors."

The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.” 
— Sir John Templeton

Going by this wisdom of one of the most successful investors and mutual fund managers of the 20th century, public sector companies appear to be making a solid investment case. Gloominess in this space is at its peak.

Mumbai-based brokerage B&K Securities in its recent research report wrote many of the funds that they met told them that they were not interested in even discussing PSUs.

With up to 97 per cent drop since the beginning of this decade, these stocks have become a minefield investors now fear to tread. BSE PSU index is down over 21 per cent during this period.

Will this trend change anytime soon? Analysts are not very hopeful.

But valuations, which have turned a lot cheaper relative to fundamentals, tell a different story: It could just be the time to nibble at select names from this basket.

Public sector banks are already drawing some interest, as their private peers have witnessed a good runup in recent weeks and the crippling NPA mess appears to have bottomed out.

They together with other top PSUs like IFCI, Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL), Shipping Corporation of India, Nalco, GMDC, Oil India, ONGC, PFC and SJVN are trading at valuations lower than their book values. Trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratios of most of these companies have slipped below the industry averages.

“Healthy pessimism is still there in the PSU space, but opportunistic buying can happen now,” says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman, Inditrade Capital.

Kotak Institutional Equities says PSU stocks are trading at inexpensive multiples mainly because of the market’s worries about unfavourable regulations, irrational government actions and repeated disinvestments. It says most of these stocks are offering meaningful value at their current price levels.

There are chances that some of the PSUs would deliver some quick returns in the near term. The index representing these stocks has a track record of outpacing Nifty at least for some time after every general election.


Others
“Historical data of election years suggest a post-poll hope rally in PSU stocks. Time is ripe for that rally to take off,” B&K Securities said.

S Naren, ED & CIO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, expects a re-rating for the PSU stocks. “I am hoping that the new government would recognise that most PSUs are deeply undervalued and there are huge opportunities to rerate them through effective management of the shareholding in next five years. Strategic value of many of these PSUs is simply fantastic,” he told ETNOW during an interaction.

SBI Securities says the government’s aggressive divestment targets for FY18 and FY19 led to rapid stake reductions in most central public sector enterprises (CPSEs). That overhang continuous over many CPSEs. But current attractive valuations with high return ratios make it a favourable case for investing in select CPSEs.



ICICI Prudential’s Naren says already gone “massively overweight” on PSU stocks. “PSUs got de-rated for 10 years and at this point of time I have a simple metric to look for stocks that are trading at single-digit trailing PE. Look for stocks that trade at 5 per cent dividend yields and look for names that are not too leveraged. If I look at this combination of high dividend yields, low trailing PE and not too much leverage, I get a number of stocks and that is why we are massively overweight on PSU stocks,” he said.

Since the beginning of January 2011, public sector players like MMTC, Indian Overseas Bank, Hindustan Copper, UCO Bank, Andhra Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, IFCI, Bank of India, BHEL and Central Bank of India have eroded over 75 per cent of investor wealth till March 18, 2019.

At the same time, others like HPCL, BPCL, Balmer Lawrie, ITI and Power Grid have delivered returns from 100 per cent to 270 per cent.

From an investment perspective, B&K Securities prefers BEL, Concor, GAIL, GSFC, HPCL and SBI.

Bandyopadhyay says most of the PSUs are looking oversold and undervalued. “Leaving the banking space aside, there is merit in buying stocks like Bharat Electronics and NTPC from a medium- to long-term perspective. Some of them are looking good from dividend perspective. In the banking space, one can look at SBI and Bank of Baroda, but one should stay cautious on smaller lenders.”"
40,2019-04-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian stocks started the F&O expiry week on a bearish note on Monday, as jitters over a possible spike in crude oil prices on US plan to end all sanction waivers on Iran oil imports dampened mood Dalal Street in morning trade. 

Crude oil prices rallied nearly 3 per cent on Monday to levels not seen since November 2018. Citing a source familiar with the matter, Reuters confirmed a report that Washington was set to announce that all imports of Iranian oil must end or be subject to sanctions. Brent crude futures rose to $73.77 a barrel near the November 2018 high.

Surging crude oil prices also hurt the rupee, which slipped as much as 52 paise to 69.87 against the greenback. 

HDFC Bank traded 0.29 per cent higher at Rs 2,296 after the private lender reported a 22.63 per cent year-on-year jump in March quarter profit at Rs 5,885 crore, which was better than a Rs 5,805 crore estimate that analysts had projected.

Reliance Industries slipped 2 per cent to Rs 1,355 even after the company delivered better-than-expected earnings for March quarter post market hours on Thursday. Indian markets were closed on Good Friday. Analysts said the quarterly profit spike was already baked in the stock price. A continuous drop in average monthly billings of RIL’s telecom arm Reliance Jio for the past five quarters proved to be one worry, though analysts said it may finally put pressure on the company to raise tariffs.

A spike in India VIX, the Volatility Index that measures traders’ perception of market risks, to its highest in 15 months, also turned traders and investors cautious ahead of the national election results.

India VIX opened 7 per cent higher this morning.

Record high levels of the benchmark equity indices have also made market participants nervous. BSE barometer Sensex traded 209 points, or 0.53 per cent, down at 38,932, while NSE’s Nifty was down 67 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 11,686. 

""We expect Nifty to sustain above last week’s low of 11,648, and eventually head towards the 12,100 level in the coming weeks. Stock-specific activity would take centrestage as March quarter earnings season accelerates and the general elections enter a crucial stage,"" said ICICIDirect.

On NSE, 14 Nifty stocks advanced, 34 declined while 2 started the day unchanged.

In the Sensex pack, eight stocks traded mildly higher while 22 were in the red. TCS was the biggest gainer, rising 0.91 per cent, after the company deployed an integrated solution for India Post to modernise a network of more than 1.5 lakh post offices in the country. 

Others on the leader board included PowerGrid, Infosys, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank and ONGC.

IndusInd Bank led the laggards, shedding 2.23 per cent. Other losers included Reliance Industries, YES Bank, Asian Paints and Axis Bank.

TCS and Infosys were the biggest contributors to index gain. But heavyweights such as RIL, HDFC and others top bank stocks pulled the market down.

Oil prices shot up after a Reuters source confirmed a report that the United States is preparing to announce on Monday that all buyers of Iranian oil will have to end their imports shortly, or be subject to US sanctions.

44,2019-04-24,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty broke their losing streak of three successive sessions with robust gains on Wednesday, thanks to heightened buying across sectors during the second half.

Analysts were not surprised. “This was expected. We were anticipating a sharp swing on either side ahead of Thursday’s F&O expiry,"" said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

Nirav Chheda, derivatives & technical analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities, attributed it to a positive undercurrent in the market. “The market undercurrent is positive. The losses of last three sessions were because of a rising VIX owing to election-related jitters. Now, the volatility has eased and the market played to the tunes of its underlying positive sentiment,"" he said.

That said, the market is likely to remain choppy till the election results are out, he added. 


Let's take a look at the key highlights of Wednesday's session:

Investors richer by Rs 1.42 lakh croreWednesday's gains shot up the cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,53,17,138.47 crore from Rs 1,51,74,915.17 crore on Tuesday, making investors richer by Rs 1.42 lakh crore in a single day.


Stocks that saw spurt in OIWith a 71.28 per cent change, UltraTech Cement led the stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest (OI). It was followed by Siemens (59.64 per cent), Equitas Holdings (54.31 per cent), ONGC (51.81 per cent) and Power Grid Corporation (50.58 per cent). 


UltraTech logs healthy gainsAfter three consecutive sessions of losses, shares of UltraTech Cement closed 5.51 per cent higher at Rs 4,435.45 after its standalone profit for March quarter more than doubled to Rs 1,017 crore from Rs 488 crore a year ago. Standalone net sales jumped 18 per cent YoY to Rs 10,334 crore from Rs 8,750 crore. Domestic sales grew 16 per cent for the quarter. 


Tata Elxsi shares fall on Q4 numbersShares of Tata Elxsi declined 2.06 per cent to close at Rs 930.30 after it reported flattish fourth quarter earnings. The company reported 1.42 per cent growth in March quarter net profit at Rs 71.29 crore against Rs 70.29 crore reported for the same quarter last year. 


Tata Motors extends lossShares of Tata Motors fell for the third day in a row, closing 3.33 per cent down at Rs 223.70. The stock has come off 5.17 per cent in last three sessions. Analysts say while the worst seems to be over for the stock, it may see some volatility. ""It appears the worst for Tata Motors have been priced in. But volatility in the stock is something everyone cannot fancy,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corporate Affairs at IIFL. 


ACC declines 3% on Q1 numbersShares of ACC declined 3.07 per cent to close at Rs 1,606.90 a day after the cement maker reported a 38.19 per cent rise in consolidated March quarter profit at Rs 346.02 crore. Even though the numbers were in line, margins disappointed the Street. HSBC has a 'hold' call on the stock with a reduced price target of Rs 1,650. The brokerage highlighted that the Q1 results were not encouraging as the reported Ebitda came below the expectations. It said that margin expansion failed to play out due to misses on realisations, as well as on costs. 


Indiabulls Real Estate surges 10%Indiabulls Real Estate shares surged 10.23 per cent to close at Rs 116.35 ahead of its quarterly earnings and after the company said it is to sell its London property to its promoter for $258.7 million due to Brexit uncertainty. Post market hours, the company reported a 7 per cent drop in March quarter profit at Rs 1,006 crore.


Coromandel shares riseShares of Coromandel International closed 2.33 per cent up at Rs 436.30, a day after it reported a 22.8 per cent jump in March quarter profit at Rs 110 crore. 


Auto pack lone sectoral loserThe auto pack emerged as the only sectoral loser on BSE, falling 0.29 per cent on losses in shares of Tata Motors (3.33 per cent), MRF (1.47 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (0.60 per cent) and Maruti Suzuki (0.26 per cent). Among the 16 components in BSE Auto index, 10 declined and six advanced. 


68 stocks ready to fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 68 counters on BSE. Among those stocks were Sterlite Technologies, InterGlobe Aviation, Maruti Suzuki India, Adani Ports and Indraprastha Gas. A bearish crossover indicates that the stock may fall in the coming sessions. Meanwhile, Indiabulls Realty, Zee Entertainment, NIIT, HCL Technologies, Bata India and Titan were among the 54 stocks that showed bullish crossovers on BSE. 


Dhunseri Group firms surge 20%Shares of Dhunseri Group companies surged up to 20 per cent after Tata Global Beverages (TGBL) said it will to acquire branded tea business of Dhunseri Tea & Industries for Rs 101 crore subject to due diligence and necessary approvals.

Shares of Dhunseri Ventures, Dhunseri Investments and Dhunseri Tea & Industries surged 20 per cent each."
45,2019-04-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic benchmark indices opened on a flat note on Thursday, after surging past the 39,000-mark in the previous session, ahead of April F&O expiry.

Asian markets remained lackluster as a surprise deterioration in German business morale rekindled fears of slowing global growth, while oil prices pulled back slightly after a sharp run-up earlier in the week. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.2 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei average edged up 0.3 per cent to 22,264.81 points. 

Moreover, the rupee moved below the 70/dollar mark, its weakest since March 11, which capped gains for the market.

The markets would keenly watch the movement in stocks of Maruti Suzuki, Axis Bank, Tata Steel and Biocon as they are slated to report their March quarter results later in the day. 

Shares of Maruti Suzuki edged down over 1 per cent ahead of Q4 numbers as brokerages estimate the company is likely to post a fall in net profit for the third straight quarter. 

At the same time, share of Axis Bank traded marginally higher. Brokerages are of the view that the Private lender is likely to swing back into the black in March quarter on the back of strong loan growth and lower provisioning for bad loans. 

At around 9:30 am, BSE sensex was up 28 points or 0.07 per cent at 39,083 while NSE Nifty traded near the 11,750 mark at 11,745, up 18.60 points or 0.16 per cent.

""Going ahead, we believe faster retracement of recent corrective phase (11,856–11,565) would reinstate the bullish momentum and set the stage for next leg of up move. Failure to do so would lead to prolonging of consolidation in the broader range of 11,850–11,550 amid stock specific action as Q4FY19 earnings season accelerates and anxiety around General Elections continues,"" said ICICI Direct.

16 of 30 Sensex stocks traded on a bullish note. YES Bank was the biggest gainer and rallied 2.86 per cent ahead of its quarterly results on Friday. Other gainers were Powergrid, L&T, HCL, HDFC Bank and NTPC.

On the other hand, ONGC was the biggest loser down lost the most, down 0.83 per cent. Amongst other losers were Maruti, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Auto and Kotak Bank.

HDFC Bank was the biggest index contributor, but, Infosys was the worst drag.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap outperformed benchmark Sensex, rising 0.38 per cent and 0.51 per cent, respectively.

On the BSE sectoral front, barring Energy, IT, Telecom and Teck all sectors gained. Consumer Durable and Power were the biggest gainers.

47,2019-04-26,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: How have five years of the Modi raj changed Varanasi, his own constituency? Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to turn Varanasi into Kyoto, the Japanese town famous for its temples. The VVIP constituency of Varanasi may not have become another Kyoto but PM Modi sure has started and even inaugurated many ambitious projects. 

While election results will tell how Varanasi residents judge PM Modi's performance in his own constituency, on the day when PM Modi files his nomination papers to seek another term from Varanasi, we list below some of the prominent developmental projects initiated and delivered by the Modi government.


Multi-modal terminal on the Ganga 
For the first time in India's history, river transport has begun starting with Varanasi. Last year, PM Modi inaugurated India's first multi-modal terminal on the Ganga river in Varanasi and received the country's first container cargo transported on inland waterways from Kolkata. The first consignment containing food and beverage had set sail from Kolkata. This is the first of the four multi-modal terminals being constructed on the National Waterway-1 (river Ganga) as part of the World Bank-aided Jal Marg Vikas project of the Inland Waterways Authority of India. 


Roads
In November last year, PM Modi inaugurated two important roads, having a total length of 34 kilometres and built at a cost of Rs 1,571.95 crore, in Varanasi. The 16.55-km-long Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I has been built at a cost of Rs 759.36 crore, while the work of four-laning and construction of 17.25 km Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 cost Rs 812.59 crore. 

The Ring Road, with two rail overbridges and a flyover, allows traffic on NH 56 (Lucknow-Varanasi), NH 233 (Azamgarh-Varanasi), NH 29 (Gorakhpur-Varanasi) and Ayodhya-Varanasi highways to bypass Varanasi, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city. This reduces travel time, fuel usage and pollution in the area.

The Babatpur Airport highway connects the city with the airport and goes on to link Jaunpur, Sultanpur and Lucknow. With a flyover at Harhua and a rail overbridge at Tarna, it reduces the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, providing a big relief to the people of the holy city and tourists.

National highway projects of total length 2,833 km, costing Rs 63,885 crore, are underway to link Varanasi with other places in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Of these, 15 road projects of 1,143 kilometre length are under various stages of construction. These include Varanasi-Jaunpur, Varanasi-Sultanpur, Sultanpur-Lucknow, Varanasi Ghaghra Bridge and Varanasi-Azamgarh. 


Kashi Vishwanath Temple to Ganga Ghat corridor 
This is PM Modi's dream project that can give Varanasi pilgrimage area a big makeover. This project will make Kashi Vishwanath Temple accessible to the pilgrims directly from the ghats along the Ganga, sparing them the struggle of reaching it through congested, serpentine lanes. The project, costing Rs 600 crore, is expected to be complete this year. 166 buildings have been demolished and 46 ancient temples and other buildings of architectural importance have been preserved. The 56-meter wide corridor will be over 300 meters in length. The temple is surrounded by narrow lanes which are full of dilapidated buildings and crumbling basic infrastructure. The narrow lanes and dilapidated buildings prevent fire-fighting system and medical facilities. The project aims to build world-class facilities for pilgrims in and around the temple. 


Cleaning the Ganga 
A total of 13 projects worth Rs 913 crore have been sanctioned for Varanasi under Namami Gange programme. Additionally, sewerage projects worth Rs 703.14 crore have been taken under JNNURM and AMRUT schemes. Varanasi is set to have zero sewer discharge in the holy river by November this year.
The Ganga Action Plan was launched by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in Varanasi on June 14, 1986 to reduce the pollution load on Ganga. Under Nitin Gadkari, the Ministry of Ganga Rejuvenation and its implementing arm National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) have taken up several projects for treatment of sewer water in Varanasi. 
According to officials, work on 50 MLD (million litres per day) sewage treatment plant at Ramana is nearing completion. By November this year, it is expected to be fully operational for treating discharge of Assi Nala. With this, flow of untreated sewer water from Varanasi city into the Ganga will be completely checked. Another 120 MLD treatment plant at Goitha is undergoing trials which will increase sewage treatment capacity to 412 MLD. 


Piped gas to households
PM Modi dedicated to the nation the Varanasi City Gas Distribution (CGD) network last year which will supply environment-friendly natural gas to the city's households, transport sector and industries. The foundation stone of the project was laid by PM Modi in 2016 as part of the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga initiative. The CGD network, which is being implemented by GAIL (India) Limited at a cost of Rs 755 crores, will cover 1,535 sq km and cater to a population of 36.76 lakh. 


Making Varanasi 'wireless'
Eighty-six years after Varanasi got electricity, overhead power cables in Varanasi were dismantled after a project to lay underground lines over 16 sq-km was completed last year. Laying underground cables for 50,000 consumers through the serpentine lanes and congested markets in one of the world’s oldest cities was quite a challenge. Powergrid took two years and finished the project in 2017. 


Cancer treatment facilities
PM Modi inaugurated the Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital in Varanasi last year. It is run by the Tata Memorial Trust. This is Tata Memorial Trust’s first such big cancer treatment centre in this region to cater to the population of Uttar Pradesh as well as Bihar. PM Modi had requested the Trust to take over the Railway Cancer Institute and refurbish it with the latest machines and equipment. The Trust has built another cancer tratment facility inside the Banaras Hindu University. The 352-bed Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre was built in record 10 months and was inaugurated in February.


Convention Centre
A modern convention centre is being built in Varanasi with Japanese government's official lending arm JICA giving financial assistance of around Rs 130 crore. The sophisticated convention centre with a seating capacity of 1,200 will have a main hall with a full flying tower, a gallery, meeting rooms besides a parking facility for 120 cars."
48,2019-04-26,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Opening with healthy gains, headline indices Sensex and Nifty started the first day of May F&O series on a positive note.

A strong surge in market-wide rollovers suggests traders are largely pricing in a favourable election outcome and paying little heed to the weakening macro-economic indicators. 

The market-wide rollovers stood at 83 per cent. Nifty futures rollover stood at 81 per cent, which were way above 63 per cent rollovers seen in the last three series. 

Besides, FPI inflow also influenced the mood. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 3,785.73 crore worth of domestic stocks on Thursday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 4,069.98 crore, data suggested. 

Indian rupee gained some strength against the US dollar following a slight fall in crude oil prices. The domestic unit inched up by 16 paise against the dollar in early trade. However, it turned almost flat soon after some buying of the greenback by banks and exporters. 

Oil prices dipped on Friday on expectations that producer club Opec will soon raise output to make up for a decline in exports from Iran following a tightening of sanctions by the United States against Tehran, Reuters reported.

Subdued Asian peers weighed on the sentiment, capping gains for the equity benchmarks. 

Around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was 82 points, or 0.21 per cent, up at 38,812 while Nifty was 25 points, or 0.22 per cent, up at 11,667.

Midcaps and smallcaps rose in line with benchmark Sensex as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.22 and 0.26 per cent up, respectively, around that time. 

Tata Steel rose over 5 per cent and was the best performing Sensex stock after the company on Thursday, post market hours, reported a profit of Rs 2,430.92 crore (attributable to the shareholders) for the quarter ended March 31. Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected a profit of Rs 2,330 crore.

It was followed by Axis Bank which gained nearly 3 per cent. The private-sector lender too had posted its March quarter numbers on Thursday. The bank moved back in the black as asset quality of the lender improved for the fourth straight quarter in Q4FY19 coupled with double-digit fall in provisions. 

HCL Tech, NTPC and Power Gride were among other top gainers.

However, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC were among the top losers.

Barring auto, industrials and consumer discretionary goods & services, all sectoral indices were in the green on BSE. 

Metal, oil & gas and utilities sectors were trading with decent gains. BSE Metal index climbed nearly 2 per cent on gains in shares of Tata Steel, Jindal Steel, SAIL, JSW Steel and Coal India. 

Meanwhile, HDFC Life Insurance Company, Hero MotoCorp and YES Bank are among the companies that will come out with their March quarter numbers today."
50,2019-04-29,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Cyber weapons can be far deadlier than missiles, apart from being cloaked in anonymity to baffle an adversary. India may still be far away from establishing a desperately-needed military cyber command but is now taking some steps to prepare for battles in the virtual world, especially with China rapidly building its cyber warfare capabilities.

The Indian armed forces will conduct a major cyber exercise or ‘Cyberex’ this week, along with other stakeholders, which will include scenarios connected to cyber attacks on critical Indian infrastructure like strategic networks and power grids. 

“The cyber attacks will be painted at the military and national levels… the aim will be to assess the situation, seek responses, damage control and requisite actions required for a synergised response. Cyberex is the first such major joint exercise of the Army, IAF and Navy, under the aegis of integrated defence staff, with participation from several other organisations,” a source said.

The others involved in the two-day exercise range from the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), National Informatics Centre (NIC) and Computer Security Resource Centre (CSRC).

Though Cyberex and other such endeavours are required to prepare for challenges in the fifth dimension of warfare after the first four “real” battlefields of land, air, sea and space, experts say much more needs to be done. 

China, for instance, is steadily upgrading its cyber weapons to degrade or destroy an adversary’s military assets and strategic networks as well as energy, banking, transport and communication grids.

The malicious Stuxnet software worm, developed by the US and Israel, crippled Iran’s nuclear programme almost a decade ago. Even the Indian Army’s latest “land warfare doctrine” stresses cyberspace is the “new dimension of warfare”, which will be “a key battle-winning factor in future conflicts”.

However, India has lagged far behind in developing cyber warfare capabilities despite having a robust civilian information technology sector. It’s only now that a small tri-service Defence Cyber Agency (DCA), much like the ones for space and special operations, is coming up under a two-star general.

These agencies are truncated versions of the original proposal to have fully fledged commands under three-star generals (Lt-Generals/Air Marshals/Vice Admirals) to handle the critical domains of space, cyberspace and clandestine warfare, as was first reported by TOI.

The DCA, led by a naval officer, will basically involve an upgrade of the existing Defence Information Assurance and Research Agency, with some leeway to hire civilian experts from outside. It will undertake “defensive” cyber operations, with the “offensive” ones being left to other agencies under the national security adviser.

China, apart from hacker brigades, has a Strategic Support Force to oversee the People’s Liberation Army’s space, cyber and electronic warfare operations. The US has a huge Cyber Command, led by a four-star general, to launch a “full spectrum” war if required as well as protect over 15,000 American military networks from attacks round-the-clock."
49,2019-04-29,PowerGrid,"BENGALURU: Among wind equipment manufacturers, Suzlon installed the most in 2018-19 with 581 MW, followed by the Denmark headquartered Vestas with 492 MW, while Siemens Gamesa put up 261 MW, according to multiple sources close to the development. India installed a modest 1544 MW of wind energy capacity in 2018-19, which was even lower than the 1739 MW commissioned the previous year, and way below the 5400 MW installed in 2016-17.

In 2017-18 too, Suzlon was the leading original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in India, installing 626 MW, with Siemens Gamesa in second place with 552 MW, and Vestas with 181 MW in third.

Other OEMs, however, added very little in 2018-19, due to overall paucity of orders. Inox Wind added a mere 36 MW through the year and Regen Powertech just 25 MW. GE India added 132MW, while Germany’s Nordex Acciona added a paltry18MW.

The low capacity addition is hurting OEMs as much of their capacity remains unutilized due to shortage of orders. “OEMs with deep pockets can sustain their operations but for the others, it is not possible to recover the fixed cost at this level of capacity addition,” said a wind developer on the condition of anonymity. “This in turn will have adverse impact on banks as all of them must have taken loans. It is also likely to affect employment at their units.”

Regen Powertech closed one of its units in Rajasthan and retrenched 400 people two years ago.

Growth in wind energy capacity has fallen sharply in India since the introduction of auctions for wind projects in early 2017, as against the feed in tariff regime that prevailed earlier. This is because, in the first year after auctions were initiated, very few auctions were actually held.

However, around 10,000 MW of wind projects were auctioned in 2018-19, which are currently in various stage of construction. If they are completed during the current year, wind installation will go up sharply this year. “The Indian market did go into a standstill for several months, but we know it will revive,” Markus Tacke, global CEO of Siemens Gamesa told ET recently.

Some OEMs and developers, however, were skeptical of how many MW would ultimately be installed this year, because projects have been moving at a glacial pace lately due to problems in land acquisition and obtaining access to the power grid."
52,2019-04-30,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Gains in HDFC twins and IT stocks helped BSE Sensex stage a 280-point recovery on Tuesday, even as the index closed marginally lower. The 30-stock pack settled 36 points down at 39,032.

NSE barometer Nifty ended the day a tad below the 11,750-mark at 11,748, down 7 points.

A sharp rise in the rupee against the dollar on easing crude oil prices lent support to domestic indices. The domestic unit gained over 30 paise against the greenback to hit intraday high of 69.70. Oil prices hovered around $72 a barrel, off its recent high of $75.

""Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 11,550 to 11,860. Broader market weakness is seen as midcap index trades with a negative bias. We expect this consolidation to continue for a few more sessions before a breakout is witnessed on the higher side,"" said Sahaj Agrawal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak securities.

Expert Take
Investors resorted to profit booking, as weak results from banks and auto dragged market sentiment. However, late recovery in IT and metal stocks helped to minimise losses. Global cues were weak due to ongoing FOMC policy meet. The US economic data was mixed with better-than-expected GDP and weak inflation, which may influence policymakers to adopt a wait and watch approach until they have a clearer perspective on job data, inflation and GDP- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"

0,2019-05-01,PowerGrid,"Solar light panels are used for residential and commercial lighting purposes. Solar light panels are made of photovoltaic (PV) modules. These PV modules usually comprise of high-quality solar cells made of crystalline silicon. PV cells are used for converting light energy received from the sun into electrical energy to be used or stored for later use.


How do Solar Light Panels Work?
A solar light panel system comprises numerous solar (or photovoltaic) cells and the system is either connected or not connected to the main power grid. If the system is connected to the grid, then DC power generated through PV panels is converted to AC power using a power conditioning unit. The power produced is added to a 220V single-phase line grid or an 11 KV three-phase line grid as per the system installed in the locality. The power generated during the day is used for powering lighting systems. The excess power is fed to the grid subject to its availability. A non-grid solar light panel system needs a backup system in the form of a full load bearing battery, power conditioning system and advanced load management equipment. 


Features


Solar light panels are very hardy and wear out very slowly. Across a full year, the effectiveness of these panel reduces by a mere one-two per cent or less. 
Along with decreasing the dependability on traditional power sources and fossil fuels, solar panels do not generate harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment. 
Individual solar or PV cells are made of semiconductor elements (e.g. silicon) and are electricity producing devices in their own capacity. 
PV cells are available in different shapes and sizes and may have a maximum length of several inches. 
PV cells are put together in the form of PV modules that may be a few feet wide and several feet long. 
The PV modules, in combination, can form PV arrays of different power output and sizes. The size of arrays depends on users’ needs and the amount of sunlight available in the area where installed. 
The solar light panel system comprises of PV modules, electrical connections, mounting hardware, power conditioning equipment and batteries for storing the generated electricity. 


Applications


Solar light panels can be installed in homes to reduce electricity cost and the effects of global warming.
Solar light panels are also used in different gadgets like calculators, wrist watches, torches, flashlights etc. 
Complicated solar light panels are used for powering water pumps, communication satellites, etc. 
These days, most traffic signs and street lights are powered with the help of solar light panels.

7,2019-05-02,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a rather lacklustre session on Thursday, as losses in the shares of select banking, auto and IT heavyweights dragged market. 

Mixed quarterly earnings and subdued global cues weighed on investor sentiment. However, a drop in crude oil prices and a stronger rupee helped cap the losses. 

Sensex ended the session 50 points down at 38,981, while Nifty slipped 23 points to 11,724. 


Let's take a look at the top highlights of Thursday's session: 

TaMo shares fall for 7th successive day

YES Bank looks up, climbs 3%
Breaking a losing streak of three consecutive sessions, shares of YES Bank settled 3.45 per cent higher at Rs 173.80 as value buying emerged on the counter. However, brokerages said it is too early for the stock to gain the faith of the market. It is behaving more like an ADAG stock, said Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL Securities. ICICIdirect said it would be cautious on the bank for next 3-6 months as upside risk to its stressed book is a strong probability. 


Jet's misery continues
Shares of Jet Airways plunged 12.04 per cent to Rs 134.85, extending their losing streak into the fourth successive session, as bidders for the debt-ridden airline showed no interest in following up on their expressions of interest, dashing hopes of an early revival of the airline. The stock has fallen over 21 per cent in last four sessions. 


Dabur falls on poor Q4 numbers
Dabur India reported a 6.46 per cent drop in consolidated March quarter profit at Rs 371.49 crore against Rs 397.18 crore reported for the January-March quarter a year ago. Shares of the company closed 3.91 per cent down at Rs 382.45.

PNB Housing Finance said it would raise up to $1 billion (around Rs 6,954 crore) from overseas markets, and an additional Rs 10,000 crore by issuing bonds. The board meeting scheduled for May 9 will consider the proposal. The announcement failed to provide any respite to the stock as it remained on a downward trajectory for the fourth straight session. The stock closed 3.84 per cent down at Rs 684.40, losing 14 per cent in the last four sessions. 


MRF shares extend losses

10,2019-05-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Private power transmission companies have written to the Competition Commission of India, Comptroller and Auditor General and power regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, alleging predatory pricing by Power Grid Corp (PGCIL) in the midst of auctions of some Rs 9,000-crore projects. 

Companies have alleged that the central utility has unfair competitive advantages given its access to low-cost funds and government support. Private companies want PGCIL to be barred from crosssubsidising competitive tariff projects with the help of low-cost, AAA-rated debt raised through its cost-plus assets, and separation of central transmission utility role. 

A senior government official said the Centre will look into it. Letters were sent by the Independent Power Producers Association of India (IPPAI) late on Thursday. 

PGCIL has emerged as lowest bidder in most transmission projects so far auctioned on competitive tariff basis, bagging about 40% such contracts. Sterlite Power, Adani Transmission, Essel Infra and L&T Power are among other prominent private players in the fray. IPPAI has sought intervention of agencies and the power ministry in the competitive bidding currently underway for nine transmission lines in renewable projects of Gujarat and Rajasthan. 

“There are some grave concerns on the abnormally and unreasonably low pricing being done by PGCIL in certain competitive bids for awarding transmission projects, taking unfair advantage of its massive financing and pricing power owing to its large base of assets built under the cost-plus mechanism,” the association said. 

Private firms alleged that PGCIL has an asset base of over Rs 2 lakh crore of cost-plus projects allocated through government support. According to IPPAI, the 15.5% return earned by Power Grid Corp on cost-plus projects compensates for low returns from lines won under tariff-based competitive bidding. 

“This has created a non-level playing field, which is not contemplated in the Electricity Act 2003,” it said. The Independent Power Producers Association also alleged that PGCIL’s positioning as the central transmission utility and on the national and empowered committees on transmission gives it access to advance information about new projects and an edge over others in configuring them at the conception stage itself. 

“If this goes unabated, it will slowly and steadily kill the private transmission industry and lead to monopolistic trends that hurt consumer interest by misusing public funds to kill competition,” it said."
9,2019-05-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Independent Power Producers Association of India (IPPAI) has shot off a letter to the Power Ministry demanding level playing field for private sector players via-a-vis state-run Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) in allocation of electricity transmission projects.

""We seek your suo moto intervention in this matter in the interest of maintaining a level playing field in this segment (transmission) of the power sector and to stop the misuse of public funds which are procured at very low costs (by PGCIL) from multilateral agencies against sovereign guarantees of the Government of India,"" IPPAI said in its letter written earlier this week to the power secretary.

The industry body pointed out that in view of the dominant position of PGCIL reflected in its predatory bid pricing, the ministry should ensure that the low-cost pool of funds raised by the company are not allowed to cross-subsidise TBCB (tariff based competitive bidding) projects.

The IPPAI also sought separation of the central transmission utility (CTU) role of PGCIL from its role as an asset developer to create a level playing field for competition and ensure delivery of the cheapest cost of landed power to consumers.

It claimed that PGCIL often gets projects on a nomination basis under Section 62 (cost plus) of the Electricity Act 2003 and is allowed a pass through of any cost escalation which is incurred due to any delays in projects.

However, it said that the projects competitively bid under Section 63 (which are primarily done by private sector transmission companies) are imposed with stiff penalties by the regulators for delays.

According to IPPAI, PGCIL beats the competition by quoting low prices due to diversion of funds from the parent company (PGCIL) to the SPVs (special purpose vehicles or projects) at a very low carrying cost since these funds, which are from multilateral agencies, are lent under the sovereign guarantee of the Government of India.

Besides, it is able to divert resources from projects being built under Section 62 to projects under Section 63 (TBCB) without fear of loss since any delays or carrying costs in projects under Section 62 are allowed as a pass through, it added."

While making a decision to shift to solar power systems a number of businesses get confused between off-grid and on-grid solar systems. To make the right choice it is important to comprehend the key differences between off-grid and on-grid solar systems.


On-grid solar systems
On-grid solar power systems generate power using a solar power system and are directly connected to the utility power grid. These systems send excess power generated by the solar power system to the utility grid and consumers get compensated for the extra power fed back. These systems work in collaboration with the power grid. In the case when there is not enough sunlight to meet your business’ needs, the system runs on the power supplied by the grid. These systems are best suitable when your power consumption is high and you wish to reduce your electricity bills. On-grid systems can be installed with or without net metering. Being connected to the main grid, these systems do not work during power outages. 


Applications:
Businesses can rely on on-grid solar systems to meet their daily requirements, as well as earn income from the excess power generated. On bright sunny days, buildings can generate enough solar energy to power appliances, lights, water heating systems, etc. 


Advantages: 


On-grid solar systems are very cost-effective and easy to install.
Businesses can recoup the cost of their investment by offsetting electricity bills in just 3-8 years. If a private, commercial or industrial building sets up a solar PV rooftop system it will be eligible to avail an ‘Accelerated Depreciation Benefit’ which is currently 80% in a year. At this rate, a business can completely depreciate the whole value of the project in approximately 4 years.
Residential users and business owners can earn a passive income for the surplus energy generated by the system. 


Off-grid Solar systems
Off-grid systems work independently of the grid but have batteries which can store the solar power generated by the system. The system usually consists of solar panels, battery, charge controller, grid box, inverter, mounting structure and balance of systems. The panels store enough sunlight during the day and use the excess power generated in the night. 

These systems are self-sustaining and can provide power for critical loads in areas where a power grid is not available. However, these systems require specialized equipment to function and can be costly to install. These are ideal for businesses which can sustain for a short period of time with no electricity.


Applications


Electricity supply in rural and remote areas - Off-grid solar systems can facilitate independent, long-term and sustainable electricity generation in rural and remote areas.
Power back up in areas with frequent electricity cuts - A number of places in India face frequent power cuts due to power transmission malfunctions, which can hamper operations of companies and public institutions. Off-grid solar systems can provide an economical and viable long-term backup solution to overcome the problems occurring during frequent power cuts.


Advantages:


These self-sustainable systems can work independently and do not rely on the grid. 
They generate enough power that can be stored and used at night or when the power grid is down. 
These are ideal for remote areas where there is no power access from the grid.
Grid failures and shutdowns will not affect your power supply. 

Electricity consumption in India is forecasted to reach 15280 TWh by 2040. The Indian government has set a target of reaching a renewable energy generation capacity of 225 GW by 2022 and is offering a number of benefits as well as tax rebates to businesses which shift to renewable solar energy systems. Solar power systems are a source of clean renewable energy and have numerous benefits depending on the type of system you choose. Due to a drop in the prices of solar PV in the last few years as well as significant policy-level implementations by the Government of India, setting up solar PV technology systems in residential buildings and business organizations have become very lucrative.

14,2019-05-06,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices took a beating on Monday as hopes of a US-China trade deal were dashed by US President Donald Trump’s fresh threat to China on likely tariff hikes. The comments, at this crucial stage, is all set delay progress, as China is unlikely to send its delegates to Washington scheduled for later this week. This along will a host of other domestic concerns are a key drag on domestic indices today. 

The BSE Sensex dropped 362.92 points, or 0.93 per cent, to hit a low of 38,600.34. Nifty50 ended below sub-11,600 level.

Here are key factors which led to a sharp plunge in domestic benchmarks on Monday: 


Trump comments sinks Asia, China down 5% Domestic investors can take heart from the fact that domestic indices were among least hurt indices among Asian peers, which dropped up to 5 per cent in Monday’s trade on fears that extended US-China trade talks could derail recovery in the world economy, especially for export-oriented economies of Asia.

China’s Shanghai Composite slumped over 5.4 per cent, followed by Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 3.84 per cent, Singapore’s STI 3.52 per cent, Taiwan’s TWSE 1.83 per cent and Korea’s Kospi 0.9 per cent. 

Trump on Sunday announced that he would hike US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. Reports suggests China was considering canceling this week’s trade talks in Washington. 


For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 B… https://t.co/oXh0NKws5m&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1557072526000

5th phase of elections Adding to the nervousness was the kick start of the fifth phase of the general elections. Voting on Monday began on 51 Lok Sabha constituencies from 7 different states. In this phase, nearly nine crore voters will decide the fate of 674 candidates, including political bigwigs Rajnath Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Smriti Irani. After four phases of elections, the voting percentage is 67 per cent, comparable to 67.6 per cent in 2014. 


Concerns over Q4 earningsThere have been concerns over mixed set of numbers by largecap majors. After five consecutive quarters of double-digit volume growth, FMCG behemoth Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Friday reported just 7 per cent volume growth for March quarter. Bharti Airtel, which is scheduled to announce its quarterly numbers today, is projected to report losses to the tune of Rs 1,200-1,300 crore on a 3-5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in sales. A total of 216 companies will report March quarter earnings in this trading week, BSE data suggests. 


Foreign flows may take a hitUS-China trade tensions is likely to take a toll on foreign flows into India and other emerging markets, which have been pretty strong so far. Foreign inflows to India stood at Rs 72,394 in the last three months. That said, inflows in April at Rs 21,193 crore were down 37 per cent from March’s record flows of Rs 33,980 crore. In May so far, FPIs have pulled out Rs 367.30 crore worth of equities. 


Nifty nears lower end of a key range Nifty has been stuck in the 11,550-11,850 range for last 22 sessions. Dips were being bought into, but follow-up buying was missing at higher levels, analysts said. But Monday's sharp fall means the index has been trading near its lower end of the range, a break below which could bring further downside. By 9.45 am, the index has already breached its support of 11,666. 


Market Update:
In the sensex pack of stocks, 28 were in the red while only two were in the green at around 9.30 am. Power Grid was the biggest gainer rising 0.89 per cent, followed by Asian Paints which rose 0.70 per cent.

Meanwhile shares of Tata Motors shed the most, falling over 4 per cent, on reports that that auto major may phase out small diesel cars from its portfolio as demand is expected to slow down due to upcoming BS-VI emission norms that would make such vehicles expensive, according to a senior company official. 

Other losers were Tata Steel, YES Bank, Vedanta, HDFC and IndusInd Bank.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap too slipped into the red zone, shedding 0.47 per cent and 0.36 per cent, each.

On the BSE sectoral front, all sectors declined with the BSE Metal falling the maximum, down, 2.15 per cent led by Tata Steel."

11,2019-05-06,PowerGrid,"BENGALURU: Many of the projects won by developers in the two wind auctions conducted by Solar Corporation of India in 2017 have not been completed yet, according to sources close to the development. The commissioning deadline for the first tranche of projects of 1050 MW was October 2018 and for the second of 1000 MW was May this year. But only 690 MW of the first lot and a mere 200 MW of the second are complete.

The winners from the first auction who have managed to set up the entire amount obtained are ReNew Power and Sembcorp, while Mytrah Energy is close to commissioning. Inox Wind and Adani Green Energy had won 250 MW and 50 MW, respectively, but neither has set up a single megawatt so far. Some of the developers unable to meet their deadlines were given a month’s extension, but they still couldn’t finish their projects.

“According to the terms of the power purchase agreement, three months after the commissioning date, the tariff paid to the developers will be lowered by about 15 paise for every month’s delay in commissioning of projects,” said the source. “That’s the stage at which all the developers who have delayed are, as far as SECI’s first lot of projects goes.” These penalties will be decided upon only at the time of commissioning. If delays persist beyond a point, SECI has right to invoke the bank guarantees the developers have given.

Inox confirmed that nothing has been commissioned by them so far. A company spokesman said they were delayed because obtaining connectivity from Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) has been time consuming.




“We have not been able to commission anything yet since the PGCIL grid took too long to be constructed. It has been delayed by over 17 months. The PGCIL grid was to be readied in January 2018 but after a huge delay it was finally commissioned 10 days ago and we are now in the final stages of hooking up our infrastructure with PGCIL,” he said. Queries to Adani and Mytrah remained unanswered till the time of going to press. Industry insiders say delays in both cases could largely be attributed to obtaining connectivity. Queries to SECI too remained unanswered.

Sembcorp, Renew, Orange, Inox and Adani were the winners of the second SECI auction winning capacities of 250MW, 250MW, 200MW, 250MW and 50MW, respectively. Out of this, only 200MW has been constructed so far. Almost all projects are expected to be commissioned in Gujarat, hence the delay. Gujarat all of a sudden last year turned reluctant to lease land to projects auctioned by SECI and not by the state.

Queries to all developers remained unanswered till press-time except for Inox which confirmed their second project too has not been commissioned. Sources said that while most of them will miss the deadline, Sembcorp’s project will come up in May and Renew in May or June. “Delays in infrastructure projects are common, so a slight delay is fine, as long as they get commissioned,” said another source."
21,2019-05-07,PowerGrid,"Commercial establishments who continuously burn a massive amount of electricity can benefit both monetarily and in terms of CSR by employing alternative sources to meet their energy demands. Solar technology is one of the most readily available methods that can be used and installed anywhere to supplement the already available electrical connection and give some respite to business owners. The Government of India is actively encouraging big firms to install solar power systems in their premises to aid the country’s and their own power requirements.

However, installing a commercial solar power system has to be done carefully. The entire structure should be capable of handling a part or the entirety of your power demands and thus requires a series of careful considerations. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has issued several guidelines over the years in regards to the installation process, a brief synopsis of which is presented here.


Step 1: Deciding on the implementation process
In other words, evaluating how exactly do you want solar energy to benefit you. As per the rules set by the MNRE, currently, there are two ways to install a commercial solar power system in your premises. One, grid-connected and two, off-grid. In the first method, the entire electricity produced by the solar panels will be fed to the main power grid and your electricity bill will be calculated based on the difference between your production and consumption. For off-grid systems, the entire solar structure will be isolated and you can directly receive electricity without any connection to the grid.
This decision-making part is important as it will also decide the type of metering you will have. Since the government will be buying electricity from you in a grid-connected system, you must first find out whether such a policy exists in your state at all. The MNRE’s website lists all the necessary details regarding the states that can opt for net metering, gross metering or have to go for an off-grid system and this is typically where your solar installation process begins.


Step 2: Load calculations and involved analyses
Your choice of implementation will decide the types of calculations and analyses that you will have to do following the first step. For instance, if you choose an off-grid system, you will have to take all the loads that you have on-premise into account, incur extra costs on batteries and choose panels of a suitable size/number that can produce the amount of power you need. But for grid-connected systems, all the calculations are fairly easy as the MNRE restricts the total permissible installation capacity to 100-150% of your “connected load”.

Apart from this, there is also the necessity of shadow analysis wherein engineers will visit your site to determine the amount of sunlight your intended solar installation area will receive. This will include a further series of calculations like the number of panels required, the efficiencies of the panels, the area available for the installation and so on. The final result will give you a total estimate of the cost that you will have to incur.


Step 3: Inspections and installations
Next, you will have to inform all the necessary local authorities that you are about to install a commercial solar power system. The first body that you must intimate is your local electricity supplier to whom you will also be selling the electricity you produce in case of a grid-connected system. They will check your existing meter connections and give you a fresh meter if required. Officials from the concerned civic bodies may also pay you a visit to determine the structural integrity of your premises and test other relevant parameters.
And when these formalities are completed, the final phase is where your entire solar power system will be assembled and set up. Here again, every component must come from brands that are MNRE approved and following their recommended specifications. The ministry’s website has the relevant lists as to which brands you must stick to while purchasing solar panels, inverters, accessories, etc.


And then you go online
Post completion of all necessary installation activities your solar power kicks in and takes care of your energy needs. Take note here that the Government of India does not provide any solar subsidies for commercial installations. However, you can access the Accelerated Depreciation Benefits. 

Switching to solar power systems has a number of benefits for businesses in the long run, as they can become self-sustainable and get a massive cut in their electricity bills. With the need to decrease dependence on fossil fuels and companies becoming more environmentally conscious, the demand for clean renewable energy is growing day by day.

Market sentiment remained subdued amid fall in global shares after the US President Donald Trump's latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods upset financial markets and fueled worries that trade talks may get derailed.

European shares struggled to stay afloat as trade concerns weigh.


How the market performedBears dominated the show as only seven Sensex stocks ended in the green while 21 fell.

HUL was the top performer, up 1.37 per cent. Other gainers included L&T, Power Grid, Infosys, ONGC and Bajaj Auto.

Tata Motors was the biggest loser, down 4.60 per cent. Other losers were ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, vedanta and Asian Paints.

Both the BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap ended lower, down 0.98 per cent and 0.85 per cent, respectively.

Infosys was the biggest contributor, however, the mood was spoiled by heavyweights such as Reliance, ICICI Bank and ITC.

On the sectoral front, barring IT, Consumer Durable and Capital Goods, all other sectoral indices declined. The BSE telecom was the biggest loser, down 2.44 per cent led by Bharti Airtel.


Factors that weighed on market:

Weak European marketsEuropean shares were little changed early on Tuesday with London markets leading losses as investors returned from a long weekend to digest a slew of earnings and watch for developments around US-China trade talks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index flitted between gains and losses and was last up 0.1 percent by 0735 GMT.


Concerns over GSTTrading sentiment also got hampered with S&P Global Ratings’ latest report stating that Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India is not likely to reduce the deficit of state governments significantly, amid large and growing expenditure mandates for the social sector as well as capital spending.


Uninspiring earningsThe market mood was further dragged because of lacklustre March quarter earnings, which reflect towards a slowdown in Indian economy and a delay in the much-awaited revival in earnings. These developments developments that are likely to promote investor unease


Sharp selloffThe negative breath was triggered owing to a sharp selloff in the index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, ITC and Tata Motors.


Trade tensionsEscalating trade tensions and uncertainty over election outcome remain an overhang on the markets continuing the past bearish mood.


Expert Take
Indian markets have been on a shaky ground for the past couple of days driven by ambiguity associated with the US-China trade negotiations and less-than-inspiring ongoing corporate earnings season. Further, the ongoing election season is another major variable that markets are watching closely. In the current scenario it’s critical that market participants keep resources handy to take advantage of opportunities once stability revives- Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Centrum Broking"

30,2019-05-10,PowerGrid,"In today’s world, electricity is as basic and as necessary for survival as food, clothing or shelter. Though the majority of our lives’ aspects are dependent on electric power, but there's no denying that we do experience power outages. It’s inevitable. We haven’t reached that state of perfection in terms of power supply/distribution, as of yet. 

Now, think of an FMCG outfit dealing with processing food products that require constant refrigeration or a hospital where several appliances are dependent on electricity to operate. A power outage in such establishments could cause chaos and result in consequential financial catastrophes. This precedent holds true -- varying in degrees of complication -- for every setting and scenario, be it a household birthday party, a restaurant in its peak hours or a movie theatre amidst a screening. Power outages are always unpleasant.

This is where generators or gensets kick in. Generators are basically machines which provide standby power to be used during power outages. Based on the requirements of an establishment, generators are available in various configurations with the capability to generate power starting from a range of a few kilowatts to over 3 megawatts. The most widely popular and commonly used generators operate either on diesel or CNG (compressed natural gas). Generators, over the years, have become more fuel efficient, easy to maintain, non-cacophonous and environmentally favourable. Modern-day generators are even capable of instantaneously taking over power distribution responsibilities in case of a power outage to ensure seamless operations.

There are several features and specifications that a user needs to consider while buying a generator. Amongst those features and specifications, the fuel on which the generator operates is one of the most important ones as its functionality, application and usability (based on where and for what purpose it is being used) can vary a lot based on this sole factor. 

As mentioned earlier, diesel and CNG generators are the most preferred ones amongst all available types of generators. So, let’s compare these two types of generators and understand which one could be the most suitable one for you.


In terms of purchase cost
Diesel generators generally cost less as compared to CNG generators. So, if you're clear about your power requirements and price is the primary concern then a diesel generator is more likely to provide an optimum solution. But if you are thinking long term, then you need to consider several other factors such as fuel prices, maintenance costs, etc. before choosing a suitable generator.


In terms of fuel prices/efficiency
When compared in terms of market price, CNG as a fuel is cheaper as well as more efficient than diesel. However, when it comes to performance, diesel generators are capable of delivering greater electrical output and performing for longer durations of time. So, if your power requirements are not very high or very frequent then a CNG generator would be idle for you. Whereas, if you are seeking a generator with high electrical output with consistent performance over time then opt for a diesel generator.


In terms of maintenance cost
Though both the types of generators demand periodic maintenance, diesel generators require very little maintenance in comparison to generators utilizing natural gas. Moreover, CNG is highly flammable, that is why it’s necessary to conduct thorough inspections periodically to avoid fatalities such as a gas leak. So, if your business or establishment is prone to risks of fire hazards or if power outages can cause significant losses then it would be recommendable to choose a diesel generator. 


In terms of fuel supply
CNG generators are more applicable in urban areas where natural gas is readily available through a gas pipeline. On the other hand, diesel generators are preferable where the continuous supply of CNG or any other fuel for that matter isn't available. Diesel generators can be advantageous in places such as rural areas or ships where there is no power grid and a generator is the only source of power.


In terms of safety
Of all the fossil fuels in common use, diesel is the least flammable. On the other hand, natural gas is highly combustible in nature. Moreover, diesel comes naturally in a liquid state with a distinct odour and therefore, a diesel leakage is easy to detect or prevent. In comparison, CNG apart from being highly combustible is stored in a compressed form which makes it vulnerable to explosions. CNG also doesn’t have any natural odour and in the case of a leakage, inhaling CNG in large quantities can result in fatalities. Therefore, if your outfit is prone to fire hazards then a diesel generator would be more suitable for you.


In terms of noise
When compared in terms of noise produced, diesel generators produce a lot more noise than CNG generators. Therefore, if you want to install a generator in places such as hospitals or schools then a CNG generator would be an appropriate choice.


In terms of emissions
Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and has a minimal inverse impact on the environment. Emissions caused by burning CNG causes very little to no pollution, whereas machines operating on diesel emit a lot of smoke harmful to living beings. So, if you’re looking for a generator to be installed in a compact or densely populated area where pollution could cause significant harm then a cleaner and greener CNG generator would be more suitable for you.

Choosing a suitable generator might seem to be a complicated task unless you are clear about your preferences and requirements. A diesel generator would be suitable for a large manufacturing unit located in a remote area because of its durability, consistent performance, and its capability to deliver higher electrical power output. Whereas, a CNG generator would be a wiser choice for a small business outfit operating in an urban area where pollution as well noise are more critical concerns than power outages.

31,2019-05-12,PowerGrid,"BENGALURU: The renewable energy ministry has held discussions with state governments to find out how much land they are willing to set aside for renewable energy parks, a senior official told ET.

This follows a recent announcement by the ministry that it will ensure that land and transmission facilities are in place for developers who win wind and solar projects in auctions conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), its nodal agency.

Last week, MNRE officials held discussions with their counterparts in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the central government official said, requesting not to be named. Meetings with Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka are in the offing, the official added.

“We want the states to identify actual parcels of land where projects can be set up,” the official told ET. “Developers can bid comfortably knowing they won’t have to hunt for land. We will make sure Power Grid Corporation of India provides connectivity in these places too. PGCIL is already working on extending its transmission.”

It is learnt that Gujarat has agreed to provide land to accommodate 10,000 MW; Andhra will be giving space for 8000 MW, while Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have offered land for 19,000 MW and 5,000 MW, respectively.

“The broad areas of land have been identified. In around a month, SECI will start floating more tenders,” the official cited earlier said.

Gujarat, in particular, had been reluctant to provide land for centrally-auctioned renewable energy projects, since the power produced would not necessarily go to Gujarat, but could be provided anywhere in the country through the inter-state transmission network.

The ministry hopes that these meetings will iron out any differences that may have arisen with the states. In March, it had announced an incentive scheme by which states putting up renewable energy projects would be entitled to Rs 0.02 of every unit of power produced by the plant, irrespective of where the power was supplied."
34,2019-05-13,PowerGrid,"What is a Diesel Generator? 
A diesel generator is used to generate electric energy by using a diesel engine along with an electric generator. A diesel generator can be used as an emergency power supply in case of power cuts or in places where there is no connection with the power grid.


Types of Diesel Generators
Diesel generators are available in various sizes, models and designs that are manufactured by many companies. So before buying a diesel generator, here are the different types that you should know about:



Industrial or Residential – Industrial generators are generally large in size and can provide a great deal of power for a long period of time. As the name suggests, they are generally used in industries where power demand is high. On the other hand, residential generators are small in size and provide power up to a specific range. They are ideal for use in households, small shops and offices.
Air cooled or Water cooled – Air-cooled generators rely on air to provide the cooling function for the generator. No additional part, except for an air intake system is used. Water cooled generators rely on water for cooling and comprise of a separate system for achieving this function. Water cooled generators require more maintenance than air-cooled generators.
Power Output – The power output range of diesel generators is very wide and can be classified accordingly. A 3 kVA diesel generator can be used to run power tools or appliances such as ACs, computers, multiple ceiling fans, etc. They are suitable for use in small offices, shops and houses. Whereas a 2000 kVA diesel generator would be suitable for use in big industries or places with high power demand.


Specifications to keep in focus while buying a Diesel Generator


Power - It is important to know the requirement of the home/enterprise before buying a diesel generator. According to the need of a place, generators ranging from 2.5 kVA to more than 2000 kVA can be used.


Phase - Diesel generators are available for both single phase and three phase connections. Find out if your home/enterprise has a single phase or three phase connection and choose a suitable generator accordingly.


Fuel Consumption - Fuel consumption is one of the most important things to be kept in mind while buying a diesel generator. Find out the fuel consumption of the generator per hour and per kVA (or kW) and also the fuel efficiency it provides with respect to the load.


Control systems and power management systems - Generators with the ability to automatically transfer power from the grid to the generator during a power cut and vice versa, display warning (low fuel and other performance issues) along with providing a broad range of analysis data, helps increase the efficiency of the diesel generator. The power management system helps to optimize the fuel consumption and the performance of the generator with respect to load demand.


Portability and Size - A generator with a set of wheels or those provided with slots for easy lifting helps reduce the hassle of transportation. Also, keep in mind the size of the generator with respect to the space available to keep it.


Noise – High noise emission can be a problem if the generator is kept in close proximity. Noise absorption technology is provided in some diesel generators which highly reduces the noise emitted by it.

33,2019-05-13,PowerGrid,"What are Job Site Generators?
Job site generators are used to provide power supply to equipment or machinery being used on job sites. Normally, job sites are in areas where power supply from the main power grid cannot be provided or where connecting the machinery to the main line would be difficult. Normally, most of the 
job site generators are portable and have the ability to be transported from one site to another. Multiple fuel options like diesel, propane, natural gas etc. are available for job site generators.


Features of Job Site Generators


Job site generators are provided with wheels or handles for lifting, which allows them to be transported from one site to another easily. 
They are available in a wide range of options with varied power output capacities. Contractors or business operators can calculate power requirements and buy a suitable job site generator accordingly.
Multiple fuel options like diesel, propane, natural gases etc. are available with respect to different makes and models of generators.
Job site generators with different fuel tank sizes are available. Thus, if a contractor or business operator wants to continue their work without refuelling the tank multiple times, he/she can choose a generator with a big fuel tank.


Applications of Job Site Generators


Job site generators can be used for powering commercial machinery or equipment in places where power cannot be accessed from the main line. 
For contractors or business operators who keep changing work sites, job site generators are a huge advantage as they are portable and can easily be transported after the work is completed at the site. 
At locations where frequent power outages occur, the work being done by types of machinery may get halted. This results in loss of time and impacts the overall efficiency of the work. Thus, job site generators are handy during such scenarios and help the machinery continue their work without any interruption.

Investors can take advantage of the declining movement to accumulate good stocks. Some stock names to look for positional perspectives include PowerGrid, MGL, FSL, Bajaj Electric, and GEPIL."
35,2019-05-14,PowerGrid,"How do Diesel Generators work?
A diesel generator is used to generate electric energy by using a diesel engine with the help of an electric generator. Diesel gensets convert the mechanical energy generated by the diesel engine into electricity using alternators. An alternator comprises of a rotor (a moving component that produces rotating magnetic field) and a stator (a stationary set of electrical conductors wound in coils over an iron ore). The rotor generates a moving magnetic field around the stator and thus voltage difference is induced between the windings of a stator. This is how electricity is produced by the generator.


Features of Diesel Generators


Power Output: The power output range of diesel generators is very wide and can be classified accordingly. Diesel generators used for industrial purposes are generally large in size and can provide a great deal of power for a long period of time. They are generally used by industries where power demand is high. Whereas diesel generators used for domestic purposes are very small in size and provide power up to a limited range. They are ideal for use in houses, small shops and offices.
Cooling: Air cooled diesel gensets rely on air to provide the cooling function for the generator. No additional part, except for an air intake system is used. Liquid cooled diesel generators rely on liquids for cooling and comprise of a separate system for achieving this function. 
Control systems and power management systems: Modern day diesel generators have the ability to automatically transfer the source of power supply from the grid to the generator during a power cut and vice versa. They can also display warning messages (low fuel and other performance issues) along with providing a broad range of analysis data, which in turn helps to increase the efficiency of the diesel generator.

Applications of Diesel Generators


Diesel generators can be used as a backup power supply system for homes, shops, offices etc. in the event of power outages or when connection to the power grid is lost.
They can be used to power machinery and power tools at job sites where getting power from the grid is difficult.
They can even be used as the primary source of power supply in distant regions, where connection to the power grid is not possible.

38,2019-05-15,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets took heart from gains in US stocks in overnight trade, extending their gains to Wednesday's session. Improving global sentiment and renewed hopes of a trade deal lent some confidence to investors on Dalal Street. 

US President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that trade talks with China have not collapsed and called the widening US-China tariff war “a little squabble”, even as his administration readies 25 per cent duties on all remaining Chinese imports. Expanding on a stream of optimistic early morning tweets, Trump told reporters that he has a “very good dialogue” going with China and touted his “extraordinary” relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. 

Soothing oil prices contributed to the upbeat mood. Oil eased on Wednesday after closely watched data showed a surprise rise in US crude stockpiles, but prices were supported by mounting tensions in the Middle East, Reuters reported.

Rupee too rose against the US dollar amid ease in trade tensions between the US and China. The domestic unit rose 23 paise against the greenback to 70.22.

At around 9:30 am, Sensex was up 102 points or 0.27 per cent at 37,420. In the Sensex pack of stocks, 18 advanced while 12 declined. 

Nifty50 rose 32 points or 0.28 per cent to 11,254. Among Nifty stocks, 29 stocks gained, 20 declined while one remained unchanged. 

""The index has paused the ongoing correction by maintaining the rhythm of not correcting more than 10 to 11 sessions in a row, since July 2013. Therefore, follow through strength above 11,300 would be required to extend pullback towards 11,500 or else consolidation in the range of 11,000 – 11,300 as volatility ahead of key event of General Election 2019 would offer buying opportunity,"" said ICICI Securities.

The markets would keep an eye on stocks such as Lupin, Torrent Power, Manappuram Finance, Adani Green, Jubilant Foodworks, KPIT Tech, Taj GVK Hotels, Central Bank, Amara Raja Batteries, Zuari Agro Chemicals and Aditya Birla Fashion which will report their March quarter results today. 

In the 30-pack Sensex, HCL Tech was the biggest gainer followed by Powergrid, Tata Steel, Vedanta, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.

On the other hand, YES Bank was the biggest loser, falling over 4 per cent. Former Reserve Bank Deputy Governor R Gandhi has been appointed as additional director on the board of the private lender.

Other losers were Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Bajaj Auto.

Off the main board, shares of Jet Airways sulked, shedding 5 per cent after its top brass took an exit. Lenders to Jet Airways and Etihad Airways have approached the Hinduja Group offering a stake in the grounded airline, said people close to the development, adding that exploratory talks are on. Meanwhile, four senior executives, including chief executive Vinay Dube and his deputy Amit Agarwal, have quit the ailing airline.

36,2019-05-15,PowerGrid,"In the absence of earnings growth triggers, which has shrunk the universe of investible ideas, leading fund houses have resorted to selling more of a part of their portfolios than buying fresh stocks in April this year. Managers have been sellers in select public sector companies. Most prominent among them are SBI, Coal India, ONGC, and Power Grid Corporation. There have been very few companies which were fresh entries in the April portfolio of leading fund houses.

Apart from participating in initial public offerings (IPOs), mutual funds have enhanced exposure in select IT companies. Also a sift through the buy-sell pattern of fund houses shows that in April in comparison with March, managers have enhanced exposure in companies which are essentially bottomup and low-beta ideas in sectors such as pharmaceutical and telecommunications. Here is the low-down on a few prominent companies in which fund managers enhanced their exposure.


Cipla
Turnaround in business(noticeable improvement in the US sales), encouraging sales guidance, and new approvals of Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) have improved the earnings’ growth estimates of pharmaceuticals company Cipla. The company’s sales from the US markets have shown high momentum which is expected to fund its research and development investments. This should boost the company’s overall profitability. Besides this, the company has been clocking steady growth in its domestic business. According to analysts’ estimates, the company’s earnings are expected to grow at compounded annual growth rate of 23 per cent in the three fiscals ending FY21.


NTPCOne of the key reasons why fund managers enhanced exposure to NTPC because of its stable and highly predictable earnings’ growth. The company has added nearly 5 Gigawatt of incremental capacity on the consolidated basis in the previous fiscal year. This may add to 10 per cent increase in the regulated equity, thus translate into improvement in the earnings. In addition to this, the company’s coal stock data at its plants has improved considerably with coal stock at 18 days in March this year compared with seven days about six months ago. The improved coal supply, plant availability factor and annual incremental addition of 4-5GW of capacity could support company’s return of equity in the medium term.


TCSIncreasing number OF large deals (over $100 million) across geographies and business verticals, improved financial performance in key business verticals (BFSI, retail) amid high competition, superior execution, pricing power and strong demand for digital segment point out that TCS would gain further market share in the coming quarters. Besides this, TCS has been able to maintain its margins. Its margins are highest in the industry. In contrast to this, margins of its peers are falling. Also favourable currency movement works in the company’s favour. These factors have attracted high interest in the company’s stock.


Alkem LaboratoriesOne of the key triggers in the stock of Alkem Laboratories is price correction. Since January till the end of March, the stock of Alkem Laboratories fell close to 10 per cent while the benchmark index Sensex gained close to 7 per cent. This fall was largely due to weaker than expected FY19 financial performance of the company. The pharmaceuticals company which is into manufacturing and selling of generics drugs active pharmaceutical ingredient (APIs) and neutraceuticals both in India and overseas markets, is expected to benefit from certain earningsenhancing triggers. These are pronounced improvement in its financial performance in the past few quarters, favourable currency impact, 60 pending Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in generics segment in the US markets (27 per cent of total sales), which shows promise of high scalability and consistent growth in the US markets. Due to these factors, analysts foresee that the company’s earnings to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 23 per cent in the three years ending FY21."
39,2019-05-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a positive start on Thursday amid firm global cues. Market breadth was in favour of buyers. However, steadily rising crude oil prices and selling by foreign institutional investors capped gains.

Asian shares steadied in early trade on news that the US was planning to delay tariffs on auto imports, providing much-needed relief to markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Australian and South Korean indices were little changed.

Oil prices rose for the third straight day, as the risk of conflict in West Asia stoked fears of supply disruptions, negating an unexpected rise in US inventories. Amid all this, Brent crude futures touched the $72 mark.

India’s trade deficit widened to a five-month high in April as rising crude prices raised import costs and gold imports swelled. 

FIIs have suddenly turned sellers in equities in seven out of last 10 sessions. They offloaded shares worth Rs 1,142.44 crore on Wednesday, NSE data showed. 



At 9:30 am, Sensex traded 24 points, or 0.06 per cent, higher at 37,139 while NSE’s Nifty was up 6 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 11,163. In the 50-pack, 30 stocks advanced, while 20 declined.

Kotak Bank was the biggest loser, falling over 1 per cent. L&T, Coal India, M&M, HDFC and ITC joined Kotak on the list of losers.


Off the main board, IndiGo shares kept buzzing after reports of serious differences between the two founder-promoters, threatening to affect the airline’s functioning. Clauses in the shareholders’ agreement and differences between the two founders over strategies and ambitions are said to be the bone of contention. IndiGo shares slipped nearly 3 per cent.

44,2019-05-17,PowerGrid,"ICICI Prudential Asset Management, the country’s second-largest money manager by assets, was busy all through April lapping up beaten down stocks, when the BSE benchmark Sensex advanced around 1 per cent.

The fund house increased exposure to select stocks such as Vodafone Idea, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Avanti Feeds, Bharat Electronics and NBCC, that have plunged 45-72 per cent since January 2018. 

S Naren, ED and CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The market currently is fairly priced. The strategy in such market condition is to adopt a stock-specific approach. There are several pockets of opportunities across sectors and market capitalisations, where scrips are available at attractive valuations.”

Power, auto ancillaries, metal and telecom looks attractive to Naren.

Vodafone Idea recently concluded a Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, which was oversubscribed nearly 1.08 times. Ace Mutual Fund data base showed ICICI Prudential was holding 46 crore Vodafone Idea shares as of April 30 against 8.77 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house subscribed to the rights issue.



Besides, the fund house bought additional shares of IT majors Infosys (1.30 crore) and Tata Consultancy Services (4 lakh). Infosys last month posted a 10.5 per cent rise in consolidated profit for March quarter at Rs 4,078 crore, and gave a guidance for 7.5-9.5 per cent revenue growth in FY 2019-20. 

TCS reported 17.7 per cent year-on-year growth in March quarter net income at Rs 8,126 crore and Rs 6,904 crore profit. The IT major last Friday once again became India’s most valued firm by market valuation, surpassing Reliance Industries. 

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Infosys with a price target of Rs 782 and a ‘buy’ call on TCS with a price target of Rs 2,312.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added shares of auto players Eicher Motors (5,484 shares), TVS Motor (13 lakh) and Mahindra & Mahindra (4.15 lakh). Financial majors Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank also manage to draw the fund house. 

In the power sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 2.83 crore shares of NTPC, followed by Power Finance Corporation (40 lakh), REC (36 lakh) and Adani Power (1.34 lakh). Antique Stock Broking has ‘buy’ rating on NTPC with a price target of Rs 161.

“With improvement in commissioning and commercialisation, NTPC should see an uptick in operational performance. Further, capacity addition in the next five years will sustain the momentum. We foresee 5-6 per cent capacity addition CAGR,” the brokerage said.

The fund manager also bought auto ancillary shares like Apollo Tyre, Exide Batteries, Motherson Sumi Systems and Amara Raja Batteries.

“I will be a little contrarian on auto and auto ancillaries at this point. Although lead indicators suggest a bit of consumption slowdown, two-wheelers should start looking better. I would probably be a buyer on dips starting with two-wheelers and also in some of the auto components and auto ancillaries. There has been a reasonable price correction because of the overall slowdown,” Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, told ETNOW.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 111 companies, and sold in 116 across sectors. The fund house held 552 stocks as of April 30.

45,2019-05-18,PowerGrid,"BHANGAR, KOLKATA: “That’s where they were planning to build an octopus of wires,” says Salim Shiekh, a first-time voter at Khamarait in Bhangar, pointing towards the power transmission towers that were to crisscross the multi-crop farm plots carrying electricity to parts of South Bengal and Bihar. “Our fields were taken away, crops were suffering… We have forced them to go underground,” he adds with an unmistakable sense of pride in his voice.

The wires may have indeed disappeared for now after high voltage resistance from over a dozen villages for close to three years forced the Mamata Banerjee government to backtrack on a Power Grid transmission project, but even today, scratch the surface and the fault lines appear among the poorest who feel betrayed by their chief minister who herself fought a crusade against the Left over land and won.

“I have never ever seen such animosity, terror and violence in the 30 years of my life of the kind I have witnessed in the last three,” says Mushirul Hasan from the adjoining Machhi Bhanga village. “It has been a reign of terror unleashed by Trinamool Congress goons who were hell bent to snatch our land.”

Just 30 km from Kolkata, Bhangar, part of the Jadavpur Lok Sabha Constituency, has been the new Singur. And Banerjee has been on the other side of this bloody agitation.

Ten years ago, she had championed the cause of the downtrodden, making forcible land acquisition for industry a major national political issue, and stormed to power in West Bengal riding high on her protests against Tata Motors’ Nano car project in Singur. But the simmering tensions in Bhangar for over three years that has seen severe police brutality, lathi charges, tear gas shelling, even firings that took the lives of at least four villagers and several arrests of protestors, now serves a grim reminder of the agitations against land acquisition in Singur, Nandigram and Lalgargh —the political cul-de-sac of voter apathy from which her Communist predecessors could never emerge. After the riots that lasted over two weeks and left several dead, the villagers of Bhangar also retaliated much the same way by blocking highways with uprooted tree trunks, setting police vans of fire, pelting stones and smashing windscreens of official vehicles.

Beyond the violence, the similarities are uncanny. Fundamentally these are all agitation over some of the most fertile tracts of farmland. “It is also about using brute political force to achieve an objective inimical to the locals… It inevitably backfires,” says Mirzan Hasan, a convenor of the Jami, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha committee (committee to protect land, livelihood, environment and ecosystem), that has been leading the opposition. Son of a local TMC panchayat leader, Hasan has pledged his support for Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidate.

Banerjee, who had thrown her weight behind the resistance movements at Singur in 2006, Nandigram in 2007 and Lalgarh in 2009 as an opposition leader, is now the chief minister. Given her pro-poor, pro-people rhetoric, the agitation in Bhangar, and the government’s response, has been especially ironic.

“The issue is no more germane. But what is significant is what the Bhangar movement stands for,” says Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, CPI(M) candidate from Jadavpur Lok Sanha constituency. “When poor villagers unite they can take their tormentors to task. TMC’s terror cannot subjugate us. That has been the biggest outcome.”


Bhangar power transmission project.

Ma mati manush redux
The symbolism of Bhangar is expected to play a significant role in deciding the Lok Sabha member from Jadavpur, arguably the most prestigious seat in West Bengal.

Traditionally a Left citadel, it elected CPI(M) veteran Somnath Chatterjee to the Lok Sabha, where he later became the speaker. Chief minister Banerjee also contested her first election from Jadavpur in 1984 and had won, causing a major upset. To stem the in fighting within, she purportedly sprung a surprise and announced Tollywood star Mimi Chakraborty—a political greenhorn—would take on former Kolkata Municipal Corporation mayor Bhattacharya of CPI(M).

To be fair, TMC government has accepted most of the demands and have tweaked the project significantly after Banerjee herself had to inetervene. The project won’t move but resumed only after truce. Overhead high-tension wires were replaced; nearby roads, drainage systems improved and compensation package improved to placate everyone.

Both candidates know that the wounds are still raw. Chakraborty is trying to use her star power to woo voters to her sides. “I am directly dealing with the voters there,” she says. “Bhangar was definitely an issue before. No longer. The government has accepted most of the terms of the agitators. There are far bigger issues that are more relevant...depleting water table, unemployment. I am making sure that voters of Bhangar know I stand for them and beside them.”

Chakraborty would hate a spark to foment passions yet again. More so as Bhattacharya, a seasoned lawyer, had been a consistent legal advisor to these agitating villagers in several of the court cases and have deep connects with the masses.

“He is an old world Marxist but not your quintessential dogmatic one — clean public life, tremendous goodwill, with an impeccable legal credential,” says Gautam Pramanik, a resident of Tollygunge who voted for TMC in 2014 but will switch sides this time. “He fought cases pro bono even when he was the mayor and had undertaken several civic initiatives for the city. Voters will support him and not a Barbie.”

Most people have written off BJP’s Anupam Hazra, a former Trinamool MP who recently courted controversy and received a show cause from his own party.


Power to the people
But what really transpired that polarised these villages? Why is a three-year-old agitation still relevant? Or is it?

In 2013, the state government acquired 14 acres spread over four villages for the project under Power Grid Corporation of India to set up a 4,000 kV power grid substation. Interestingly, the state government had acquired the land a day before Parliament passed the new land acquisition bill in 2013, using the draconian the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, that Banerjee herself had fought tooth and nail during her days in the opposition.

Once work on the substation commenced, the villagers reacted saying they were kept in the dark. Some said they were bullied into giving up their land. “At the gunpoint of [Trinamool Congress leader] Arabul Islam and his men, the villagers were all forced to hand over their land to the government,” says Shukla Bhuimali, a member of CPI(M) Red Star that also became a part of this movement. “This entire exercise was illegal.”

The villagers alleged the government gave a total compensation of Rs 15 crore, as per the old land acquisition act. Twelve villagers, however, refused to take the money and began protesting. From the beginning the local MLA, state Food Processing Industries Minister Abdur Razzak Molla had been downplaying the agitation saying only four five villages are under seize. In reality the discontent had spread wide and far.

The protestors were not shown any social-impact-assessment or environment-impact-assessment report even though they asked for these. Naturally, they feared adverse environmental effects of the project. Rumours spread about the potential electromagnetic effect leading to brain disease, stillborn babies, and the death of fish in the local water bodies. Most villagers who rely on farming for a living worried their output would be damage their crops. Soon with political parties -- Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Star notorious for stalling almost eight similar projects throughout India – green and social activists joined in the movement gathered heft and organisational momentum. 

What infuriated the villagers most was that the state government did not even acknowledge the deaths and in 2018 tried bulldozing the panchayat polls. Eventually, five of the eight candidates belonging to the Committee for Protection of Land Livelihood Environment and Ecology (CPLLEE), braving intense violence and murderous attacks on their supporters, won. These independents had to file their nominations through WhatsApp, in accordance with the directive of the Calcutta High Court after TMC hooligans allegedly blocked their way. The spectacular victory of protesting villagers in Bhangar represented the moral victory of one of those rare people’s movements in Bengal in recent times.

“There is indeed a ground-level grievance among villagers,” says Bhattacharya. “To break the movement, Mamata first used extra-constitutional forces like her party’s goons. And she was their messiah a few years back after she claimed the Left had sold out. It’s been a 360-degree U-turn thereafter. The fear of a free and fair elections on Sunday still persists. If that happens, the outcome might be quite different.”


Legacy of past & present
His confidence stems from the fact that of the seven assembly constituencies that together make up for Jadavpur, the urban and semi-rural voters have always had a soft corner for the Left even after the party has been decimated in recent years. CPI(M) has never lost the Jadavpur assembly since 1967, barring the 2011 elections when TMC dislodged the 34-year Left regime in Bengal. Currently, CPI(M)’s Sujan Chakraborty is the sitting MLA from Jadavpur. As a mayor, Bhattacharya also initiated several drainage projects funded by ADB in many of these newly added wards of Kolkata Corporation, thereby garnering goodwill. Even in 2014, CPIM corned 36.51% of vote share as against TMC’s 46.5% and in 2016 Assembly vote, CPIM still managed 34.38% versus TMC’s 48.26%

TMC’s infighting spurred by the rivalry of between Mollah and Islam, the local strongman in Bhangar has not only frustrated the villagers of the area but might also cause some headaches in an otherwise well-oiled machinery that should easily take on the non-existence Left organisational backbone. The apathy and absenteeism of the last two TMC Lok Sabha candidates Sugata Basu and Kabir Suman is also not helping Chakraborty, a self made actor, who rose from small town Jalpaiguri to celluloid success, to pull off what was once considered a walk in the park. “I am not going anywhere,” argues Chakraborty. “My constituency is right behind my house. Moreover, in today’s Instagram age, movie actors have nowhere to hide. We will always remain under public scrutiny. I have joined politics at the peak of my career knowing fully well what I am getting into.” 


Power grid corp's Bhangar power transmission project.
Many are hoping Jadavpur causes a big upset. In 2014, Bhangar constituency had propelled TMC to victory; this time the tangled wires might just trip up TMC hopes or at least give it a good hard fight. Pockets of the old Red bastions -- the urban pockets of Jadavpur and Tollygunge that had backed former chief minister Budhadev Bhattacharya since 1982 all the way till 2011 -- still have enough captive supporters and is now seeing BJP and CPIM join forces for a coordinated strategy to beat their common adversary, Banerjee’s TMC. 

Bhattacharya’s own political fortunes turned in 2012-13, when he single handedly took on TMC during the aftermath of the chit fund scam in the courts and got the CBI to investigate the matter. Overnight, the former election agent of Buddhadev Bhattarcharya, was the poster boy in his party. Naturally, his party is now turning to him for redemption.

“A Left defeat will again showcase they still have not recovered from 2011 and have zero organisational strength,” said a TMC councillor who did not wish to come on record. The person said TMC will have it easy in four of the seven assembly segments in the Lok Sabha constituency that are semi rural. “In Jadavpur and Tollygunge, Left is likely take a lead. It will eventually boil down to Bhangar.”"

The momentum indicator signalled a bullish crossover -- a sign of bullish undertone -- on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. Many of these stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included DHFL, Ashok Leyland, Adani Ports, L&T Finance, Zee Entertainment and Indiabulls Real Estate, Adani Green BHEL, NBCC and ONGC. ITC, Power Grid, IDBI Bank, Tata Power and Allahabad Bank have also sent out bullish signals on the technical charts, data suggests.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Experts said Monday’s rally was just the beginning exit polls hold true.

The bank is on its way to recovery. Underlying loan growth is healthy and the bank is also diversifying its loan book to make it less risky. ROE of the bank should improve significantly in FY20.
NextHDFC Life | CMP: Rs 391.05 | Target: Rs 436.20 | Upside: 12%20 May, 2019It did a successful OFS recently which is encouraging.

The company trades at an attractive valuation of 12X forward PE.

The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

Analysts feel the ongoing rally may lift Nifty to 12,000 mark, if the election outcome is in line with exit poll projections. They see good times ahead for stocks in the broader market.

“The positive development (exit polls) has resulted in a complete gush in many midcaps, which had underperformed significantly over the past few months. Going ahead, traders should focus completely on such propositions from the broader market and should keep a close eye on the poll outcome on Thursday,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.
If the strength is Nifty50 helps it top the 11,856 level on a closing basis, the rally may extend up to 12,100, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in. “Strong support can be expected around the 11,720 level, where fresh buying can be considered with a stop loss below 11,590 level on a closing basis,” Mohammad said.

51,2019-05-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Riding on the back of gains in financials and bank stocks, flagship equity indices recorded a firm close to an otherwise volatile session ahead of the general elections outcome on Thursday.

Hopes of a second term for the incumbent BJP government, kept market sentiment bullish. However, analysts have been quick to point out that exit poll outcomes must be taken with a pinch of salt, as they have proved to be wrong on many occasions.

Steady FII inflows along with gains in domestic currency lent support to the upbeat mood.

BSE Sensex ended 140 points or 0.36 per cent higher at 39,110 while NSE Nifty settled at 11,738, up 29 points or 0.25 per cent.

However, India VIX spiked 7 per cent to 27.54. The volatility index hit the 30 level during the day for the first time since September 2015.


Market at a glance:
Among Nifty stocks, 34 advanced while 16 declined. While in the 30-pack Sensex, 25 stocks ended higher and five lower. IndusInd Bank was the best index performer, rising 4.84 per cent, even as the lender reported a 62 per cent fall in profit at Rs 360 crore on a nearly five-time jump in provisions.

Sun Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Coal India and Tata Motors were among other stocks that shut shop in the green. 

YES Bank (down 2.34 per cent) shed the most, followed by ITC, TCS, Power Grid and Hindustan Unilever. 

Midcap stocks fared poorly, with BSE midcap index dropping 0.16 per cent. The BSE smallcap index rose in line with benchmark Sensex, up 0.54 per cent.

On the sectoral map, BSE Bankex and BSE Capital Goods shined the most, rising 0.89 per cent and 0.87 per cent, respectively. BSE Industrials too logged strong gains, up 0.82 per cent. 

On the other hand, FMCG, IT, Consumer Goods and Teck were among the worst hit.


Factors that supported the market:


Optimism over BJP's returnWith election outcome due tomorrow, stock market investors turned buyers ahead of the D-Day amid optimism that the BJP led by Narendra Modi government would return to power as reflected in the exit polls.


Rupee edges higher 
The domestic currency edged higher by 10 paise against the dollar amid weakness in the greenback and easing crude oil prices. Strong FIIs inflows also improved sentiments for the rupee. The dometic unit hit an intraday high of 69.62.


Crude prices cools a bit
Oil prices fell on Wednesday after industry data showed an increase in US crude inventories and on demand concerns linked to a protracted trade war between China and the US. However, analysts said oil market remained tight amid supply cuts led by producer group Opec and as political tension escalates in the Middle East. Brent crude futures were down 70 cents at $71.48 a barrel and are set for their biggest daily fall in eleven days.


Expert Take

“We remain structurally positive on the market and expect a positive bias post elections. Any dip or correction is expected to act as a strong buying opportunity. We expect Nifty to test 12,200-12,500 on the higher side, while meaningful support is seen at 11,400. Investors are advised to accumulate while traders can use volatility in their favor and follow a buy on dips strategy""- Sahaj Agrawal, Head of Research, Derivatives, Kotak Securities ""Volatility index shot to a four-year high just ahead the big event. Valuation is expensive depicting the risk of the market to handle such event risk, long-term investors can stay cautious. While actual outcome being in-line with the exit poll will be a relief in the short-term. Formation of a government with strong mandate will support the undercurrent by foreign inflows""Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"

Ashoka Buildcon: This stock can be a unique play on the construction sector both as a developer and EPC player. It received strong order inflows of over Rs 6,700 crore during 9MFY2019 taking its total order book to 3x TTM revenues. Strong order book along with advanced stages of receipt of appointed dates for its HAM projects is expected to result in strong revenue booking over FY2019-FY2021E. The recent private equity investment in its city gas distribution (CGD) business will lower equity requirement in the business.

The brokerage has set a price target of Rs 154 for Ashoka Buildcon.


Ahluwalia Contracts (India): The company has geared up with a robust order intake and is now out of NGT related execution risks for its projects. Further, it has improved its capabilities leading to the bidding for bigger ticket size projects where the competitive intensity is much lower. Government spending on education, affordable housing and health sectors are expected to rise further post the formation of a stable government. Sharekhan believes the company is on a strong growth trajectory over the next two years with earnings slated to rise by 25 per cent CAGR driven by an increase in the operating margins and an improvement in execution (16 per cent CAGR) over the period of FY2019-21E. Sharekhan is positive on Ahluwalia Contracts with a price target of Rs 390.

54,2019-05-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: History does repeat itself!

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s NDA scripted a spectacular win in India’s general election on Thursday, almost repeating its record seat haul in 2014, Dalal Street too decided to do encore.

In 2014, when BJP’s Narendra Modi won a historic mandate, equity benchmark Sensex rallied a cool 1,470 points to top the 25,000 mark. A repeat win on Thursday lifted it past the 40,000 landmark. On both occasions, the market gave up over 1,000 points from the day’s peak; the difference this time is it closed in the red.

By the time the trading halted, the NDA’s tally read 339 against opposition UPA’s 93 and others 110. The final results of the vote count are due later this evening.

As the indices climbed new highs, riding the euphoria over clear majority for the BJP, investors decided to take some profit off the table in view of the weak fundamentals that stare at the economy.

""Internals of the market were weaker this time, because open interest had increased only 5 per cent post-exit polls. In 2014, there was a massive surge in open interest after the exit polls. This clearly showed that sentimentally Mr Market was supporting the bulls but hard money was not flowing in,” said Umesh Mehta, Head of Research of Samco Securities.

After surging over 1,000 points to hit new high of 40,124, BSE Sensex not only gave up all the gains but also slipped 299 points, or 0.76 per cent, into the negative territory to end at 38,811. Its NSE counterpart Nifty, suffered a similar fate to end at 11,657, down 80.85 points or 0.69 per cent. The 50-pack had hit a high of 12,041 in the first half of the day. This was the biggest intraday drop for the market in 11 years.

India VIX fell whooping 29 per cent to 19.58, registering its second biggest fall ever since its launch. 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, ""Since the final outcome is in line with expectation, we can have a mild consolidation in the short term. This is because neither earnings nor the economy has started picking up and is unlikely to see any immediate revamp as it takes one to two quarters to stabilize. These factors along with premium valuation and muted global trend will start controlling market momentum now as the optimism gets digested.”

In the Sensex pack, 15 stocks advanced while 15 declined. Vedanta, down 5.53 per cent, was the worst hit in the 30-pack index. ITC, HDFC Bank, Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance and Sun Pharma joined Vedanta on the losers’ list.

IndusInd Bank led the winners’ pack. Coal India, YES Bank, Hero MotoCorp and PowerGrid were other Sensex gainers.

The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices declined 0.15 per cent and 0.11 per cent, respectively, but fared better than Sensex. 

Twelve of 19 sectoral indices on BSE ended in the red, with FMCG dropping the most, followed by metals and consumer durables. Telecom and metal stocks were among the best performing indices.

Analysts are hopeful the indices will do better going forward. 

""The results have raised hopes that the issues facing the economy will be tackled in a firm and prudent way. Global issues may bother a bit less in the near term, though their shadows can linger on. The challenge to earnings growth will continue in the near term till we have a better picture of monsoon spread and intensity and the liquidity situation eases,"" said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities.

Globally, most markets were in the red, as concerns grew that the China-US trade conflict was fast turning into a technology Cold War between the world's two largest economies."
55,2019-05-24,PowerGrid,"The re-allocation of the asset class from real estate -- physical assets to financial assets will continue, said Kunj Bansal, Partner & CIO, Sarthi Group, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

What do you think the markets would want to see from NDA-2.0?
What the market wants to see going forward from here is the improvement in macro and micro numbers. While the uncertainty is over, the fear that in case of a change in government, the policies will change and the growth period may get lengthened is over. 

But let us keep in mind that now it is time to go back to basics. Our macro and micro situation probably is not as great. There seems to be a risk of fiscal deficit slipping out of the target. Tax collections have been lower than the target and the growth is not reflecting in the earnings of the corporates. So I think that is where we have to be back to. Thankfully the oil price globally continues to support us so that will be a positive factor if it remains that way. And so does the currency movement. So net-net, it is back to basics, uncertainty and the risk of policy changes not being there anymore. Now focus has to come back to improving macro and micro.


Too many coincidences, yes from the same village also. That is another coincidence, I always tell people.Yes. Its like this filmy dialogue, 
aap kuch karna chaho toh puri kaynaat aapko karne ke liye jut jati hai (If you truly want to do something, the universe conspires to help you), So, probably something similar has happened to this government and all the global factors have helped it. 

If we look at the monsoon track record of last five years, that has also been reasonably friendly. Let us see what happens going forward. But yes, the oil price will continue to remain a challenge, especially if it moves up with this news flow of Iran and Syria war and the US again is going strict on sanctions. So, that will be a challenge. 

We are coming close to monsoon that is something that will have to consider. Net-net, the Indian equity market story has not been as much about growth, especially in last few years. It has been a case of more asset re-allocation. After talking for last 10-15-20 years, Indian equity penetration is not there. The money invested in equity from Indian savings shows that change has happened in the last three years. We could assign the reason to demonetisation or maybe it would have happened otherwise if demonetisation was not there. I do not know. 

So the money which was going to the non-productive physical asset classes like gold and real estate has significantly come down in the last three years. So, coming back has been the story and that is what the story will continue to be.
As I said, growth is not there, macroeconomic numbers are not there, corporate earnings are not there. But that does not mean equity market will not give returns. The equity market will give returns but that will come from money inflow that will continue to come in. The re-allocation of the asset class from real estate -- physical assets to financial assets will continue. Within that, we have seen the phases wherein last one year, largecaps sharply outperformed the mid and smallcaps. 

Is it time for small and midcaps to perform? Probably yes. Those kind of changes will keep happening wherever the result support is there. 


Where are you deploying money within the engineering and capital goods space?Surprisingly, I continue to remain doubtful on this whole engineering and capital goods space. In last five year also, while it is well known fact that a significantly high amount of investment has gone into road construction and if I juxtapose that with the stock performance or even the financial performance of the road companies, road EPC, road owners, other than one or two exceptions, probably none of those have given any return to shareholders for three, four, five years.

So let us keep in mind that we are not talking here of a short-term return. So, that was a surprise. We saw so much of investment, so much of focus by the government in infrastructure investment especially in road and yet not a single stock has given return to shareholders! The reason is that most of these companies own multiple projects. 

As a result of this government focus, the number of projects under them went up, but there continue to remain problems with one project on acquisition, another on financial closure and yet, another on less than projected traffic growth with one project on debt equity ratio having gone skewed. As a whole, the holding company or the main ownership company of these projects did not improve its financials as much as it could. 

Of course, there has been a significant reduction in the overall debt by all these companies, but that resulted in no return coming to the shareholders. That is why I continue to remain doubtful on returns coming in from infrastructure or investment related sectors or stocks. 

The only space where I think the return can continue to come in is cement. We have already seen the performance coming in in terms of financial performance as well as stock performance especially the large cap companies. It is time for the midcap investments in the overall as a strategy. Within that midcap cement is something which is where I think the return can come in going forward.


What is the outlook on pharma? I have been finding it difficult to be able to predict the developments in the pharma space. After continued up down, the sector has been an underperformer for almost close to four years now. It will continue to remain that way. There are a lot of variables, a lot of factors affecting it, we all know USFDA continues to be an issue that will be the way the life will be with the pharma sector and pharma companies going forward. Again the growth challenges, especially in the US market (which used to be a major market), continues to be there and so has become the case in the domestic market as well. 

It is difficult now with the government having come back, will it focus on its earlier policy of focussing on generics and all that which had reduced in the last two years of the previous regime? If yes, that can be the other challenge. 
Again unlike a lot of other sectors, en-block outperformance or underperformance has not been the case with the pharma. So, it is all the more difficult to take a call. There are some specific companies which sharply outperformed over the last one, one and a half years and the others sharply underperformed. 

It will continue to be difficult for me to be able to predict and as a result I would probably stay away. But at the same time, there are other investment opportunities available. Were they not available, I would have probably tried to apply my mind more into the pharma sector.


Purely from an election standpoint, do you concur that power utilities like NTPC, Power Grid and some of the quality banks are spaces to remain invested in?Both are completely different sectors in terms of their approach and financial parameters and so I will talk about them separately. The power utilities like NHPC and Power Grid have been massive underperformers over the years. I am not talking about over 10-year period. Some other utilities like Tata Power have also been massive underperformers but these are the best traders’ friends. 

For long-term investors, it is a destruction of value, the stocks have not given any return and will not give any return. Also from the point of view of the fact that the government policies regarding that keep changing depending on the larger need of the populace and that’s how it should be. When it comes to investments, I do not think utilities is a space to invest in for medium or long- term investors. 

Moving on to banks, that is where we will continue to see good growth coming in, going forward based on all the developments that have been happening over the last few years. 

The NPA challenges, the NCLTs, the insolvency code and all that because of government continuity, will continue to take shape going forward and will give a lot of support. In addition because the NPA issue has been tackled by the banks, they have been able to focus on growth for the last three or four quarters. As a result, we will continue to see some good numbers coming in from there. 

Also if we continue to see inflows, particularly from overseas, those will first go to the largecap spaces, liquid spaces, liquid and high float norm assets and that is where these private sector corporate banks will come in again.

Within banks, although we have seen a good rally coming in public sector banks after the exit poll and then yesterday’s results, I do not think that is going to be sustainable. 

The government is rightly on its way to restructure the whole public sector banking space, we already saw them clubbing three banks and I think that is a trend that will continue as the government has got a second term. As a result, the investors, are not likely to get any return in the public sector banks. Private sector banks both large as well as mid sized is the space that will continue to give returns.


What about the metal space as a whole? There has been quite a bit of news flow and being a cyclical sector, how do you place your bets within metals?I would avoid it for now. I would prefer to play safe because there is a lack of clarity in terms of the future price movements of the commodities going forward. Also, there are individual issues with a lot of companies in terms of some acquisitions they are trying to do, in terms of some getting sold but the process is not getting concluded. 

Within commodities, cement is one commodity that probably will do well and looks like a good investment opportunity to me. For the last two, three quarters, despite the so-called stress in the economy, cement companies have been reporting a reasonably decent volume growth towards the high single to low double digit that is a trend that will continue. So within commodities, cement is something I will be more positive on instead of metals."

57,2019-05-25,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Brokerages gave a thumbs up to the landslide victory of the Bharatiya Janata Partyled coalition in the just concluded general elections. The government’s focus should now be on affordable housing, removing distress in rural economy, crisis in the NBFC space and recapitalising public sector banks. Some brokerages, however, believe despite the decisive victory, global concerns such as the US-China trade war and expensive valuation could limit the upside in the market. ET takes a look at brokerage commentary after NDA’s election victory.


Bank of America Merrill Lynch
BofAML said the upcoming Union Budget in July is likely to adopt fiscal deficit at 3.4 per cent of the GDP, which was the target set in the interim budget earlier this year. The bank expects the government to focus on lowering lending rates and recaptalising PSU banks with excess RBI economic capital. Political stability also opens the scope for raising foreign exchange reserves via sovereign FX bonds, the bank said.


CLSA
CLSA said that an absolute majority for the BJP would reduce the need for competitive populism though some near term pro-farmer announcements are likely. CLSA expects a further push for affordable housing. Potential policy rate cut and a market-friendly ministerial council could be the next market trigger, said CLSA. However, external factors such as the US-China trade war and rich valuations would mean limited foreign flows, which could cap market returns to single digits, said CLSA. The brokerage's top stock picks include Aditya Birla Fashion, Godrej Properties, Havells, Lemon Tree, NCC, Ramco Cements, Sadbhav Engineering and Sobha.


Credit Suisse
Economic slowdown, NBFC stress and global risks should now be the front and centre of the markets, said Credit Suisse. The firm expects the government to prioritise judicial reforms, direct tax reforms, administrative changes, more PSU bank mergers, continued infrastructure spending and move forward on labour law simplification. With the economic slowdown not yet sharp, an intervention from the government to support growth is unlikely, it said. The brokerage is overweight on banks, including SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and utilities like NTPC and Power Grid.




Elara Securities
The government should focus on eradicating farm distress, which is its biggest challenge now, said Ravi Muthukrishnan, head of institutional research at Elara Securities. The government should prop up consumption, especially discretionary consumption, he said. NCLT issues need to be resolved and PSU banks need to be capitalised to spur credit growth. The government needs to do it in such a way that fiscal deficit does not go beyond control, said Muthukrishnan.


ICICI Securities
The government needs to focus on the current situation in the economy, particularly the mini-crisis in the NBFC sector and recapitalisation of PSU banks, said Piyush Garg, CIO, ICICI Securities. Any laxity on the fiscal front will have medium-term implications on the other macro factors, added Garg. The government needs to focus on the issues in the NBFC sector and PSU banks going forward rather than big-bang reforms, he added.


Morgan Stanley
Morgan Stanley expects the inflation framework, fiscal consolidation, infrastructure spending, FDI focus and strong external affairs policies to continue. The firm said new administration may bring some changes such as increasing cash transfers to the poor, more emphasis on portfolio flows, focus on India's external trade and social & constitutional reforms. The firm sees the market focus shifting to the growth cycle and domestic flows returning with strength. Morgan Stanley has set a June 2020 target for Sensex at 45,000. Apollo Hospitals, AU Small Finance Bank, Chalet Hotels, Edelweiss Financial, Gujarat Gas, Indian Hotels, Jindal Steel, Just Dial, Oberoi Reality, Sobha are its top stock ideas.


Nomura
Unlike the BJP's first term, where prudence came at the cost of growth, policy priority in the second term will be to reignite growth with prudence as secondary priority, said Nomura. The brokerage expects a mix of rural reflationary policies, infrastructure spending, tax simplification and social investment. Reforms to ease of doing business are also likely, said Nomura. The brokerage expects the government to retain its interim budget fiscal target of 3.4 per cent of GDP for the current fiscal. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Container Corporation, L&T and SBI Life its top picks."
58,2019-05-26,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Despite strong volatility, domestic equities logged solid gains during the week gone by as a majority verdict for the Narendra Modi-led NDA infused bullish sentiment in the market. 

Analysts said investors, who were staying away from the market due to uncertainty in the runup to the general election, are coming to the market now.

For the week gone by, headline indices Sensex and Nifty jumped 4 per cent.

The coming week may see more volatility due to the expiry of May series futures & options contracts. Analysts are advising investors to go for contrarian bets as the market may now start reacting to macroeconomic numbers, corporate earnings and global cues.

“When corporate or election results are as per market expectations, it is pointless to act on information that is already known to all. Everything has been already discounted for and, therefore, taking a contrarian bet could be far more profitable than going with the consensus,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote.

Let's take a look at that factors that will influence market mood during the coming week:


F&O contracts expire on Thursday
The market may experience bouts of volatility as the May series futures & options contracts expire on Thursday and participants will roll over their positions to the June series. 


Buzz around Cabinet formation
The new Cabinet is to take shape in the next few days and even if it is too early to expect any policy announcement, the market will keep a close eye on the development.


Flow of foreign money
The flow of foreign portfolio investments will remain an important factor for the market. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net buyers in the market, putting in Rs 2,026.33 crore on Friday, NSE data showed. So far in May, FPIs pulled out Rs 2,093 crore, data available with NSDL showed.


Fourth quarter GDP print
All eyes will be on India's fourth quarter GDP print, expected on Friday. The country's GDP growth slipped to 6.6 per cent in third quarter of FY19. The economy had grown 7.1 per cent in the second quarter and 8.2 per cent in the first quarter, logging 7.6 per cent for the first half.


Fiscal deficit, infra output data
The fiscal deficit numbers and infrastructure output for April will be released on Friday. Both are significant macroeconomic data that can give an idea on the country's economic health.


March quarter earnings
Fourth quarter earnings season is at its end. NTPC, Adani Ports, GAIL, IndiGo, Zee Entertainment, PNB, Sun Pharma, Coal India and Power Grid Corporation are scheduled to come out with their March quarter numbers during the coming week. 


Global macro
Bank of Japan's core CPI, China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI (May), Japan's industrial production data (April) and personal spending and income data of the US for April are among the key global macro numbers scheduled to be released during the coming week.


Technical outlook
Last week, Nifty formed a bullish gap-up candle on the weekly chart, indicating that the bulls are holding a tight grip on the market. However, analysts see downward pressure too. If Nifty trades above 11,859, at least for the first one hour on Monday, it can extend its strength towards 11,955 level, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in."

Post poll euphoria, market will consolidate and shift focus towards macro data, onset of monsoon, RBI monetary policy and Union budget.

Factors that pulled Dalal Street down:


Weakness in global markets
With no signs of Sino-US trade tensions easing and fears of an Italy-European Union confrontation growing again, the global bond rally accelerated, as investors dumped shares and scurried for the safety of German and US government debt.

European shares opened lower, with pan-European share benchmark losing 1.3 per cent. Wall Street was set to open on a weak note, with S&P500 futures down half a per cent.

Data suggests market-wide F&O rollovers till Tuesday stood at 48 per cent. Nifty rollover till Tuesday stood at 42 per cent, which were marginally lower than average rollover of 45 per cent seen in the last three series.


Rupee trades lower
The domestic currency weakened against the dollar, slipping almost 31 paise to hit a low of 69.99. Besides, strength in dollar against some major rival currencies, foreign fund outflows and heavy selling in domestic equities also kept pressure on the rupee, dealers said.


Expert take:

Mr Market is dragging its feet without any specific direction. The mood is lacklustre more so because we recently experienced a phase of very high volatility due to the elections. The RBI policy next week can invigorate stocks, but till then it could be a compulsory vacation time for traders. Today, certain stocks experienced movement due to the results, but in general decline can be attributed to the correction phase post the inflated levels- Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities"

77,2019-05-30,PowerGrid,"Absolutely. I am more a believer of multicap approach but SIPs are always welcome. In fact, SIPs are meant to be for lean periods like this, said Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, said in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Would cement and road makers be the first beneficiary of any uptick in the cycle?Absolutely. A large part of this is led by government spending and as I pointed out, that has slowed down and should probably be reflected in some of the numbers. But that is likely to pick up. 
The surplus balance with RBI is at a record high and that is likely to change. The spending will resume and if you see the manifesto of the NDA, they are talking of some obnoxious number on the infrastructure spending. I think you will probably see some massive privatisation and some other measures to reduce the fiscal stress as well. So that looks to be a safe play. 

Also in cement there are benefits in terms of reduced space cost since it is on a cost to delivery basis, the raw material cost will be benign. This year, about 27 million tonnes of additional capacity is coming in. There have been price hikes across geographies and overall on a 500- million tonne market, you have UltraTech at Rs 150. If you add ACC, Lafarge, Ambuja Group -- that will be another one-third. So, there is a lot of consolidation as well. You will now see both value and volume growth coming in this space. It may not be double digit but could be high single digits growth.


Now: What is your take on some of the auto majors?
The auto sector is not looking good with 10% production cuts for both M&M and Maruti. Also, inventory is still at 40-45 days. I have been speaking to a lot of dealers and some of them happened to be our clients. They have been sending a lot of SOS to the makers. It will take a little time before things really turnaround. M&M’s result was a bit of a mixed bag with auto segment revenue and margins holding up on back of two-three launches especially the Marazzo and the couple of the XUV300 and some of the others. 

The farm equipment side and the tractor side is where you saw the decline both in revenue as well as margins and the guidance also was a little muted. My sense is that one can gradually accumulate them on dips. The risk reward, even the downside looks limited to me because a lot of pain is in the price. M&M has seen an almost 30% price correction, as it is trading at reasonable valuations and there are not enough plays. So, there are already talks of government having an exclusive agriculture ministry. 

I was reading some data that 58% of the farm loan waivers are yet to be actioned and that will infuse a lot of rural liquidity. The RBI is maintaining cash surpluses. So, a lot of non-discretionary spending will pick up. Once liquidity returns, once the NBFC credit crunch fades away, the interest rate transmission happens, gradually it will pick up. But maybe that is one or two quarters away. Meanwhile, one can buy on dips. 

Immediately one can look at two-wheelers. Bajaj Auto looks attractive. It is gaining market share. More than 50% is due to export, there is a three-wheeler which comes in. So you can start with maybe two-wheelers first and then look at accumulating M&M and Marutis of the world on further declines.


You would not stretch your list of the private banks to Yes Bank, would you?
There are more skeletons there which are likely to come out. There is a lot of exposure to the ADAG Group. There is a significant unsecured and project finance book. You will see more provisioning in the coming two quarters. I agree the price points are pretty attractive but you can look at much better places like SBI. The consumer loan book is only 32% of the overall book. The CEO is already talking of 11-12% growth by acquiring some NBFCs portfolio. Even the private banks are being very cautious, especially when it comes to both SMEs and on corporate advances,

What CIBIL did to retail ending is what insolvency and IBC would do to corporate lending. I think there are better plays available at less than two books and we are not even discussing the recoveries which will come from the large accounts. They are at a very advanced stage. The credit cost is likely to come down, the provisioning is almost more than 70% up and you can target an increase in ROA and ROE. There are better plays and last one year ICICI and Axis have actually returned more than 50%.


Are you beginning to hunt within mid and smallcaps?
We have a more multi-cap approach, not to bias towards any particular market cap. We also have to take into account the liquidity which will chase some of the names. Globally we are already witnessing a bond rally with the US 10-year. If you remember last year, it went above 3%. We are already talking of 225-230 levels. The German and the Japanese 10-years have slipped into negative territory. We saw the Chinese PBOC yesterday infusing $36 billion through open market operations. 

I think RBI is likely to inject liquidity in the upcoming MPC on 5th and 6th of June. So, liquidity will come and once the liquidity eases, it is the front line names it will chase more. I will be happy even accumulating an ICICI Bank and I do not mind putting up an RBL Bank as well. So, I will be market cap agnostic but the mid and small cap space with both time and price correction, is not looking as wobbly as it used to be. 

There are few opportunities even in midcap space. There are some niche consumption plays which are looking very good. We saw for example TTK Prestige report very good set of numbers and the price it down more than 20%.

Is it the correct time to start SIP in a good active midcap fund for a period of three, four, five years?
Gurmeet Chadha: Absolutely. I am more a believer of multicap approach but SIPs are always welcome. In fact, SIPs are meant to be for lean periods like this and that is when you get more units. Lot of fund managers have been cherry picking. The net flows remain good. There has been Rs 8,000 odd crore kind of inflow in SIP. A large part of this comes in the small and midcap space because outperformance before the correction came, was largely in the small and midcap funds only. So liquidity courtesy SIP flows, also gives you a cushion to buy more on these declines and get the favourable price points.


What about ONGC? Any thoughts on the stock fundamentals?
 It’s an avoid for me, There are a couple of PSU names which have shown better earnings. If one has to go into PSUs with a tactical view, you are better off with Power Grid. Their work in hand bidding is almost at about Rs 18,000 crore worth of projects, their order book stands at about Rs 60,000 crore. So that looks good in light of heightened power demand. PFC grew their advances by 12-13% and I was surprised to see the cost of funds coming down by 10 bps. It seems there will be some synergy with the REC merger. If you want to play some of the PSU names, there is SBI. Being tactical is probably a better way to play. A retail investor could buy some of the PSU ETFs which keep coming which the government gives at a discount in terms of getting their privatisation and disinvestment targets in place. so That is a better way to play them.

Infrastructure is the other key flavour of the moment. Give some of the names you would look at there.
 Gurmeet Chadha: It is a broad sector. We are looking at some of the capital good makers like L&T. Last financial year, they not only met the guidance but in fact raised the guidance and if you break up the order book segment wise, it gives you further confidence. 

Their focus on giving up non-core business stays. The margins have improved. I am very positive on L&T. In fact, the stock has seen quite a nice upmove in the last couple of weeks. Cement looks very good. I am of the opinion that cement upcycle has begun. A pan-India play through UltraTech could be a good play. You can also look at some geography specific plays like Shree Cement and Ramco down south. 

So cement and maybe a couple of road makers as well."

0,2019-06-02,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: In a move to sharpen accountability and bring stability to internet services in rural area, BBNL is planning to take over operations and maintenance work of optical fibre-based infrastructure being laid under BharatNet project, a top official said.

""In events when my system is down, I am dependent on BSNL at present. Entire maintenance of fibre under BharatNet is done by BSNL. We are in the process of taking over maintenance of incremental fibre that we have laid. We have moved to USOF (universal service obligation fund) and asked for permission,"" BBNL Chairman and MD Sarvesh Singh told PTI.

Bharat Broadband Nigam Limited (BBNL) had allocated around 70 per cent of rural broadband network roll-out work to BSNL and about 15 per cent of work to Railtel and Powergrid each.

BBNL utilised existing 2 lakh kilometer of optical fibre of BSNL and laid incremental fibre of around 3 lakh kilometer to connect over 1.27 lakh gram panchayats (GPs) with high speed broadband network.

The project, which started in 2011, has missed several deadlines to connect 2.5 lakh panchayats. The last deadline was March 2019.

While 1.19 lakh GPs have been service ready, often most of the network have been found to be non-functional.

BSNL has onus of preventive and corrective maintenance of the optical fibre portion connecting gram panchayats but the responsibility of remaining network elements lay with other agencies. Due to this multi-vendor system and lack of mechanism to precisely locate fault, BharatNet network suffers in most of the GPs.

""We have hired 800 people on contract to maintain the network,"" Singh said.

BBNL has completed network rollout in 1.25 lakh GPs under phase 1 in December 2018.

Singh said that BBNL's priority is to complete roll out of broadband services in rest of 1.25 lakh panchayats at the earliest and then start laying entire fibre infrastructure on its own in the third phase.

""Our objective is to build infrastructure, we are still at 45 per cent level. We have to reach 2.5 lakh. First we want to complete the work,"" Singh said.

In phase 2, BBNL has partnered with eight states - Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Telangana, who will roll out broadband network in rural area on their own.

""Around 50 per cent of GPs are with states where they will roll out broadband network, 33 per cent is with BSNL. We have approved contract of BSNL for around of half of GPs to be covered by it and will seek resubmission of detailed project report for the remaining,"" Singh said.

He said that the project has been delayed mainly because of right of way issue across states and mostly in forest area.

""Right of way have been resolved to large extent with states coming on board. We now expect expeditious roll out of BharatNet,"" Singh said."

4,2019-06-04,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government will try to introduce the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill in the forthcoming session of Parliament, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said Tuesday.

The bill, pending approval from the Rajya Sabha, lapsed after the 16th Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die in February.

""The cabinet note is ready for the Motor Bill and once it is approved we will try to introduce it in the upcoming session of Parliament,"" Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said.

Gadkari, who took charge of the Ministry this morning, told reporters that radical reforms are expected in the transport sector once the bill gets Parliament nod.

The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, which had been passed by the Lok Sabha, was introduced in the Upper House in April 2017 but was referred to a select panel.

After taking into account the panel's recommendation, the bill was re-introduced in the Rajya Sabha but the debate on the bill remained inconclusive.

The bill proposes hefty penalties for various offences pertaining to the road transport sector.

Talking about the projects with the Ministry, Gadkari said by March next year, route to Kailash Mansarovar via Pithoragarh is likely to be completed while projects under Char Dham Yatra would be expedited.

He said to reduce accidents at 8,000 black spots - accident-prone areas - have been identified and will be rectified.

He said a road grid and a water grid on the pattern of power grid were also on the anvil and completion of various projects to decongest Delhi will ensure that the national capital is free from vehicular pollution in the next two years.

He said highway projects worth Rs 50,000 crore are in the pipeline for Delhi alone.

The road building pace is likely to reach 32 km a day soon, he said and added that most of the stuck projects have been rolled out."

6,2019-06-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: A go getter in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, Union Minister Nitin Jairam Gadkari in his second innings has lined up big plans -- from infusing Rs 15 lakh crore in highways to propelling GDP growth by globalising khadi and MSME products.

After taking charge of Road Transport and Highways and Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) ministry, Gadkari in his first interview to PTI, said the mission ahead was to further propel country's economic growth through concerted efforts be it in highways or MSME.

""The blue print for highways is already in place. We plan to take up work worth at least Rs 15 lakh crore in highways that includes building 22 green expressways, rolling out all stuck projects in the next 100 days and creating a 'grid of roads' at par with power grid,"" Gadkari told PTI in an interview here Wednesday.

The Minister said during his previous tenure, his ministries -- Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, Ganga Rejuvenation and River development -- in a cumulative basis, had seen a spend of Rs 17 lakh crore that included Rs 11 lakh crore in highways sector alone.

Referring to the momentous victory of BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gadkari said the resounding mandate by the people rising above petty party-politics, caste-creed or communalism has reaffirmed that people need ""development"" which will remain a priority area.

Through demonetisation, the message has gone clear to the people that Modi-led government is against corruption and black money and all initiatives whether welfare schemes, houses, gas, electricity or health insurance have benefitted the poor, he said.

The minister said that the priority for him will be ""rolling out all stuck highway projects that include many of the IL&FS projects within 100 days"".

""I reviewed projects yesterday and found out about 225 projects were pending for financial closure etc, which has been resolved and now only about 20-25 projects are left. This is a priority area and the pending projects will be zero within 100 days,"" the minister said.

He said credit goes to his Ministry for saving Indian banks a whopping sum of over Rs 3 lakh crore from turning NPAs during his earlier tenure, as there were 403 stuck projects when he had taken charge in 2014.

""The bidders were shying away from highways projects... Highways sector had collapsed... Now that it has been brought on track the aim is to further strengthen this.""

""Around 13 out of 17 highways stretches in the border areas that will double up as air strips are nearing completion. Delhi-Meerut Expressway will be completed in the next two months and work is in full swing on the New Delhi-Mumbai expressway,"" the minister said.

Gadkari said he was ""satisfied"" with the work done in highways in the last five years with ""no instance of corruption"" and added that the roadmap ahead was to take the highway building target to 40 km a day as it was nearing 32 km per day now.

Despite a huge Rs 11 lakh crore work done by the ministry, ""not a single penny was involved in corruption"", as the tender and all award processes were placed online, he said.

Gadkari said, task ahead was minimising accidents and in addition to about 704 black spots another 8,000 have been identified and will be rectified soon.

The Ministry is also striving to get the entire toll income which at present goes to the government kitty, so that it could be pumped in highway building, he said.

Build, operate and toll (BOT) mode of highways building was being revived and projects worth 3,000 km would be bid out.

The Minister said, there was significant development in the Kailash Mansarovar route through Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand which is likely to be completed early next year.

Besides, Chardham project linking Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri will be completed by the year-end as all green clearances were in place, he said.

About his new Ministry MSME, the senior BJP leader said his endeavour would be to globalise MSME and Khadi products through joint ventures and he was specially keen on mass-scale honey production besides promoting products like Moringa which are globally much in demand.

The focus will be rural areas, and forming clusters of potters, people dependent on leather industries and giving them assistance with new technology aimed at promoting export of these products, he said.

Citing the example of coir, he said small scale industries will be promoted, and noted that the the plan is to make coir industry a Rs 20,000 crore economy from the present Rs 10,000 crore.

""I am confident that these are going to create huge employment and propel GDP growth which will apparently be visible in next two to three years,"" he said.

Khadi will be another thriving area, he said.

Gadkari is known for his penchant for out of box solutions to economic governance issues and the allotment of the MSME to him is significant in view of its potential not yet being realised.

MSMEs contributes around 45 per cent in the country's exports, about 25 per cent to the GDP from service activities and over 33 per cent to the manufacturing output of India."
5,2019-06-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government has connected 1.19 lakh village blocks in the first phase of its ambitious BharatNet program, the top official overseeing its implementation said.

BharatNet, a digital connectivity initiative launched by the UPA government in 2011, is aimed at linking 2.5 lakh village blocks encompassing more than 6 lakh villages for seamless delivery of citizen-centric services.

The target to complete the program, which missed several deadlines, was March this year. This has escalated costs to Rs 70,000 crore from an estimated to cost Rs. 20,000 crore earlier.

“1.19 lakh gram panchayats have become service-ready, while 95% of BharatNet-I has been completed so far,” Sarvesh Singh, the chairman of Bharat Broadband Network Ltd, a special purpose vehicle set up for the purpose, told ET.

He said the focus currently was on infrastructure expansion, while attributing the delay in rollout to several issues such as right-of-way challenges across states, including forest areas.

“Operations and maintenance is an integral part, and it has transformed the infrastructure program into a network project,” Singh said.

In BharatNet phase-II, 1.25 lakh village blocks are targeted for linkage.

Bihar and Punjab are implementing phase-II, while the detailed project reports for Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, prepared by the Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), would be accepted soon, Singh said.

Under phase II, 40% of DPRs have not yet been approved. As many as eight states, including Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha and Telangana, are implementing the program on their own.

BBNL plans to give 33%, or 40,000 blocks, to state-controlled Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) to deploy a fibre-based broadband network. BSNL’s DPRs for the second phase are being considered, Singh said.

BBNL plans to take forward fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) and Wi-Fi services, and is currently sharing revenue with BSNL in a 30:70 ratio, he said.

It has also enrolled 800 field network engineers for the BharatNet program."
8,2019-06-06,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets started on a cautious note on Thursday, with benchmark index Nifty slipping below the 12,000-mark ahead of RBI monetary policy outcome. The sentiment soured on the back of weak global cues.

Bank and financial stocks were the major index drags.

Global markets were weak as Asian shares got off to a hesitant start on Thursday as investors feared a looming US trade war with Mexico would further depress global growth. Japan's Nikkei dithered either side of flat, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 eased 0.1 per cent. 

The rupee too opened on a weak note. It depreciated by 13 paise to 69.38 against the US dollar.

Oil prices were at over 4-month low on rising US supply and demand fears and failed to lift Street mood.

At around 9:30 am, the 30-pack Sensex traded 28 points or 0.07 per cent down at 40,055. NSE Nifty lost 25 points or 0.21 per cent to 11,997.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) plunged as much as 15 per cent to Rs 94.90 in early deals on Thursday after many rating agencies downgraded the commercial papers (CP) issued by the debt-laden company to default.

Among Nifty stocks, 23 advanced while 27 declined. Meanwhile, in the Sensex pack, 14 stocks were in the black and 16 in the red.

Power Grid was the biggest Sensex gainer, up around 1.61 per cent. Other gainers were -- HUL, Bajaj Auto, Coal India, HDFC Bank and Asian Paints.

YES Bank, on the other hand, shed the most followed by SBI, IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, M&M and HeroMoto Corp.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap logged losses, falling down 0.50 per cent and 0.38 per cent respectively. 

In the sectoral space, barring consumer durables and power all sectors were in the red. BSE Utilities was the biggest loser, down 1.26 per cent.

Meanwhile, analysts said RBI is all set to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points. “The MPC in its last meeting has stated that the price stability has been achieved and has shifted focus to growth. With inflation continuing to provide room and output gap opening up further, there is a compelling case for rate cut,” Edelweiss said in a note."

14,2019-06-06,PowerGrid,"The BSE benchmark Sensex plunged 554 points Thursday, dragged down by losses in banking, energy and capital goods stocks even as the RBI cut the policy rate to shore up growth. Slashing benchmark lending rate for the third time this year, the central bank cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent and changed its monetary policy stance from 'neutral' to 'accommodative'. 

 The RBI, however, lowered the economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7 per cent due to slowdown in domestic activities and escalation in global trade war. 

 Following the announcement, the 30-share index cracked 553.82 points, or 1.38 per cent, to settle at 39,529.72. The bourse hit an intra-day low of 39,481.15 and a high of 40,159.26. 

 In similar movement, the NSE Nifty plunged 177.90 points, or 1.48 per cent, to end at 11,843.75. During the day, it hit a low of 11,830.25 and high of 12,039.80. 

 Top losers in the Sensex pack included IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, SBI, L&T, Tata Steel, M&M, Bajaj Finance, Vedanta, Tata Motors and RIL, tumbling up to 6.97 per cent. 

 Bucking the negative market trend, Coal India, PowerGrid, NTPC, HUL, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints and Infosys gained up to 1.92 per cent. 

 ""The rate cut could not infuse positivity, and the decline steepened as focus shifted from policy rates to new emerging short-term tight liquidity situation due to issues like IL&FS, DHFL and its impending impact on other financial institutions if any,"" said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) - AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers. 

 Lowered GDP forecast for current year and failure to get any cue from RBI on the liquidity front except general assurance of addressing the situation added to the selling pressure later in the day, he added. 

 The Indian rupee fell marginally to 69.28 against the US dollar. 

 Meanwhile, other Asian bourses ended on a mixed note, while Europe was trading in the green in opening deals. 

 Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.76 per cent to 61.09 per barrel."
13,2019-06-06,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: A slowdown in economic growth had led to Dalal Street already pricing in a 25-basis point cut in repo rate and a change in stance was also not ruled out. But on Thursday when RBI moved along the expected lines, concerns over growth and liquidity overshadowed the rate cut, so much so that benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty logged biggest one-day fall of 2019.

BSE barometer Sensex slipped 554 points or 1.38 per cent to 39,530. NSE Nifty settled at 11,844, down 178 points or 1.48 per cent.

The MPC voted unanimously in favour of a rate cut and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that a rate hike was off the table for now.

Bank, financials along with index heavyweight RIL were the cause behind market's decline. For every one stock that gained on BSE, three declined.

Besides, Donald Trump's fresh threat of tariffs on China further soured the already weak global market sentiment.


Market at a glance
Among Sensex stocks, eight settled in the black and 22 in the red. IndusInd Bank, YES Bank, SBI, L&T, Tata Steel and M&M were the top losers, shedding up to 7 per cent.

Coal India, on the other hand, rose 1.92 per cent to top the leaderboard. Power Grid, HUL, Hero MotoCorp and NTPC were among other gainers.

All sectors on BSE ended in the red. Oil & Gas was the worst performing sector, with GAIL as the top drag. Capital Goods, Bankex, Financials and Industrials were other sectors that put on a weak show, falling over 2 per cent each.

Midcaps and smallcaps fell in line with Sensex. BSE Midcap shed 1.77 per cent and BSE Smallcap 1.60 per cent.

DHFL shares tanked to end 15.86 per cent lower after rating agencies downgraded the commercial papers (CP) issued by the debt-laden company to ‘default’ grade.


Factors that weighed on the market:

Liquidity remains a concernRBI didn’t have much to say on addressing the liquidity crisis, which killed market enthusiasm. RBI, analysts said, failed to assuage investor concerns over NBFCs a day after DHFL’s failure to pay interest on NCDs led to its downgrade to ‘default’ status by three rating agencies

Governor Das during media interaction said liquidity -- where a deficit had been bothering the financial system for nearly a year -- is in surplus now, and he vowed to ensure there is enough liquidity for every productive purpose.


Revision of GDP forecastAssuming more headwinds, the Reserve Bank of India narrowed down its GDP forecast for the current fiscal to 7 per cent from 7.2 per cent. It can be noted that that FY19 ended with a lower than estimated 6.8 percent, as the fourth quarter GDP came in at a five-year low of 5.8 per cent.


Trump's trade war saga continuesUS President Donald Trump threatened to hit China with tariffs on “at least” another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, but said he thought both China and Mexico wanted to make deals in their trade disputes with the United States. China's major stock indexes fell to close at near four-month lows while pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.6 per cent.


Expert Take
A possible reason of the fall could also be that there was no mention in the policy about addressing the liquidity stress in the NBFC space. With recent news around DHFL and the possible contagion effect, several financials corrected heavily today. However, I believe that market will soon take cognizance of the change in policy stance to accommodative and LAF liquidity turning surplus. This dovish policy opens the doors to another rate cut in 2019- Amar Ambani, President & Research Head, YES Securities"

17,2019-06-07,PowerGrid,"Half of India’s problems come from huge profiteering by a protected sector of banks under the RBI umbrella. You link all the loans to RBI repo rate and you will see the economic growth going up, says Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance. The only place fully invested in right now is PSUs and banks. Like Shylock, banks make money and therefore we will invest in Shylocks.  Edited excerpts: 


Are you bullish, are you bearish? How are you feeling about the market?I would say it is an excellent market. Markets are looking good because even the correction yesterday came at the back of a 1000-point-odd rally and it is normal if you are a market operator that you will create some short positions and you will sell out at this kind of a rally. This rally is based on liquidity and if you are a decent trader or investor, you will know that there will be bad days in the market in terms of liquidity and in terms of news flow. Yesterday apparently both happened at the same time. 

RBI never came up with anything on NBFCs and the FIIs sold in the afternoon. It was a pretty potent mixture. If you are in a rally which is not based on fundamentals, which is based on pure liquidity, the way it is today, then you will have to go through this good and bad days and that is the good part of it. 

Now the next part is what are we doing? What we are doing is taking cues from what is happening in politics, the new Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, taking cues to believe in our belief that this five-year term will be the term of the PSU stocks, they will be sold. I think the companies will be sold. First the industrial companies, then the banking sector will be put under the sale banner. We are positioned pretty strongly with large allocations to PSU companies, which has done reasonably well so far. They should do pretty good in the times to come, either in terms of a sale and value which is pretty cheap or in terms of dividend. Whichever way, I will not complain.


First privatisation will happen. You say first industrials and then banks and then non-core businesses. By now, you must have your list ready also?Yes, the power sector is straight away on top of the agenda that will be privatised first in our view because there is global demand for utilities as companies. It is a huge demand from pension funds, etc, who want to invest in fixed income utilities equivalent and therefore we believe that the easiest ones to park out could be the power companies and all the power companies -- luckily in Indian context, the PSUs -- are profitable. They are not very badly leveraged. This quarter’s performance has been good across the board. The block of companies involved in the power sector would be the first to go because they can be easily sold as global capital likes these kind of companies. And it does not have too many linkages with the government. Of course they need to sort out issues of Discom, etc. But I am sure they can do that. The set of power companies should be the first to go.


Are there any specific companies that you are thinking of? You have actually seen a pretty strong exposure there. Would you recommend investors to get into some of these names in anticipation of privatisation?I cannot recommend any cases for regulatory reasons. I am not here to recommend. But I can only tell you that we have positioned ourselves pretty strongly in things like transmission, which is Power Grid, at this point of time. It is the number one holding and then we have gone into Power Finance which is linked to Power Grid and the power sector. Then, of course, there is NTPC and BHEL down the line. It is a whole gamut of companies. There are not too many luckily and so it is not too difficult to pick and choose what you want but I believe that the transmission companies, like Power Grid, etc, have the best chances and best value because they are into serious annuity income business and they cannot be duplicated easily. They got a monopoly status. If somebody is buying them, I think there will be a reasonable chance of annuity income. 

Of course, you can have a surprise in transmission company like GAIL happened yesterday which can bring the price down quite sharply. But I am quite sure that some pitfall will be avoided as the new government steps in. Yesterday GAIL was a misfortune accentuated by market sentiments. I am sure that will not happen. So, you will start from the grid companies to the generation companies and then to the capital equipment would be the last in the hierarchy. 


Do you think now there is enough reason to remain fully invested? You may have an odd bout of volatility -- it could be 5% for largecaps, 15% for midcaps and even higher for smallcaps. Do you think the optimism will be rewarded and one should be fully invested for the course of next one to three years now?That is a difficult question because we have got a cash holding of almost 20% at this point of time because we reasonably believe that the worst is still to come in terms of economic data. Whether it translates to share price, I do not know but it is wise to keep some money on the sides. We wouldn’t recommend to remain 100% invested at this point of time. Since it is a liquidity-driven rally, fundamentals can overwhelm at any point of time and that is when you want to keep some powder dry to go and invest into companies. 

When you are looking into a euphoric market like what it is today, you must have something on the sidelines and corrections will come. Corrections will come. It has nothing to do with India. Its the global flows which make a difference. Oil prices are very benign at this point of time. They may spike up. So investing 100% at this point in an economy which is wobbling so badly, is not a good idea. Whether we will be rewarded in three years timeframe, I am sure we should be rewarded because the question remains that how much worse can it get and the reason I say how worse is because the drought conditions in the country could literally overwhelm the government finances as they try to deal with issues of rural distress, farm distress, provide succour to people. Even water is not easily available. It is not like you give money and say go buy water. The kind of cost involved in getting water to literally a population the size of America is not going to be cheap and that is where the problem lies. It will upset the whole market dynamics for some time to come. May not be three years but certainly the next six months. I would say 20% money on the side is definitely required. You will get lots of chances to buy in this market.



What is your take on an ADAG Group or the Indiabulls Group? Would you be interested in having exposure to these names?Of course not, but having said that, there is demand and enough capital available for promoters to exit a business like real estate in an environment like this today. It is a great news for the capital market that there is enough capital in silos. Number two is disappointment in valuations. It is going at one time book value which really tells me that the business had no premium built into it. To that extent, if you are on fire sale mode, there is enough capital available. 

I do not think it is a good idea to invest in ADAG etc, because it is not only the issue of what is the residual value of the business, but also the regulatory risk of what is happening in those companies, the kind of transactions you already saw in IL&FS, in Jet Airways. The SFIO has walked in. So, some of the companies which had regulatory overhangs will continue to have them for sometimes. It is not a wise thing to start investing in those kind of stocks. 

A speculator can do it, he can sell and buy at 10 paisa difference in a day that is a job of a speculator, not an investor. You get good companies, do not waste your hard-earned money .


In light of the correction that one has seen in ITC, there are lots of rumour doing the rounds that perhaps in the next GST meeting, there is going to be another sin tax coming in and it may be a tobacco tax. What would that would make you a little wary of investments into liquor names or for that matter some of the tobacco names?We have to pare down our holdings. We look at the budget of the government. There is no discretionary money left for for them to spend on any of the schemes they have announced -- be it Ayushman Bharat or PM Kisan. Money has to come from somewhere. The normal sectors of the economy are fully loaded and under the GST council. Now what is left with the government?

Budget has lost relevance because only the GST council decides all the domestic taxes. Only import taxes can be levied by the budget. Therefore, it is logical to assume two things will happen down the line: one, more resources will be required and therefore you can go and tap tobacco and the sin tax. Two, liquor companies have an overhang now with this kind of government majority and the preponderance theme is that we should have prohibition in more states than one,

You could see a lot of pressure coming in the Assembly elections. A local party announcing prohibition in the state, we saw some resonance of that in Telangana. We can see it in the northeast. The liquor companies are going to be pushed against the wall in India in a scenario where there is a demand for prohibition. That should shrink the market or at least make it uncertain. Sin tax, definitely, is on the way in a big way because there is nobody else who can pay the tax. Income tax is over. The GST rates are already much higher. Where do you go for money? Easy money is where the liquor and tobacco is. It is prudent to believe that these will be taxed in a big way, if not this year, but years to come.


This is something which the government is going to take cognisance of. We have seen in the past, cigarette smuggling from neighbouring countries had become a huge menace.In Europe it is. The biggest items being smuggled across from England to France and elsewhere is cigarettes. There is a political dynamics playing out as well and the scramble for resources is a problem. Politicians in the country need money to take distress-alleviation measures in a big way. In the next 12 to 18 months where does the government find the resources? In defence, they have to replace obsolete AN-32s. People in drought ridden states need money. The government needs money. Healthcare for all needs money. 

At the end of the day in an economy growing at 5% and 5.5%, who is going to fund all these plans? Someone should and will and those are the only places that you go to the guy who cannot get out of addiction and buys whatever packet of cigarette at double the price. Maybe he will downgrade perhaps but there is no choice. So economic logic notwithstanding, circumstances will force this at least in the present context of the budget and in the next 12 to 18 months.


So how should we summarise our today’s interaction? You were sounding bullish but yet you are sitting on cash. What does that mean?It is quite simple. You have to wait for the economics to play itself out and this kind of market which runs on liquidity will give you lots of chances to buy into. We get cash because every year most investors generate more, surplus cash income. They have fresh money to invest. It is incremental money coming into the system. Now do I want to deploy it in this market at this stratospheric level? I would say no, definitely not. Am I exiting the market? No. So it is a greed and fear at the same time. I feel there will be enough chances for me to buy in, still I am holding on to the long position in various stocks. 

It is difficult to explain but I would say that in the present state of the economy, there will be lots of chances. We have not seen the end of the economic cycle on the downturn. We will see more of it in the April, May, June quarter and I know lots of brokerages have said 25% growth rate, etc, etc, but that is all bunkum. 

There is no 25% growth any CEO is talking about in this country on earning side. So leave that aside. The only thing where we are fully invested is the banks and the reason I tell you very quickly is because banks are the protected species of India. If you historically write the economic history for the last 10 years, the single reason why India has struggled on growth is that the banks have taken too much off the table in profitability. There is no other reason why bank loans are still not linked to RBI rate, repo rate in the market. The banks have stalled it for some time for a long time now. It was supposed to be on the agenda for last year. There have stalled it. So if you write economic history today, half of India’s problems come from huge profiteering by a protected sector of banks under the RBI umbrella. You link all the loans to RBI repo rate and you see the economic growth going up. 

So the only place we are max invested is banks because it is a protected species, has given fantastic returns, will give more superlative returns because the NBFC imbroglio is going to now give people the only option to go to banks to borrow and they will really be shylocks in the market and like shylocks they make the money and therefore we will invest in shylocks. The only place fully invested in right now is PSUs and banks. We believe that in a lot of other sectors we will get chances to buy at a better price."

19,2019-06-07,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Snapping two-day losses, Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty edged up on recovery in bank and IT stocks amid strong global markets.

However, both Sensex (down 0.25 per cent) and Nifty (down 0.44 per cent) settled the truncated week in the red. 

Markets traded on a volatile note throughout the day on profit-booking in select counters. BSE Sensex settled at 39,616, up 86 points or 0.22 per cent while NSE Nifty 27 points or 0.23 per cent lower at 11,871. 

On BSE, for every five stocks that traded, three ended lower, indicating that the overall sentiment remained bearish.

Global markets were upbeat. Prospects of US Federal Reserve rate cut underscores the concern with which central banks are assessing the global economy, a Reuters report said.


Market at a glance:Among Sensex stocks, where 12 ended in the green and rest in the red, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, M&M, SBI and ICICI Bank led the leaderboard, rising up to 1.90 per cent. 

YES Bank fell 2.37 per cent to Rs 139.95 apiece and witnessed the maximum fall. Power Grid, Coal India, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Auto and ONGC were among other losers.

BSE Midcap (down 0.17 per cent) and BSE Smallcap (down 0.11 per cent) underperformed benchmark Sensex. 

Utilities, power, energy, realty and healthcare were the worst performing indices on BSE, whereas telecom logged the most gains, followed by financials, consumer durables and bankex. 

On Nifty, 29 stocks declined and 21 advanced. India VIX eased 4.89 per cent.


Factors 


Select buying in bankMarket reversed opening losses on account of recovery in baking and financial stocks. Bankex and financials were the top sectoral gainers on BSE. On NSE, as well, private bank and financials indices gained the most. 


Global mood improvesEuropean stocks gained ground on Friday as hopes that central banks would loosen policy offset trade friction and the threat of global recession, putting indexes on track for their best week in two months. Wall Street futures signalled a positive opening for US markets as well. Japan, Australia and South Korea also settled higher.


Expert Take
Ongoing funding challenges faced by NBFCs prompted investors to focus on to select banking stocks while weak rupee add some impetus to IT stocks. The global central bank is moving to a rate cut cycle to combat weaker growth which supported Asian and European markets but trade war concerns continue to limit gains. Investors to remain focused on fresh triggers in the upcoming union budget and US job data to get cues on further direction

20,2019-06-09,PowerGrid,"To further give a push to the country's infrastructure, big plans are lined up that include roping in an advisor for asset monetisation and offering attractive schemes to private players, including identified 3,000 kms of projects, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said. 

 Plans are also afoot to make the vehicle scrapping policy more attractive, besides expediting the land acquisition process to create a network of expressways and highways. 

 ""We are planning to rope in an Indian expert with experience in global economy for advising NHAI on asset monetisation,"" Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari told in an interview. 

 The advisor, apart from asset monetisation, will guide the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on innovative ways to meet funding requirements, he said. 

 After the huge success of the maiden bundle of nine highway projects under TOT (toll, operate and transfer) totalling 681 kms of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat in 2018 that fetched NHAI Rs 9,681 crore, the second tranche of 586 kms was cancelled in February 2019 due to lukewarm response. 

 TOT is a model for monetising operational national highway projects. The investor makes a lumpsum payment in return for long-term toll collection rights backed by a sound tolling system. The concession period is 30 years. 

 Up to 49 per cent divestment is allowed till two years of the concession period while up to 10 per cent change in ownership is allowed after two years. 

 The government now plans to offer 550 km of roads under TOT. 

 Apart from asset monetisation, Gadkari said the government will attract private players into highways building and has already identified 3,000 kms to be bid out under the build operate and transfer (BOT) mode. 

 ""For private sector revival in highways building, we have identified 3,000 kms of highways that have 17,000 pcu (passenger car unit) traffic. We plan to bid this out under BOT mode,"" the minister said. 

 Ratings agency Crisil in a recent report said to reinvigorate private sector interest, the government has resorted to HAM (hybrid annuity mode) and BOT which will ensure putting public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the roads and highways sector back on track. 

 On the vehicle scrapping policy, the minister said it would be made more attractive with suggestions from the Finance Ministry and the PMO. 

 The policy aims to pave the way for mandatory scrapping of old vehicles from April 1, 2020. 

 In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road. 

 A committee of secretaries (CoS) had recommended to the ministry redesigning of the scheme for greater participation of states with partial support from the Centre. 

 The CoS suggested that the ""scheme may dovetail a calibrated and phased regulatory approach for capping the life of vehicles together with stricter implementation of emission norms"" and accordingly a revised consultation paper got in-principle nod from the PMO. 

 About other plans, the minister said the land acquisition process has been expedited and it has seen a three-fold jump. 

 ""This will facilitate our plans of fast-tracking projects besides building 22 green expressways,"" he said. 

 The are also plans to create a highways grid on par with the power grid, he said. 

 He said the Delhi-Meerut Expressway is likely to be completed in the next two months. 

 The minister has said there are plans to take up work worth Rs 15 lakh crore in the highways sector over the next five years."

23,2019-06-11,PowerGrid,"Top domestic fund houses took note of the political stability post-election results and lapped up shares in many perceptibly contrarian bets in May, hoping for a recovery in the battered sectors such as telecom, power, pharma and metals.

Select auto ancillary and bank stocks also attracted institutional money during month. 

Total assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry stood at Rs 25.43 lakh crore at the end of May, up from Rs 25.27 lakh crore in April end. 

“As the new government came in with a thumping majority, this along with other positive factors such as low inflation, reasonable balance of payments and good forex reserve will continue to increase inflows,” said NS Venkatesh, Chief Executive Officer at Amfi.

The same optimism is visible also in the way top fund houses bought and sold shares all through the past month.


HDFC Mutual Fund India’s largest money manager held Rs 1.51 lakh crore in equities, with maximum allocations to financials, utilities and industries. 

The fund house added 3 crore shares of government-owned capital goods firm BHEL in a clear bet on public sector capex. Its other top picks included Federal Bank (1 crore shares), Bank of Baroda (94 lakh), DCB Bank (86 lakh) and Power Finance Corporation (70 lakh) – a play on banking revival.

The fund house also added over 10 lakh shares of BPCL, Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Karur Vysya Bank, Hindalco, Lupin and Adani Power. 

Meanwhile, it sold over 1 crore shares each in public sector firms NPTC, SBI and PowerGrid and between 40-90 lakh shares of Orient Cement, HSIL, Petronet LNG, Ambuja Cement, NBCC and ICICI Bank.

The fund house completely exited Havells, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank and Vodafone Idea.


ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund With equity assets in excess of Rs 1.32 lakh crore as of May 31, the fund house wagered on a potential telecom revival, buying 6.12 crore shares of Vodafone Idea and 3.90 crore of Bharti Airtel.

The two telecom operators introduced a ‘minimum recharge’ regimes last month, weeding out low-paying users and increasing average revenue per users (Arpu) in early signs of return of pricing power.

The fund house also bought shares of NTPC (1.52 crore), Motherson Sumi (1.36 crore), Hindalco (87 lakh), HDFC Life (68 lakh), Union Bank (61 lakh), Neyveli Lignite (46 lakh) and Infosys (44 lakh). 

It sold over 75 lakh shares each in public sector companies Coal India, SBI and ONGC.

CIO S Naren told ETMarkets.com last month said he is positive on power, metals, auto ancillaries and telecom. 

He said there is an opportunity to own healthy power franchises, which are pricing in the worries of the sector more than adequately. In the auto ancillary space, valuations have corrected amid concerns over global growth, trade wars and change in emission norms.

He said telecom as the sector is at the bottom of the cycle, while valuations in the metals space look reasonable owing to uncertainties around US-China trade wars and slowdown in China. From a counter-cyclical viewpoint, the sector seems to be at the start of an upward move after a long period of poor returns, he said.


SBI Funds Management The fund house had about Rs 1.62 lakh crore invested in about 318 stocks. It also gambled on telecom, buying over 1 crore shares each in Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.

24,2019-06-12,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government will within this week float two large proposals offering subsidy to states for deployment of 5,000 electric charging stations in cities and highways. This is the pilot electric infrastructure layout plan by the government and aims at promoting India’s plan to shift 40% fleet to battery-operated vehicles. Presently, there are 150 charging stations in India. Setting up stations in cities will be open to all companies while only central utilities will be eligible to deploy such infrastructure on highways.

Two separate expressions of interest for electric vehicle charging infrastructure in cities and on highways will be floated by the department of heavy industries this week, an official said.

For securing subsidy for deployment of charging stations within cities, states through their nodal agencies, mostly electricity distribution companies, will have to submit their proposals to the department.

Interestingly, for setting up electric charging points at highways, proposals can be submitted only by central public sector enterprises. For deployment of charging stations at highways 100% subsidy will be given on cost of charger and transformer, the official said.

The government has de-licensed public charging stations business for electric vehicles enabling individuals to extend such facilities, but at a regulated tariff.

Companies like ABB, Acme Industries, Fortum India and a few Dutch firms are actively considering setting up vehicle charging stations. State-run companies like NTPC, GAIL India, Indian Oil Corp and Power Grid Corp have been exploring diversification into electric vehicle charging infrastructure business.

India has recently approved phase-II of FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India), for a period of three years commencing from April 1, 2019 with total budgetary support of Rs 10,000 crore. The main focus of this phase of the scheme is the electrification of public and shared transportation and laying of electric vehicles charging infrastructure.

The government targets setting up of one charging station every three km in cities and every 25 km on both sides of highways."

The 30-pack index settled at 39,741, down 15 points or 0.04 per cent. NSE’s Nifty, however, managed to shut shop in the black at 11,914, up 8 points or 0.07 per cent.

India VIX eased 3.61 per cent to 13.61.

The fact that buying emerged on declines signalled that the downside remains capped in the current round of consolidation.

Global markets traded mixed, with the Chinese benchmark ending higher even as Nikkei finished in the red. European shares opened lower, but rebounded later.

Crude oil prices jumped as much as 4 per cent after a suspected attack on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of global oil consumption passes, Reuters reported. 

In the Sensex pack, 13 stocks closed in the positive territory with PowerGrid ending as top performer, followed by M&M, Kotak Bank, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance, gaining between 1.54 per cent and 0.93 per cent.

YES Bank slipped as much as 12.39 per cent after UBS cut its target price on the stock to Rs 90 from Rs 170 with a ‘sell’ rating.

Ten of the 19 sectoral indices ended in the red on BSE. Realty, power and finance were among the indices that logged highest gains, while IT, auto and teck indices declined the most. 


Expert Take:
""It was a bleak opening due to a surge in crude oil prices on account of an attack in the Gulf of Oman influenced investors to stay cautious. However, some recovery was seen in quality stocks in banks & IT sectors. Going ahead, Fed policy, GST Council meeting, US-China trade talks and crude price trajectory will give direction to the market.""

27,2019-06-13,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: A clutch of investors including Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Germany’s DEG, International Finance Corporation and Indian group HEG have invested in an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) formed by Delhi-based infrastructure firm Oriental Structural Engineering (OSE), two people familiar with the deal said.

Oriental Infra Trust raised Rs 2,300 crore through an offer of units that opened on June 10. It attracted strong interest from global investors and was over-subscribed, said one of the people, reaffirming investor interest in operational infrastructure assets in India.

OSE, which is the sponsor of the InvIT, will hold 60% of the units.

OSE and DEG declined to comment, while IFC, HEG and AIIB did not respond to emails till press time Wednesday.

Infrastructure trusts, or InvITs, are becoming popular among investors of long-term revenue-generating assets like toll roads and power-transmission projects.

Currently, there are three listed InvITs — IRB InvIT Fund (by IRB Infrastructure Developers), IndiGrid InvIT Fund (Sterlite Power Grid Ventures) and IndInfravit, sponsored by L&T Infrastructure Development Projects. Canada’s Brookfield, which has bought the loss-making East West gas pipeline of Mukesh Ambani for $2 billon, also plans to list it as an InvIT.

Oriental Structural Engineering is engaged in the construction of runways, highways and bridges. It takes up projects under engineering-procurement-construction and build-operate-transfer contracts.

Its InvIT consists of five highways: Nagpur Bypass, Indore-Khalghat (NH3), Etawah-Chakeri (Kanpur), Hungund-Hospet (NH-13) and Nagpur-Betul Highway. These highways have a length of 2,804 lane kms, and their combined revenue was about Rs 1,700 crore in fiscal 2019.

“OSE has another $1 billion of highway assets which are also available to Oriental InvIT for acquisition under the ROFO (right-offirst-offer) agreement. This would lead to an assured 50% increase in the size of Oriental INVIT in the next few years,” said the second person.

EY is the investment banking adviser to the sponsor, while ICICI Securities is the merchant banker in this transaction. Spokespeople for both declined to comment.

InvITs enable a large number of investors to pool their money for investments into infrastructure assets in return for regular dividends. InvITs invest in operational infrastructure assets such as roads, telecommunication towers and power plants.

Since the operating infrastructure assets provide stable and longterm yields under the InvIT structure, global investors have been keen on such entities floated by Indian developers.

Global PE major KKR & Co, along with Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, had picked a large stake in IndiGrid. IndInfravit saw the participation of CPP Investment Board, which had subscribed to 30% of its units for $152 million, and Allianz Capital Partners that acquired 25% of the units for $128 million.

Last month, CPPIB and Piramal Enterprises announced their plan to set up India’s first renewable energy-focused InvIT to raise $600 million and buy operational assets."

37,2019-06-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Losses in private banks and financial stocks dragged domestic benchmark indices lower on Friday. Moreover, elevated crude oil prices and weakness in global markets amid fresh trade war worries also spooked Dalal Street investors.

The rise in crude oil prices sent domestic currency hurtling lower. The rupee lost as much as 27 paise against the US dollar. 

Liquidity concerns in the NBFC sector continued to plague the market. 

BSE Sensex slipped to 39,452, down 289 points or 0.73 per cent. NSE Nifty shed 91 points or 0.76 per cent to shut shop at 11,823. For the week, both Sensex and Nifty settled 0.40 per cent lower. 

The advance-decline ratio stood at 1:2.

The poor sentiment in global equity markets reflected in gold prices, which rose to 14-month high as investors scurried towards safer bets.

BSE Capital Goods was the only sector that ended in the green. Telecom, realty and bankex, on the other hand, shed the most. 


Factors that weighed on the market:

Global stocks stumbleWorld stocks struggled and safe haven bets were back in play on Friday with German bond yields plumbing record lows as Chinese data rekindled woes about the health of the global economy and fears of a new US-Iran confrontation intensified, Reuters reported.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5 per cent, with Germany's trade-sensitive DAX falling 0.6 per cent. US stock futures indicated Wall Street was in line for a lower open, with the S&P e-mini pointing to a 0.2 per cent fall.


Crude oil prices stay elevatedOil fell marginally after sharp gains in the previous session when prices were boosted after attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman stoked concerns of reduced crude flows through one of the world's key shipping routes. Brent crude futures were down 14 cents at $61.17 a barrel, having settled up 2.2% on Thursday.


High valuation, slow economy remain a riskPremium valuation and slowdown economy are other factors that are causing investors to pare their position in this market. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on US Fed meet next week to see if the US central banker would cut rate.

Ripple effect from a weak global markets while premium valuation and slow economy is hurting the market. Continuous exchange of words between the US and Tehran regarding the oil tanker attack, progress of US-China trade-war, Fed policy outcome and progress of monsoon will be closely watched by the investors.

38,2019-06-16,PowerGrid,"Power regulator CERC has allowed state-owned transmission utility Power Grid to offer towers to telecom companies for BTS (base trans-receiver station) installation to improve mobile connectivity, especially in remote rural areas.

The move will not only address the issue of deficiency of telecom coverage in the country, particularly remote areas, but this segment could also be money spinner for Power Grid. Besides, the power distribution utilities will get a share of income, which would eventually reduce tariff burden on consumers.

""....the proposal of the petitioner is not contrary to the provisions of the Act. Accordingly, we allow the proposed business of the Petitioner,"" the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) said in its recent order.

Power Grid had sought the CERC's permission to utilise existing electricity transmission infrastructure for telecommunication purposes.

The power utility had approached the commission to ""engage in other business for optimum utilisation of the assets"".

It submitted said before the CERC that the transmission towers can be used for mounting the telecom antennas and also for mounting the BTS and associated auxiliary power supply equipment for mobile communication by constructing a platform on the transmission line tower itself.

Besides, Power Grid had pleaded that this would also help in providing reliable power supply for operation of BTS equipment from transmission line itself by adopting suitable technologies.

On the revenue sharing, the CERC held, ""Initially, sharing of revenue shall be in the ratio of 50:50 of the net revenue, after deduction of all direct and indirect costs. However, the same shall be reviewed on completion of one year"".

The Power Grid has around 1.5 lakh high voltage transmission towers, which are suitable for installation of mobile antenna/BTS. These transmission line towers are spread across the country and passing through remote/rural areas.

Due to non-availability of reliable power supply in rural area, the operators are dependent on diesel power generators, which has high operational cost as well as carbon footprint.

The availability of power supply is more than 99.5 per cent at Power Grid towers. Therefore, there is no need to install diesel generator sets.

Mobile operators need to incur cost towards land leasing, towers installation etc and also facing local ROW (right of way) issues. To overcome this issue, platform on tower legs will be created for installation of BTS. The platform will be at a height of 7 to 8 metres and therefore, will not be affected by flood etc.

To meet the demand of 4G/5G Data, Power Grid OPGW fibre is running on high voltage lines and fibre connectivity may also be provided for BTS.

This initiative will also aid ""Digital India"" programme of the the government, which envisages universal mobile connectivity."

Nifty can correct and fill the gap created on the Exit Poll outcome day, according technical analysts who advise traders to go long on index puts for June expiry. Power Grid, Reliance and Cummins India are likely to trade with a positive bias and could rally to the tune of over 5 per cent, they said.


Where are We? Markets have gone into a “Traders’ Remorse” after giving the breakout post the Election outcome. Last week remained muted for our markets as the benchmark indices moved within the territory of the penultimate week’s trading range. As a result, we witnessed formation of an ‘Inside Bar’ pattern on weekly chart of both the Nifty and the Sensex. The Nifty remained in a 200 point range throughout the week and posted marginal loss for second consecutive week. For the last three weeks, the index is consolidating in a broader range of 11,770–12,100; but the market breadth remained in favour of declining counters from last 12 sessions, which is a sign of concern for the market. The highest open interest for the Nifty monthly series also shifted lower from 12,500 to 12,000 call options, indicating strong hurdle in the zone of 12,100 – 12,000. On the flipside, 11,500 put options have highest open interest in the monthly series.


What is in Store? The Nifty is currently hovering around the lower end of the consolidation phase, which also coincides with the ‘20 EMA’ on daily time scale. However, we are witnessing formation of a ‘Head and Shoulder’ pattern on daily line chart, which is a reversal bearish pattern. Momentum oscillator ‘RSI’ is confirming a negative divergence on daily chart, indicating possibility of a fall in the coming days. If the Nifty sustains below 11,770, then we may see a corrective move towards the 11,500 mark. The banking index breached its strong support of 30,620 on Friday and managed to close below the same, which doesn’t bode well for the bulls.


What could Investors Do? We have advised traders to go long on Nifty puts for the June expiry and wait for a proper reversal before committing to fresh long positions. Markets can correct and fill the gap that was created on the Exit Poll outcome day. The Nifty has a strong support around 11,300-11,400 and those levels can be a good buying opportunity for long traders who missed the previous rally. We are bullish on PSU banks like State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda (with a 3 month perspective) and advise to accumulate in the current fall."

Where are We? Despite a strong start at the beginning of the month, the index failed to add further gains. The market breadth didn’t mirror the strength as the Nifty has shown in last few of the trading session while it continues to trade sideways with a minor loss. The whole lot of news flow kept market participants baffled despite a consensus for a price correction. Among the sectoral indices, strong underperformance is being witnessed in Nifty pharma, reality and media indices, which have fallen more than 4 per cent. The mid- & small-cap indices also failed to sustain at the intermediate highs and traded lower.


What is in Store? After a prolonged phase of indecision, the Nifty is now trading above the overhead resistance of 11,760 mark. Since the breakout, it’s trading sideways and well above the 50-DMA. However, a sharp reversal on June 6 and successive close below the 12,040 mark indicate short-term underperformance is likely. A breakaway gap with low pivot of 11,590 shall limit the downside. The broader range in the short-term remains in the 11,590-12,040 band.


What could Investors Do? Open interest concentration of both weekly and monthly expiry are at the strike of 12,000 CE, this in turn indicates that market participants expect a limited upside and 12,000 remain a key hurdle in the short term. We expect follow-up correction in the Bajaj Auto, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and UltraTech Cement. While Power Grid, RIL and Cummins India are likely to trade with a positive bias and may rally 5 per cent."
43,2019-06-18,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets moved higher on Tuesday, after falling over a percent in the previous session, amid hopes that the US central bank would adopt a more dovish stance and may slash borrowing costs. However, the gains remained capped amid economic worries back home.

There has been increasing talk that the Fed will cut borrowing costs for the first time in more than a decade, though the expectation is for a move later on. The shift to a more dovish tone from the bank has been a key support for global markets in the face of the trade uncertainty.

Fitch cut India's growth forecast for the current fiscal for a second time in a row to 6.6 per cent as manufacturing and agriculture sectors showed signs of slowing down over the past year which kept investors cautious.

Globally, major Asian markets were trading with tepid gains with all eyes on FOMC meet outcome. The Fed begins a two-day meeting later today which will conclude on Wednesday.

The rupee on Tuesday, after falling for the three-straight session, opened 8 paise higher at 69.83 against the US dollar on account of some selling in American currency by banks and exporters. 

“Expectation is that the central bank could remain dovish and any hints towards rate cut by the Fed could put the greenback under pressure. Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 69.40 and 70.05-70.20,” brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. 



At around 9:30 am, the 30-pack Sensex traded 143.80 points or 0.37 per cent higher at 39,104.

Nifty surged 39.65 points or 0.34 per cent to 11,712 with 14 constituents in the black and 36 in the red. One stock remained unchanged.

Among Sensex stocks, IndusInd Bank was the biggest gainer, up 1.77 per cent. Vedanta, Power Grid, Kotak Bank, Infosys and HCL Tech were among other gainers, rising upto one percent.

Yes Bank dropped the most, down 1.55 per cent. Other losers were -- HUL, SBIN, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel and ONGC.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap shed 0.09 per cent each.

On the sectoral front, it was a mixed bag with power as the top gainer, up 0.44 per cent, and FMCG the worst laggard, down 0.63 per cent.

Meanwhile, India Inc’s advance tax figures grew 171 per cent during the first quarter of 2019-20, prompting the tax authorities to say that the economy may be back on track after witnessing lacklustre growth in earlier quarters. In overall direct tax collection, Mumbai has registered 133% growth, collecting Rs 17,174 crore of advance taxes against Rs 7,356 crore in the same period last year, according to the data compiled by the tax department."

Nifty50 formed a High Wave candle along with the formation of an Outside Bar and remained highly volatile in a 175-point range on Wednesday. It broke previous day’s low and surpassed the previous day’s high, but finally closed on a flat note. However, every bounce is getting sold into while every minor dips are getting bought into. 

The index is trying to respect its 50-day EMA for last three sessions on a closing basis. As long as it holds below 11,761 level, the upside will remain restricted. But a hold below 11,666 level could open Nifty to declines towards 11,600 and then 11,550 levels. 

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,500 followed by 11,700 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 level. There was Call writing at 11,800 followed by 11,700 levels while Put writing was seen at 11,700. Options data suggested a trading range between 11,500 and 11,929 levels. 

India VIX moved up 0.89 per cent to 14.73 level. Market volatility was visible even at lower VIX levels because of volatile swings in midcaps and smallcaps. 

Bank Nifty failed to surpass the 30,700 level and drifted towards its crucial support at 30,250. It has been respecting to its 50-day EMA for last three sessions, but followup action was missing near the resistance zone.

As long as it remains below the 30,600- 30,700 zone, weakness could persist, while a drift below 30,250 level could open it up for further decline towards 30,000 and then 29,850 levels.

53,2019-06-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Led by gains in the HDFC duo and Kotak Bank, BSE benchmark Sensex ended higher for the second straight day on Wednesday amid positive global cues.

However, some investors used the rise in market to take money off the table ahead of US Fed’s policy outcome. Sensex surged as much as 389 points in morning trade, but pared most gains to end only 66 points, or 0.17 per cent, higher. 

NSE Nifty closed flat and a tad below the 11,700 mark at 11,691.

Rain deficit remained a concern. The monsoon has progressed slower than usual after hitting the southern state of Kerala nearly a week late.

The advance-decline ratio on BSE stood at 1:3, indicating that three stocks fell against every stock that rose.


Market at a glance:
In the Sensex pack, YES Bank finished as worst performer, shedding 5.54 per cent, followed by Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp, IndusInd Bank and M&M. 

Tata Steel, Kotak Bank, NTPC, HDFC and Power Grid emerged best index performers, rising as much as 4.60 per cent.

The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices underperformed Sensex, slipping 0.69 per cent and 1.37 per cent, respectively. 

Thirteen of 19 sectors on BSE ended in the red. Healthcare, auto, telecom and industrials were among the worst performing sectors, and shed nearly 1 per cent each. Realty, followed by consumer durables shone in Wednesday's session.


Factors that worked in favour of markets:


> US, China rekindle trade talks
China and the US are rekindling trade talks ahead of a meeting next week between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, which cheered financial markets on hopes that an escalating trade war between the two countries would abate. 


> Central banks’ stimulus
Investors betted on a worldwide wave of central bank stimulus, with expectations building that the US and the euro zone may deliver interest rate cuts as early as July. With the US Fed meet outcome scheduled for later in the day, it is widely expected to follow the lead of the European Central Bank and open the door to future rate cuts.


Factors that worries investors:

> Monsoon deficit
Monsoon rains have been 44 per cent below average so far in June, delaying sowing of summer-sown crops and raising concerns that parts of the country could face worsening drought, according to a Reuters report.


> Worries over earnings
With macro worries, poor monsoon and NBFC crisis, it looks like the earnings recovery will elude Street once again. Meanwhile, the market is awaiting the Union Budget for fresh cues.


Expert Take:
""Despite global trade optimism, domestic market failed to hold opening gains amid concerns over weakening economic data, lack of liquidity and rain deficit. The earnings growth is likely to be downgraded further given the deteriorating situation. It seems like the market will have to wait till the Union Budget, which could provide have cues on what’s in store.""

55,2019-06-20,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: The stock market ended almost flat on Wednesday after swinging between gains and losses for most of the session as concerns over domestic growth and the outcome of the US Fed’s rate-setting meeting overshadowed optimism over progress on the US-China trade front and indications of more stimulus from the European Central Bank. Stock indices rose as much as 1 per cent earlier in the day but gains fizzled out with the crisis in the credit markets and non-banking finance companies showing no signs of easing soon.

The Sensex ended up 66.40 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 39,112.74 after gaining as much as 1 per cent intraday. The NSE Nifty also gained 0.9 per cent to a high of 11,802.50 intraday before ending flat at 11,691.45.


“The government has not said what they will do in terms of policy decision, there has been no word from the new finance minister and we are still awaiting the Budget,” said Andrew Holland, CEO, Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies. “The NBFC issues are still continuing,” said Holland.

FPIs net bought shares worth Rs 31.7 crore on Wednesday while DIIs net bought shares worth Rs 181 crore, as per provisional data. The outcome of the American central bank’s meeting on Wednesday night could decide the sentiment in the days ahead. The market will watch whether the Fed’s commentary would indicate that there would be further rate cuts. On Tuesday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said it is ready with stimulus if needed. This comment along with optimism that US-China trade talks would be resolved soon triggered a rally in global markets.


Small-cap and mid-cap indices in red

At home, Tata Steel was the top gainer with a gain of 4.6 per cent followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank, NTPC, HDFC and Power Grid which gained1-2 per cent.

Yes Bank slid 5.5 per cent to end as the worst performer on the Sensex followed by Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp, IndusInd Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra which ended down 1.7-2.3 per cent.

Sector-wise, auto and pharma indices on the NSE were the worst performers, ending down 1.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, while the real estate index ended up 1.1 per cent. The selling pressure was more visible in the broader market, with the BSE MidCap index ending down 0.7 per cent and BSE SmallCap index ending down 1.4 per cent. Among the SmallCap index constituents, Jain Irrigation Systems slumped 28 per cent. HOV Services, Reliance Naval, Jet Airways, Weizmann Forex and HDIL declined 15-20 per cent.

“Indian markets are being decoupled from global markets as economic indicators are not in good shape. FPIs have stopped after buying heavily in Indian markets in May and start of June. There is also caution ahead of the Budget,” said Yogesh Mehta, vice-president, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Experts said negative news flow in the corporate world and crisis in the NBFC sector is also leading to selloff in the broader market. The Sensex has gained less than 1 per cent since May 23 – when the outcome of the national polls was announced. In this period since May 23, the RBI has also announced a repo rate cut of 25 bps, after data showed that India's GDP growth fell to a five-year low of 5.8 per cent in the March quarter."

59,2019-06-22,PowerGrid,"The benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty declined over half a per cent during the week gone by amid fears over India’s retaliatory tariffs on US goods, ongoing NBFC crisis, soaring crude oil prices and concerns over poor progress in monsoon. 

The Sensex slipped 0.65 per cent to 39,194 for the week ended June 21. The index was at 39,452 on June 14. Similarly, the NSE Nifty dipped 0.84 per cent to 11,724 from 11,823 during the same period. 

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the whole week:


Top Nifty gainers


ICICI Bank: Shares of ICICI Bank rallied 3.12 per cent to Rs 430.80 on June 21 from Rs 417.75 on June 14. During the week, ICICI Bank and IndoStar Capital Finance entered into sourcing and servicing arrangement to partner in extending credit to small and medium fleet owners to purchase used and new commercial vehicles. Under this partnership, IndoStar Capital Finance will originate and service the customers through the entire loan life-cycle including sourcing, documentation, collection and loan servicing and in turn, ICICI Bank will provide funding to these customers.


Power Grid: Shares of the company advanced 2.72 per cent to Rs 199.90 for the week ended June 21. Power regulator CERC has allowed state-owned transmission utility PowerGrid to offer towers to telecom companies for BTS (base trans-receiver station) installation to improve mobile connectivity, especially in remote rural areas. The move will not only address the issue of deficiency of telecom coverage in the country, particularly remote areas, but this segment could also be a money spinner for Power Grid. Besides, the power distribution utilities will get a share of income, which would eventually reduce the tariff burden on consumers. 


Top Nifty losers

UPL: Shares of agrochemicals maker UPL dropped over 11 per cent to Rs 890.10 during the week. According to HSBC Global Research, UPL appears at risk due to its global diversified exposure, but the near-term impact should be non-material.


Yes Bank: The private sector lender remained under pressure after Moody’s Investors placed the bank's ratings under review for a possible downgrade citing it high exposure to the struggling NBFC and realty sectors. The agency said the ongoing liquidity pressures on finance companies will negatively impact the credit profile of Yes Bank, given its sizeable exposure to weaker companies in the sector. The scrip declined 4.74 per cent to Rs 109.60 on June 21 from Rs 115.05 on June 14.


Stocks that rallied up to 21%
As many as 12 stocks on the BSE500 index managed to deliver over 5 per cent returns to investors during the week gone by. The list featured stocks such as Hexaware Technologies (up 21 per cent), Suzlon Energy (10.17 per cent), Oberoi Realty (7.86 per cent), Syndicate Bank (7.56 per cent) and Dr Lal Pathlabs (7.21 per cent).

Stocks @fresh all-time high

Still, it settled the week 11.70 per cent lower at Rs 72.50. Jimeet Modi, CEO, Samco Securities & StockNote said, “This week gone by saw the biggest speculative displacement in stocks like Jet Airways, which were fundamentally weak but witnessed spine-chilling movements on both directions. The reasons? Demand-supply mismatch, greed and fear, hopes and expectations – a clear reflection of emotional responses from investors all at once.”"

Hopes of trade resolution
US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have agreed to meet at the G20 summit in Japan next week, raising hopes for a truce in the bruising trade war between the world's top two economies.


Expert Take
""We maintain our cautious stance. The near-term movement is likely to be driven by progress in monsoon as well as global developments. The G20 summit will be closely monitored, as it is likely to focus on efforts to settle the international crisis and give some indication on progress on US-China trade talks. Further, the crude oil price and currency movement will also be on the market radar""- Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking""Front line indices had a smart pull back, after uninspiring move over the previous fortnight. Markets have been building up hopes from Union budget for the revival of the economy (which has hit 5-year low GDP growth). Further, a torrent of tweets from Trump on China, have been kept the market guessing about his foreign policy and trade war stance in the upcoming G20 meet.

61,2019-06-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty showed volatile temperament in Tuesday's session in the wake of weak global cues as investors remain anxious to see what transpires at US-China trade talks later this week.

Back home, worries over a slowdown in the economy and delayed monsoon continued to weigh on investor sentiment while news flow of the NBFC sector is not turning good from the bad. 

Sentiment in the manufacturing sector remains subdued as the proportion of respondents reporting higher output growth during April-June has fallen to 41 per cent from 54 per cent in the previous quarter, according to a survey by Ficci.

However, a slight ebb in global crude oil prices and a mild uptick in rupee against the US dollar prevented the market from suffering a steep fall. 

Oil fell on Tuesday amid concerns over the outlook for crude demand, but prices were supported after Washington announced new sanctions on Iran amid mounting tensions in West Asia, Reuters reported.

The rupee advanced 11 paise to 69.24 against the US dollar in the early trade due to weakening of the greenback against major currencies amid expectations of more dovish talk from the Federal Reserve.

Around 10:20 am, the BSE Sensex was 45 points down at 39,078, while Nifty was 6 points down at 11,694.

Power Grid, NTPC, ONGC and Reliance Industries were among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

The domestic market opened on a positive note and continued to trade with strong gains till noon amid positive cues from global markets ahead of the G-20 summit.

""However, post noon, market lost gains amid reports of heightening uncertainty over US-Iran standoff after latter issued warning message to the US, adding to the volatility in later part of trade,"" said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) - AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

88,2019-06-28,PowerGrid,"Equity investors on Dalal Street are waiting for the full Union Budget to see if it contains what is needed to revive the domestic equity market and put it on a rising trajectory.

There are expectations that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman would announce some policy measures that can boost the sagging economy, create jobs and to address rural distress, among other key concerns. 

Equity benchmark Sensex has risen around 10 per cent since the last full Budget in February 2018, riding a handful of stocks such as RIL, HDFC twins and Bajaj Finance among other, while 80 per cent of stocks in the broader market have eroded investor wealth in the same period.

“The market is at an all-time high but there is no excitement there due to the polarisation. Stocks are going from hero to zero in no time. Somehow, the index is refusing to reflect the uncertainties like delayed monsoon and NBFC crisis, or ongoing economic slowdown,” said Raamdeo Agrawal, a market veteran and Joint Managing Director at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The Union Budget is a very big event for the market, as it will hold cues on what the government is planning to do over the next five years.

“Right now, the market is ignoring good things in the economy and focusing only on the slowdown. As an investor, you should think about the next five years. The strong political mandate for the government has a lot of meaning. I am cautiously optimistic and remain invested in the market. I would not wait too long for further clearance of the sky to decide my further allocation,” Agrawal said.

Speculation is rife that the government will address financial sector troubles like rising non-performing assets and liquidity crisis in NBFCs, which will in turn help lift consumption demand. Therefore, there could be action in sectors like auto, FMCG, housing and building materials.

“Specific sectors which might benefit from this Budget include healthcare or pharma, banking, FMCG and housing finance,” says Arun Thukral, MD & CEO, Axis Securities.

Any Budget incentives to build the healthcare infrastructure will benefit the pharma sector. There are also expectations of a roadmap for banking reforms, including consolidation of the state-owned lenders, to support the economy in the next phase of growth.

“There is a high probability that this Budget would see higher allocation for recapitalisation of PSU banks. This, in turn, will strengthen the banking sector,” Thukral said.

Based on these assumptions and various brokerage recommendations, we collated a list of stocks that can potentially deliver healthy returns if the Budget indeed manages to bring the market alive.

90,2019-06-29,PowerGrid,"It is a weeknight. It is also game night for Akhila Phadnis. The 29-year-old board game devotee from north Bengaluru has just spent nearly one-and-a-half hours braving the city’s infamous traffic snarl to reach the eastern suburb of Kodihalli. But her enthusiasm remains unaffected, for Cheating Moth and Codenames await.

Her indifference to put herself through a long commute just to play board games upends two popular notions: One, board games are played at home with family, usually on Sundays. Second, playing board games is a childhood hobby.



These notions do not hold true for Phadnis and 70 others, who have converged this Thursday at the weekly meetup organised by ReRoll, a board games collective.

What has brought them together are hundreds of complex new-age games that were not around when they were growing up playing Snakes & Ladders and Ludo. Meeting strangers equally addicted to board games also helps them ward off urban isolation, a constant feature of modern lives.



“When we started in 2016, only six to eight people would show up every week,” says Karthik Balakrishnan (26), cofounder of ReRoll. “Now, a bad week means 50 people.” Last Thursday was ReRoll’s 146th meetup.

The gamers gather at Lahe Lahe, a hub for cultural events in Kodihalli. For an entry fee of Rs 150, one can play board games for 3.5 hours.

This evening, many pairs of footwear are lined up at the entrance, as if out of respect for the holy place inside. No wonder Phadnis, who works as French to English translator, attends these meetups religiously. “I get to meet new people since I recently shifted here from Chennai. It’s better than loud pubs,” she tells ET Magazine.





On either side of her table, four players are engrossed in Alhambra and Puerto Rico where they are building cities from scratch. These strategy games, known as Eurogames, leave little to no room for luck.

“Do you have Secret Hitler?” a fellow player asks Balakrishnan. Secret Hitler is a popular social deduction game, we are told. Clearly, this lot has graduated from Monopoly and Mafia to more complex stuff. Another strategy game — Settlers of Catan — is considered apt for beginners in the post-Monopoly era. Germany, the players tell us, led the modern wave of board gaming in the late 1990s. It eventually spread to the rest of Europe and countries like the US, Canada, and Australia, giving birth to an internet subculture of sorts comprising of IMDB-equivalent sites like BoardGameGeek.com and YouTube channels like Geek & Sundry fetching millions of subscribers and views. 

In the last five years, this wave has reached Indian metros, and diehard enthusiasts have created a strong ecosystem of cafes, communities and conventions. 

Today, Bengaluru has three major board game communities — Victory Point, Meeples of Bangalore and ReRoll. In Mumbai, three broad game cafes — Creeda, Pair A Dice and Chai & Games — have come up in the last three years. Doolally — a chain of brewpubs in Mumbai and Pune — has also added board games to attract more customers. “The brewpub keeps updating its collection, invites designers to play-test their games and hosts regular contests,” says Tresha Guha, Doolally’s brand manager.

In addition to these, there are sellers and creators of board games trying to grab a share of the global market, valued at $4.6 billion, according to Value Market Research. Bored Game Company, an online marketplace for board games, has seen its business boom, while visual artist Amit Ghadge, 34, has designed more than 20 games for companies in the UK and the US.

Based upon the number of components and stylisation, Mumbai-based Ghadge charges between Rs 40,000 and Rs 3 lakh per project.

The emergence of this new board game ecosystem in India is largely attributed to the exposure of urban Indians to a similar culture in the West.

Take Vikas Munipalle, for instance. The 34-year-old professional photographer from Mumbai discovered high-end board games during a work trip to Canada eight years ago. Locals asked him to check out Snakes & Lattes, Toronto’s board game café chain. “The walls were stacked with more than 300 board games. These were far more cerebral than what we had been playing,” he says.

Four years ago, Munipalle attended a board game meet in Mumbai and started buying these games to play with friends. “I used to be a video gamer but that’s a solitary activity in many cases,” he says. He now owns 55 games. But this is nothing compared to some people in the circuit, he says. They own more than 300. He says he likes board games because it enables social interaction and one can play with components. But the craze isn’t limited to millennials.

At the last edition of India’s only board game trade fair called MeepleCon, the oldest visitor was a 70-year-old Parsi woman. “She was thrilled to see the variety,” says Prashant Maheshwari, the 34-year-old who has organised the event in Mumbai every December since 2017.



“Last year, 3,000 people attended MeepleCon. Of those, 2,600 were playing high-end board games for the first time,” he says. He had also found a sponsor for the event — US-based toy & games company Hasbro. For this year’s edition, MeepleCon is expecting 5,000 visitors.

Last October, Spiel, the world’s biggest board game fair held in Essen, Germany, saw more than 190,000 visitors, and 1,150 exhibitors.

“We are just 1% of the 1%,” says Maheshwari, adding that his focus is on pulling more people into the Indian board gaming community. He is active on 38 WhatsApp groups where gamers from Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad discuss latest games and meetups.

One of them is a pan-India group for buying and selling high-end games with 250 members. A year ago, siblings Aziz and Moiz Bookwala from Pune set up Bored Game Company that now sells over 1,000 board games online. Most are priced at Rs 3,500-4,500. “Initially we received one or two orders a week. Now it is 15 a week,” says 25-year-old Moiz.

Kushal Shah, founder of Tabletop Nerds, a board game community in Mulund, Mumbai, has organised gaming activities for employees of L&T and Johnson & Johnson.

“They love role-playing games like Secret Hitler and resource management games like Power Grid.”

In 2017, market research firm Euromonitor had pegged the size of India’s board games and puzzles market at Rs 330 crore.

Bhavesh Somaya, Hasbro’s country manager for India & Middle East, is positive that the Indian board game market will touch the Rs 400-crore mark soon. The category’s growth on ecommerce sites is in line with his optimism.

Amazon India told ET Magazine it recorded a 100% rise in search and sales of board games and puzzles in the last two to three years. Flipkart too has seen search traffic for the category go up by more than 50% year-on-year, says Nishit Garg, head of books, general merchandise and home at the online retailer.

Funskool India, the toy manufacturer based in Chennai, says board games category has grown by double digits in the last five years. “We expect it will maintain this growth rate for the next five years,” says John Baby, the CEO.

He says while Monopoly and Jenga blocks still rack up volume sales, high-end games like Catan, Splendor and Dixit are also in demand. Dixit, a card game introduced just 10 years ago, tops the charts among the list of more than 450 games at Creeda in Mumbai.

“People often think it has something to do with Bollywood actress Madhuri Dixit until they figure out it is a card game of European origin!” says Riddhi Dalal, the cafe owner.

Dixit may not have Indian roots but the made-in-India board game scene is becoming active too.

Fletter, a word-building card game created by former advertising copywriter Rubianca Wadhwa, did a trial run in Doolally some years ago. It now sells 300-400 decks of Rs 199 each on a weekly basis. The game recently entered the UK market via Amazon and is selling well, says Wadhwa.

Social Humour and Cards Against Sanskaar — Indian versions of the famous American party game Cards Against Humanity — are popular on Amazon too.

Come July 16 and Shasn — a high-end political strategy game from Memesys Culture Lab — will be launched on Kickstarter, a US-based crowdfunding platform. “We have received the coveted ‘Projects We Love’ badge from the platform,” says Zain Memon, cofounder of Memesys based in Mumbai. Filmmaker Anand Gandhi is also among the cofounders.



In the last 10 years, Kickstarter has received $1 billion in pledges for games and 70% of it has been for developing board games.

Local crowdfunding platforms have also swung into action. In the last six months, Wishberry has taken up three board game funding campaigns. Cards Against Sanskaar is one of them. The game raised Rs 5.5 lakh in a month of going live when the target was only Rs 3.5 lakh.

Campaign for Mantri Cards — a game of trump cards — is live on Wishberry and had raised Rs 1.52 lakh from 100 backers as of June 27.

Designed by Pune-based data visualiser Anuja Pitre, the game contains information such as net worth, declared assets and criminal cases of 100 Members of Parliament.

To help more designers publish their games, Phalgun Polepalli, CEO of Bengaluru-based Dice Toy Labs, has collaborated with Wishberry. 

“We help with the manufacturing part of putting a game out in the market,” he says.



Most ventures, however, are passion projects, with little signs of profitability. “These designers should also target kids and senior citizens for better prospects,” says Anshulika Dubey, cofounder of Wishberry. A few designers are already following her advice.

Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Vaidehi Krishnan, 26, and Ishan Mahapatra, 35, are planning their honeymoon around their favourite games. The couple first met at a board game meetup in 2016 and got married six months ago. “We will visit 10 places in France to play the board games named after them, like Carcassonne and Versailles,” says Krishnan. If the makers of the Jumanji movie franchise ever decide to shoot a romantic film, they know where to look for inspiration."
0,2019-07-02,PowerGrid,"Local telecom equipment companies do not see Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious Make in India attractive enough as they continue to have a dismal market share when compared to multinationals, and have sought a slew of reforms and on-ground policy implementation to course correct India’s growth story. In an interaction with ETTelecom’s Muntazir Abbas, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry Telecom Committee Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Telecom Exports Promotion Council (Tepc) Sandeep Aggarwal speaks on existing procurement rules, Make in India and government-funded programs. Edited excerpts.


What is the market share of domestic telecom equipment firms vis-a-vis multinational companies in India?Most of the licensed telecom service providers are importing their equipment from multinationals and through other international trade tie-ups involving long-term credits at concessional financial conditions using their government’s line of credit. Indian manufacturers can offer matching prices and quality, but they cannot provide long term credits at low rates of interest. Almost 90% procurement for them is from multinational vendors. Considering the failure of many telecom operators to continue operations, the cash flows of even multinational companies has been disturbed. The experience of multinationals with operators worldwide, differential interest cost and availability of long term finance will deter operators to buy from local vendors.


What are the current modified Preferential Market Access (PMA) or Preference to Make in India (PMI) rules and challenges?
Public procurement (Preference to Make in India) order was first issued on June 15, 2017 and subsequently revised on May 28, 2018 and again on May 29, 2019, and applies to government procurement. The department of Telecommunications (DoT) has notified 36 telecom products for preferential procurement. Implementation problems are being faced by domestic telecom industry as various government ministries and public sector companies are structuring their procurement process and putting certain conditions in tenders to avoid correct implementation of PMA policy and continue to procure from multinationals.


What according to you, the government should do to facilitate domestic firms under new PMI rules?Lack of awareness of buyers and with missing local consultants, buyers hire mostly the big four consultants, who invariably add clauses favouring multinationals, since they have experience with these companies internationally. Issuance of FAQs, conducting awareness programs across the country, encouragement to local consultants are much needed. The consultants should be advised by the government to prepare tender documents in sync with PMI norms. In cases, where the specifications in the tender are tweaked to favour any multinationals and/or requirements added, which are superficial and irrelevant, the DoT should give exemplary punishment to not only the buyer but to its consultant too. In the private sector, PMI will only happen if the license conditions require the operators to buy at least 75% of their telecom equipment from Indian companies meeting PMA guidelines.


How have been Indian companies performing in overseas markets?
Companies with Indian Intellectual Proprietary Rights (IPR) are offering competitive prices and quality and are original equipment suppliers in more than 50 countries. They include Tejas Networks and many other OFC companies. Earlier, C-DoT licensed products were very popular in Africa and other developing countries but as stated above, use of Indian goods by Indian operators is a precondition for a wide scale export of telecom equipment from India.


Many of the Universal Service Obligation fund (USO)-aided telecom connectivity projects are not moving ahead. Your comments?
Non-payment of Capex and Opex for projects already deployed is one of the key reasons. The collaboration of BharatNet, BSNL, RailTel and Power Grid infrastructures with insufficient planning is also causing delays. The cost estimates of the USOF-funded project are sometimes based on 5-7 years old statistics and the lowest tendered prices fail to match the budget and thus tenders consequently get scrapped. In hilly-terrains or in Northeastern states, the costs are substantially higher and many USOF-driven projects have failed to see the light of day even after re-floating of tenders.


Going forward, what according to you are the areas that USOF should look at?
USOF can directly or through Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) award the projects, without involving other public sector firms. USOF can also support end-to-end solutions including e-health and e-education. Project authorities need to factor in the budget estimates and inflation from the base data used for estimation up to the completion date of the project."
1,2019-07-03,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity markets opened lower on Wednesday but soon logged mild gains, mainly on account of buying in index heavyweight RIL and private bank stocks. Foreign fund outflows and weak cues from Asian markets kept investors jittery.

Meanwhile, India and the US will resume their bilateral trade talks, with senior officials of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) visiting New Delhi next week. Assistant USTR Chris Wilson and deputy assistant USTR Brendan Lynch will be in New Delhi for trade talks, the first after India increased tariffs on 28 American goods following the US putting an end to preferential benefits to Indian exports last month."

6,2019-07-04,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices opened higher on Thursday, ahead of the Economic Survey, amid firm cues from the global market and falling crude oil prices.

Asian stocks advanced on Thursday, tracking sharp gains on Wall Street as recent data from multiple sectors pointed to slowing economic growth in the United States, bolstering the prospect of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 per cent as did Japan's benchmark Nikkei, and Australia was up 0.6 per cent. 

Crude oil prices fell, pressured by data showing a smaller-than-expected decline in US crude stockpiles. Front-month Brent crude futures were down 0.4 per cent at $63.60 per barrel.

Meanwhile, markets would keep a keen eye on the Indian Economic survey. The survey prepared by Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian is likely to flag headwinds that the economy might face in its pursuit to become the world's fifth largest economy. It is also likely to detail reforms road map needed to fulfill Modi's goal of more than doubling the size of the economy to USD 5 trillion by 2024.

7,2019-07-04,PowerGrid,"By Andy Mukherjee
India will need $1 trillion of infrastructure investment to nudge annual GDP growth higher by just half a percentage point in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second five-year term. Of this, at least 55% will have to come from public resources. Where’s the money?

Those figures from an analysis by the Confederation of Indian Industry are the No. 1 challenge for Nirmala Sitharaman as the country’s new finance minister gets ready to present her first annual budget on Friday.

While the scale of investment isn’t very different from what India spent in the past five years, the sorry state of corporate balance sheets makes it doubtful whether the private sector can put up its projected 45% share. Besides, the economy is in dire straits, regardless of the near-7% GDP growth portrayed by disputed government statistics.

From consumption and private investment to exports, no cylinders are firing. Government spending is therefore the only hope. But Sitharaman is in a tight corner. It doesn’t help that revenue from a goods and services levy, India’s biggest tax innovation of recent times, continues to disappoint two years after its introduction by her predecessor, Arun Jaitley.



With health, education and other government services also needing more money, the scope to free up funds by cutting public expenditure simply doesn’t exist. Nor is borrowing an option. Annual federal deficits can’t go much higher than $100 billion; borrowing by the public sector is already cornering resources equal to 8% of the economy even as the household sector barely manages to save 9% to 11% of GDP in financial assets.

It’s what economists call a classic “crowding out” of the private sector. India Inc. is clamoring for lower costs of capital, but the level of public debt is keeping them elevated. Cuts in the central bank’s short-term policy rates can’t be passed on to private companies if they’re not even reducing the government’s long-term borrowing costs as much as they should. Besides, a shadow-banking crisis has made lenders mistrustful of the private sector’s solvency, especially for debtors that have anything to do with comatose real estate. That’s one more reason why inflation-adjusted borrowing costs are 5%-plus.

A consensus is building around the idea that Sitharaman’s best option is to recycle public assets, something that Australian states such as New South Wales have successfully achieved with power grids and other assets. After Modi’s resounding election victory in May, I wrote that India now has structures like Infrastructure Investment Trusts and a toll-operate-transfer model that it can use to monetize cash-generating toll roads, ports, airports and power plants. “The proceeds from these sales can be used in the creation of new assets,” economists at HSBC Holdings Plc said in a recent report. “As such, the same pot of money is recycled several times over, without endangering the fiscal deficit, and yet upgrading India's infrastructure.”

Should Sitharaman take this road, she’ll find plenty of interest among investors such as Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte. India’s own National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, which is 51% private-owned, can be a powerful vehicle for mobilizing global interest.

This is the right time. As much as $13 trillion of global debt now offers negative yields. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries yield less than 2%. If ready-made Indian infrastructure can offer dollar returns in the high single digits, it’ll get lapped up by yield-hungry investors.

There are caveats, though. Although existing projects will carry no or little construction risk, they would be exposed to future regulatory uncertainty. Only risks that can be priced should be passed on to new owners. Moreover, it will be important for India to auction assets in a manner that leads to fair outcomes. Adani Enterprises Ltd. was the highest bidder for six functioning regional airports, leading one to wonder why others failed to see the value that it did. (India’s cabinet approved leasing three of those airports to Adani on Wednesday; a government spokesman refused to comment on approval for the remaining three.) 



In a way, India’s 2016 insolvency law was also a recycling mechanism, albeit for corporate assets trapped under unsustainable debt. There was much hope that bankruptcies would attract global buyers. Those that did come – such as ArcelorMittal and Bain Capital – got a bruising legal ordeal. With $1 trillion required to build new infrastructure, India can’t afford similar bungling when it comes to state assets. That’s something Sitharaman should keep in mind."
8,2019-07-04,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Debt markets in Mumbai believe North Block may consider the resumption of tax-free bonds to boost infrastructure spending amid talk that PSU borrowings used for building large projects had led to inaccurate projections of India’s fiscal gap.

""Infrastructure may have to find new ways for long-term financing,"" said Vishal Shah, partner at PwC. ""You cannot have short-term money but at least 10-15-year money. For this, new avenues can be explored through tax-free bonds. Private sector capacity to fund is limited. That's why retail money could well be an option with tax-breaks.""

In tax-free bonds, interest income is tax free, resulting in higher yield on interest income.

Last financial year, a group of state-owned companies raised Rs 65,000 crore by selling government-serviced bonds. Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDDCO), National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), and Power Finance Corporation (PFC) were among the large issuers.

In those papers, the government typically pays the interest due on behalf of the issuers. Critics argue that this is a way to “manage” fiscal deficit. Such borrowings reflect in the books of accounts of the issuing companies instead of those of the government.



The creation of physical infrastructure accelerated significantly during 2014-19, the pre-budget Economic Survey said Thursday. In April 2018, electricity finally reached every village in India, with efforts to link every home to the power grid still ongoing.

“The construction of national highways (NH) proceeded at a rapid pace, with more than 20% of the existing highway length of 132,000 km being constructed in the last four years alone,” the Survey said.

Tax-free bonds were introduced in 2012-13, selling debt of Rs 30,000 crore. The issuances extended in consecutive financial years until 2015-16, which saw about Rs 60,000 crore worth of bond sales.

Those bonds offered 9%. This time, if tax-free bonds are allowed, they would yield much lower, with overall interest rates falling. Those papers should offer rates in the range of about 5.50-6.50%.

 “A new class of investors should be created for long-term infrastructure funding,” said Ajay Manglunia, managing director and head of institutional fixed income at JM Financial Products. “While the issuers gain on two counts – lower borrowing costs and long-term funding, investors find it relatively safe credit to higher cumulated interest income. Wealthy investors find them attractive as tax-free interest increases their cumulative interest income.”"
14,2019-07-05,PowerGrid,"At the beginning of Part B of the budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman quoted from Purananuru, a collection of Tamil Sangam period (1st-3rd century) poetry. Directed at a Pandyan king, the poem she quoted — first in Tamil, and then in English — stated, “…a few mounds of rice from paddy that is harvested from a small piece of land would suffice for an elephant. But what if the elephant itself enters the field and starts eating? What it eats would be far less than what it would trample over.” 

I don’t know Tamil, but I have read an English translation and I think the FM didn’t deliberately quote the interesting bit — where the analogy between the elephant and the king becomes clear: a wise king is careful in collecting taxes; a silly king harasses taxpayers like the elephant. This is similar to Kautilya’s adage about collecting taxes the way a bee collects honey from a flower, without damaging the flower. 

Traditionally, there’s always been hype around the budget. We can’t get the 1988-89 ND Tiwari ‘sindoor’ budget out of our head. That was before reforms, and both revenue and expenditure are expected to stabilise now. The budget is an annual statement of GoI’s receipts and expenditure, nothing more and nothing less. 

As we have been reminded this year, it is a bahi-khata, or ledger, not something kept secured inside a briefcase with a combination lock. True, the budget speech has sometimes been equated with big bang policy announcements. But consider the following. 

First, for items under GST, the rates are decided by the GST Council. The FM may have a role to play in the council, even a major role. But the decision vests with the GST Council — some items waiting to be brought into GST require states to agree. That’s why when the budget speech refers to GST on electric vehicles, it says the GST Council “has been moved”. 

Second, there is a task force on direct taxes. This has not yet submitted its report. Third, there was an interim budget in February. The same party has formed government, and it is the same PM, even though the FM has changed. So, there has to be continuity. So, should one have had unrealistic assumptions about tax changes? 

There have certainly been some changes — simplification of GST procedures, faceless electronic assessment and swifter dispute resolution, change in the threshold for 25% corporate tax rates, higher effective tax rates for those with more than Rs 2 crore income, TDS on excessive cash withdrawals, and eventual replacement of PAN by Aadhaar. Some of these are intended to discipline the ‘elephant’, the last change mentioned suggesting the eventual elimination of PAN. But the broad point is simple. As there are more and more reforms, the tax system will stabilise. 

There won’t be changes from year to year. There won’t be secrecy associated with the budget. Such perceptions are legacies. The budget speech will become boring, perhaps even unnecessary. 

Let’s now turn to expenditure. At the beginning of Part A of the budget speech, there is a reference to the interim budget presented on February 1, and the 10 points of the vision. Budget day is only one day out of 365/366. GoI doesn’t cease to function on other days. There is continuity here too, since the budget is only one policy instrument out of several GoI possesses. 

We know about expenditure on infrastructure, housing, regional airports, gas and power grids, rural electrification, health, farmers, etc. We know about the package of centrally sponsored schemes, which will remain in place till April 1, 2020. We may have our own wish list of what GoI should spend on. But was that likely? 

On the expenditure side, too, we are heading towards stability. Give it a few more years, and there will be no mystery about the budget. The only mystery, if at all, was about whether Sitharaman would stick to fiscal consolidation or abandon it. With a fiscal deficit-GDP ratio of 3.3% and GoI debt-GDP ratio of 48% in 2019-20, she has stuck to fiscal consolidation and the medium-term fiscal policy statement. Some may have presumed mystery around the disinvestment figure. 

The FM has adhered to continuity and has signalled some reforms in debt and corporate bond markets. This is in line with expectations.

9,2019-07-05,PowerGrid,"ET Intelligence Group: Is offbalance sheet expenditure helping North Block prevent the fiscal gap from widening? This method of spending likely involves leveraging the balance sheet of a state-owned agency or company to help finance items of federal expenditure.

According to estimates, about Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth of expenditure may have been pushed off-balance sheet as borrowings at Food Corporation of India (FCI), PowerGrid Corporation, and a few other entities. Of total incremental off-balance sheet borrowing, FCI garners about three-fourths.

The government has an important role to play in the business model of FCI. The agency procures food at minimum support prices. However, the difference between prices of foods under the public distribution system and market prices results in a gap.


The Centre has funded this gap through foods subsidy, which is part of the government’s expenditure. In the last few years, a part of foods subsidy not paid by the government is supported by the borrowings of the FCI due to a revenue shortfall. The government has provided food subsidy bill of Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the interim budget for FY20.

Prithviraj Srinivas, economist at Axis Capital, believes that fiscal deficit could be understated due to borrowings of the FCI to fund food subsidy bill, but public debt is not grossly under-represented if borrowings are mainly supported by funds gathered through the National Savings Schemes (NSS).

FCI borrowings increased to Rs 1.96 lakh crore under FY19 revised estimates, compared with Rs 0.71 lakh crore in budget estimates for the same period. Under-recoveries in foods subsidy were funded by the additional borrowing on the balance sheet of FCI. Consequently, debt at FCI has increased to Rs 2.18 lakh crore in FY19 compared with Rs 0.96 lakh crore in FY13, according to Axis Capital estimates. CLSA also estimated that FCI’s debt rose to Rs 2.2 lakh crore in FY19.

Incremental borrowings at FCI were financed by NSS funds. FCI borrowed Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 51,000 crore from NSS in FY17 and FY18, and this accounted for 59 per cent and 32 per cent of the total NSS funds raised during the same year. According to the interim budget of FY20, FCI is expected to pay back Rs 27,000 crore. Thus, borrowings of FCI are expected to decline.

Similarly, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has been raising debt to top up budgetary support. Total debt of NHAI has increased to Rs 1.2 lakh crore in FY18 compared with Rs 0.24 lakh crore in FY14. The government has been servicing interest payments on debt raised by NHAI. This model works perfectly if toll collections are equivalent to the amount of interest paid by the government."

16,2019-07-06,PowerGrid,"If the capital expenditure is not resulting in the completion and delivery of service, then that’s fiscal. That expenditure on capital is actually worse, says Subhash Chandra Garg, Finance Secretary. Excerpts from an interview with ETNow.


There seems to too much focus on revenue expenditure in this Budget. 

In my understanding, if you spend on education, if you spend on health, if you spend on the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, all of them are revenue expenditures. Are they in terms of quality less important than constructing a factory or constructing a road or constructing a dam? It might also happen that many times the capital expenditure is not productive, as we have seen in the case of several dams. 99 damns which are still being completed over so many years have not actually generated and so that capital expenditure has not yielded anything to the economy.


A fiscal multiplier from say building a road is definitely more than the fiscal multiplier of spending on education.

I agree with you so long as that capital expenditure results into a multiplier but if it is not resulting into the completion and the service of the production coming up, then that fiscal, that expenditure on capital is actually worse. It ends up adding the expenditure to the economy but the productive assets not coming through. It might actually be inflation.


Are we not throwing the baby out with the bathwater when we shift from investments to consumption?

I do not think I wanted to communicate that capital expenditure is bad. Capital expenditure is very good and very desirable and that is why a lot of capital expenditure has actually been shifted to more productive organisations. So whether it is NTPC or Power Grid or for that matter NHAI, which does the road the construction programme and all, there is a massive capital expenditure.

My sense is both the expenditures are important and most monitored indicator should be how much is the total fiscal deficit.


Another important issue is that of the RBI dividend. The dividend that you put forth this time around in terms of financial institutions is over Rs one lakh crore as against Rs 82,000 crore earlier. How much money are you factoring in from the RBI? 
The heading which we have is for the dividend surplus and profits, these are the ongoing normal profits. So we did estimate a certain kind of amount depending upon what the six months profit and loss statement of the Reserve Bank of India indicated. It is actually not very complicated. It depends upon how much the Reserve Bank earns on their investments, both the foreign as well as domestic. 

Last year was better in terms of foreign investments yield and so this year, it should be better than last year and that is what made us estimate the number which you are quoting as part of their total dividend numbers. The stock of surplus which they have, the stock of the reserves and etc that is the mandate of the Bimal Jalan Committee.


So you have not taken any number as yet? So that is a cushion that you have kept?
No. There is no need to do it because that number is not available at this moment.


You have not taken a ballpark number?
Why? Let the report come and depending upon that when the next budget is presented you can...


Which is just six months from now…so is that a reason why the government is so confident of achieving that 3.3% fiscal deficit target because you have a sizable cushion?
No, that is not factored in for this year. This year we are doing it based on the numbers we have and we are fairly confident.


It should come in this fiscal?

Let us not speculate on what kind and what time. It is better to wait, it will go to the board for decision and I think the government will also get concerted at some stage so this is not at all factored here."
18,2019-07-08,PowerGrid,"Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty plunged over 2 per cent each on Monday following heavy selling across sectors.

“The fall in the market was on account of concerns over future fund flow into the secondary market and a fresh loan fraud at PNB. The hike in I-T surcharge in Budget will have an adverse impact on high-end consumption and reduce investible surplus of high-income individuals, whose money was the mainstay of mutual funds, PMSes and the midcap segment,” said Amar Ambani, President & Research Head, YES Securities.


Here is a breakdown of the key highlights of Monday’s trade:

20,2019-07-09,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The sharp fall on Dalal Street in last two sessions has made the bears get an upper hand. Tuesday’s session also began weak, making analysts to surmise that Nifty50 may have made its short-term top around the 12,100 level. 

That said, there are at least 17 stocks on NSE, which look strong on the technical charts, as suggested by the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides from here on. These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included YES Bank, which gained 5.67 per cent on Monday and a further 2.5 per cent on Tuesday even in a weak market setup.

Dhanlaxmi Bank, PNB Gilts, BF Utilities, Sonata Software, Aegis Logistics, Cholamandalam Finance and Music Broadcast are some of the other stocks that look strong on the MACD charts. Others include Alkem Laboratories, Hatsun Agro, BF Investment and Future Supply Chain. 





The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed there are 181 stocks, which are showing a bearish trend. They included Bajaj Finance Axis Bank, Hindalco Industries, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, SAIL, NTPC, Power Grid, Cipla, Ambuja Cements, OBC, LIC Housing, Siemens and Indiabulls Realty. 











“The recent correction was so severe in some of the marquee names that it was extremely intimidating,” said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking.

“The stock-specific mayhem has started again and this time, rank outperformers are also not spared. Hence, traders are likely to adopt a cautious approach and should ideally avoid trading aggressively for a while,” Chavan said.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, the important opening upside gap of May 20 is all set to be filled soon at 11,426. This gap is expected to offer support to the index and one may expect a minor upside bounce near 11,400-11,425 levels in the next few sessions.

“Nifty50 has seen a double top breakdown below 11,625 on the daily chart. It could trigger more panic. A strong support for the index is seen in the 11,500-11,426 range and the immediate strong hurdle is in the 11,620-11,690 zone,"" said Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities.


Understanding MACD
 
A close look at the stock chart of Dhanlaxmi Bank shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line on this country, the stock has shown upward momentum and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded at Rs 16.15 on NSE, up 0.96 per cent.

22,2019-07-09,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday informed the Lok Sabha that local militant recruitment in Jammu and Kashmir has come down by almost 40%.

Union minister of state for Home G Kishan Reddy told the House that ‘terrorist-initiated incidents (in J&K) have declined by 28%, net infiltration has reduced by 43%, local recruitment has fallen by 40% and neutralisation of terrorists has increased by 22%.”

Security situation in Jammu and Kashmir has improved drastically and the cross-border infiltration has reduced by 43% after the surgical strikes on terror camps in Pakistan, MoS for Home Nityanand Rai said in a separate reply in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

Rai's remarks came in response to a written question on whether cross-border infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir has abated after the the Air Force carried out surgical strikes on terror camps in Balakot in February. “Due to concerted and synergised efforts of forces, the security situation in the state has witnessed an improvement in the first half of this year over the corresponding period in 2018. Infiltration has reduced by 43%,” he said.

The minister said the central government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards cross-border infiltration. Rai said the government of India in tandem with the state government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to contain cross-border infiltration. The measures include multi-tiered deployment along the International Border and the Line of Control (LoC), border fencing, improved intelligence and operational coordination, equipping security forces with improved technological weapons and taking pro-active action against infiltrators.

Replying to another question, the minister said the electric fence, the Anti-Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS), on LoC along Indo-Pak border has proved to be a potent tool to guard against infiltration. The electricity requirements for the AIOS are being catered through power grid wherever available and through generators at other locations to ensure uninterrupted power supply, he said."

27,2019-07-15,PowerGrid,"By Jonathan Tirone

The world needs explosive growth in renewable energy for the next three decades, but even that probably won’t be enough to forestall catastrophic climate change.

That’s the conclusion of study commissioned by First Light Fusion Ltd., the British startup that’s building a machine to mimic the power that makes stars shine. With greenhouse gases accumulating at record rates in the atmosphere, researchers at SystemIQ wrote that entirely new zero-carbon technologies will be needed to avert the rising seas, superstorms and famines predicted by runaway global warming.

“We need to continue building renewables at the maximum possible rate, but if we’re going to solve the problem we need new technologies,” First Light co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Hawker said in an interview. His company near Oxford University has drawn investments from IP Group and has an advisory board that includes former U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu.

Pressure to adopt cleaner power is intensifying. A series of reports showed that efforts, while substantial, are still far short of what’s needed to keep climate change in check. At current rates, temperatures will rise at least 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, missing by a wide margin the 2015 commitments made under the Paris Agreement.

“Within the next two decades, we have to simultaneously replace current power generation from coal, natural gas and oil with zero-carbon sources, while doubling the existing output of electricity using, again, zero-carbon power sources,” according to the study.

Wind and solar power are set to increase the amount of power they supply eightfold over the next two decades. Even so, that would leave the world with a potential electricity shortfall as great as 20,000 terrawatt-hours, almost as much electricity as the entire world uses each year.

That electricity gap that needs to be filled is the target of First Light, as well as competing fusion startups being funded by Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Peter Thiel. They’re pursuing designs they hope can start generating power sooner than the 35-nation, $25 billion Tokamak fusion reactor known as ITER, the largest research project in history, whose collaborators have been laboring on a gigantic demonstration reactor in France since 2010.

“The internal tension in the field fusion comes down to size,” according to Hawker, who said that bigger machines, in which plasma reactions can be more easily be calibrated, also cost more for investors. “We want a design that will reduce the upfront capital costs, even if it comes at a slightly higher cost of electricity.”

The SystemIQ study assesses that “if fusion can be delivered at $60 a megawatt-hour, the addressable market could be about 460 gigawatts globally.” Countries with limited space and poor solar conditions like the U.K., as well as places with rapidly expanding power grids like India are ideally suited for fusion, according to the portions of the confidential report that were shared with Bloomberg News.

“Decarbonizing the power system based primarily on wind and solar would probably be achievable in a scenario of flat power demand,” wrote Jeremy Oppenheim, the SystemIQ partner who organized the study. “If power demand booms in the next two decades as it is projected to do, especially in geographies with fast-growing populations and economies, then we will need new sources.”"
29,2019-07-15,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: A total of 26 deviations were committed by close to a fourth of the Nifty-50 companies, 11 to be exact, for the year 2018-19, according to the first ‘secretarial compliance report’ that captures adherence to Sebi regulations, which kicked in this year.

Following recommendations from the Uday Kotak-led committee on corporate governance, Sebi has mandated that all listed companies disclose their ‘secretarial compliance status’, intended to ensure efficient board functioning and an in-depth check specific to the regulator’s norms.

The 11 companies are SBI, Larsen & Toubro, IndianOil, NTPC, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid, GAIL, Adani Ports, Bharat Petroleum, Eicher Motors and ONGC, according to CimplyFive, a tech solution provider for compliance standards, which analysed information filed by Nifty-50 companies with the stock exchanges.

Inadequate representation of independent directors on the board tops the list with six companies, closely followed by five companies that did not conduct an evaluation for their independent directors — both being areas of concern, according to industry experts.

Of the six companies that reported non-compliance with board composition, penal action is reported only in the case of four — IndianOil, NTPC, Power Grid and Adani Ports. A penalty of nearly Rs 19 lakh was imposed on Adani Ports. In the other two companies — Bharat Petroleum and SBI — penal action is either not taken or, if taken, not reported to exchanges.

Further, for the five companies that had not undertaken evaluation of independent directors, no penal action is reported by auditors. In all these companies, penal action is either not taken or, if taken, not been reported, the analysis said.

A questionnaire emailed to Sebi went unanswered till the time of going to press.

Of the 26 deviations, stock exchanges took penal action against five companies for six lapses. The Companies Act, 2013 requires every listed company to have a minimum onethird of their total number of directors as independent and at least one woman director on their board.

Sai Venkateshwaran, partner and head (CFO advisory) at KPMG India, said, “Independent directors have a very significant role to play in ensuring good corporate governance. Similarly, board evaluation is an important step. Therefore, not having the requisite number of independent directors or board evaluation not being done periodically should be areas of concern.”

Shankar Jaganathan, founder and CEO of CimplyFive, said, “Our analysis of the applicable LODR regulations indicates that there are over 150 compliances that an equity listed company needs to undertake every year. Even among the cream of the corporate sector, 26 deviations are reported by 22 per cent of the population. We believe annual secretarial compliance report does not pass the test of cost-benefit analysis. Further, by adding a superfluous reporting requirement, it also could be a deterrent to ease of doing business in India.”"

31,2019-07-15,PowerGrid,"Kolkata: A reduction of direct controlling stakes by the government of India in large state-owned energy companies is unlikely to negatively impact the ratings on these entities, as long as the government maintains majority effective ownership and broad control of their activities, said Fitch Ratings, in a statement made on Monday.

The Fitch Ratings update comes on the backdrop of a statement made by a government official steering the centre’s asset sale department on stake sale of energy PSUs. The official indicated that that the centre may reduce its direct controlling stakes in large energy companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, NPTC and GAIL (India), while maintaining effective controlling stakes of at least 51 per cent through arms such as Life Insurance Corporation of India. This comes as the government has set an enhanced target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore of divestment receipts for the financial year ending 31 March 2020.

Fitch will continue to apply its government-related entities rating criteria if the government continues to have sufficient control over these rated government-related entities (GREs) through involvement in and influence over these entities' strategic, operational and financial activities, while other government-controlled institutions are only used to hold investments on behalf of the government.

“However, if the latter take over control of the rated entities, which is not likely to be the case based on our understanding, Fitch may re-assess the credit profiles of the rated entities based on its parent and subsidiary rating linkage criteria, similar to when the state's direct majority ownership in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd was transferred to ONGC in FY18,” Fitch said in the statement.

A reduction in government's direct stakes in these GREs will not change Fitch's assessment of the four GRE factors, if the government retains majority effective ownership and a similar level of control over the GREs' activities.

However, if the reduction of the government's effective ownership is significant and there is also evidence of a weakening of the government's involvement in the GREs' activities, Fitch may re-assess the 'status, ownership and control' and 'financial implications of default' factors.

The 'support track record and expectations' factor could also be lowered if tangible support is expected to be reduced. However, the 'socio-political implications of default' factor will likely remain unchanged.

The impact on rated Indian GREs' credit profiles is likely limited, even if there were to be re-assessments of their GRE scores, which is the sum of scores assigned to each GRE factor.

Both Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and GAIL have standalone credit profiles (SCP) above the Indian sovereign rating at 'bbb', while NTPC's and Oil India Ltd's (BBB-/Stable) SCPs are the same as the sovereign rating at 'bbb-'.

As a result, their ratings will remain unchanged, even if their GRE scores are lowered. IOC's and Bharat Petroleum Corporation's (BPCL, BBB-/Stable) current GRE scores equal 40 points under Fitch criteria; a significant reduction in this score to 25 is required for their ratings to be lowered to one notch below the sovereign rating.

HPCL's rating is aligned with the credit profile of its parent ONGC under the parent and subsidiary rating linkage criteria, while Fitch expects the latter's credit profile to remain stable even if there is a re-assessment of its GRE factors.

In addition, the government may also monetise its direct stakes in state-owned companies through share buybacks. Share buybacks are limited to once a year and limited to 25 per cent of a company's aggregate paid-up equity capital, such that after the buyback, the company's aggregate debt is not more than twice its paid-up capital and free reserves. Large share buybacks can weaken the GREs' financial profiles. Oil India bought back 4.45 per cent of shares in FY19, reducing the government's effective ownership from 66 per cent to 61.6 per cent, while its headroom under the 'bbb-' SCP negative rating guideline of 2x has been reduced."

Where we are: Last week’s candle has closed below the previous week’s Shooting Star candlestick pattern, which acts as a confirmation. Since July 5, Nifty corrected sharply on the daily time frame and violated its intermediate support of 11,600 by witnessing breach of smaller degree trendline. Bulls made several attempts to surpass 12,000 mark but were capped for the previous couple of occasions. Intermediate support for the index is now at 11,400-11,200 mark. Decisive break is needed that will could possibly trigger further weakness.


What is in store: The list of the stocks taking the market higher gets narrower with each advance in the market and so the stock selection is getting even more important. Positive trend on the weekly time is still intact as Nifty 50 is trading in a higher-high higher-low formation, which is sustaining within a Rising Channel Pattern. Previous three-month candle has formed a small body which indicates narrow range trading in a market after registering a life time high. Going forward, Nifty is likely to consolidate in the range of 11,800 and 11,400 as long as it fails to break the bands on the either sides. A decisive pullback above 11,800 may attract further buying in the market which may lead to an upward move towards 12,000.


What could traders do: As long as Nifty sustains above 11,400, the trader may trade the range with an upside expectation towards 11,750 and 11,900. Long positions can be kept as long as Nifty doesn’t break 11,400. Avoid the weak sectors like auto and IT. Some of the technical picks where traders can catch the dip for 10-12 per cent in the short term for the stop loss of 5-6 per cent. Among the stocks are Powergrid, CESC, McDowell, Can Fin Home are likely to remain in strength."

33,2019-07-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended gains for the second consecutive trading session on Tuesday supported by realty, pharma and FMCG stocks while losses in IT limited the upside. 

Analysts said that investors cheered easing WPI inflation (June) data and felt that markets were unaffected by trade data released on Monday that showed weakening consumption, with June imports slipping to their lowest level in four months to $40.29 billion, down 9 per cent from a year ago.

On the macro front, business sentiment in June was down to its lowest level since 2016 in India due to slowing economic growth, water shortage and regulatory hurdles, according to a survey by IHS Markit. However, hopes of probusiness government policies and a better financial flow continue to underpin optimism towards output and profitability growth in the year ahead, the report said.

Also, analysts were of the view that Skymet's prediction that monsoon will be weak across India over next two weeks may weigh on the markets in the coming days as investors await more set of earnings this week.

Q1 results so far have been mixed and moving ahead they are expected to be subdued in nature, analysts warned. 

On the global front, Asian shares closed higher as investors awaited US retail sales data and corporate earnings which will provide cues on the health of the world's biggest economy ahead of a likely US rate cut later this month.

Meanwhile, shares of YES Bank surged 11 per cent in Tuesday’s trade, even as the bank denied reports suggesting that four PE firms were looking to infuse money in the private lender.

BSE Sensex closed 234.33 points, or 0.60 per cent, higher at 39,131.04. While NSE Nifty ended at 11,661.05, up 72.70 points or 0.63 per cent. 


Market at a glance 
In the 30-pack Sensex, 21 stocks ended in the green and 9 in the red with TCS as the worst performer and YES Bank the best. M&M, Tech Mahindra, Kotak Bank and HCL Tech too joined TCS on the losers list, slipping up to 2 per cent. 

Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, NTPC and Power Grid were among the other Sensex stocks that advanced. 

The BSE Midcap index advanced 0.69 per cent outperforming benchmark Sensex, while the BSE Smallcap index ended 0.27 per cent higher. 

BSE Realty index recorded gains of 1.98 per cent followed by Power, Oil & Gas and Consumer Durables index. BSE IT index though was among the worst performers. 

In terms of index contribution, RIL, L&T, YES Bank and Axis Bank were the top supports while TCS, M&M, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank were the top drag on Sensex. 


Expert Take


We expect the market to remain choppy in the near term in the backdrop of weak domestic sentiment given the on-going economic slowdown. The monsoon has shown considerable improvement over the past 1-2 weeks, which is a positive for Indian economy. However, the progress of monsoon would be actively tracked by traders and investors. Further, earnings announcement by companies is likely to lead to stock specific volatility. On the global front, ongoing geopolitical tensions between US-Iran could have a bearing on Indian market as crude prices have inched higher in the recent past and is likely to keep the market participants on edge

37,2019-07-18,PowerGrid,"Once the economy starts turning around over the next three or six months, people will start building in some risk in the portfolios and start looking at some of the names which are beaten down today, but have a little risk in terms of funding etc, says Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The news for NBFC/financial space is just not improving -- be it DHFL or Yes Bank or Indiabulls Housing Finance. What do you think the situation is there?Clearly the pain points are still there in the NBFC space. Initially, the problem started with the asset liability mismatch and on the liability side, there has been a complete freeze. I do not think many of the NBFCs are getting either the bank lines or the lending from MF and they are also not able to raise money through other sources at this point of time. In a way, their liability side has always been a difficult one and at the same time, in some cases we have seen some of the asset quality or governance issues coming up, which adds to the whole problem. Every few weeks, if you hear a negative story on one or the other NBFC, then to that extent, normalisation in the debt markets is unlikely to happen at a faster pace. I would say the next couple of quarters are going to be difficult for most of the NBFC names.


Is that pain going to continue? We have been talking extensively about the slowdown and while there have been a fair amount of comments coming in expecting a pick up, how dire do you feel the situation is currently?There has been a visible slowdown in the economy, more pronouncedly in the consumption side. We think this is likely to continue for some more quarters. Once the fixed income market normalises, all the businesses that require working capital or money for growth will be able to source that money and slowly the economy would start recovering. 

At this point of time, only the better balance sheets or better businesses are able to access money and usually they are the ones who do not need so much of money for growth or working capital. It is the basket which is down the curve which actually needs more money and which is also more leveraged at this point of time and that is where the benefit of lower interest rates has not really accrued because transmission has come to a standstill. Until that revives, we cannot expect a large and pronounced economic recovery.


Cement has been a complete proxy to economy but consumption is slowing down and investment cycle is yet to pick up. There is a global slowdown and exports are dwindling. Could you be forced to relook at your positions in cement or even corporate banks because they are proxy to economy? We have already done that to an extent and we still find more value in some of these infrastructure or economic-activity linked stocks rather than the consumption side. While a slowdown would affect both sides eventually, but today the consumption side is witnessing a lot more slowdown compared to some of these economic activity or infrastructure activity linked stocks. Also the valuation differential between these two segments is very large one. We believe that as long as the consumption sector continues to underperform as against market expectations, there is unlikely to be any valuation support for these segments and in our view there is a visible slowdown which is not really built fully into analyst expectations in that segment.

In case of some of the other names, there is a relative valuation comfort while the growth may still slowdown for some of these proxies of economy. We believe that valuations are not as high as what you would see in the consumption basket.


You have a large exposure to chemicals. There is a large block deal in Sudarshan Chemicals. SRF, PI Industries stocks are at record highs. What exactly do you like in chemicals -- agro chemicals, industrial chemicals or speciality chemicals?We have exposure across our portfolios in speciality, agro chem and even pharma related chemicals. We believe this is a space which gives a short-term opportunity because of the environmental issues forcing some of the Chinese facilities to shut down their production. So the demand being same, you will see a lot of export opportunity for some of these names depending on which segment of the chemicals they are operating in. 

Also from a medium to long-term perspective, we believe another large opportunity is opening up because of the trade tension between US and China. A lot of global majors have also seen consolidation and they are looking at outsourcing from regions other than China for their intermediates. If the tension continues and if there is a chance of disruption of supplies, then some of these global majors would look to diversify their intermediate base and that is where some of the Indian chemical companies would start to figure in. 

I am not saying that the entire Indian chemical basket would get an opportunity like this but at least the ones which have better quality, which can stick to the supply timelines, etc, and which have scaled to compete with some of the global majors would be the ones to get a medium to long-term export opportunities. 


One sector that has been in limbo has been the consumption space. When could we see the impact of the monetary stance play out because we think a low interest rate environment should bode well? Would it be better during the festive season by the end of the year or could it stretch into next year?This is exactly what I was trying to explain initially that while the interest rates have been low, the transmission has not taken place. There is also room for further interest rate cuts as global liquidity is abundant and global interest cycle is also benign and our own inflation is also ruling quite moderate. Given all this, the interest rate scenario looks quite benign in the Indian context. But the problem has been more of transmission. I do not think the transmission has been taking place and it is difficult to put a timeline in terms of when that transmission will start to happen. 

But it is going to be a very slow grind over the next couple of quarters and it also depends on no further accidents from the NBFC space. As the market tries to normalise, if there are more accidents from NBFC space, then that will delay the normalisation process. Another point to note is that in most of the consumption segments, especially the discretionary consumption segment such as auto, there is a lot of inventory that is still lying with either the dealers or distributors or even the manufacturers. 

There is no hope for the revival of demand at least in the immediate term and we will have to watch this space closely over the next couple of quarters to understand where that inflexion point would come from.


Would you be looking at utilities? Would you be looking at buying NTPC, Power Grid purely because interest rates are likely to come down? We have got an overweight position on gas utilities. Between power utilities and gas utilities, our preference has always been gas utilities given the fact that there is going to be a medium to long-term growth trajectory for gas. Gas being a cleaner fuel, that tilt is always going to be there. Whether it is the Indian government or any other government in the world, everybody is focussing to reduce environmental issues. Given a choice, it is better to look at gas utilities rather than the power utilities at this point of time because the lower interest rates scenario would benefit both of them equally.


Is it valuations, is it global trade war or domestic slowdown/liquidity -- where do you think markets are not prepared for a shockwave?Clearly the market is not prepared for a liquidity shock. We do not expect any change in either global liquidity or domestic liquidity but for some reason, if you see that happening, then the current valuations may not sustain.

Clearly today’s valuations are slightly elevated compared to long-term averages and that is sustaining because of the money that is coming from foreign investors as well as the structural change that has happened in Indian context, where money is moving away from physical assets and coming into financial markets. 

These two have been in combination helping the market to sustain slightly elevated valuations and if you see any change in that liquidity trajectory, there is a risk for the market.


What is your view on IT not playing it as a defensive? You are looking at some of the bigger names that have been performers, not being concerned with the tremors on growth over the next 18 months. What is making you so confident on the IT names?We have an underweight position on IT names. We have just stock specific positions there. As far as the entire sector is concerned, we believe there are some verticals which are slowing down and there are also issues in terms of whether the Indian IT companies have the right business model to take on the future expected growth in the digital space. 

As you rightly mentioned, the currency which can be a short-term tailwind is unlikely to be a great tailwind for IT sector at this point of time. Given all this, we remain underweight on the sector but we do have a couple of names where some of these issues are unlikely to play out and hence we are more positive.


Where do you see value within some of these high PE stocks?Clearly high PE stocks carry some amount of risk, especially in a scenario, where the overall economy is slowing down. If you witness a slowdown in any of the names where the valuations are very high, then there is a risk of a) earnings downgrade and b)multiple contractions. 

So to that extent, you have to be very careful in selecting some of the high PE or high valuation stocks at this point of time. That is where on the consumption side we have been very careful because that is where the slowdown is. If that continues, some of the valuations could at risk for some of these companies.


When do think this market’s obsession with near term visible growth/corporate governance will change? In any market, 50% of the market does better than the index, 50% of the market underperforms the index but now we are looking at what 3-4% of the market doing better than the index! How long will this trend continue?I will again go back to transmission of lower interest rates. Once the broader market starts getting funding for growth, then it will start participating in the overall upside. Today a), there are very few stocks which are consistently delivering earnings growth; and b), there are far fewer names where there is no management or governance concerns. 

People are moving their investments into some of these names where there seem to be a reasonable degree of risk protection. Going forward, when you see lower interest rates getting transmitted and helping most of the businesses, slowly the expectations on earnings growth for that basket will also improve and that is when you will start seeing some money going into that segment. 

But I would say that for the next couple of quarters at least, it is going to be very stock specific market. I do not think you will see a broad-based rally at this point of time and when there is a likelihood that the economy is going to turn around maybe over the next three or six months, that is when people will start building in some risk in the portfolios and start looking at some of the names which are beaten down today, but have a little risk in terms of funding etc. That is the point of time where they will start picking some of those names in our opinion."
38,2019-07-18,PowerGrid,"The ammunition for investors or the managers to go and buy stocks is actually limited because the money has not really come in a big way, says Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

What has changed since the last time we spoke? What is starting to look more attractive? One thing that has been happening is that despite a positive election result and the SIPs remaining good and steady, the lump sum money and investors have not come back yet. The ammunition for investors or the managers to go and buy stocks is actually limited because the money has not really come in a huge way. 

The steady SIP flows happening is great but the lump sum money, that optimism, has not come back yet. We are noticing interesting trends like increased buying into IT stocks like TCS, Tech M and HCL Tech. Another very interesting trend that we have picked up with managers is that pharma is emerging as a contra value play right now.


There is so much underperformance as well in some pharma stocks.Absolutely. But it is not just one-two names -- Sun, Dr Reddy’s, Cadila -- some of the midcap names are also interesting managers. These are the newer trends that are emerging. Obviously, financial still remains reasonable part of the buying pattern but that is business as usual. 


Is auto an absolute no-no as of now? What is the data suggesting?Autos again is tepid. But what has been happening is that trade-off is still happening. We are still seeing some marginal buying into Maruti and given the price correction, stock managers do not mind picking up a quality name like Maruti but largely autos as well as auto ancillaries have been pretty flat with investors turning very, very selective over what they want to play in that sector.


What about in the broader markets? Is it still looking like a very painful picture there? Would you even go into trying to find some opportunities? What is happening there?The money that has moved in from the managers has predominantly gone to largecaps. Quality names like the HDFC twins, Kotak Mahindra Bank, some of the corporate names like ICICI and Axis continue to get flows. On the flip side, we have also seen some outflows from some of the stocks that clearly have not gone anywhere like ONGC, Power Grid. 


So is it a trend that is emerging there or is it very stock specific?It is becoming a little stock specific in that sense. But the other interesting trend that we noticed which is probably a very peculiar thing that we have seen is some promoter selloff or strategic selloff like we saw in Emami where the promoter to pay debt actually sold stake and mutual funds did pick that up fair bit. Piramal sold exposure in the Shriram Transport Finance and we have seen funds picking up exposure to some of these names. But I think that is again like I said very stock specific rather than a more broad-based trend.


What about consumption? We continue to talk about slowdown. Is that a space that we are looking at from a slightly longer term view? When could things stabilise?Consumption is a basket. If I just look at the defensives part of it, given that there is no long-term-ish view, they are building some defensive positions. Likes of HUL, ITC is being added to portfolio on the basis of valuations. It is not a very large position but you can clearly see that is another trend that has added some exposure to that sector.


I see Godrej Properties is on the list and it seems to be a consistent favourite all around. Talk to us about that.Godrej is largely driven by the QIP that they did. In that space, probably DLF is one of the names that was being picked up earlier but Godrej probably is the other name that sees some interest.


What is the outlook on real estate then? It has been performing well at least at the start of this year but I do not know how things will improve incrementally?When we speak to the managers, I do not think see a broad-based interest in real estate stocks, saying optimism is nowhere on the horizon. Right now, the interest is very selective. There are some specific names that could potentially be a plays what they look at.


What about banks and financials?Banks and financials has always remained that blue eyed boy but even there, you can slice and dice. Corporate banks clearly remain the focus and ICICI, Axis continue to get flows. Quality names like HDFC Bank continue to get flows but if you go into some of the mid-tier banks, I do not think we have seen flows coming in at all. In fact, Federal Bank has lost some money, Ratnakar is not really getting too many flows coming in. Yes Bank has seen outflows. The exposure was not large but obviously given the concerns around that, money has moved out. IndusInd is a name where we saw selling in prior quarters, but we have seen some positions being added, given what they are talking about, probably the provisioning is in place now. Things should look better from now on. IndusInd is something where we have seen some buying. 

On the HFC space again it is the quality names. LIC Housing Finance, HDFC are the guys getting flows.


Any trend that you are seeing when it comes to pharma? What kind of companies are being picked out?It is actually a mix. Some domestic names like Ajanta is finding interest but it is very stock specific. There is not one trend that you can draw. But the interesting bit given the way the valuations have come off for a lot of these in terms of the stock prices, is that people are considering value picking in some of these counters.


Are metals a complete no show?Looks like. Tata Steel was a large sell, given the amount of pain they are suffering on their European part of the business. That is something that we have not seen and so there is a lot of money has moved out from Tata Steel as well.


If you had to sum up in terms of just the mood and the key trends, which was the pick?I would say the mood is cautious. Obviously flows have also not been that strong and managers are being very selective and not painting everything with a broad brush. Over the long term, we are still optimistic but we need to see a lot more happening on the ground in terms of the results panning out the way managers would want them to and really seeing that growth pickup happens before they can thump the table and say look we are going to aggressively allocate money across sectors. It is going to be a much more sort of selective play right now."

40,2019-07-19,PowerGrid,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), India’s largest domestic institutional investor, raised bets on select banks as well as agrochemical, pharma and FMCG stocks during June quarter, which saw domestic equity benchmark Sensex gain marginally 1.87 per cent to 39,395 as of June 28, 2019 from 38,673 on March 29, 2019. 

The insurance behemoth offloaded shares of telecom, power, mining, public sector banks, NBFCs, power generation and oil exploration firms during the quarter.

Private sector lenders emerged as institutional investors’ favourites amid hopes that with adequate provisioning and fewer concerns over incremental slippages, corporate-focused players would see an improvement in return on assets going forward. 

Shareholding pattern of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Federal Bank showed a rise in LIC holding, according to data from corporate database Ace Equity. Among the companies that have reported their shareholding data so far, LIC held a stake in 150.

Federal Bank recently posted a 46.25 per cent rise in June quarter profit at Rs 384.21 crore on healthy growth in non-crore income and stable asset quality. Brokerage Anand Rathi has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Federal Bank with a price target of Rs 130. 

Shares of Federal Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have rallied 10 per cent and 22 per cent on a year-to-date basis till July 17, while the benchmark Sensex has gained 7 per cent in the same period.



Among the public sector banks, LIC upped stake in Bank of Baroda, but cut holdings in Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India.

Punjab National Bank earlier this month reported a fraud of more than Rs 3,800 crore by Bhushan Power & Steel. The development came at a time when the bank was coping with a major financial fraud of around Rs 13,000 crore by diamond merchant Nirav Modi.

Mutual funds also increased holdings in some of the private banks during June quarter, raising their total exposure by 370 basis points to 19.90 per cent YoY and 20 basis points QoQ. 

The domestic equity market was upbeat through much of June quarter amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) on hopes of the Narendra Modi government coming back to power. FIIs poured more than Rs 30,000 crore in domestic stocks during April-June.

Beyond banking, LIC also increased stake in pesticide and agrochemicals firm UPL, industrial gases and fuel firm GAIL India, FMCG major ITC, pharma and drug companies Granules India and Bliss GVS Pharma and household and personal product-related firm Gillette India. 

Among others, Blue Dart Express, Havells India and Adani Ports also reported a rise in LIC holding during the quarter. 

On the other hand, the insurance behemoth brought down its stake in MTNL to 14.56 per cent at the end of June quarter from 18.49 per cent in the preceding quarter. It also reduced stake in Power Grid (from 7.50 per cent to 4.89 per cent), BHEL (14.13 per cent to 11.67 per cent), NMDC (14.72 per cent to 12.89 per cent) and Shipping Corporation of India (11.91 per cent to 10.32 per cent). 

It also cut stake in other companies including Welspun Corp, Nalco, NTPC, SAIL, Paisalo Digital, OMDC, Tamboli Captal, Oil India and SV Global Mill.

41,2019-07-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their decline for the 2nd day on Friday as markets witnessed a sharp sell-off aided by auto, NBFC and PSU bank stocks. 

Analysts said that disappointing earnings and reports of slowing economic growth dented market sentiments and they also felt that absence of any fresh positive triggers has been the reason that the markets haven't been able to shake off the negativity after the budget proposals.

Asian Development Bank lowered India's GDP growth forecast to 7 per cent for the current year on the back of fiscal shortfall concerns. Meanwhile, the Finance minister on Thursday stuck to her Budget proposal and declined to remove the applicability of the new surcharge on the super rich on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) which further hurt the sentiments. She said they should adopt a corporate structure to avoid the levy.

Also, slow progress of moonsoon weighed on investors' risk appetite as IMD had said that India’s monsoon rains were 20 per cent below average in the week ending on Wednesday, as rainfall was scanty over the central, western and southern parts of the country raising concerns over the output of summersown crops.

Meanwhile, shares of Reliance Industries were in focus today as the company is scheduled to announce its June quarter earnings later today. The shares of RIL closed 1 per cent lower at Rs 1249 on BSE. Analysts expect that the oil-to-telecom conglomerate may deliver muted profit growth due to challenges in the refining and petchem segment. However, telecom arm Jio and retail business may drive performance, analysts said. 

On the global front, Asian shares closed higher while European shares also jumped after a speech by a top Federal Reserve official further cementing expectations for a US interest rate cut at the end of July, fuelling appetite for risky assets and capping the dollar. But in an unusual move, a New York Fed representative later clarified that the speech was academic in nature, based on 20 years of research, and “not about potential policy actions” at the Fed’s rate-setting meeting on July 30-31. 

BSE Sensex closed 560.45 points, or 1.44 per cent, lower at 38,337.01. While NSE Nifty ended at 11,419.25, down 177.65 points or 1.53 per cent. 


Market at a glance 
In the 30-pack Sensex, 4 stocks ended in the green and 26 in the red with M&M as the worst performer and NTPC the best. Bajaj Finance, IndusInd Bank, YES Bank and Hero MotoCorp too joined M&M on the losers list, slipping up to 5 per cent. 

TCS, Power Grid and ONGC were among other Sensex stocks that advanced. 

The BSE Midcap index declined 1.99 per cent and the BSE Smallcap index ended 1.83 per cent lower, underperforming benchmark Sensex. 

BSE Auto index recorded losses of 3.24 per cent followed by Finance, Consumer Discretionary and Bankex index.

In terms of index contribution, TCS, NTPC and Power Grid were the top support while HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and ITC were the top drag on Sensex. 

Expert Take
Market slid as there was sharp sell-off by foreign funds due to the government’s reluctance to tweak FPIs income tax surcharge, and the deficiency in monsoon rain, which impacted risk sentiment. Additionally, downward revision in India’s growth to 7% by ADB and lackluster earnings from domestic corporates added anxiety over premium valuation.

42,2019-07-20,PowerGrid,"The global markets are having an undoubtedly strong party and our markets are sitting over here, sweating it out, trying to grapple through the domestic news flow, says Kunal Bothra, Independent Market Analyst in a conversation with ET NOW.


Across the board, there has been selling pressure, volatility has been at a low and nothing spared the carnage, be it largecaps or midcaps. What is on the horizon?

I will try and address it in two different ongoing situations. One is that the global markets are having an undoubtedly strong party and our markets are sitting over here, sweating it out, trying to grapple through the domestic news flow which has been going on for the last couple of weeks. I think that is one big overhang because if the global party takes a pause and our markets rejoin them, how would the balance be for our markets? That is a very big question mark because we are severely underperforming with such a strong global market. Then you look at the second spectrum which is the market internals. The largecap falling indicates there still is a lot of institutional wholesale selling which is happening in the stocks. It is not just retail-based selling because not only midcap stocks but even largecaps participated on the downside. Nifty is breaking some key supports in terms of technical levels and thus the internals of the markets are also not improving. All those signs indicate that there could be more pain left for the indices. Rather than playing for a very short-term bounce, which could happen if the indicators are oversold, play for medium-term downtrend which could be the trend for the next couple of weeks.


How do you expect IndiGo to behave when the market opens on Monday?

The stock should open with a decent gap up as it has shown a lot of resilience, not just last week and especially on Friday, but throughout the last 9-10 months of this heightened market volatility; a complex situation. IndiGo stock has managed to perform extremely well. So, it should not come as a surprise to the market. Now, the next level of targets for IndiGo could be closer to Rs 1590-1600 and that is where I believe the stock should be heading on the back of these strong results.


What are your top picks for the week ahead?

I will go with one buy and one sell recommendation. We are expecting the market to remain volatile for the first half of next week as well. So, the first is a buy on Power Grid. We saw a lot of PSUs making a very good comeback on Friday in terms of price patterns and volumes coming back. Power Grid could be in line for some more recovery. It has also traditionally been one of the low bit of stocks. With the market getting a bit volatile, try to shield trading ideas with a few low beta names. In that regard, Power Grid is a buy with a target of Rs 212 and the stop loss at Rs 202. 

Apollo Tyres is a stock I have been bearish on for the last couple of weeks or rather months. The stock continues to drag lower. In fact, on Friday, the stock made a fresh low swing for itself. So, the weakness could continue for Apollo. Hence I suggest a sell call there, with a target of Rs 165 approximately and stop loss at Rs 180."
43,2019-07-22,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Tata Realty and Infrastructure (TRIL), a wholly-owned unit of Tata Sons, is set to exit the roads business by selling four of its projects, for which preliminary talks are on with Singaporean sovereign fund GIC Pte, two people aware of negotiations told ET.

Subsidiary TRIL Roads Pvt Ltd owns the four National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) toll road projects on offer.

TRIL has hired Ambit Capital to find a buyer. Feelers were sent out to global investors such as Macquarie, Cube Highways and Canadian fund CDPQ, said one of the sources. “The formal sale process will begin in a couple of weeks. But the management has already begun discussions with GIC,” said one of the sources cited above. The deal size could not be ascertained.

Two of the assets are operational — the Durg Bypass in Chhattisgarh and the 110-km Pune-Solapur Expressway on NH65 in Maharashtra. The other two are under construction — the 120-km Hampi Expressway section of NH13 in Karnataka, and Uchit Expressway of 93.5 km from Chittorgarh to Udaipur on NH76.

Earlier, CDPQ and TRIL discussed setting up a platform as the fund’s entry vehicle into the Indian roads sector, but talks remained inconclusive. 




Incorporated in 2007 for undertaking infrastructure and real estate projects through special purpose vehicles (SPVs), TRIL has a portfolio of IT parks such as TRIL IT4 in Mumbai and Ramanujan IT Park in Chennai; Trilium Malls in Nagpur and Amritsar; and residential projects in Kochi and Nagpur. It also owns ropeway services in Manali, Dharmashala and Matheran.

TRIL and CDPQ declined to comment, while mails sent to GIC, Macquarie and Cube Highways remained unanswered.

TRIL has been less active in road projects, with the last winning award dating back more than two years. After winning the Chattisgarh-based Durg Bypass road project from NHAI in April 2017, TRIL Roads did not sign any project with the national highways authority.

However, another infrastructure subsidiary, TRIL Urban Transport Ltd, remains an active investor.

GIC manages assets worth more than $100 billion, and has been an active investor in the Indian infrastructure space. In May, GIC, along with private equity firm KKR, invested Rs 2,060 crore in Sterlite Power Grid Ventures - sponsored IndiGrid, an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT). GIC Holdings owns more than 60% stake in Hyderabad-based renewable energy producer Greenko Energy Holdings. GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) invested more than $1.5 billion in Greenko. Global pension funds and sovereign wealth funds have lately invested in Indian road projects."

45,2019-07-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: There was no relief for domestic equities on Monday, as frontline indices Sensex and Nifty lurched lower sharply amid a major selloff in morning trade.

Overseas foreign investors’ money continued to exit the market after the Union Finance Minister clarified that the newly-imposed income-tax surcharge in the higher income bracket is here to stay. 

Uninspiring quarterly numbers, weak global cues, rising crude oil prices, a geopolitical flareup in West Asia and rupee's weakness further deteriorated investor sentiment.

How to trade in such a market? Be cautious and remain stock-specific, say analysts.

Based on recommendations from various analysts and brokerages, here are eight stocks that the analysts said should log some gains over the next two to three weeks. 


Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivatives Analyst, HDFC securities

Indraprastha Gas (IGL) | Buy | Target price: Rs 350 | Stop loss: Rs 310 
IGL has shown a lot of relative strength in past two weeks. While the market has been in correction mode, IGL shares have rallied smartly from the lows of Rs 295 to gain almost 10 per cent in last two weeks. Technical indicators, too, are giving positive signals as the recent rally in the stock has led it to close above the 13-day and 50-day SMAs. The 14-day RSI is in rising mode and not overbought. The Relative Strength indicator also is in an uptrend, indicating that the stock is set to outperform Nifty.


Just Dial | Buy | Target price: Rs 860 | Stop loss: Rs 750
This stock has been consolidating in the Rs 743-796 range for the past several weeks. This week, it bounced back from the lower end of the trading range on healthy volumes, despite weakness in the broader market. In the process, the stock has closed above the 13-day SMA. The 14-day RSI, too, has bounced back and cut its nine-day EMA from below, which is a positive signal.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking

Gujarat State Petronet | Buy | Target price: Rs 230 | Stop loss: Rs 190
In spite of the recent carnage in midcaps, this stock has shown a comparative outperformance. On the weekly chart, the stock has finally broken above the hurdle after facing resistance around the Rs 200 mark for more than six times in last three months, thus confirming a bullish reversal ‘Inverse Head N Shoulder’ pattern. The said breakout was supported by an increase in volume. In addition, momentum oscillator RSI is placed in the positive zone supporting the ‘buy’ call. The stock price is well above major moving averages such as 50-DSMA and 200-DSMA, indicating overall bullishness on the counter. “Since there is weakness in the broader market, we recommend buying this stock on dips at Rs 204 for a target of Rs 230 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 190,” said Bhosale.


Infosys | Buy | Target price: Rs 830 | Stop loss: Rs 740
Market participants have given a thumbs up to its better-than-expected quarterly earnings. As a result, the prices have witnessed a gap-up opening and the optimism got extended last week. On the weekly chart, the stock has been gyrating in the Rs 760-690 range for past four months and the prices have since broken above the higher range, confirming a breakout of the rectangular channel pattern. The said breakout is supported by a gap termed as ‘Breakaway Gap’ and with a good increase in volume. Momentum oscillator RSI is in the overbought zone. However, the structure seems to be placed positively. “We recommend buying this stock on dips to Rs 770 for a target of Rs 830 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 740,"" said Bhosale.


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Kaveri Seed Company | Buy | Target price: Rs 480 | Stop loss: Rs 415
This stock has bounced back from an important support placed around Rs 433 and has closed above its last four-days’ close, making it a reversal pattern. The stock has also closed above its Head and Shoulder neckline, after giving a false breakdown, indicating buying at lower levels. Volume has been much higher compared with the average volume in July and almost thrice of its last three-day average. “We believe Kaveri Seed can see a short-term bounce till Rs 480. Have a stop loss at Rs 415,” said Nadeem.


Engineers India | Buy | Target price: Rs 115 | Stop loss: Rs 101 
This stock has formed a double bottom on the daily chart with a Harami pattern. With that, there is a positive divergence on the charts with the stock making lower lows and the RSI moving higher sustaining the previous lows. “This can result in buying at lower levels and prices can move to a higher target of Rs 115,” Nadeem said.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

BEML | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,017 | Stop loss: Rs 890
After the recent breakout of price and volume, this counter appears to be in a minor consolidation mode of 50 points since last six sessions and it looks ripe for a fresh breakout above this range as it almost remained indifferent to the broader selloff witnessed in the market. “Positional traders should go long with a stop below Rs 890 on a closing basis and look for a target of Rs 1,017,” said Mohammad.


Kaveri Seed Company | Buy | Target price: Rs 480 | Stop loss: Rs 410
This counter strongly recoiled in the last session on relatively higher volumes without violating its corrective swing low of Rs 412, hinting that a fresh short-term upswing might be in progress. In such a scenario, the correction which is in progress from the highs of Rs 559–412 may get at least briefly arrested, paving the way for a pullback which can test its interim top placed at Rs 482. “Positional traders are advised to create fresh longs by adopting a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines close to Rs 420 and look for a target of Rs 480,” Mohammad said


SMC Global Securities

Power Grid Corporation of India | Buy | Target price: Rs 220-225 | Stop loss: Rs 190 
The 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) of the stock on the daily chart is currently placed at Rs 194.13. The stock is in the consolidation zone but holds its higher levels, trading in high highs and lows. Apart from this, it has formed an Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the weekly charts and seen a breakout of the same while trading higher. “This shows that the buying momentum can continue in the coming days. One can buy the stock in the Rs 200-204 range for an upside target at Rs 220-225 levels with a stop loss below Rs 190,” the brokerage said.

56,2019-07-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their losses for the fourth day in a volatile trading session on Tuesday as the markets witnessed selling pressure in auto, pharma and PSU banking counters. Meanwhile, IT and FMCG indices offered some support to the markets.

Investors mostly remained cautious throughout the day on disappointing June-quarter earnings as the HDFC twins continued their downtrend. Investors are now keeping a close watch on HUL, ZEEL, L&T and NIIT Technologies, who are scheduled to announce their June-quarter results later today, for further cues. Analysts expect volatility to persist in the coming sessions as the markets are expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings season.

Analysts said that markets have entered a bearish phase amid concerns over an economic slowdown and weak corporate earnings and believe that concerns over tax and muted Q1 results will continue to hamper the sentiments. Also, with lack of any fresh positive domestic triggers and uncertain global cues, markets may maintain a cautious stance for the coming days. 

Heavy foreign fund outflow and weak monsoon were also hurting investor sentiment, analysts added. IMD had recently said that deficient rainfall was expected over half of India this season. 

On the global front, Asian shares closed higher on expectations that the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.95 per cent while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.04 per cent.

57,2019-07-24,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices started off on a firm note on Wednesday, tracking firm cues from the global markets, but concerns surrounding massive FII outflows, rising crude prices and earnings weighed on domestic market.

Meanwhile, IMF cut India’s growth estimates by 0.3 per cent to 7 per cent for 2019 and to 7.2 per cent for 2020, saying its GDP will grow slower on weaker-than expected outlook for domestic demand.

The volatility also remained high ahead of the July futures and options expiry on Thursday. India VIX spiked 4 per cent.

Oil prices rose, extending gains after an industry group reported a much bigger-than-expected drop in US inventories. Brent crude futures rose 24 cents, or 0.4%, to $64.07 a barrel, while WTI futures gained 22 cents. 

The rupee on Wednesday opened 15 paise down at 69.09 against the US dollar due to stronger greenback against major currencies and sustained foreign fund outflows. “Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 68.65 and 69.20,” brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market participants would keep a close eye on stocks such of Asian Paints, Jubilant Foodworks, ICICI Prudential, Canara Bank, Bharti Infratel, Oberoi Realty and Shriram Transport, Karur Vysya, IDFC First Bank, Monsanto India, Quess Corp and Syndicate Bank, which are among entities which will announce June quarter results today.

62,2019-07-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended flat in Thursday's trading session amid high volatility triggered by expiry of July futures and options contracts. 

The markets fluctuated between gains and losses throughout the day as Nifty witnessed its worst F&O series since October 2018. The benchmarks were dragged by PSU banks and metal shares while pharma and IT counters lent some support.

Analysts said that markets witnessed profit booking at higher levels and traders used 'sell on rise' strategy due to weak market sentiments. 

Analysts felt that concerns over an economic slowdown, weak corporate earnings, heavy foreign fund outflow and weak monsoon would continue to weigh on the domestic market in the coming days. 

Bajaj Finance was among the top losers in the Sensex pack slipping nearly 6 per cent on BSE as the company's record quarterly profits failed to cheer investors.

The company on Thursday said its consolidated net profit jumped 43 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to a record Rs 1,195 crore in June quarter. The NBFC had reported a profit of Rs 836 crore in the same quarter last year. The profit number came largely in line with ET Now poll estimate of Rs 1,200 crore. But, the provisions for the quarter surged 69 per cent YoY to Rs 551 crore from Rs 327 crore posted in same quarter last year. 

Investors are now keeping a close watch on Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Vedanta and JSW Steel, who are scheduled to announce their June quarter results tomorrow, for further cues. Analysts expect volatility to persist in the coming sessions, as the markets are expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings season.

On the global front, Asian shares closed with modest gains ahead of the European Central Bank meeting. Japan's Nikkei touched a near three-month high while Australian shares ended near a 12-year peak after its central bank chief stressed that interest rates could continue to fall. 

BSE Sensex closed 16.67 points, or 0.04 per cent, lower at 37,830.98. While NSE Nifty ended at 11,252.15, down 19.15 points or 0.17 per cent.

65,2019-07-26,PowerGrid,"Andhra Pradesh on Friday regulated electricity supply from wind power plants during peak hours for second day in row in gross violation of regulatory norms, which might escalate its ongoing legal spat with the renewable energy companies in the high court.

Sources said the curtailment was undertaken by the state without attributing any valid reason and even as there was no abnormality in frequency of national grid on Friday. But the state decided to ramp up its thermal generation and disconnect renewable plants causing them losses. On Thursday, the state backed down about 3000-mw of solar and wind capacity which across the country enjoys ‘must-run’ status.

Officials in the National Load Despatch Centre or the agency to maintain national power grid said there were no transmission constraints or disturbances in the grid to justify the back down of wind plants by Andhra Pradesh. “80% of wind power plants supplying to the state were backed down and were allowed to come on-line only after peak hours. At around 5pm on Friday the wind plants were operating at 20% capacity,” an official said.

The back down of solar and wind power generation attracts penalties under state’s electricity grid code which gives renewable energy projects ‘must-run’ status. The Andhra Pradesh state electricity regulatory commission can take suo-moto action against the state load despatch centre, the grid managing agency, sources said.

According to sources, the southern region load despatch centre had on Thursday asked the state load despatch centre to back down some of its power generation as the national grid frequency was high at 50.3 Hz around noon. The grid frequency is maintained at around 50 Hz, but it rises when inter-state drawals of electricity decline.

At around 4.30pm on Thursday, about 1100-mw of wind power generation was restored and only 550-mw solar could be partly brought on line as the Sun had started setting in, he added. “Solar was at its peak when the plants were asked to shut down,” he said.

Andhra Pradesh is in a legal battle with renewable energy developers as the state has asked them to revise down electricity tariffs. The newly formed Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the state in its July 1 notification, also sought to challenge its electricity regulator’s previous decision to award ‘must-run’status to renewable projects.

Renewable power plants across the country enjoy ‘must-run’ status. This was done to promote clean energy projects facilitate their integration in the grid. Power supply by a state despatch centre is arranged in the order of their cost, starting with the lowest tariff. This process, called merit order despatch, is carried on till demand of the state is met. However, power generated from renewables is not curtailed in any case."
64,2019-07-26,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Mutual funds mostly lapped up financials and software services stocks in June, even as they shunned energy companies within the largecap universe.

TCS was the most sought after stock among mutual funds in June, as they lapped up Rs 866 crore shares, data from Morningstar showed. This was followed by HDFC, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank.

“Mutual funds were underweight IT, and are coming back through select names such as TCS and the like,” said Kaustubh Belapurkar, director of fund research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

TCS, India’s top software services exporter, missed Street estimates on June quarter revenue, as spending in the key banking and financial services segment slowed. The company said its performance in the ongoing quarter would be key to meeting its full-year target of double-digit growth.

“Incrementally, cautious commentary led by weak BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) outlook is a negative. Further, the current quarter will be critical with improved performance to aid double-digit growth for the year,” Reliance Securities said in a note on July 10.

“We expect the stock to remain subdued in the next quarter owing to below-par revenue performance,” Reliance Securities said.

Belapurkar said financials were a large part of the index. “There has been this thrust towards corporate banks for last 9-12 months. HDFC twins – are the quality names, and continue to see flows,” added Belpurkar.
That was a popular tone

“Financials is one-third of the index, so, even if one has a mildly positive view, you can’t but buy financials. Among the financials space, private lenders are preferred,” Dipen Sheth, head of institutional research at HDFC Securities

“Interest rates are also headed southwards, which makes a case for financials,” added Sheth. 

The other banks that found their names in the top large cap buys were Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank.
The stock they sold the most was Tata Steel. They sold a collective of Rs 655 crore worth the company’s stocks.

The most-sold large cap stocks in the list included Power Grid, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, GAIL (India), Hindustan Petroleum, Coal India.

Belapurkar said energy stocks have been drags on the portfolio and mutual funds have been cutting exposure. Sheth pointed that all of these energy companies were state-owned.

“The Street is increasingly wary of a government which is not letting go the control and command approach over PSUs . The driving style is too socialist. Even if these stocks look attractive from valuation perspective, the way some of them are run is a turn off,” Sheth said."
66,2019-07-28,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Come week will be data-heavy as far as earnings, high frequency data and regulatory decisions are concerned. So far, the sentiment on Dalal Street has been fragile, as suggested by the third straight week of fall for benchmark indices, thanks to a less-than-expected set of earnings and cues suggesting slowdown globally.

For the week, Sensex fell 454 points, or 1.18 per cent to 37,883. Nifty fell 135 points, or 1.18 per cent to 11,284. 


Here are a couple of factors which may sway the market direction next week:


US Fed policy: If we go by a Reuters poll of economists, the US central bank is all set to cut policy rate in its two-day policy review starting Tuesday. This would be the first time in over a decade when the Fed will reduce policy rates. As per the poll, a 25 basis points Federal Reserve interest rate cut is almost a done deal. The Reuters poll anticipates another rate cut later in the year amid rising economic risks from the ongoing US-China trade war. 


Q1 results of a dozen Nifty firms: Dr Reddy’s Labs will announce its June quarter results on Monday; Axis Bank, Hero Motocorp and Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday; UPL, IOC and Eicher Motors on Wednesday while SBI, ITC, HDFC, Bharti Airtel and Power Grid will release June quarter earnings on Friday. NMDC, Ashok Leyland, DHFL will be other firms announcing their quarterly results this week.


US-China negotiators to meet in Shanghai: Lead negotiators for China and the United States will meet in Shanghai on Tuesday for two days in the next round of trade talks, China’s commerce ministry confirmed this week

It would mark the first face-to-face meeting between US and Chinese trade teams since presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping agreed at a G20 summit in Japan to revive talks to end their year-long trade war, Reuters reported.


High frequency data releases:  Next week will see release of trade data. Readings such as manufacturing and service PMIs, auto sales numbers, core sector output and July GST collections will also be keenly followed. The numbers may hold the key when the RBI's monetary policy committee meeton August 5-7.


GST council meet outcome: The council in its meet on Saturday brought down the GST on electric vehicles (EVs) to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. It also slashed the GST on EV Chargers from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. The new rates will be effective from 1st August 2019. Besides, it approved exemption from GST on hiring of Electric Buses by local authorities. The move will influence shares of auto and auto component makers."
67,2019-07-29,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: After registering a flat opening, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty turned negative on Monday, mirroring depressed sentiments of other Asian markets, as investors anxiously awaited a likely rate cut by the US Fed on Wednesday.

Market sentiment was sombre owing to multiple domestic as well as global factors. Earnings disappointments, concerns over a weakening economy and prolonged liquidity distress in the financial system have dented investors’ risk appetite.

FPIs have been on a selling spree on Dalal Street since the Union Budget.

While there has been pessimism all around, analysts said investors should adopt a stock-specific approach to be able to reap gains and minimise losses. Based on the recommendations of various analysts and brokerages, here is a list of 11 stocks that they say can potentially deliver gains over the next 2-3 weeks.


Gajendra Prabu, Senior Technical & Derivatives Analyst, HDFC Securities

SBI Life Insurance | Buy | Target price: Rs 860 | Stop loss: Rs 750This stock has not corrected much in a falling market. In fact, it made a new lifetime high when the fall got extended. Momentum indicators like MACD and KST are looking positive, which can keep the momentum intact. The stock has been forming higher highs and lows, which is a bullish continuation structure. In addition, the stock has been trading above all the key moving averages. ""Traders may look to buy the stock at current market price and add on dips to Rs 770 level for an upside target of Rs 860 over the next 2-3 weeks,"" said Prabu.


Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,630 | Stop loss: Rs 2,360This stock is comparatively strong, compared with its peers in the auto space. It has been forming a contracting triangle (CT) for last 13-14 days, while other stocks have been making lower lows. At this juncture, CT is a bullish development. Technical indicator RSI is showing a positive divergence, which could add to the positive momentum. ""Traders may look to buy the stock at the current market price 2,467 for an upside target of Rs 2,630 over the next 2-3 weeks and place a stop loss at Rs 2,360 on a closing basis,"" said Prabu.

Unlike the broader market, this counter appears to have bottomed out ahead of others with a low of Rs 568 registered on July 22, indicating better relative strength. With a five-day consolidation around this level, it appears to be positioning itself for a pullback rally. “Positional traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 640, with a stop loss at Rs 567,"" said Mohammad.


SRF | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,647This stock appears to have posted a near-term bottom at the recent low of Rs 2,612 and appears to be on the verge of a pullback as it erased the losses of the past three sessions on last Friday with a strong bullish candle. “There can be an initial hurdle around Rs 2,798 level, but once it manages to close above that level, its momentum shall strengthen further towards Rs 2,900 level,"" said Mohammad.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking

Lupin | Buy | Target price: Rs 830 | Stop loss: Rs 748
After forming a base on the long-term support zone at Rs 720, which has been acting as a strong demand zone for last one year, this stock has started moving higher. ""On the daily chart, we are witnessing a series of higher bottom formations, which indicate a bullish reversal on the strong support zone,"" said Bhosale. Recent volume analysis indicates higher volume during rallies and comparatively low volume during down moves, which indicates accumulation on the counter. In addition, momentum oscillator RSI is placed in the positive zone supporting the buy call.


Power Grid Corporation | Buy | Target price: Rs 227 | Stop loss: Rs 203
In last month, this stock witnessed a strong consolidation by breaking above the barrier of Rs 205 of last two years, which previously acted as a hurdle on four occasions. However, the stock lacked followup buying, as the oscillators were placed in deep overbought territory. At the current juncture, after witnessing a time-wise correction for last few sessions, the stock has resumed a primary uptrend by confirming a range breakout. Momentum oscillator RSI has started moving higher after a minor dip, which suggests a fresh leg of upmove in the near term. ""As the stock is trading in the unchartered territory, it is well above major moving averages, indicating strong optimism,"" Bhosale said.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFC Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,420 | Stop loss: Rs 2,240This stock has seen a price erosion recently and bottomed out near Rs 2,245. The bounceback has been strong with a positive bias, while the RSI has indicated a trend reversal to give a ‘buy’ signal. “With the charts looking attractive, we recommend a ‘buy’ on this stock with an upside target of Rs 2,420, keeping a stop loss of Rs 2,240,"" said Parekh.


Dr Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,575This stock has been in consolidation mode for quite some time and has picked up momentum to cross above the 200-DMA, improving the bias. The RSI has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy. ""With the chart looking promising, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 2,900, keeping a stop loss of Rs 2,575,"" Parekh said.


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager- Technical Analysis, YES Securities

Federal Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 100-104 | Stop loss: Rs 92On the weekly chart, Federal Bank has taken support at the lower end of the channel pattern, which happens to be the 200-DMA on the daily time frame. Further, the stock has turned higher after halting at the 189 per cent Fibonacci extension level, which signals higher levels in the coming trading sessions. The RSI has turned upward after testing the oversold zone of sub-25 zone, indicating the possibility of the stock touching higher levels in the coming sessions.


LIC Housing Finance | Buy | Target price: Rs 556-580 | Stop loss: Rs 502On the daily chart, LIC Housing Finance is on the verge of a breakout from a channel pattern suggesting bullishness building up in the share. A sustained trade above Rs 530 level will trigger a breakout from the pattern which can take it higher to levels of Rs 556-580. On the weekly chart, it has taken support at an uptrend line, confirming demand at lower levels. Moreover, RSI has formed a positive divergence and turned north indicating at the bullishness in the stock.


Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Bajaj Auto | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,740 | Stop loss: Rs 2,540A classic double bottom pattern is seen on the daily chart at Rs 2,500. A reversal high wave candle with a long white candlestick confirms the bottom. The RSI, which was in the oversold zone below 30, has also reversed and is now moving up. ""We expect this to be a short term uptrend with targets of Rs 2,740,"" said Nadeem.


Dr Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,900 | Stop loss: Rs 2,620This stock has bottomed out recently as prices have now moved above the consolidation area it has been in for the last two months. The RSI is showing positive divergence on the daily scale in the short term and it making higher highs. A positive crossover is also seen with 50-days MA, indicating a resumption of the uptrend in the short term.

68,2019-07-29,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Friday’s gains in equities proved to be shortlived as equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty on Monday resumed their downward movement, falling up to 0.84 per cent.

Weak Asian markets combined with continuous outflow of foreign funds weighed on investor sentiment. “The market started the week on the feeble note and lost nearly one per cent. Weak Asian markets combined with continuous outflow of the foreign funds are weighing on sentiment. The market is largely focusing on weak domestic sentiment while global cues remain mixed,” said Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking.

Investors stayed away from riskier equities, awaiting anxiously for the Fed outcome on Wednesday. Uninspiring earnings and lack of positive triggers continued to keep risk appetite low. 

Here is a breakdown of the key highlights of Monday's session. Take a look:


400 stocks plumb 52-week lowsAs many as 405 stocks, including Bajaj Auto, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland and EID Parry (India), plumb 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, Asian Paints, Adhunik Industries, Banas Finance, Kratos Energy & Infrastructure, Mac Hotels and Procter & Gamble Health were among the 26 stocks that hit 52-week highs.


Upper & lower circuitsIndiabulls Integrated Services, Cox & Kings, Unitech, Essar Shipping, 5paisa Capital and SORIL Infra Resources were among the 242 stocks that hit their lower circuits. On the other hand, 118 stocks, including Jubilant Industries, Astec Lifesciences, Mangalam Drugs & Organics, 63 Moons Technologies, Electrotherm (India), HOV Services and Manaksia Steels, hit upper circuits.


Rs 1.36 lakh crore gone in a dayMonday's losses in equities dragged the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,42,45,433.92 crore from Rs 1,43,82,243.21 crore on Friday, making investors poorer by Rs 1.36 lakh crore in a single day!


Above & below 200-DMAsLarsen & Toubro, NTPC, Voltamp Transformers, NIIT Technologies, Mahindra Lifespace Developers, India Cements, Bank of Maharashtra, Adani Transmission and Max Financial Services were among the stocks that witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200-DMAs. However, JSW Energy, Grindwell Norto and Jubilant Industries were among those who traded above 200-DMAs.


74 stocks show potential for riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 74 counters on BSE, signalling these stocks may witness gains in the coming sessions. Among those stocks were Suzlon Energy, TCS, Mindtree, GHCL, HCL Technologies, Deepak Fertilisers, Binani Industries and Varun Beverages. On the other hand, Vedanta, HDFC Life Insurance, Power Grid Corporation, Ambuja Cements, Hindustan Unilever and PVR were among the 56 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.


140 stocks now oversold Momentum oscillator Relative Strength Index, or RSI, showed 140 stocks, including Ballarpur Industries, Vodafone Idea, Tejas Networks, RBL Bank, HCC, Marksans Pharma and Tata Elxsi, in the oversold zone on BSE. On the other hand, VR Films & Studios, Goenka Business, Yashraj Containeurs, EIS and Mandhana Industries were among the 18 stocks that entered the overbought zone.


Auto top sectoral loserBSE Auto, with a loss of 3.55 per cent, finished as the top loser among the sectoral indices on BSE after the government proposed to hike registration cost on new vehicles. The index ended with all components in the red, with Tata Motors (down 6.52 per cent), Apollo Tyres (down 6 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 4.99 per cent), Eicher Motors (down 4.81 per cent) and Motherson Sumi Systems (down 4.34 per cent) as the top losers. Maruti's poor Q1 numbers also aggravated a selloff in shares of auto companies which have been grappling to cope with a slump in demand in the wake of liquidity crunch in the financial space, weak monsoon and changes in emission and safety norms. 


Vodafone Idea plunges 27%Shares of Vodafone Idea plunged 26.81 per cent to close the day at Rs 6.77 after weak results for the fiscal first quarter, which prompted analysts to fear that the telco could rapidly be relegated to a regional player if it fails to grow revenue in the coming quarters. 


Maruti shares down 4%Shares of Maruti Suzuki closed 4.26 per cent down at Rs 5,558.05 today. India’s largest carmaker on Friday reported a 27.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit at Rs 1,435.50 crore for June quarter on weak volumes and higher depreciation expenses. While the company’s slump in profit was broadly on the expected lines, projected near-term pressure on volumes and demand has prompted analysts to turn cautious on the stock. 


ICICI Bank climbs 3%Shares of ICICI Bank ended 3.32 per cent higher at Rs 429.30 after the lender’s June quarter earnings impressed investors on Dalal Street. Brokerages say the scrip has potential to rally 25-50 per cent in next one year, as incremental stress at the second-largest private bank moderates with the shrinkage of the pool of low-rated corporate exposure. 


DRL declines ahead of earningsShares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) closed 1.92 per cent down at Rs 2,652.55 ahead of its June quarter numbers. Post the market hours, the company said its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the June quarter climbed 45 per cent on year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 662.80 crore compared with Rs 456.10 crore in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, the profit surged 53 per cent."

70,2019-07-30,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty opened in the green on Tuesday, mirroring the positive sentiment in other Asian markets as equity investors awaited an expected US interest rate cut this week.

The US Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, at which it is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. If implemented, it would be the central bank's first rate cut in a decade, Reuters reported.

Sensex jumped over 200 points and Nifty touched 11,257 in early deals. Around 9:25 am, the 30-share Sensex was 214 points, or 0.57 per cent, up at 37,900 with 25 stocks in the green.

The NSE Nifty was 65 points, or 0.58 per cent, up at 11,254. Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty pack, 41 were in the green and 9 were in the red.

BSE Midcaps index was 0.48 per cent up, but the smallcap index was 0.21 per cent down around that time.

Bharti Airtel, Tata Steel, Mahindra & Mahindra, ICICI Bank and Vedanta were among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

On the other hand, Hero MotoCorp, NTPC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS and Power Grid were among the losers in the Sensex pack of stocks. 

Among the sectoral indices, telecom, healthcare and metal packs were trading higher by a percent. The BSE Power index was n the red on losses in shares of NTPC, Thermax, Torrent Power and JSW Energy.

Oil prices climbed amid expectations of a rate cut by the US Fed. The rupee opened almost flat at 68.72 against the US dollar.

The local currency on Monday settled over 10 paise higher at 68.73 against the dollar. The domestic unit had consolidated in the first half of the session on Monday but advanced in the latter half following marginal weakness in the dollar against its major crosses. 

Meanwhile, international rating agency Moody's says it expects India's growth to be ""weaker"" in next 12-18 months as the lingering crisis at non-banking lenders poses fresh challenges to their asset quality, PTI reported. 

As per the report, Moody's said the slowdown comes at a time when banks are recovering from legacy non-performing loans, which at the system level had crossed 12 per cent in recent past and is trending under 10 per cent now. 

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 704.42 crore on Monday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 1,352 crore, data suggests."
71,2019-07-30,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The ongoing selloff in the equity market has been so intense that Nifty has ended in the red in seven out of past eight sessions. The index has entered the oversold zone, having lost 500 points in eight sessions. The situation is worse in the broader market.

Despite this, at least 25 stocks on NSE look set to rebound, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled a bullish crossover on these counters, hinting at possible upsides. These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included IT shares TCS, HCL Technologies and Mindtree, commodity-linked stocks Balrampur Chini and Jayshree Tea, and fertiliser stocks Deepak Fertilisers and GNFC. 

Suzlon Energy, Aptech, GHCL, Den Networks and Shalimar Paints are among other stocks that have seen similar bullish crossovers.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages.

A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed 33 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included Dish TV, Vedanta, Ambuja Cements, Power Grid, HDFC Life Insurance, IGL, Balkrishna Industries and Hindustan Unilever. Shree Renuka Sugars, BEML, PVR, Inox Leisure and Alembic Pharma are also looking weak on the technical charts.

Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As for Nifty50, Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in believes it is headed for the 11,100 level. “Unless, Nifty decisively clears the short-term resistance point at 11,311, it will not regain strength. The threat of breaking below 11,108 registered in May remains high, from where the entire upmove towards the 12,100 mark unfolded in the past. In that scenario, sub-11,000 levels are a strong possibility. For the time being, as risk-reward ratios do not favour the bears, traders should avoid positional shorts but can consider intraday shorts below 11,150 to achieve modest gains,” Mohammad said.

There is a probability of a pullback, but the overall market breadth needs to improve for sustainability of such an upmove, said Ruchit Jain of Angel Broking.

“The immediate resistance for the index is seen around 11,300, and a move above this level can lead to a pullback towards the 11,400-11,450 range,” Jain said. 


Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of TCS shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown an upward momentum and vice versa. On Monday, the scrip traded 0.76 per cent higher at Rs 2,125.10 on NSE.

72,2019-07-31,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: July turned out to be the worst month for Nifty in 17 years. The NSE benchmark is on course to end the month 6 per cent lower, marking its biggest fall monthly drop since 2002.

Market sentiment was hit this month following disappointing announcements in Union Budget amid tepid corporate earnings.

In July 2002, Nifty had registered a 9.35 per cent fall, which was also its biggest fall that year. The index has ended July in the red on five instances in last 17 years. It fell 2.93 per cent in 2011, 0.95 per cent in 2012 and 1.72 per cent in 2013.

FII have sold equities around Rs 12,000 crore this July, leading to major wealth destruction across sectors. Nifty shed over 700 points during the month. The overseas portfolio investors had brought in over Rs 80,000 crore during February-June.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told ETNow that the income-tax surcharge hurt FPI sentiment, adding to the market’s woes.

The pain is even worse in the broader market. BSE midcap and Smallcap indices fell 8.52 per cent and 11.16 per cent, respectively, during the month.

Within the Nifty pack, 44 stocks eroded investor wealth in July, with Coal India, YES Bank, Titan, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ONGC, GAIL, Bajaj Finserve, JSW Steel, Grasim and M&M falling up to 21 per cent till July 30.

However, stocks like Zee Entertainment and Asian Paints gained up to 13 per cent to help cushion the fall. Among others, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid and Dr Reddy's Labs managed to deliver positive returns to investors.

“Poor Q1 earnings, a slowdown in domestic consumption and the ongoing NBFC crisis have dampened investor sentiments on Dalal Street,” said Hemang Jani, Head of Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We are cautious on the NBFC space. Rising credit costs and higher provisioning are likely to impact bottom line and credit growth. As per recent reports and data domestic growth will be weaker over the next 12-18 months,” he said.

Khemka of MOSL said, “The broader market has turned weak mainly because of poor fundamentals. The underlying earnings growth has remained elusive and Q1 numbers have proved to be a dampener for earnings recovery expectations for FY20.”

Jani prefers stocks like Ramco Cement, HUL and Asian Paints which have shown decent growth in a challenging environment."
9,2019-08-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Strong across-the-board selling caused domestic equity indices Sensex and Nifty to end with deep cuts on Thursday.

The market kept reeling under pressure with no respite from global as well as domestic headwinds. While weak global sentiment and a fall in the rupee against the dollar were seen as the immediate reason for the selloff, fundamentally, concerns over a weakening economy, poor earnings and the tax setback in Budget lingered. 

“Pain is substantial as the impact of Budget on investor sentiment still continues. Moreover, subdued quarterly earnings and clear signs of an economic slowdown are serious concerns,"" said G Chokkalingam, Founder & Managing Director at Equinomics Research and Advisory.

At one point during the day, Sensex was down 787 points, but it pared losses to eventually end at 37,018, down 463 points or 1.23 per cent. Nifty closed the day at 10,980, down 138 points, or 1.24 per cent. Expiry of weekly derivative contracts caused the sharp volatility. 

Sensex and Nifty have come off 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, from their all-time highs, hit early June, 2019.

Here is a lowdown on key highlights of Thursday's session:


Investors poorer by Rs 1.6 lakh crore
Thursday's selloff dragged cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,39,87,400.37 crore from Rs 1,41,47,124.63 crore on Wednesday, making investors poorer by nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore. Since the Budget day on July 5, 2019, investors have lost 13.70 lakh crore!


541 stocks plumb 52-week lows
Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Tata Motors, Vedanta, Bank of India, Biocon, Central Bank of India and Escorts were among the 541 stocks that plumb 52-week lows on BSE. Barely 16 stocks, including Power Grid Corporation, Gujarat State Petronet, Modella Woollens, Vaibhav Global and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers hit 52-week highs. 


265 stocks hit lower circuits
As many as 265 stocks, including Coffee Day Enterprises, Indiabulls Integrated Services, Cox & Kings, Manpasand Beverages and Reliance Communications hit their lower circuit limits on BSE. On the other hand, Williamson Magor & Company, 63 Moons Technologies, Trejhara Solutions, Indian Card Clothing, Tera Software were among the 105 stocks that hit upper circuits.

ZEEL falls 4%
Shares of Zee Entertainment dropped 4.08 per cent to close at Rs 346.70 even as Rs 4,224 crore deal by promoters to sell 11 per cent stake in the company to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for nearly Rs 400 per share was at a 10 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 361.50 for the stock.

Nifty50 failed to sustain Wednesday’s bounce and fell sharply towards the 10,880 level. However, it witnessed a 120-point recovery in the last hour of trade and finally closed in the negative below the psychologically important 11,000 mark. The index has been forming lower highs and lows on the daily and weekly charts, while resistances have shifted lower gradually.

As long as Nifty remains below 11,111 level, weakness could continue and make Nifty retest the immediate swing low of 10,881 and 10,800 levels, while on the upside, resistance is seen at 11,050 and then 11,111 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,300. There was Put writing at 10,700 followed by 11,000 levels, while Call writing was seen at 11,000 followed by 11,200 levels. Options data suggests a trading range between 10,800 and 11,300 levels.

India VIX moved up 7.12 per cent to 14.55 level.

Bank Nifty failed to respect its immediate support at 28,550 level and fell sharply towards the 28,000 mark. During the day, it corrected around 750 points from the intraday high of 28,820 and finally closed with a loss of around 500 points. The index has been making lower highs and lows on the weekly scale and it has broken all immediate support levels.

Now as long as it holds below 28,888 level, weakness could be seen towards 28,000 and then 27,750 levels, while on the upside a hurdle is seen at 28,550 and then 28,888 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,027 with a loss of 0.95 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Voltas, Ujjivan Finance, Chola Finance and Power grid while shorts were seen in ICICI Prudential, UPL, Siemens and SBI.

6,2019-08-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Indian stocks on Thursday tanked like a house of cards on not-so-dovish comments by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The poor show on the first day of August followed the worst July for the domestic market since 2002.

India was among the worst-hit major markets globally. Surely, domestic factors too played a role in the selloff.

BSE Sensex tumbled 462.80 points or 1.23 per cent to 37,018.32 while NSE Nifty ended at 10,980, down 105.40 points or 1.24 per cent. The NSE index slipped below the 11,000 level for the first time since March 1, 2019.

Experts said market turned volatile during the second half of the trade due to weekly expiry of options.

Thursday's selloff dragged cumulative market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to Rs 1,39,87,400.37 crore from Rs 1,41,47,124.63 crore on Wednesday, making investors poorer by nearly Rs 1.6 lakh crore. Since the Budget day on July 5, 2019, investors have lost Rs 13.70 lakh crore!


Here are the factors that pulled domestic stocks lower:

US Fed comment: The US Fed cut policy rate by 25 basis points overnight. But Fed Chairman Powell characterised the rate cut as a mid-cycle adjustment to policy. Markets took it as a sign that sharp further cuts were not imminent, Reuters reported. Later in a news conference, Powell said Wednesday's move was not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.


Panic in Asia, Europe: By afternoon session, European shares had joined Wall Street and Asian markets to trade in the red. The Fed outcome dampened hopes of future cuts in US. The pan-European benchmark stock index STOXX 600 fell 0.2 per cent, with energy and mining giants the biggest drag as oil, iron ore and copper prices dipped. Asian markets, other than India, were down up to 1 per cent earlier in the day. 


Outflow vulnerability: Mixed earnings and the recent market-unfriendly Budget announcements have made India vulnerable to foreign outflows. Data suggests FPIs pulled out over Rs 11,000 crore worth of domestic shares in July. “No significant US rate cut would mean that the incremental flows into emerging markets may not be strong. That does not board well India at least in the short run,” said Hemang Jain of Sharekhan.


Weak rupee: A sharp 41 paise fall in rupee against dollar has made the matter worse. The domestic currency on Thursday fell to a low of 69.20 level against 68.79 level in the previous session. A weak rupee eats into the takeway profit of FPIs and hence make investment unattractive. Geoff Dennis, EM Commentator. 

“The dollar is firmer on the back of Powell’s statement. It tends to be negative for the emerging markets. Even if the emerging markets were to take off on dollar weakening and money starts moving out of the US, India would not outperform,” he said.


Poor market breadth: The market breadth has been pretty poor of late, partly reflecting concerns over earnings. On Thursday, three stocks fell for every stock that rose on BSE. It suggests the bears are at the driving seat and that the pain may be here to stay. “We are now slashing our one-year Nifty target to 11,300-11,800 from 12,200-12,700,” PhillipCapital said last week. “Consensus Nifty FY20/21 EPS is currently forecasting a growth of 23 per cent/18 per cent with nominal GDP growth assumption of 10 per cent - which indicates high risk of meaningful earnings downgrade,” it said.

In the 30-pack Sensex, seven stocks ended in the green and 23 in the red with Vedanta as the worst performer and Maruti Suzuki best. Tata Motors, SBI, Bharti Airtel and Infosys too joined Vedanta on the losers list, slipping up to 6 per cent.

1,2019-08-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: In line with most Asian peers, Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty suffered significant losses in early deals on Thursday as the US Fed reduced the key interest rate by 25-basis-point but poured cold water on market expectations of a lengthy easing cycle.

Powell characterised the rate cut as a mid-cycle adjustment to policy, citing signs of a global slowdown, simmering US trade tensions and a desire to boost too-low inflation. Markets took that as a sign that sharp further cuts were not imminent, Reuters reported. 

Back home, concerns over a slowdown in the economy, foreign fund outflow, liquidity squeeze and uninspiring quarterly earnings persisted, eroding the risk appetite of investors.

India’s core sector growth slumped to its lowest in more than four years in June, reflecting the economic slowdown and the lack of pickup in investment. 

The index of eight core industries rose 0.2 per cent in June, down from 4.3 per cent in May and 7.8 per cent in the year-earlier, government data showed. A sharp slide in the performance of steel and cement underlined the lack of investment.

The rupee's weakness further hit the sentiment. The domestic unit opened 40 paise down at 69.20 against the American currency after the dollar jumped to two-year highs.

Due to the lack of fresh positive triggers, the market resumed its downward journey, giving up Wednesday's gains.

Sensex fell 240 points and Nifty slipped to touch 11,040 in early trade. Around 9:30 am, the 30-share pack BSE Sensex was 171 points, or 0.46 per cent, down at 37,310 with 4 stocks up. 

The Nifty index was 22 points, or 0.49 per cent, down at 11,064. Among the 50 stocks in the index, 11 were up and 39 were down.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.12 per cent up each around that time. 

Power Grid, IndusInd Bank, Maruti and Axis Bank were the four gainers in the Sensex pack. On the other hand, Vedanta, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Tata Steel, Sun Pharma and YES Bank were the top losers in the Sensex kitty of stocks.

The selling in the market was widespread as most sectoral indices were in the red. Metal, IT and teck were the worst hit packs on BSE.

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 1,497 crore on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 2,479 crore, data suggests."

11,2019-08-02,PowerGrid,"Power Grid Corporation of India may report a double-digit rise in bottomline as well topline on Friday for the quarter ended June 30. Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities sees a 27.10 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit for Power Grid on 13.60 per cent on increase in net sales. 

Revenue growth of the company will be aided by an aggressive capitalisation of Rs 19,200 crore in trailing 12 months.

Kotak believes that Power Grid's EBIDTA could increase by 15.40 per cent YoY in Q1FY20. “We factor asset capitalisation of Rs 3,700 crore in Q1FY20 compared to Rs 6400 crore of asset capitalisation in 4QFY19,” the brokerage house said. 

According to ICICI Securities, net profit of the company may grow by 10.10 per cent YoY as the company continues to carry non-core debt for funding growth. It also projected 13.40 per cent YoY growth in EBITDA, largely on account of revenue growth and costs control.

Shares of Power Grid were trading 0.58 per cent down at Rs 212.80 in the morning trade, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was trading 327 points, or 0.90 per cent down at 36,684 at around the same time.


Factors to watch:
1) Clarity on project pipeline under the 13th Five-Year Plan (particularly, against the backdrop of Rs 1 lakh crore capex project by CEA in the plan for inter-state transmission network and Rs 1.6 lakh crore for intra-state projects).

2) Update on Rs 40,000 crore Green Energy Corridor ordering.

3) Management guidance on commissioning and capex for FY20/FY21.

4) Update on payment security mechanism for intra-state projects and possible workarounds for the company.

5) Update on JV with NTPC for investment in power distribution space."
12,2019-08-02,PowerGrid,"Power Grid Corporation of India on Friday posted a 8.30 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in standalone net profit at Rs 2,427.89 crore for the quarter ended June 2019. 

It had reported a net profit of Rs 2,241.70 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. 

Analysts in an ETNow poll had projected a net profit of Rs 2,450 crore.

Revenue from operations increased to Rs 8,804.11 crore in Q1FY20 over Rs 8,130.73 crore in Q1FY19. Other income rose to Rs 424.26 crore in the June quarter from Rs 392 crore in the March quarter and Rs 297 crore in the year-ago quarter. 

The company said that the income on account of transmission charges for the quarter was provisionally recognised based on the transmission tariff norms applicable for the block period 2019-24.

“The transmission income includes Rs 117.26 crore increase for the quarter (corresponding previous quarter Rs 32.94 crore (increase) pertaining to earlier years,” it said."
13,2019-08-02,PowerGrid,"Taking part in a panel discussion “Can the budget reverse the slowdown?”, Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar and power secretary Subhash C Garg contended that the recent budget has done enough to spark a revival in the not-too-distant future. ReNew Power CMD Sumant Sinha and Feedback Infra chairman Vinayak Chatterjee were of the view that the economy was facing deeper, structural issues and called for immediate measures to lift demand and investment. HDFC chief economist Abheek Barua described the slowdown as cyclical. The discussion was moderated by ET’s Deepshikha Sikarwar. Edited excerpts: 


Though the budget has set a target of a $5-trillion economy, there is criticism that it lacks specifics, there is no road map. Your comments? 
Kumar: The road map to be a $5-trillion economy is very clear. We require 11% rate of growth in nominal terms from where you are, until fiscal 2024-25. The reforms done in the last five years, and the budget now, which is a very pro-private investment budget, has set the stage for us to overcome the current slowdown… the stage as well as the path ahead have been laid down quite clearly, especially with the focus of the budget, which insists that the government will depend on private investment and bring about a change in the investment cycle, and for which there are about 12 measures in the budget. 


What is your assessment of the current economic situation? How deep is the slowdown? 
Kumar: We are all concerned — that’s how I would put it. I would use the term deeply concerned and the fact is that no one in the government would deny that there is a slowdown and the kind of information that you are getting about investment, consumption and external demand shows that the slowdown could persist if measures were not taken. But the good news is that measures are being taken. 




Has the government done enough to reverse slowdown? Garg: My assessment is that it’s not a very deep slowdown. We are accelerating things. It’s a temporary slowdown driven by some sector-specific events. For example, automobile is one sector undergoing a very deep structural transformation. 


How long do you expect it to last? Garg: It should last latest until the third quarter of this financial year and from the next year, things should improve. India’s estimated growth of 7%. I do not know why we are categorising 7% as slowdown. It’s our high expectations. My sense is that number one, there is no real deep slowdown. It is temporary, it will reverse very soon. Now… the budget road map. If you are looking for a road map on things to be done each year and the kind of growth to be achieved year after year, that kind of thing is not there in the budget. I think this is symptomatic of the old, planned economy mindset. What will work is whether you can get the private sector to invest because investment-driven growth would be the real growth… I would call it strategy rather than a road map, and there is a lot of strategy in the budget. I can recount what has been done for investment, what is done to change the government ownership into private sector. So, envisage four to five years from now an economy that is much more dominated by the private sector, where the private sector is investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, services, etc, and the economy is growing at 8-9%. 

As Kumar said, if we have a nominal growth rate of 11-12% and foreign exchange depreciation was 1-1.5%, we are there at a $5-trillion economy in 2024-25. 


Abheek, do you agree with the diagnosis of the problem here that the economy faces right now? Do you think it is not a deep slowdown and we can reverse it soon? Barua: The fundamental question one needs to ask is whether it is cyclical or structural. There are a lot of cyclical elements built into this. In fact, in the middle of 2018, we were looking at a situation where capacity utilisation had picked up in a number of sectors and there was a sort of tiny glimmer of hope of private investment coming back. After that, a bunch of things happened. One was the NBFC problem. The second was the usual prebudget uncertainty, which forced a lot of potential investors to push things back. 

What I think was very critical — and it is perhaps commendable for the government — was that unlike other elections where you get a hop in spending, presumably to get votes, this time because of a revenue shortfall, there was a massive compression in expenditure. So, all these factors came together and on top of that you had the long-standing issues of clean-up of the financial sector, etc, the bad loans in the NBFC sector. So yes, there is a slowdown. There is a strong cyclical dimension to it. Cyclical, not in the textbook sense of an inventory build-up, but a cyclical slowdown set off by a set of factors. 



Cyclical, by definition, means short-term, and once the government starts spending again, because the compression phase is over, you might see signs of recovery and capacity utilisation… So, once you get the confidence back and things start moving, perhaps you will see the investments turning. 


Sumant, do you agree with Subhash’s statement that this budget contains more measures for investment? Sinha: Two of the big issues are linked strongly to each other, which we’ll have to watch and see what happens. One is the issue of liquidity. In the budget, there were a number of steps that have been mentioned about liquidity enhancement. I think capitalisation of the banking system was one — perhaps the number could have been higher. But I’m sure the government had constraints on the fiscal deficit issue that they had to watch out for. 

The second is what they’re doing on the NBFC front, which is trying to come up with this contingency type of framework, which deals with the NBFC problem without enhancing moral hazard and so on. So, they’ve tried to come up with some formulation around that. Let’s see how both of these impact the system. 

You will see investments begin to pick up if liquidity comes back and if the cost of capital begins to go down substantially. Now, neither of these significantly emanates from a lot of the issues in the budget. But the budget also had a lot of other factors, which are at some level, policy statements, and therefore we need to see how they get enacted. The foremost, of course, is the one on investments in infrastructure, where a target of Rs 100 lakh crore was spelt out over a five-year period, which is a very, very sizable number, if you think about it, and $1.4-1.5 trillion over a five-year period is a very sizable number. 

A lot of those, if they get implemented properly, you will see pick-up beginning to happen. If that happens, along with liquidity and cost of capital coming back, then you start seeing confidence in the sector beginning to pick up. My only issue with the budget was increase in taxes. Because if you, as the government, are trying to revive animal spirits, then animal spirits have to be revived. You can’t depress animal spirits at the same time. 


Vinayak, you have been watching the infrastructure sector. The Rs 100 lakh crore — where is that going to come from? From the private sector? Chatterjee: I am going to be a little contrarian and, possibly, uncomfortable. To classify this current phase as cyclical, I think, does a great disservice to the current state of the economy. Right from bank recapitalisation to NPAs to the stress in the power sector to the competitiveness of Indian economy, these are deep-rooted structural issues. So far as I’m concerned, demand compression is far more widespread, far more critical and far more affecting the sentiment of not just Indian industry, but of the average Indian citizen, than we are prepared to face. If you take the BJP manifesto, if you take the economic policy and if you take the budget, all of them, I give full marks for creating what is called, in different points of English, track, strategy, vision, road map. I’m not denying any of that. 

I have no quarrel with the direction that the government has set, but the issue is that the track has been laid. From Indian industry and from Indian citizens’ point of view, I now want an engine that’s pulling out of the station. It’s not enough for me to stand at the station and view the track. 


Subhash, could the government have relaxed the fiscal deficit this budget? What held you back from doing so? Garg: The fiscal deficit is an extremely important economic narrative. It affects so many things, many times we don’t consciously recognise that. After this 3.3%, which is a signal from 3.4%, which was announced when the interim budget was presented, interest rates have come down by more than 1%. Think of what a 75-basis points repo rate will have, a different effect. But 1% reduction, everyone’s cost of borrowing — for corporates issuing bonds — is affected. You have the option of sort of relaxing the fiscal deficit and giving stimulus to the economy, which normally gets translated into a higher growth. That can come in two ways — one what Chatterjee was trying to argue — that use this to invest in infrastructure and other kinds of assets. Unfortunately, that does not happen in the short term. 

So, if you want to earmark for making this kind of investment, probably that money would have remained underutilised and not had that kind of effect. It works normally by boosting consumption, by providing some tax credit or some support or assistance, which works immediately. But that is, in my judgment, very dangerous. It is not that we have not witnessed it. Go back to 2008-09 and later, when India was faced with a slowdown after years of bumper growth. What happened? We relaxed the fiscal deficit. What happened? You saw so much of inflation, you saw so much of the growth slow down after a very small period — it doesn’t work. So, I think it was a very conscious decision that let us not to go the route of fiscal expansion, stimulus, steroids, but go to the real long-term path, which can deliver, and which is investment. If you can bring down the rate of interest in the economy, you can incentivise investment. You might miss for three months or six months or nine months, which is fine, but the long-term trajectory is not compromised. 


Rajiv, we have seen this divide here, Abheek and Vinayak have a different diagnosis, you and Subhash have a another diagnosis... 

Kumar: I did not give a diagnosis. I have said and I stand by that. We have noticed a slowdown and we are concerned that it might persist and we are committed to not let that happen. And the question is that if you call it a structural thing, then you foreshadow it, there’s no way that you can get out of it. Nobody can argue that because, in fact, most of the structural factors that are needed for growth are now in place. In fact, the formalisation of the economy that’s taken place in the last five years has meant that now any growth that comes will be far more sustainable than a boom-and-bust thing. 

I’m not sure why people don’t give that enough credit. The formalisation also means that the rules of the game have changed in many major ways — IBC, RERA, Benami Act, GST. Now, all of this means that the economic agents on the ground are having to adjust to the new rules of the game and that’s what’s beginning to happen. Now, the issue here, and these are not negative structural factors, these are structural factors that have been corrected for faster growth and more sustainable growth in the future. My argument has been — and I’ve been saying this since September, especially after IL&FS — that such changes, which require a huge behavioural change, need a lot more grease of liquidity than what you have in the system, especially after September when about Rs 2.5-3 lakh crore is probably short to what it would have been in a business-as-usual situation. Had there been no IL&FS, you would have had, in my calculation, about Rs 2-3 lakh crore more, because of what NBFCs have done in the past five years, the way they had grown at 20% per annum and quadrupled their balance sheets in the last five years. 

Now, those balance sheets have shrunk. That’s the loss of liquidity that you have. Now, who has made up for that liquidity? I’ve just seen a figure that the M3 to GDP ratio has declined. Again, this is not something that is not amenable to policy measures. But the fact is that the government, as Subhash knows, is completely cognizant and sees all this and, therefore, has announced a series of measures, more will be forthcoming. Not all of them could be announced in the budget, as Subhash said. For example, asset monetisation, I know that in NITI Aayog there is a committee which has recommended close to about Rs 1.6 lakh crore asset monetisation, which is not all your brownfield assets. The question that arises is that who has the capacity to take these on? You can talk about PPP, but are there companies now, after what is happening between 2011 and 2016, which have the capacity to take this on? 

I am not so sure any longer. So, therefore, would you want all of these to be foreign owned? I am told that 206 of the 269 toll roads today are owned by foreign financial companies. May be that is the way forward. I think FDI should come in much more in greenfield than brownfield investment. 





On NBFCs, you said there is a huge issue here. Could we have not taken some radical measures? 
Kumar: In 2013, Raghuram Rajan himself opened a window, when the rupee was in a free fall. RBI opened a window saying that they will backstop any losses in the NBFC and the banking sector and that window was never used but brought back the confidence in the system and liquidity started moving again. The fact that something could have been done to ameliorate the impact, but there again, with all due respect to everybody concerned, the feeling was that this is not such a big deal and this is a market correction. Somebody has written today that people who have over-extended themselves need to pay the price. I agree with that but at the same time one must remember that one must have much more sophisticated instruments for measuring whether something is systemic or not. Garg: In 2012-13, the facility which was announced was `50,000 crore for that time. This was not utilised because probably there was no need for it. And this time, we have, in a way the budget has announced, about `1.32-lakh-crore facility. 


Abheek you have been watching the banking sector, you have seen the NBFC sector, but we are allowing this issue to prolong... 
Barua: Yes, I think there is more liquidity in the system. We are now in surplus liquidity. Risk rates for lending to NBFCs have gone down. Banks and NBFCs tend to operate in overlapping spaces, take the case of finance and housing. The substitution hasn’t been dialling in perfect because NBFCs were targeting a certain category of individuals or borrowers who the banks are not entirely comfortable with and I think that there is some substitution that is happening. But it’s very difficult to give a clean line of credit to NBFCs. So, if you do it through the banks, you have some checks and balances there. That’s exactly what has been done. What has happened is with the media and the hue and cry about the NBFCs, a lot of the good quality NBFCs, I can point out that these 25 of them have gotten short shrift, because of entities that have been errant. So, it is being sorted. It will take some time, there will be a clean-up.





Sumant faces a unique problem of contract enforcement. In the current environment when these things are happening with private sector investment, what happens after that? 

Sinha: Some of the discussions going on are because there is a certain degree of angst in the corporate sector, which I think is being recognised, to an extent, by the government. But the corporate sector really expected the government to do a little bit more, come out with specific steps. And as Mr Garg pointed out, the government took a very conscious decision to go for the more longterm sustained improvement rather than to go for a shorter-term fix, which might have been more palatable. Whether the long term ends up being the better way forward, only time will tell because these things take years to play out. In the meantime, are we into a much deeper slump – again, time will tell? Now, in terms of the other point that Dr Kumar was making, which is a very important point, which is, the government wants to monetise assets. We want to answer your question. A ton of new investments will happen, but the reality is the corporate sector does not have the wherewithal at this point in time. That is the stark reality. When issues like what you mentioned happened, as in the case of the Andhra Pradesh situation, it really shakes the very foundation of the entire investment thesis in India. If there is no sanctity of contracts and there is no enforcement from the courts in a quick manner, then actually even whatever investments we’re getting is not going to be happening. So, this is actually a pressing matter. While it impacts the renewable energy industry in the state of Andhra Pradesh, it has very widespread ramifications of national importance. Therefore, I would really urge the government to deal with this issue in a very, very serious manner. 


Subhash, would you like to respond? Garg: Renewables has been one sector where we have seen investment actually expanding for quite some time. But there are some issues which have come up — Andhra example has been made, but a much deeper example is the sanctity of contracts, which essentially means that you are not getting paid for supplying the power which you will generate, and unless you make payment for the power you buy, you can’t hope to get investment coming. In fact, it might jeopardise even the existing investments, which it is doing, which will become NPA and you see a lot of this in the power sector… So, if we have to get the investment story right, we’d have to sort these things out. We’ll have to ensure that payments are made. Anything or anybody who buys must make the payment. In past many years, we have tried to find solutions. The only thing which we must ensure is this — some effort is being made now, the power ministry has issued instructions that the letter of credit has to be given first, otherwise the power will be cut off... Let me also respond to the monetisation of assets and how it improves investment. PowerGrid roughly makes about Rs 15,000-20,000 crore investment every year. If it can raise `10,000 crore, its investment need is met. The same amount becomes available for other investors. That is how it helps the government to continue to make investment and also the private sector to come and make investments. That’s very necessary. Responding to Dr Rajiv Kumar, I would say since we sort of pre-empt so much of public savings in India for government investment and very little is left for private sector investment, I think for some years we will have to be very welcoming to foreign investments, which are available abroad in pension funds and in sovereign wealth funds. They are sitting on investable funds and we need the investment. Third, $17-trillion bonds are yielding negative interest rates in the West. We are still not a $3-trillion economy. They need investment avenues; we should get them. Even if it comes in the form of brownfield investment, it actually helps more greenfield investment. 


Vinayak, why should foreign investment in brownfield infrastructure be a concern? Chatterjee: Infrastructure segment has three buckets of investment — development risk, construction risk, operating risk. The foreign investor is extremely wary of development risk and construction risk, so they are today very comfortable and Mr Garg said they are sloshing around the capital markets, waiting to take operating brownfield assets… I’m fully in sync with what Mr Garg said. I’ve been advocating asset monetisation for over 10 years now. It is now fashionable to talk about it. I’m listening to all the conversation, there are very clearly two perspectives that I am taking back. One is, if you speak to anybody in the governmental system, the view is reasonably similar - we have laid out a track, various systemic changes have been made, as Dr Rajiv Kumar pointed out earlier — RERA, IBC, GST, e-way bill, etc. Your laundry list of good stuff that has been done, no denying it. Now, the worst is behind us. Sit back and watch the 8% plus 5% play out and take 11-12%. The second point of view, which I am representing the views of many people from private industry, is that in the current situation of demand compression and liquidity crunch, it is not enough to say that things will sort themselves out within three to five months. Mr Sinha said it far more politely than I did, saying that we are sitting at the cusp where history will judge whether this path has been espoused by Mr Garg or by the finance minister. 


Garg: Can you do something to align with this path which has been chosen? Chatterjee: So the point is there is a vast number of newspaper readers, TV watchers, analyst watchers, waiting for some specific steps right now, in the next 30 days, 60 days, to see what is the specific step the government is taking to put money in the hands of people that will reverse, shall we say the decompression of demand. 


You were behind the budget that we just saw. Savings are down, investments are down, demand, of course, is down. What was the need to raise taxes? Garg: The first part is not factually correct. Investment in the last quarter was high, also capital formation was higher, growth was there. It was not down in that sense, right. But to come to your question about tax. I think what persuaded the finance minister to go for this was the temporary situation. You had a gap in your revenues and your expenditure requirement. So, she went for two major measures — one was to raise `2 per litre on diesel and petrol. That provided on an annual basis something like `30,000 crore. Since the gap was about `40,000-45,000 crore, I think the choice was made. I hope it’s temporary. 


The minister in an interview to ET said the taxation on FPI was an unintended consequence. The idea was to tax only the super-rich. But these are the investors who are investing in the country. With this kind of increased taxation, would they continue to do so? Barua: I have a very clear view on this — I think it needs to be reviewed… I think we might need to rethink, maybe to take some revenue losses, hope that passive monetisation, with the disinvestment target being larger than what they have put in the budget, that’ll be easier. One of the things I liked about the budget is that it found innovative ways of addressing the fact that there is enough money to fund the kind of borrowing needs the government has. On top of that, if you want to borrow, to support Vinayak’s plan, I think you would just have, you know, one thing going up — money in the hands, aggregate demand going up, and interest rates pulling them down. 


As NITI Aayog, the government’s think tank, what would be your advice to the government on this FPI issue, on the tax on FPIs? Kumar: The FM herself has said that there would be a review of this. 

Garg: So FPI, I’d also mentioned it, was not in the frame in the surcharge that was raised. It’s a little collateral kind of consequence. They are quite vocal. The FPIs basically make investments in the secondary market. They don’t make it the primary market. If you were to look at the economic and financial consequences of what their behaviour might be with our share markets actually being in very high PE ratios, it’s not in the economic disinterest of the country if slight exit takes place. It also doesn’t affect the real investment in the economy. But still there was an attempt on how we can find a way out to sort of at least take out both FPIs, which represent smaller investors, don’t represent the cash rich. It becomes very messy. It has not been possible to find a way out. Then the conclusion is, which I also read, and the finance minister also had very clearly spoken — I don’t think anything is going to be done for them in this year. 


AOPs have been impacted by the surcharge as well. A lot of infrastructure investments come as AOPs... Garg: So, then there are other areas, AIFs, sovereign wealth funds. I think they’ll find a response, an appropriate response for responding to the tax question. If it turns out to be not longstanding, maybe the situation will resolve in due course on its own. 

Sinha: For a small amount of fundraising at the government level, you know, the kind of damage that it does to sentiment, that is hard to measure… So, the general feeling is that India is dis-incentivising foreign investment in some way, shape or form. That then just percolates into a lot of other areas. So, my advice to the government is basically, be responsive to foreign investors because, as we discussed earlier, they’re the ones, the guys with the capital… the general perception that will get created is that India is not really looking for foreign investment and we are not really rolling out the red carpet for them… my advice would be to change it. It doesn’t matter for a couple of thousand crores. 


On sovereign borrowing… Kumar: I agree with Subhash, when you had said earlier it was and there was nobody in the government who disagreed with that proposal, to the best of my knowledge. The fact is that we are so under leveraged, 5% of GDP is external debt today. That we will get into a crisis at once, is going too far. We are all very rational people, in North Block, specially. 





I want an answer to a specific question, specially of Rajiv and Subhash: Where do you see the investment logjam breaking? Garg: Let’s divide that into two parts. One is the government and the other is the private sector. Many times, we forget that the real investment from the government side, of the public side, comes from the public sector entities… In my sense, public sector investment will still be rising and rising reasonably well. The challenge to my mind is to get the private sector investment to come up. There, the story is more complicated. We have to get several reforms done sector by sector. There are several issues connected with that, if we can get those policies right and create the environment for the resources to be available, especially from foreign sources now, the investment will start flowing. 

Kumar: To elaborate more, ours is one of the most underleveraged economies in the world. Our private debt-to-GDP ratio is down to about 50-odd%, while it is much higher in the US and China. That means that the credit offtake by the non-food private sector, as you know, has slowed down considerably. That’s also because of the banking sector. So therefore, the capitalisation that we talked about is the source of that funding. With that capitalisation, leveraged by six times — banks can generate up to `6 lakh core of new credit demand. The point, therefore, is that source of funding for investment is not an issue. I can cite you other examples. What you need is one, the sector reforms that Subhash has referred to. Also, what you need to do is the financial sector reforms, which I’ve been insisting upon for some time now… But those reforms are essential for us to make the banking sector the conduit of growth. Because in China after 1990-1992, most of the growth came from higher leverage in the economy. 


As we wind up, I have one question each to all of you. I’ll start with you Rajiv. In the near term, what are the three or four or five steps that the government could take to kickstart the economy? Kumar: There are three. The one that you will see very soon, the two labour codes, are already in there. We see the third going in for industrial relations, which has got some significant changes in terms of limits and overtimes and females. I am sure that will give a boost to investment. Subhash mentioned `1 lakh crore, I see the scope much bigger. If you include asset monetisation, disinvestment and privatisation, you can do much better and why not use foreign money available for this? NITI Aayog has done some numbers and I think the figure can be much larger. The third thing that has never been talked about: the government’s own capital output ratio. We, as a government, are one of the least efficient users of our own capital… … there is a lot of hoarded capital in the government, which we are trying to now work at through these measures of assets. This will take us quite far in terms of getting the revenue that we need for infrastructure building, but I know that there is a large gap. I’m quite sure that with the higher leveraging, capitalisation on the banks, and this greater efficiency of government capital, we can meet that gap. 


Subhash, you have just moved to the power ministry. What kind of reforms are you looking at in the power sector? There are huge issues there. Garg: The biggest impact maker in the sector is: Can we get the power sector finances, including the payment system, right? We have had several solutions in the past, they have not worked. This time it has to be a private sector-oriented solution. So that’s one thing which we would like to work on. Second, to supplement what the government has done, announced about a large-scale, sort of disinvestment and monetisation and I think the power sector has enormous potential for doing it, we have some companies to list. We have some companies to disinvest. We have some mergers to complete. We have assets for more monetisation to be done. If we can contribute to the government’s disinvestment programme, government’s privatisation programme, that would be a very good addition. Third, in my mind, we have some structural kind of weak segments in the business. We have about 25,000 crore gas capacities, which have, in my judgement, no future. So, there are also other segments that, can we sort them out? Can we find solutions for those, the real solutions? 


Sumant, for your sector and overall business in mind, what is your expectation of the government in the near term? What can you do to boost demand? Sinha: The government has taken a view and I’m quite happy that they’ve taken a longer-term view — there’s nothing wrong with that. To me, the key to revive the economy is to somehow reduce the cost of capital in the economy. And that is, to me, the No. 1 fundamental issue. That can come through more liquidity in the system, it can come through better handling of the NBFC situation, it can come through getting more foreign investors to come in, it will come through lower borrowing by the government — there are many ways, many things have to be done to get the cost of capital down. If you go back to the early 2000s when we had this phenomena, you know, growth in the first few years of that decade, a lot of it was fuelled because the cost of capital came down quite dramatically. So, that’s really the one thing that we have to focus on because today, the cost of delivering any service, because of the high investment cost, is just very high… So real rates of interest in the economy are very high. And to me, that is the biggest factor that is constraining the momentum in the economy from going much faster… 


Vinayak, what is the solution in the near term? Chatterjee: Four solutions. No 1: Increase the fiscal deficit by 0.3 percentage points and ringfence it with the National Infrastructure Development Fund audited by whoever is the relevant auditor so that the public at large is not percussed. No 2: A very aggressive monetisation action agenda, not just a wish list, with clear announcements of targets and responsibility centres. No 3: A strident revival of PPP and preferably with a separate department in the ministry of finance or in NITI Aayog on revival of PPP and everything that has to be done with it. And the last point is just a note of caution. I accept the point that Dr Rajiv Kumar made about capacity in the banking system to lend `6 lakh crore more but let us not make the asset-liability mismatch mistake again. Infrastructure cannot be funded by commercial banks. So that `6 lakh crore should be nicely kept aside for industrial capacities and other capacities. Infrastructure cannot be funded, particularly in the first two portions of the greenfield infrastructure, which is development risk and construction risk, by commercial banks. …the sector requires a DFI. So, I’m recommending immediately developmental financial institution for the infrastructure sector, however backdated and unpopular the concept may be. It is relevant and I am arguing for it. At least, it will lead to a lot of galvanising of action, of finance, of capacity enhancement, credit enhancement, all the kinds of stuff under one roof. 


Abheek, you said this was cyclical. So, what is your solution? What are the quick things the government should do? Barua: I’m fundamentally against the idea of things being too quick because I think the financial system clean-up will take some time, we have to be patient. And although I live in Delhi now, I am a Mumbaikar at heart — very pedantic. I work for the most boring bank in India. So, the one thing that I would like to say — and taking off from what someone said — the cost of capital, so they could have all these ideas sitting in Lutyens Delhi or Gurgaon or whatever. But what the financial consequences are in terms of very, very boring world of credit demand and supply and bond markets, completely mind-numbing world. But that should impose some discipline on the viability and visibility of doing certain things. For instance, I think fiscal expansion at this stage is perhaps not such a good idea. So, it’s over to the governor? Barua: To the governor, to some extent."
14,2019-08-02,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended higher on Friday, thanks to gains in shares of heavyweights, including HDFC, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Infosys and Asian Paints.

After plunging about 411 points intraday, Sensex rebounded to end with a gain of 100 points at 37,118.22. Nifty settled 17 points higher at 10,997.35.

However, market breadth remained tilted towards the bears as 1,362 stocks declined against 1,097 that logged gains on BSE.

While some short-covering might have lifted the market, the sentiment was influenced after media reports suggested that the government was considering ways to check the outflow of foreign funds from Indian market.

There were hopes that the government may exempt FPIs from the tax surcharge and also do away with the proposal of raising the minimum public shareholding in listed companies to 35 per cent from 25 per cent.

""Indian market recovered in the second half of the trading day on optimism that the government is mulling over exempting FPI from super-rich surcharges. Additionally, better domestic macros like GST collection, PMI and Monsoon forecast in August provided relief that the economy will improve by the second half of FY20,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

We walk you through the key highlights of Friday's session:


Over 600 stocks hit 52-week lows
As many as 609 stocks, including ITC, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Vedanta, Hindalco, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Exide Industries, Escorts and DB Corp, hit 52-week lows on BSE.

18,2019-08-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty resumed their downfall after Friday’s rebound in Monday's trading session dragged by metals and PSU bank stocks as escalating US-China trade war and political uncertainty in Jammu and Kashmir spooked investors. 

Analysts said that the benchmarks witnessed heavy selling pressure amid persistent foreign fund outflows, negative global cues, mixed corporate earnings, slowdown in domestic consumption and uncertainty in Jammu and Kashmir. 

Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday moved a bill in the Upper House to reconstitute the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Shah proposed the revocation of most sections of Article 370 which provides special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. 

Also, China’s yuan tumbled more than 1 per cent on Monday to hit an 11-year low amid mounting fears of an escalation in the US-China trade war, which sparked a selloff in other currencies in the region, Reuters reported. Rupee cracked 98 paise against US dollar to hit a low of 70.58 as concerns over US-China trade war sent Chinese yuan below 7 a dollar level. The weakness was intensified by uncertainty over Kashmir issue, poor high frequency economic data, and escalation in foreign outflow. 

Analysts expect volatility to persist as the market is expected to be largely driven by the ongoing quarterly earnings and the outcome of the RBI policy meet outcome on Wednesday.

It is widely expected that RBI will cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time in a row to boost the economy at a time when key indicators are pointing towards a slowdown, analysts said.

24,2019-08-06,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: In perhaps the biggest Indian road sector deal, Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) on Tuesday said it would invest Rs 4,400 crore in IRB Infrastructure's under-construction road assets platform, valuing the property at Rs 22,500 crore.

IRB will transfer nine BOT assets into a private infrastructure investment trust in which it holds 51%. The portfolio spans 1,200 km in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. IRB shares surged 10% on Tuesday, against Sensex’s 0.75% gains.

The transaction comes at a time when Indian infrastructure companies are struggling to raise finances, in the aftermath of IL&FS defaults.

“This will help us deleverage our balance sheet. This is a long-term partnership with GIC and we will together bid for future road projects that are coming up for bidding,” Virendra Mhaiskar, chairman and managing director of IRB, told ET. “This investment symbolises the confidence shown by a global institutional investor in IRB’s ability to build quality infrastructure for India. Most of the transactions in the road sector were always buyouts or controlling deals. However, GIC preferred to partner with IRB. The proceeds will also be used for equity funding in future projects,” Mhaiskar said.



Five assets under construction are lane-expansion projects, where tolling and construction have begun, strategically located along economic corridors and tourist hubs.

IRB will have management control over these assets, with GIC having rights of a financial investor and corresponding board representation. Construction, operations and maintenance of the portfolio will be executed by IRB as project manager for the private InvIT.

GIC will also hold 49% in the investment manager entity formed to manage the private trust. Net revenue of the portfolio in FY19 was Rs 630 crore.

Bajaj Consultants were sole advisors to IRB in the deal.

Earlier this year, GIC along with KKR, invested Rs 2,060 crore in Sterlite Power Grid Ventures sponsored IndiGrid.

26,2019-08-08,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: If it goes through, it may turn out to be the mother of all public asset sales – Rs 3 lakh crore of proceeds by monetising public sector transmission lines, telecom towers, gas pipelines, airports and, as ET had earlier reported, land parcels.

Government think tank , after consultation with many ministries, has drawn up a list of assets that can be sold including electricity transmission lines of Power Grid, towers of BSNL & MTNL, pipelines of Gail India Ltd, airports in some cities and prime real estate owned by central public sector enterprises. CPSEs in the Niti list that have monetisable land assets include National Textile Corporation, Hindustan Antibiotics and NTPC.

“The idea is to push CPSEs to monetise their existing assets and use the proceeds to fund greenfield assets,” a government official said.

Unspent Proceeds to go to Govt
The official added that if CPSEs are unable to use the proceeds towards capital expenditure it will flow to the government through dividends or other routes. The official spoke off record.

“Towers of BSNL & MTNL can be further leased out, or in some cases sold outright,” said the above quoted official adding that the pipeline business of GAIL can be demerged from the parent company and given on long term lease or completely sold off depending on buyer interest.



BSNL and MTNL have already rented out 13,051 and 392 mobile tower sites, respectively, to private telecom service providers. Powergrid owns and operates about 1,45,400 circuit kms of transmission lines, GAIL owns over 11,500-km of natural gas pipelines in the country.

In March 2019, Canadian fund Brookfield had bought 1,400 km of pipeline owned by Reliance Industries for Rs 14,000 crore.

The department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) has already issued expression of interest for appointing consultants who will provide transaction advisory services for monetisation of land assets.

“Land assets can also be monetised through Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) route. Already, firms such as Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Cushman & Wakefield and Colliers International have expressed their interest,” said another official aware of the developments. He, too, spoke off record.

There will be increased focus on strategic sales as well this year as the government has the mandate to bring down its holding in select public sector firms to below 51%. The government has set a disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in 2019-20.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the central government will be open to bringing down its stake below 51% in a government-owned company provided the combined stake of the government and government-owned agencies stays above that threshold. Already, there is ‘inprinciple’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 23 central public sector enterprises (CPSEs)."

Leading overseas investors are scheduled to meet finance ministry officials today as the government seeks to ease concerns over dwindling foreign portfolio inflows after a budget move to increase tax surcharge on them, media reports suggested.

Besides, a delegation of India Inc met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday with a charter of demands, that included tax rationalisation, a package for NBFCs, faster transmission of policy rate cuts and relief from harsh penal provisions introduced in the Companies Act for noncompliance with CSR. The government has assured some ""quick action"" to jumpstart the sluggish economy. 

Rupee's rise against the US dollar and improved global sentiment also played ball. 

The Indian currency opened 14 paise higher at 70.55 against the US dollar on Friday. Asian shares edged up, following a Wall Street rally, helped by China's better-than-expected export figures. However, fresh concerns about Sino-US trade ties remained an overhang.

30,2019-08-13,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty tumbled in Tuesday's trading session dragged by auto, telecom and banking stocks as investors turned cautious due to the absence of any significant fiscal stimulus from the government to arrest an economic downturn. 

Sensex slumped 624 points, logging one of the biggest drops of this calendar, as weak global cues added to domestic woes to intensify selling. Had it been not for the surge in RIL shares, Sensex would be down almost 1,000 points, potentially recording the worst daily fall of the year.

A major crash in Argentina's peso triggered risk aversion globally, driving investors to safe harbours like bonds.

Analysts said investors were disappointed that no concrete action had been taken so far, despite assurances some corrective actions from the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to revive the sluggish economy. 

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave no indication at last Friday’s meeting with foreign portfolio investors that she would withdraw a budget proposal to impose a surcharge on income-tax, analysts said.

Also government data on Friday showed India's industrial production growth slipped to a four-month low of 2 per cent in June, mainly due to poor performance of mining and manufacturing sectors further dented investors sentiment.

Analysts expect volatility to persist as the market is expected to be driven largely by macroeconomic data and government measures to support growth and FPI’s tax issues in the holiday-shortened week.


Here are the key factors that weighed on Dalal Street:

Uncertainty over govt relief timeline: The market was still waiting for any followup on the likely capital markets booster package by the government. The disappointment was visible across on social media platforms. 

Market expert Sandip Sabharwal tweeted, ""Markets continue to crash as (there is) no visible action except for some statements, which doesn't change anything. Subdued economic growth conditions will eventually lead to big job losses. It is time for action.""

""Huge diff in an industrial slowdown (which is a sad fact and on which govt needs to act) and value due to falls assuming the end of the road,"" tweeted value investor Safir Anand. 

In a later tweet he said: ""The stock market shows that talk will not matter unless there is action.""


Weakness in Argentina’s peso sends rupee lower: A sharp plunge in Argentina Peso weighed on currency markets across Asia. The rupee fell 38 paise to hit a low of 71.15 during the session. Even a statement by the People's Bank of China, suggesting that China’s yuan was an appropriate level could not lift the sentiment.
Argentina Peso slumped 30 per cent in overnight trade after voters snubbed the incumbent government by giving the opposition a surprisingly bigger-than-expected victory in Sunday's primary election. Singapore cutting its full-year growth forecast added pressure in the region. 


Weak IIP numbers: Weak factory output numbers released on Friday added to investor woes. India's industrial production growth slipped to a four-month low of 2 per cent in June, mainly due to poor performance of mining and manufacturing sectors. Factory output, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), had expanded by 7 per cent in June 2018. Capital goods segment, which is a barometer of investment, saw a contraction of 6.5 per cent in June compared to 9.7 per cent growth a year ago. Investors were also bracing for CPI numbers due for Monday.


European data, S&P futures: A data suggesting investors' view of the German economy, the largest economy in Europe, fell to its lowest since December 2011 amid concerns about the US-China trade conflict, the chance of a disorderly Brexit and a possible competition among countries to devalue their currencies. German DAX fell 1 per cent. Other European markets were down up to 1.2 per cent.

A 0.4-per cent drop in S&P stock futures were hinting at a weak start for the US stocks.

In terms of index contribution, RIL and Sun Pharma were the top support while HDFC twins, Infosys and ITC were the top drags on Sensex.

RIL was among the top gainers in the Sensex pack, witnessing the biggest single-day gain in a decade as investors cheered the company's largest FDI deal with Saudi Aramco, the roadmap to become a zero net-debt company by March 21, the unveiling of four new growth verticals and plans to unlock value in retail and telecom businesses. 

Auto stocks witnessed severe selling pressure throughout the session, as SIAM data showed a 31 per cent drop in domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales to 2,00,790 units in July from 2,90,931 units in the same period a year ago. 



Analyst view
“Indian markets have been tagging along global markets in palpable risk-off sentiment due to multiple challenges of intensification of US-China trade war, selloff in Argentina and Hong Kong markets. Reliance stock’s best day in a decade performance on the back of pro-investor statements in its AGM couldn’t save the day for market,” said Jagannadham Thunuguntla of Centrum Broking.

Global markets On the global front, Asian shares closed lower as fears of a drawn out China-US trade war, protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina's peso drove investors to safe harbours like bonds, gold, and the yen. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1 per cent. Chinese stocks fell 1 per cent, while Hong Kong's main market index tumbled 1.7 per cent to a seven-month low.

31,2019-08-13,PowerGrid,"Benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty snapped a two-day winning streak to log biggest fall in over a month on Tuesday, as investors turned less hopeful of a market booster package from the government. A selloff in global equities following a crash in Argentina’s peso and a sharp drop in the rupee further intensified the selloff in the final hours of trade.

The 30-share Sensex tanked 623.75 points, or 1.66 per cent, to end the day at 36,958, while NSE’s Nifty settled 183 points, or 1.65 per cent, lower at 10,925. 

“Global uncertainty due to political uncertainty in Argentina and Italy impacted our markets. The domestic market was hoping that the government will come out with supportive measures. While FPIs remained sellers, as they got no assurance of a possible tax shield from the government. Until such measures are implemented, the market will react based on economic data, which continues to be weak,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.


Here is a breakdown of key highlights of Tuesday's session:


RIL cushions biggest Sensex drop
A nearly 10 per cent rally in Reliance Industries (RIL) capped the downside for the equity benchmarks. The stock zoomed after the oil-to-telecom behemoth announced a mega deal and a host of other proposals at its AGM. RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said telecom unit Reliance Jio will begin offering fibre-based broadband services from next month. The scrip settled the day at Rs 1,275. Had it not been for the gains in RIL, Sun Pharma and PowerGrid, Sensex would have fallen 1,005 points, logging one of its biggest drops in recent memory.


YES Bank shares tumble 
Shares of YES Bank tanked 10.35 per cent to Rs 73.60 after the private lender told the bourses that some rumours regarding the issue price of the recently-launched QIP has been brought to its notice. “We would like to confirm to the market participants that the board’s capital raising committee would consider and approve, among other things, the issue price for equity shares in respect of the QIP on August 14. This intimation is intended to put at rest unnecessary speculation or rumours being spread regarding the QIP,” YES Bank said in a release.


Q1 results push Sun Pharma higher
Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical advanced around 4 per cent after it posted a 31.22 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit at Rs 1,387.48 crore in June quarter against Rs 1,057.29 crore reported for the corresponding quarter last year. Analysts in an ETNow poll had estimated Rs 994 crore profit for the quarter. The scrip settled 3.72 per cent higher at Rs 437.55.


Jet still looking for pilot
Shares of Jet Airways hit lower circuit after Volcan Investments, the investment company of Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal, on Monday said it would not pursue the Expression of Interest (EoI) submitted for the debt-ridden airline. The scrip declined 4.91 per cent to Rs 44.55.


Spurt in open interest
With a change of 25.10 per cent, Just Dial led the pack of stocks that witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest. It was followed by YES Bank (18.76 per cent), Bharat Forge (17.87 per cent), Reliance Industries (17.67 per cent) and MRF (17.19 per cent).


Rs 2 lakh cr wealth gone in a day
Investors lost Rs 2.28 lakh crore in a day as market capitalization of BSE-listed stocks tanked to Rs 139.41 lakh crore from Rs 141.69 lakh crore on Friday. The domestic equity market was closed on Monday on account of Bakri Id.


65 stocks readying to rise
Momentum indicator MACD showed 65 stocks, including Reliance Industries, Jai Corp, Exide Industries, Future Retail, Sadbhav Engineering and Bombay Dyeing, with bullish crossovers, signalling these stocks may log gains in the coming sessions. On the other hand, ICICI Bank, NCC, Arvind and M&M were among 37 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.

It was followed by Idea Cellular (number of shares traded: 16.98 crore), SAIL (5.36 crore), Reliance Industries (4.79 crore) and BHEL (4.41 crore). On the other hand, Reliance Industries (Rs 6,109 crore) finished as the most active stock in terms of value, followed by Indiabulls Housing (Rs 1,871 crore), YES Bank (Rs 1,601 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 859.59 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 765 crore) and HDFC (Rs 717 crore). 

Reliance Industries logged its highest ever turnover, and biggest trading volumes since January 18, 2006 on NSE, data available with the stock exchange suggest."
32,2019-08-14,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty opened higher on Wednesday, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street after US President Donald Trump delayed tariffs on some Chinese imports and gave much-needed relief for markets.

Trump backed off his September 1 deadline for 10 per cent tariffs on the remaining Chinese imports, delaying duties on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods in the hopes of blunting their impact on US holiday sales. 

Following this development, most of the Asian markets too got a leg up with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising by 0.9 per cent. South Korea's KOSPI advanced 0.8 per cent and Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6 per cent. 

Market sentiment also got a boost after retail inflation inched down to 3.15 per cent in July against 3.18 per cent in the previous month. This was the first time in six months that the inflation rate dipped.

As a result, the 30-share Sensex opened 275.34 points higher at 37,233.50, while the 50-share Nifty index opened 77.40 points higher at 11,003.25.

The 30-pack Sensex traded over 400 points higher, led by gains in index heavyweights Vedanta, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Tech Mahindra amid firm global cues.

Sun Pharma, YES Bank, Power Grid, TCS and Kotak Mahindra Bank were down between 1-4 per cent.



Reports suggesting that the finance ministry may soon consult the law ministry on how best to provide relief to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from the super-rich surcharge that was announced in the July 5 budget also provided hopes to investors. FPIs have been on a selling spree since the Union Budget.

They pulled out a net amount of Rs 9,197 crore in just seven trading sessions in August due to unconducive domestic and global factors. In the preceding month, FPIs were net sellers in the Indian capital markets (equity and debt) to the tune of Rs 2,985.88 crore, PTI reported.

Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said, “We believe the bears are here to stay for a while and it won't be easy and quick for the market to recover anytime soon. We remain cautious and maintain our sell on a rising approach.” His view came after Sensex and Nifty plunged more than 1.50 in the previous trading session.

Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, “The global risk aversion and favour for safe haven like gold and bonds is impacting the entire emerging market flow. The volatility in the market could continue for some more time till some favorable measures from government to boost the equity market.”

Shares of HDFC Life plunged 7 per cent on reports a total of 6.4 crore shares changed hands on the counter at Rs 486 a piece in early trade, representing 3.2 per cent of the company’s total stake.

BSE Midcap index was trading 0.41 per cent higher while BSE Smallcap was up 0.28 per cent at around 9.40 am.

33,2019-08-14,PowerGrid,"Asset under management of the mutual fund industry inched higher to Rs 24.53 lakh crore in July despite a harsh selloff in the domestic equity market, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed. Total AUM stood at Rs 24.25 lakh crore in June. 

Investors’ mutual fund portfolios suffered a dent after the Union Budget 2019 slapped a surcharge in the high income-tax bracket that hit foreign portfolio investors (FPI). In response, FPIs, who had poured in around Rs 80,000 crore during February-June, offloaded stocks worth more than Rs 12,000 crore in July itself.

Even the bluest of blue chips like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank cracked up to 8 per cent during the month. The BSE Sensex dipped around 5 per cent, while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 8 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Money managers of top fund houses used this crisis as an opportunity to lap up low hanging fruits.


Here’s a look at what top five asset managers bought and sold during the month:

HDFC Mutual Fund
The country’s largest money manager held Rs 1.43 lakh crore in equities, with maximum exposure to financials, power and industrial stocks. The fund house added 5.71 crore shares of GAIL last month, while other names on its shopping list included ITC (3.10 crore), Power Grid (2.08 crore), Bharat Electronics (1.81 crore), Coal India (1.29 lakh) and YES Bank (1.11 crore).

The markets fluctuated between gains and losses throughout the day with metal, pharma and IT counters capping the gains.

Media reports suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspired stimulus package for the economy may come as early as this weekend, boosted the market.

""Prospects of the government considering steps to revive the economy with stimulus measures and recovery in crude prices due to easing recession helped the market. Until prompt and effective actions are announced by the government, market will react to upcoming economic data which is weak,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

 The markets had opened on a subdued note as mixed signals from China-US trade war stoked worries about global growth.

There was no resolution in sight in the trade standoff, which has disrupted global supply chains, after China on Thursday vowed to retaliate against the latest US tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods, a report said.

Analysts said that rising concerns of an economic slowdown, weak Q1 earnings and global trade volatility continued to put pressure on the markets. However, any positive progress on US-China trade talks may boost investors’ sentiments.

Analysts said investors may remain cautious in the coming days as the markets are expected to remain volatile in the near term in the absence of any fresh domestic triggers.

YES Bank was among the top gainers in the Sensex pack jumping up to 6.5 per cent in today's trade after the lender on Wednesday said it had raised Rs 1,930.46 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) to fund its business expansion.

34,2019-08-16,PowerGrid,"June quarter earnings season has ended on a mixed note with select companies from FMCG, paints and corporate banking space delivering better-than-expected numbers, even as those from auto and auto ancillaries and mid-tier IT firms failed to impress Dalal Street.

As many as 20 companies in the 30-share Sensex reported an increase in net profit for the quarter, while others posted a dip in bottom lines. 

Nearly 2,500 of the BSE-listed firms have announced June quarter numbers so far, out of which only 35 midcap and smallcap companies with at least Rs 30 crore profit reported over 100 per cent year-on-year (YoY) expansion in their bottom lines. 

Some of them did so on the back of exceptional gains. For instance, a one-time gain of Rs 1,291.20 crore mainly aided NIIT’s bottom line during the quarter

“If it is a one-time gain, then one should stay cautious even if a company has posted over two-fold rise in net profit. Investors should focus on consistent performers in stock selection,” said G Chokkalingam, Founder, Equinomics.

Among the top performers, NIIT posted 61 times, or nearly 6,000 per cent YoY jump in profit during the quarter, while InterGlobe Aviation, Usha Martin, Gokaldas Exports, Multi Commodity Exchange, IOL Chemicals and Deepak Nitrite reported profit growth in the range of 300 to 4,220 per cent.

Despite manifold rise in profit for NIIT, Elara Capital recently slashed the target price for the stock to Rs 157 from Rs 183. “We have lowered the target price, as we no longer factor in cash value for the minimum alternative tax (MAT) paid, although it can be offset against future taxes,” it said.

InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of the country’s largest airline IndiGo, also got some benefit from the grounding of cash-starved Jet Airways and improved performance on the cargo front in June quarter. Centrum Broking is bullish on InterGlobe with a price target of Rs 1,846.

Except for NIIT (down 1.85 per cent) and Usha Martin (down 6.87 per cent), net sales of other firms increased between 9 per cent and 40 per cent YoY. 

Among others, Pokarna, Adani Enterprises, Orient Cement, The India Cements, The South Indian Bank, Zydus Wellness, Tamil Nadu Newsprint, JK Cement, Kolte Patil, Hindustan Media Ventures, JK Lashmi Cement, Dalmia Bharat, Godrej Properties, Bank of India and Welspun Corporation posted 150 to 260 per cent YoY profit growth. Net sales of Kolte Patil, Zydus Wellness and Pokarna increased over 50 per cent YoY.

AU Small Finance Bank, United Spirits, DLF, Max Financial, Subros, Phoenix Mills, Trident, Seamec, Supreme Petrochem, Power Grid, Godfrey Phillips, Ipca Labs and Himachal Futuristic were among other companies that reported over 100 per cent YoY rise in quarterly profit.

Among Sensex companies, Tata Motors, Axis Bank and Bajaj Finance posted 94 per cent, 75 per cent and 43 per cent YoY rise in net profit, respectively, during the quarter. On the other hand, ICICI Bank turned around with net profit of Rs 1,908 crore against a Rs 120 crore loss in the same quarter last year. SBI reported Rs 2,312 crore profit against a Rs 4,875 crore loss for the same period.

Anand Rathi Shares and StockBrokers is positive on ICICI Bank with a price target of Rs 511. “With declining credit cost on account of lower slippages and adequate provision coverage ratio, we believe ICICI Bank is favourably positioned to deliver superior profitability and return ratios.”

Bharti Airtel posted a net loss of Rs 2,866 crore for June quarter against a net profit of Rs 97.30 crore in the same period last year. YES Bank, Tata Steel, M&M and Maruti Suzuki reported 30-92 per cent drop in profits during the quarter.

ICICIdirect gave a ‘buy’ rating to Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 400, despite the company having reported a loss for June quarter. 

The brokerage believes Bharti Airtel is well placed to tackle the industry pressure with an apt strategy of focusing on high-paying customers. “Bharti with a relatively nimble balance sheet post its Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, monetisation of Africa assets through pre-IPO stake sale and IPO fund raise of $750 million, coupled with further potential of deleveraging, can remain one of the major players in the Indian telecom space,” it said.

Arun Thukral, MD & CEO at Axis Securities, said he had expected slightly better numbers for June quarter.

Corporate banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI and IndusInd have delivered good numbers, but there has been some misses also, he said.

Among FMCG companies, HUL’s growth was modest though Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Nestle’s numbers have been good. Cement companies, including UltraTech, have come up with good results while auto and auto ancillaries’ performance has been below par, Thukral said."
37,2019-08-17,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty ended the truncated week in the red, following mixed macroeconomic data amid fears of a global economic slowdown. 

The 30-share Sensex shed 231 points, or 0.62 per cent, to end at 37,350 for the week ended August 16. Likewise, the 50-share Nifty lost 61.85 points, or 0.56 per cent, to end at 11,047.

The market kicked off the week on a bleak note on Tuesday as sentiment got hit after government data showed that India’s factory output growth, as measured by IIP, slowed down for the second straight month to 2 per cent in June compared with 7 per cent in June, 2018 and 3.1 per cent in May, 2019. 

However, the market pared some of the losses in the remaining two days of trade amid hope of a stimulus package for the economy from the government. Investors also took comfort as India’s retail inflation based on CPI eased to 3.15 per cent in July, 2019 from 3.18 per cent in June, 2019 and 4.17 per cent in July, 2018. WPI inflation also eased to a multi-year low of 1.08 per cent in the month of July, on account of cheaper fuel and food items. 

Meanwhile, trade deficit, the gap between imports and exports, narrowed to $13.43 billion in July from $18.63 billion a year ago, helped by a lower oil import bill.

Below are the top stocks and sectors that buzzed through the week.

44,2019-08-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Unit-3 of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has taken a key step towards operationalisation with supply of main equipment for the plant ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Russia in September first week. 

Andrey Lebedev, Vice-President for projects in India of ASE,Russia`s Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation Engineering Division, said that all main equipment have been supplied.

Rosatom State Corporation is main equipment suppliers and technical consultants for the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant project.

The shipment consisted of the molten core catcher, embedded parts of the reactor pit, dry protection, heat-insulation of the cylindrical shell/barrel, truss buckstay, reactor vessel. These are part of the enhanced safety features in VVER-1000 reactors. A thrust truss and devices for neutron flux monitoring chambers allocation are expected to be delivered by the next shipload. 

A core melt localization device (CMLD), or a “core catcher,” is one of the most important passive safety systems of modern nuclear power plants of Russian design. CMLD is installed at the bottom of the plants’s protective shell. It is designed to localize and cool the molten core material in case of a hypothetical accident that could lead to damage to the core. The “core catcher” allows the integrity of the protective shell to be preserved and thus excludes radioactive emission in the environment, even if the hypothetical accident is serious.

The passive safety systems are capable of functioning even in the event of a complete loss of power supply. They can provide full safety without the active systems and an operator. For example, the passive heat removal system (PHRS) ensures long-term heat removal from the reactor core section if all the other power supply sources fail. If necessary, the system can switch on without external interference and function under the influence of purely natural factors.

“Taking into account that four steam generators, a pressurizer, main coolant pipelines and a bubbler were delivered earlier, ASE has mostly completed the procurement of the containment equipment for the third unit to ensure uninterruptible and continuous operations for the reactor plant construction which is on the critical path of the project,” said Lebedev.

Kudankulam NPP is being constructed in Tamil Nadu within the scope of Russian-Indian agreement of 1988 and its attachments dated 1998 and the Agreement as of December 08, 2008. 

In October 2013 Unit-1 of the Kudankulam NPP was connected to the southern power grid. In August 2016 Unit-2 of the Kudankulam NPP was connected to the power grid. Unit-3 and Unit-4 of the Kudankulam NPP are under construction. The contracts for construction of Unit-5 and Unit-6 have been signed and the preparatory works are in progress. 

Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation is the largest electricity generating company in Russia, providing over 18% of the country's energy needs. The company ranks first in the world in terms of the size of its foreign projects portfolio, with 36 power units in 12 countries at various stages of implementation. Rosatom ranks first in the world in uranium enrichment, second in the world in uranium reserves and fourth in terms of its production, and provides 17% of the nuclear fuel market. 

Rosatom brings together about 400 enterprises and organizations, including the world's only nuclear icebreaker fleet. Together, they employ about 250,000 people."
45,2019-08-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty pared gains to end flat in Monday's session as markets witnessed selling pressure in the last hour of trade in auto and PSU bank counters mainly.

Earlier, the benchmark Sensex had jumped up to 350 points supported by pharma and IT shares as hopes of new measures from the government to revive growth bolstered investors sentiments. 

Analysts said that investors cheered positive cues from other global markets as US President Donald Trump dismissed worries about a recession in the US and claimed the economy remained strong. Also, expectations of measures from the government to boost growth and revive consumer sentiment kept the markets upbeat throughout the day.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said her officials are still in discussion with their counterparts in the PMO and the government would figure out what remedial steps should be taken and announce the same once the talks get over. 

Markets also got some push after RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said banking reforms are a continuous process and it will be the endeavour of RBI to see to that there is no collapse of any large NBFCs. He said liquidity in the system has been in surplus since June 1 and promised to ensure adequate liquidity to meet productive needs. 

Analysts said markets may remain volatile in the near term in the absence of any fresh domestic triggers as investors await some action from the government. Also, any positive progress on US-China trade talks may boost investors’ sentiments further.

Sun Pharma was among the top gainers in the Sensex pack jumping up to 4.6 per cent in today's trade after it informed bourses that one of its arms has granted an exclusive licence to a subsidiary of China Medical System Holdings Ltd (CMS) to develop and commercialise seven generic products in Mainland China.

48,2019-08-21,PowerGrid,"In the next two or three months, time will come to buy and concentrate more on Nifty40 stocks as compared to Nifty10, says Sandeep Tandon, Founder, Quant Group. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Everyone is convinced that we are in a downturn. The slowdown is real, markets will go down, nobody wants to participate and forget about selling on rally, stocks like Yes Bank and Suzlon and Vodafone are getting hammered despite rallies. Do you think the selling is overdone or is this just the beginning of a long winter?We look beyond fundamental also. Our key takeaway right now is from the risk appetite analytics point of view as well as the liquidity data which we track on a global basis. Let us look at the risk appetite first. In India, the Quant risk appetite indicator peaked out in January 2018 and since then, it is declining. We have seen the risk appetite being actually linked with the slowdown in economy. If risk indices or the risk appetite indicator is drifting down, it is a clear trend globally also and so is the case in India. 

As of last month’s data, it has not bottomed out. It might take two to three months more before it bottoms out and typically risk appetite indicators are linked with the smallcap and the midcap themes because they are more driven by the risk appetite and liquidity. Let us spend two minutes on liquidity also. India liquidity has peaked out somewhere in April 2018 and since then, it is drifting down. 

Globally also, the risk appetite has peaked out somewhere in January and it is still drifting down. But what is more important is the liquidity parameter which actually bottomed out in December 2007. I am looking at the global liquidity analytics point of view. They have been inching up. Both from the good liquidity and bad liquidity point, we believe stimulus liquidity and the private sector liquidity is rising in the developed market as compared to the emerging markets (EM). EM still remains soft on the liquidity. 

As a combination, typically the market peaks out when liquidity and risk appetite peak and it bottoms out in a similar manner. But from the Indian perspective, liquidity started drifting down from July onwards and risk appetite has not bottomed out. This clearly means that from a midcap and smallcaps perspective, some pain is still left. We are closer to the bottom. Maybe in another two or three months’ time, it will really bottom out.


There is this conviction that in two to three months, the sentiment will revive for equity markets. Would it take something from the government’s end, perhaps a stimulus, perhaps a rollback of the FPI surcharge or even some change with the LTCG quantum from one to three years, etc; Would it take all of that to revive and get the animal spirits back into the economy?A lot of expectations are getting built from the government perspective. Even if it comes let us this week, even then it could be a temporary support for the market. But from a medium-term perspective, our data point showcases that some amount of pain is still left and if you really look at from a larger perspective, when we talk about stimulus happening globally, and if I have to break it into different components. One part is bad liquidity or stimulus liquidity which actually started rising from April 2019 onwards and it is expected to move up further. If the Indian government also does something like that, we will not be surprised. So that trend is happening and we expect global liquidity to improve further. 

Maybe emerging markets will take a few more months to bottom out and everything India is also part of the emerging market. Within emerging markets, Brazil is the only emerging market country where the liquidity situation and risk appetite perspective is slightly better. All EMs are largely down.


Midcaps can fall 20-30% before the time markets bottom out in 2-3 months. Are you saying that 15-20% decline is still left in the market?From a broader market perspective, we are seeing some amount of extraordinary shorts or what we measure through our capitulative indicator or the short buildup in the market or fear index in some manner. We are seeing extraordinary shorts. We have seen a Reliance which rallied, as did some of the auto names. Currently, whether it is Axis Bank, State Bank, we have seen highest short positions in five years. 

The fear index is just spiking and some of the individual stocks will start bottoming, not the broader market in general because in the broader market, some pain is still left and maybe stock specific correction is much more likely rather than generalising that the entire market can correct 15-20%.


It is a market which is looking very, very fluid. How does one figure out that the pain in NBFCs is behind us? What are the indicators which will tell you that it is time to buy NBFCs?Coming to NBFCs and stocks in particular, I have to again link these with risk appetite and liquidity, which in particular drives NBFCs. I do not see that is the case on an immediate basis. The fall may not be very big from these levels but there is pain still left in these names. I will like to avoid these names at this juncture.


Why is there a de-polarisation in this market? The fund managers who are not buying Asian Paints, Trent, Bajaj Finance stocks are criticising the fund managers who are buying them, saying that you cannot buy good companies at any price. But those fund managers and those investors who bought these good stocks are the ones having the last laugh and making money in this bear market?I agree with you but if I break the entire Nifty into Nifty 10 and remaining Nifty 40 stocks, I agree that the polarisation has reached extreme levels. Both from the delivery and the market cap valuation perspective or the concentration risk perspective, we believe it has peaked out. 

So whether you talk about Titan or Bajaj Finance or some of the safer names like Berger and Asian Paints, because of the low oil prices are still holding on but most of the stocks have peaked out. In the next two or three months, time will come to buy and concentrate more on Nifty40 stocks as compared to Nifty10.


Going forward, where can one park money? Would you still look for value when it comes to the broader markets and stick to perhaps safe haven names? Since I talked about that, concentration is now moving towards new ideas and the people are trying to identify spaces which are under-owned. Look at classic example. Some of the insurance -- both general insurance and life insurance -- stocks have moved up in the last six months or one quarter in particular. 

So is the case with some of the asset management companies. These are growth areas from the next three, five, 10 years perspective and on a relative basis, they are still under owned. So that is one area where we like to park our money as compared to the private sector banks which is relatively overowned. 

So there are such certain spaces you have to identify. Some of the stocks in cement space, metals from a 2-3 months’ perspective are where you will see value. I will be more focussed on looking at some of the oil marketing companies, maybe the Power Grid or NTPCs of the world, which are closer to the bottom. I would like to look at opportunities in next 40. These are the names which we believe will qualify."

50,2019-08-22,PowerGrid,"Stocks that are beneficiaries of low interest rates and private banks are the places to hide in the current environment of economic weakness, said Credit Suisse. Even though consensus EPS estimate for the Nifty 50 members has come down to 25 per cent from 31 per cent, the brokerage sees downside risk to earnings estimates due to the weak economic momentum.

Credit Suisse is bullish on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank among private banks and sees Embassy Office Parks REIT, NTPC and Power Grid as beneficiaries of low interest rates.

“Some of the economic weakness is just de-stocking, which will become sharply positive when it turns, but the turning point is not visible yet,” said Credit Suisse.

The brokerage expects Nifty earnings growth to settle in the high-teen levels but sees downside risks due to the weak economic momentum, particularly with even private banks now starting to slow credit.

Sales growth of BSE 100 companies slowed to 4.4 per cent in the three months ended June --- the slowest in seven quarters, according to Credit Suisse. The sales growth excluding oils and metals would be 7.2 per cent. Credit Suisse said the weakness is not extreme yet as inflation is much lower than the 2014-16 but broad-based. Nearly 60 per cent of the firms reported less than 10 per cent growth, said Credit Suisse.

Operating margins increased sharply year-on-year for cement, healthcare, financials and utilities whereas metals, industrials and consumer discretionary saw the steepest declines, the brokerage said."
51,2019-08-22,PowerGrid,"To step into the market and start buying or sit on the side-lines, that is the question!

Most investors, seasoned or novice, are failing to make up their minds even after several Nifty50 stocks cracked up to 80 per cent from their 52-week highs.

In the broader market, only 87 stocks, representing just 2.9 per cent of BSE universe, have delivered positive returns since early 2018. The remaining 97 per cent have eroded up to 99 per cent of investor wealth in last 18 months. Several stocks have dived up to 98 per cent from their 52-week high levels.

Many of these are, of course, victims of a slowdown that is becoming more and more pronounced in the economy, while several others have perished because of issues related to corporate governance, large debt piles and sector-specific headwinds.

The biggest index loser is, of course, YES Bank, which has tanked 82 per cent to trade at Rs 65 on August 21 from its all-time high of Rs 404 hit on August 20 last year. The private sector lender recently raised Rs 1,930 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Market expert Sameer Narayan says instead of looking at the stock from a short-term perspective, one has to see what kind of capital has come in and from what kind of investors. 

Mortgage lender Indiabulls Housing Finance, auto majors Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and metal players JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta are down between 40 and 60 per cent from their respective 52-week highs. 

Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says Tata Steel and JSW Steel have become good value picks now.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1.

Analysts say overall the auto sector got hit primarily due to highly subdued volume performance across segments over the past three quarters, which has been attributed to higher insurance cost, a liquidity squeeze in the NBFC space, new axle load norm besides the forthcoming shift to BS-VI pollution norms from April, 2020. 

Even the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki and the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp have slipped 39 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, from their 52-week high levels. 

Both stocks have since started rising, but most analysts remain cautious. “I would wait for another quarter at least and see how the financing side pans out. I think it is too early to bottom-fish in auto sector,” said Ratnesh Kumar, MD & CEO, BOB Capital Market.

Other Nifty components like Sun Pharma, GAIL, Zee Entertainment, Coal India, Grasim Industries, ONGC, Hindalco, IndusInd Bank, Cipla, Britannia, IOC, UPL and Bharti Infratel have lost over 25 per cent from their year’s highs in this correction.

So what do you do now? Buy for keeps, wait for short-term play. That’s the verdict coming in from market veterans.

Considering the ongoing correction, market veterans are advising investors to stay cautious for the short term and adopt a stock-specific approach in this market. However, long-term investors with 5-10 years horizon should definitely start picking quality stocks. 

“Investors with long-time horizon should definitely start buying. We are bullish on manufacturing companies, especially those in the chemicals sector, select technology and private banking players. We are not bullish on infrastructure sector, apart from L&T,” says Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) – and AVP for Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Even shares of the most stable companies – Asian Paints, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, TCS, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and HCL Technologies – have fallen between 1 and 10 per cent from their 52-week highs.

The benchmark NSE Nifty index is down around 9 per cent from its 52-week high of 12,103 hit on June 3, 2019. On August 21, the index traded at price-to-earnings ratio of 27 against its 10-year average and five-year of 22 times and 24.20 times, respectively. This indicates that the market is still looking overvalued at index level in terms of valuations.

Kuntal Shah, Partner, Oaklane Capital Management, says many cycles are playing out in the market at the same time.

“There is a business cycle, there is an economic cycle, there is a fiscal cycle, and more importantly, there is investor behaviour cycle,” says he. “If you have spent adequate number of years in the market, you know this too will turn around,” he said."

53,2019-08-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty snapped their 3-day losing streak in a volatile trading session on Friday supported by energy, IT and metal counters as reports that government may soon rollback the plan to levy higher tax on foreign investors sparked a rebound.

According to reports, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will hold a press briefing on Friday evening amid expectations that the government will announce steps to revive economic growth.

Earlier in the day, the markets fluctuated between gains and losses with the benchmarks plunging more than 1 per cent in early trade.

Analysts said that markets bounced back as investors are expecting the finance minister to take some corrective actions to revive the sluggish economy. 

There have been a series of meetings this month between finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and FPIs, and between Sitharaman and Prime Minister Narendra Modi which has raised hopes of stimulus measures, analysts said.

Also, investors will be closely watching Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell comments in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, US today which may provide further cues on whether the central bank will go for further rate cuts to energize the US economy.

55,2019-08-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government has kick-started the process of diluting its stake in state-run companies below 51% and has identified nearly a dozen firms for implementing the Budget announcement. The department of public investment and asset management (Dipam) is in the process of floating a discussion paper to consider the pros and cons of the move and thrash out a strategy for rolling out the plan that is expected to account for a significant share of this year’s target from asset sales, which has been estimated at Rs 1.05 lakh crore. 

The nearly dozen companies, which have been identified in a preliminary list, include those in which the government’s holding ranges from about 50% to 60%. Sources in the government said that Dipam will hold consultations with various ministries to try and resolve any issues linked to the stake dilution. 

They said the government wants to make sure that crucial issues such as reservation policy in PSUs need to be discussed threadbare to ensure that no controversies emerge after the stake dilution. Among the companies that may be taken up for disinvestment are IOC, NTPC, Power Grid, Oil India, GAIL, NALCO, BPCL and EIL, the sources said. 

They made it clear that no final view has been taken on the process and once the discussions are over, a Cabinet note will be floated. They also pointed out that the quantum of dilution has also not been finalised and would depend on how the discussions proceed. 

The sources also said that the government is aiming to wrap up at least two-three such cases by the third quarter of the current financial year that ends in March. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her maiden Budget speech in July, had said that the government is considering, in cases where the undertaking is still to be retained in government control, to go below 51% to an appropriate level on a case-to-case basis. She had said that the government has also decided to modify the present policy of retaining 51% government stake to retaining 51% stake inclusive of the stake of government-controlled institutions. 

In a post-Budget interview, the then Dipam secretary Atanu Chakraborty had said, “The basic understanding is that we can go below 51% on a case-to-case basis. How 51% is to be calculated also has to be stated. Government has also decided to modify present policy of retaining 51% stake inclusive of stake from government-controlled institutions. Large stake is held by public financial institutions or cross holdings, then that adds to 51% and that leaves very little float for people to come in. Now, with this the float is more.”"

59,2019-08-28,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty opened on a cautious note on Wednesday tracking weak cues from US stocks in overnight trade.

Statement from Moody’s Investors Service’s too impacted investor sentiment on D-Street. Moody's said the economic measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman are unlikely to provide some form of confidence or improve business and consumer sentiment.

Moody's, which lowered India’s gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to 6.4 per cent for FY20, said there is significant uncertainty in terms of the growth prospects both because of domestic as well as external factors. 

The 30-pack Sensex opened 14.50 points down at 37,641.84 but extended decline to over 50 points. The 50-share Nifty index opened 4.05 points down at 11,101.30.

According to Reliance Securities, Nifty index finished on an indecisive note on Tuesday. However, the near-term metrics are in buy mode. This may lead to a rise towards 11,500-11640 on a near-term basis. The immediate support zone falls around 11070-1130-10970, while it may face resistance around 11,200-11,250-11,360.

Sectorwise, Metal and Bankex were down 0.72 per cent and 0.34 per cent in early trade on BSE, while Healthcare and IT index were up 0.78 per cent and 0.55 per cent, respectively.

Wall Street ended in the red on Tuesday due to selling in financial stocks as a deepening of the treasury yield curve inversion raised US recession worries and uncertainty over any progress in trade negotiations between the United States and China took a toll. Dow Jones Industrial Average index settled at 25777.90, down 0.47 per cent against the previous close."

63,2019-08-29,PowerGrid,"Indian lenders had barely started breathing easy, a new bogey of debt defaults has started appearing on the horizon.

A sustained selloff in domestic equities for several months now has resulted in a situation where market capitalisations of many companies have slipped below their total outstanding debt.

This creates a serious challenge for domestic banks, as the biggest chunk of their corporate books is tied up to many of the financially-stressed firms.

Data available with Ace Equity showed as many as 190 BSE-listed companies had aggregate debt of Rs 18.89 lakh crore on their books against total market capitalisation of just Rs 5.54 lakh crore as of August 26, 2019. It means these companies owe over 3.4 times their total market valuation to banks in outstanding debt. 

Several prominent names figure on the list, including NTPC, Vodafone Idea, Srei Infra, GIC Housing Finance and Power Finance, among others.

Steel manufacturer and exporter National Steel & Agro Industries has a debt-to-market cap ratio of 133, with a debt of Rs 1,165.60 crore and market value of mere Rs 8.8 crore. A similar story is playing out on counters like Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), Adlabs Entertainment, McLeod Russel India, PNB Gilts, Steelco Gujarat and Hindusthan National Glass & Industries, which owe over 10 times their market valuation in outstanding debt.

“India Inc is guilty of over-leveraging,” says Amar Ambani, President, YES Securities. “After the US sub-prime crisis of 2007-08, the Indian corporate sector accumulated large debt on their books. Such companies can be risky bets, as debt and interest payment obligations are going to keep on mounting, leading them into debt traps,” Ambani said.

While the government has just released Rs 70,000 crore towards recapitalisation of public sector banks, trying to reinvigorate the credit cycle, the risk is that on the corporate side those in need of credit are mostly in a debt mess.

Steer clear of companies with high debt on their books, says Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. “It shows two things; first, the stock has taken a toll relatively during the correction phase, and secondly, debt repayment is going to be tough in such rough patches,” he said.

Ambani of YES Securities pointed out that the imbalance between debt and m-cap may trigger a fresh wave of corporate defaults. 

There is a serious issue of over-leveraging in the economy and it is increasingly becoming difficult for companies to improve balance sheets in the current depressed scenario of the market and the broader economy.

The problem is more pronounced in housing finance companies (HFCs) and shadow banks (NBFCs), but not limited to them.

Other firms belong to capital-intensive sectors like textile, telecom, auto and auto ancillary, cement, mining real estate, power, infrastructure and engineering. 

LIC Housing Finance, Tata Steel BSL, PNB Housing Finance, Future Enterprises, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Avadh Sugar & Energy, Indostar Capital Finance, Steel Authority Of India, Shriram Transport Finance, Can Fin Homes, Emami Paper, Suzlon Energy, Bombay Dyeing, Jindal Stainless, M&M Financial Services and JK Tyre & Industries all have debt exceeding their market cap.

Low valuations and the vicious cycle of low liquidity-poor profitability-earnings downgrade, if any, may further accentuate the problem. 

“If debt is about 1.5 times or higher than market cap for a long term, it is not considered a good omen. But in capital-intensive sectors, this level can go a little over 1.5 times,” said Nair.

He said one can ignore NBFCs and housing finance companies (HFC) from this equation, as debt works as capital for these companies.

There is a need companies to try internal management to seek ways for cash flow and fund operations if the economic turnaround takes longer than expected.

Companies should try and seek a balance between access to capital and excess of capital to avoid this vicious circle, which can lead to inadequate market capitalisation in a bad phase of the market. 

Not surprisingly, some of these companies are under constant scrutiny by analysts, leading to further downgrades. Recently, global rating agency Moody’s downgraded Indiabulls Housing Finance’s long-term corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1, while changing its outlook to negative from stable.

The international rating agency said the downgrade reflects renewed pressure on cost and availability of funds for Indiabulls Housing Finance (IBH) and certain other finance companies.

“At the same time, companies focused on cash flow and better productivity can becomes multibaggers over times,” says Ambani. 

“It is possible that some companies have humungous debt and compact market caps, but if the business picks up and the company is able to generate cash flow, it can ultimately help reduce debt. In such a scenario, the relative market-cap would ultimately rise helping the stock to deliver multibagger returns,” said Ambani.

Geojit’s Nair said every company has its own plan to take, manage and repay debt. Troubled companies usually sell core and/or non-core assets to meet debt obligations. “If one finds buyers at fair price, that can work as a remedy.”

But should investors catch falling knives?

Barring Manappuram Finance, Cholamandalam Investment, Power Grid, Ind Bank Housing and Sonal Mercantile, other companies on the list have not given positive returns to investors since January 1, 2018. 

On the other hand, companies like National Steel, Adlabs Entertainment, McLeod Russel, Quadrant Televentures, WS Industries, Vodafone Idea and Premier have tanked up to 90 per cent in the same period.

“Look at management guidance and their commentaries before taking an investment call. If the management sounds confident enough to make a turnaround, then one can look at quality stocks with strong fundamentals,” said Nair.

Spotting a stock among such companies is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Leveraging can work bot. Therefore, one should be very careful in investing.

“One should not try to catch falling stocks without proper analysis, as these are knives which have already fallen and hit the floor. Investors need to study company specifics, look at outstanding debt levels and study its ability to generate cash flow to repay debt based on the business model,” Ambani said, adding that one should refrain from sectors like telecom, as debt management would be tedious job over there due to cut-throat competition."

2,2019-09-03,PowerGrid,"Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a way to better harness the volume of energy collected by solar panels.

In the study published in the journal 'IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,' the researchers developed an algorithm that increases the efficiency of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system and reduces the volume of power currently being wasted due to a lack of effective controls.

""We've developed an algorithm to further boost the power extracted from an existing 
solar panel,"" said Milad Farsi, a Ph.D. candidate in Waterloo's Department of Applied Mathematics.

""Hardware in every solar panel has some nominal efficiency, but there should be some appropriate controller that can get maximum power out of solar panels,"" said Farsi.

""We do not change the hardware or require additional circuits in the 
solar PV system. What we developed is a better approach to controlling the hardware that already exists,"" Farsi continued.

The new algorithm enables controllers to better deal with fluctuations around the maximum power point of a solar PV system, which have historically led to the wasting of potential energy collected by panels.

""Based on the simulations, for a small home-use solar array including 12 modules of 335W, up to 138.9 kWh/year can be saved,"" said Farsi.

""The savings may not seem significant for a small home-use solar system but could make a substantial difference in larger-scale ones, such as a solar farm or in an area including hundreds of thousands of local 
solar panels connected to the power grid,"" said Farsi.

He further pointed out that the savings could be even more substantial under a fast-changing ambient environment or when the power loss in the converters due to the undesired chattering effects seen in other conventional control methods is taken into account."

If you are not aware, there is a solid lifeboat to sail through a bear market. Amid falling interest rates and severe selling pressure in domestic equities, high dividend yield stocks can help you stay on the winning side, and how!

Many of the listed companies have a good track record of delivering substantially better dividend than the interest rates you earn on your savings account. 

Data available with Ace Equity showed as many as five companies on BSE have managed to maintain a dividend yield of at least four per cent in last five years. The chart topper is, of course, public sector miner Coal India, which has a dividend yield of over 5 per cent.

State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s biggest lender by assets, currently offers an interest rate of 3.50 per cent on savings deposit balance of up to Rs 1 crore and 4 per cent above Rs 1 crore. 

Concerns over an economic slowdown and US-China trade tensions have put equity investors in a fix. The ongoing correction in the domestic market has already wiped off nearly Rs 12 lakh crore of investors’ wealth on BSE since January 2018, with over 85 per cent of stocks are now trading in the red. 

Such sustained selling usually allows investors to pick stocks at lower prices. And in the case of dividend payers, the equation gets even more attractive as dividend yields go up when prices go down. This mean this bear market has essentially thrown open a shopping season for stock pickers.

“It is a good idea to shop for high dividend yield stocks in a bear market. You are sure that even if the stock price falls from the levels you buy, you can wait for a long time for the stock to rise to a level where you can sell it for a profit,” says VK Sharma, Head - PCG & Capital Market Strategy, HDFC Securities.

June quarter GDP print showed the domestic economy in deep pain, which means the market may remain volatile for an extended period in spite of the booster dose that the government has offered to try and pump-prime the economy.

“High dividend yield stocks assure you a good return in the form of a dividend even if a stock does not appreciate. This allows you to hold a stock in a bear market. You can buy such stocks in a bear market and fix your dividend yield forever, as long as the company does not reduce the same,” says Sharma of HDFC Securities.

Economists have cut their growth forecasts for Indian economy and predicted deeper interest-rate cuts after data showed a sharper-than-expected slump in output.

Goldman Sachs Group and Citigroup have lowered their growth projections to 6 per cent for the financial year through March 2020, while Oxford Economics said there’s a risk the expansion could be weaker than that

“In a period where the economy is not growing very fast, utilities and dividend yield stocks are two very interesting areas to look at,” says S Naren, ED & CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC. 

The country’s economic growth already dropped to more than six-year low of 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2019-20 due to a sharp deceleration in the manufacturing sector and sluggish agriculture output, according to official data released on Friday.

Indian automakers reported up to 60 per cent drop in August sales, signalling deeper slowdown in discretionary consumption.

India Ratings has lowered its FY20 growth forecast to six-year low of 6.7 per cent from an earlier estimate of 7.3 per cent on account of slowdown in consumption and moderation in industrial growth among other factors.

 “Investors should chase beaten-down stocks that have quality earnings trajectory at least for the next two years and also offering good dividend yield at current market price. Coal India, Petronet LNG and ONGC have corrected significantly from their respective tops. This is the right time to accumulate such stocks,” said Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan.

Other public sector players Balmer Lawrie Investments, Oil India and NLC India (formerly known as Neyveli Lignite Corporation) have also maintained a dividend yield rate of over 4 per cent in last five years, while healthcare services firm NG Industries is the only private firm to maintain a dividend yield of between 4-6 per cent during FY15-19.

PSUs have been paying high dividends in recent years also under pressure from the government to help bridge its own revenue gap. With the government having got a bonanza from RBI this year, that pressure might ease some bit this year, leading to lesser dividend payment in some case.

For the financial year ended March 2019, Nalco, Vedanta, Graphite India, Hindustan Zinc, REC, HPCL, NMDC, BPCL, Power Grid, Firstsource Solutions, PNB Gilts, Ircon International and Indiabulls Housing Finance were among 45 companies with dividend yield between 4-13 per cent. 

Investors must remember that a dividend payout is totally a function of the earnings, the desire of the management to pay dividend also depends on the capex plan in hand. Past track record is no guarantee that a dividend will be paid, but consistency of dividend payments helps one understand the management policy.

Income received as dividend is tax-free to the extent of Rs 10 lakh per annum, which is an icing on the cake for investors.

However, there should be a proper exit strategy before investing in high dividend counters. Hota said investors should cut their positions when the tide turns and the market stabilises. “One should go for high-beta stocks when there are hopes that the market will go higher in near term,” he said"

6,2019-09-06,PowerGrid,"Any changes in divestment or dividend policies would benefit undervalued public sector undertakings (PSUs) such as Indian Oil, BPCL, Bharat Electronics, ONGC, NTPC, Powergrid Corporation, NMDC and Petronet LNG, among others, which could offer good value to the investors, analysts said. Stocks such as Coal India, Hindustan Copper, ONGC, BPCL, National Aluminium and Indian Oil rallied up to 10 per cent intraday on Thursday over news the government is likely to sell stake in state-owned companies through strategic divestments instead of an offer-for-sale or exchange traded funds (ETFs).

The multiple offerings of CPSE ETF over the past one year has acted as a key overhang for some PSU stocks, which remained flattish during this period. BSE PSU plunged 18 per cent in the last one year against 3.5 per cent decline of the Sensex.

“The news of a possible rethink on selling of government stake at the present low valuations have come as a relief to public sector companies that are anyway trading at attractive valuations,” said Gaurav Dua, senior VP, head, capital market strategy, Sharekhan. “Within the PSU basket, we prefer Bharat Electronics, ONGC, NTPC, Powergrid Corporation and Petronet LNG.”



In the past, public sector companies have grossly underperformed due to the hangover of additional supply of paper by the government to raise resources. Lately, the government also resorted to transfer of its holdings to cash-rich companies or via regular cash transfer by way of dividend payouts.

Stocks such as Steel Authority of India, National Aluminium, BHEL, Gail and Coal India have declined between 20 per cent and 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.

“The government’s current stance of not willing to sell at distress valuations is a significant positive and that has been the reason for the interest in state-run stocks,” said Naveen Kulkarni, head of research, Reliance Securities. “PSU companies have seen consistent declines because of lots of supply from the government.” Stocks such as Ircon International, REC, Hindustan Aeronautics, NTPC and Engineers India currently offer an attractive dividend yield between 4 per cent and 10 per cent. A few of them like NMDC, ONGC, BHEL, National Aluminium and Oil India are trading at their book value.

“Some of the PSUs with sound fundamentals can offer good trading opportunities for the midterm if government changes its divestment and dividend policies,” said Asutosh Mishra, head of research, institutions, Ashika Stock Broking. “Stocks such as HPCL, BPCL, Indian Oil, NMDC, among others, with clear earnings visibility are currently available at discounted valuations.”

In her budget speech on July 5, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would continue with strategic disinvestment of select central public sector enterprises. The government has raised the divestment target for financial year 2020 to Rs 1.05 lakh crore from Rs 90,000 crore earlier."

12,2019-09-07,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has asked central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to advance their capital expenditure plans and also ensure the timely release of payments to small and medium enterprises, as part of the government’s efforts aimed at giving a boost to the sagging economy. “They (CPSEs) were impressed upon to adhere to the expenditure plan and accelerate investment activities,” a finance ministry release said on Friday. North Block called heads of Maharatna and Navratna companies to review their expenditure plans on Friday. The meeting was co-chaired by economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty and expenditure secretary GC Murmu and also attended by financial advisors of infrastructure ministries.

In the budget for FY20, the government had provided Rs 5.38 lakh crore for capital expenditure through internal and extra budgetary resources (IBER), which is essentially that by CPSEs. The amount budgeted for this year is less than the Rs 6.12 lakh crore spent via this route last year. India’s economy grew 5% in the first quarter of the current financial year, its slowest in over six years. The slump in sales of automobiles and consumer non-durable goods in August has added to the worry that revival may take a while.

The government has announced several measures to shore up the economy and lift overall business sentiment, including withdrawal of the super-rich surcharge on foreign portfolio investors and additional depreciation benefits for vehicle purchases. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman also unveiled a major consolidation exercise in the banking sector that will see 10 state-run lenders merged into four. Heads of state-owned enterprises were also asked to focus on “monitoring release of payments” for procurement and other contracts without delay to ensure liquidity in a timebound manner.

“Resolution of outstanding payments, which may have been held up on account of disputes, was also reviewed,” the statement said, adding that the ministry of finance would constantly monitor the progress of large infrastructure projects for ministries as well as CPSEs and follow-up meetings would be held.

After the meeting, ONGC executive director NC Pandey said as many as 27 projects worth Rs 87,000 crore are on stream. These will be completed in three-four years, he told reporters. “We are on track. We are hopeful that these projects will be completed on time,” he said.

On payments, it was emphasised that efforts should be made to facilitate these ahead of schedule, Pandey said. Those who attended included top executives of Power Grid Corp. of India, NTPC, NHAI, Steel Authority of India Ltd and Government e-Marketplace."

15,2019-09-09,PowerGrid,"You need to start buying into stories of limited returns rather than alpha returns and the magic of three times and four times, Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance Services. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Will we survive this storm in the market?In a lighter vein, you can say that the so-called experts do not have a clue. We are all leading each other without knowing where we are going. But having said that, since we are talking about serious money at this point of time, people need to start to understand that in the short run, market news boil you up but in the long run, it is the economic policy of a nation which will dictate its fortunes and vicissitudes. 

If you really look at India’s situation today, we are essentially becoming more of a socialistic kind of an economy. Literally, a lot of India is getting hooked to dole and therefore the prospect of any serious change in economic fortunes can only happen if there is an idealistic change in the government policy. 

It is not about small steps. Small steps are valued if you pay 75% of arbitration. Money is very good for some companies, but the magnitude of the change will only come if we start to believe that we are a capitalist nation and a capitalist society. That is where the divergence is coming in terms of expectation of industrialists and people like us who invest money. We are believing ourselves to be a capitalist economy like America. We have seen what has happened in Italy and Greece. Are we going to see the same thing for some more time to come, till there is a steep correction in the direction of the government?

If that happens, we change. If that does not happen, we need to be circumspect about what our portfolios should comprise of and the quantum of investment in the market.


Is it time to pick bargains, time to protect cash or time to accept that we do not know what is coming next?It is not that we do not know. We know that at the end of the day, economic reality will change the policy. It is now a matter of timing alone. Let us be honest, we may like midcaps and small caps very much but the life term of smallcaps is over. It is done and dusted. Let us not even waste time putting money there in the hope of a revival. 

Nine out of 10 people want to get out, not get in. Any revival of a serious kind will be sold into. So that is a given. It is back to the same thesis -- where are you in the quality stocks of any nation? Whether you are in France, Germany, Italy, in order to invest, you first need to build your portfolio top-down not bottom-up. Problem is that 90% of our portfolios are bottom-up which means smaller, opportunistic stocks take up the space. But if you ask the person how much of your portfolio is lying with the top 10 companies of this country, you will find may be it is 10% to 20% only. It should have been the other way round. I think that inversion is a given. If you have not done it, it is time to do it. Maybe it is too late in your view because you got to book losses, but that is the reality. 

We will have to live with the idea that India’s smallcap story has been over for a very long time. The midcap, some of them are good quality, actually definition of midcap also varies, SEBI definition is different than our definition. But if you look at industry to industry, midcaps sound good. It is absolutely fine to be in some of them. So it is not gloom doom. You need to rebuild your portfolio and wait it out for some time as things turn out. The best part is that in a low investment cycle, you will see high dividends because all the good quality companies pay good dividends and we have discussed a number of times the MNCs’ fantastic dividend returns. 

One needs to focus on dividend. You have seen the performance of Embassy REITs for instance -- 300 to 410 -- spectacular increase for a pure fixed income product. You need to start buying into stories of limited returns rather than alpha returns and the magic of three times and four times.


Where do you see those green shoots or any kind of impact of recent stimulus or likely stimulus measures? Where is there some merit in investing?We test all the companies that we have invested in by checking if they need government intervention for their fortunes to change. That is not a good idea to be in. Auto is one of the sectors we have not invested, not because government needs to give a stimulus but we have discussed it the auto companies need to start empting out their pockets and the promoters to start supporting their own businesses. 

Maruti has started leasing out space with their own money in various tier two and tier three towns. I think that is a great move. You need to make your portfolio with stocks which are not so dependent on government policy action. You cannot control it, you cannot predict it and so if you are buying auto, as in the aviation pack, there are only one or two to buy. You are just fine there because we have seen the government moving out of it. 

If you are looking at the airport, that is a wonderful place to be even though there are two very stressed companies. This sector is not doing extremely well and is an amazing example of how good quality assets got created without the government putting in any money. In fact, the government is realising fantastic sums of money. You have to look at whether it is a multiplex, whether it is aviation, whether it is consumer. None of them need government stimulus to move. They just need the regular economy to shape up.

The challenge is it may take time. We can live with it and the good part is all these companies pay give good dividends. You need to focus upon the companies where government action is not the sole dictator of their fortune because if that is so, then you are playing a very dangerous game of predicting the government actions, which you cannot. I do not think that is a wise way to put your money around somebody else policy actions.


Government and airports are connected. We have seen what happened to GVK and GMR when government policies were changed. Airport businesses are highly regulated and tomorrow morning, the government may come and say we will charge this and we will not charge this. You are asking investor to avoid government dominated businesses and you are bullish on airports?What the government cannot tinker with is that they cannot shut down airport operations. The two airport companies are doing wonderfully well now. I do not know where to place the blame. They have set up the power plants which have promised gas, the gas never came. You can blame the companies for it, you can certainly blame the promoters for overleveraging. Also there are elements of government action in other parts, which was the sub gas supply. The reason I said privatisation is because nine more airports have been privatised,

I am quite sure the policy will be consistent across all the airports. If influential groups have taken over the new airports -- for example, seven airports by the Adani Group --. I would presume that the policy would remain neutral. It is not going to get adverse. Neutral policies are good policies because you can predict on it that is one. Number two, the government realises good money; number three, there is a regulatory commission which governs what these airports can charge you and me as user fees etc. 

It is not necessarily government controlled. May be the person who gets appointed can get influenced but there is still a barrier between government action and what charges they can levy on us. Therefore it is a good case study. 

An example of what has gone right and what has gone wrong is exactly are coals and etc. where there is no capex etc. but there is this whole host of companies which do not need to worry about government action at all at this point of time. Let us be honest, government has no money to give stimulus. So, if you are basing on a government stimulus, that will be a very bad investment choice and as we said government allows you to invest across the world. There is no need to look at only India to diversify your portfolio. Real estate has done well, gold has done well, US markets have done well. It is not bad if you are really making intelligent portfolio choices and not linked to only midcap and small cap of India.


How do you bet on a government linked theme ? GVK has got challenges, GMR and may be Adani can be considered. GMR certainly allows the airport interplay?Well unfortunately I do some work for GVK and so I do not want to comment on the company at this point of time. GMR I would definitely say is not coming out of the woods to that extent. We just built up holdings there, in the last couple of weeks. The Adani Vehicle is still not available to invest in terms of direct investment in airports.

Privatisation will give more rewards rather than penalties for this sector. At its worst, policy will maintain status quo; at best, it will be beneficial and I doubt it will be adverse at this point of time. It is a declared policy.

The second place where you want to go is the power industry where the government will sooner or later, invest more. The power policy is by and large frozen and we need to see what happens to discoms. I will not invest in a PFC because I do not know what is going to happen to the dues, what the balance sheet looks like etc. Companies like Power Grid where we have investments, make sound business sense because what has happened to the REIT transaction on power assets if you look at what KKR has bought, it is a wonderfully good asset and may be the government will follow that path, Power distribution could be one of the places where one couls see lots of action happening."

22,2019-09-13,PowerGrid,"Nobody, trust us, nobody has ever got it right while trying to tell a market bottom. The textbook trick is: start buying when the last bull has turned a bear!

Dalal Street’s biggest bull, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has already turned bullish. “Indicators are suggesting that stocks have bottomed out, particularly midcaps, and this is a good time to invest,” he told a TV channel on Thursday.

Meanwhile, adverse macro-economic factors that were causing all the trouble in the market have started improving: the US and China are making goodwill gestures, no-deal Brexit is off the table, ECB going in for fresh bond buying, and back home the government is getting serious about hand-holding the distressed sectors of the economy. IIP print for July did show a turnaround, though economists were cautious with that number.

Domestic stock investors surely have a huge opportunity here; the challenge is in one’s ability to spot the right stock. Stocks have been beaten down across sectors and many of them today trade really cheap by any valuation matrix.

Investors are already busy mining value bets and BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have started showing early signs of brisk buying, having managed to outpace the benchmark Sensex in four out of past five sessions (till September 12).

“It is difficult to call the market bottom,” says Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Marcellus Investment. “But it is looking like a good time to go bargain hunting, even though there is some degree of risk out there. One should always realise that bargains are only available when there is a degree of risk. It does feel a little difficult from an economic perspective, but you should go bargain hunting when you still feel a little risk in the air,” he said.

At ETMarkets, when we applied some filters, we found around 350 stocks that have fallen 10-97 per cent from their respective all-time highs scaled in last three years.

This list includes only liquid companies that reported profits in last five financial years.

And then, we applied a few more filters on them. Check out what we found:-


1) Stocks that have slipped 10-20%The list threw up 48 stocks that are down up to 20 per cent from their all-time highs. The list even included some of the largecaps such as HDFC Bank, Power Grid, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra and Bajaj Finserv.






2) Stocks down 20-40%Most stocks on this list are midcaps or smallcaps and several auto majors that have taken a big knock after the severe slowdown. So the list included Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, The Federal Bank, Tata Chemicals, Chambal Fertilisers and Cholamandalam Finance.








3) Stocks down 40-60%This list, too, includes select auto and auto ancillaries, besides media and NBFC companies. Among them are M&M, Balmer Lawrie, TV Today, LIC Housing Finance and TVS Motor, which have eroded nearly 50 per cent of investor wealth from their all-time high levels.










4) Stocks down 60-80%Avanti Feeds, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Phillips Carbon Black, Indiabulls Housing Finance, NBCC and JBM Auto are some of the names on this list








5) Stock down more than 80%The list topper here is, of course, YES Bank, which faces corporate governance issues. Others included Geojit Financial Services, PC Jeweller, Vakrangee, Kushal and Excel Realty, which have wiped out up to 97 per cent of investor wealth.




6) Stocks below industry PE averagesWe further shortened the list to look for stocks trading a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios that are below their respective industry averages. It threw up nearly 230 names, which included Apollo Tyres, Bajaj Consumer, Deepak Fertilisers, Eveready Industries, M&M and YES Bank, among others.






7) Stocks trading below book valueThis screener threw up some 60 names. The list included YES Bank, Indian Bank, GSCL, Gujarat State Fertilisers, Arvind, Welspun Enterprises and JK Tyre, among others.




8) Stocks with YoY profit & sales growthWhen the list was further filtered for companies that reported a rise in profit and sales on a year-on-year basis for last four quarters, it yielded just seven stocks: Welspun Enterprises, Goodluck India, REC, GHCL, Globus Spirits, Himatsingka Seida and Sukhjit Starch & Chemicals."

23,2019-09-17,PowerGrid,"Tata Global, Deepak Nitrite and Crompton Greaves Consumer are the three midcap favourites of Abhimanyu Sofat, VP-Research, IIFL. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


If the Indiabulls-Laxmi Vilas Bank deal fails to pass RBI’s litmus test, do you think it could turn out to be a crisis in the scale of the IL&FS one?One must recognise that two weeks back or so, the CEO of Lakshmi Vilas Bank has already resigned. Considering a deal is under way, such kind of news could be worrying. It is very hard to say whether it would happen or not, but ultimately RBI has to take a call on that. Structurally, Lakshmi Vilas Bank’s numbers are showing a significant amount of stress and if Indiabulls has to come around, considering the problems they themselves are facing. this deal might take a bit of time before if it happens. 

As for whether it can become something like IL&FS kind of an issue, the size and scale of Indiabulls also is quite large in terms of the size of the book and so if something happens to Indiabulls, then that kind of issue can happen. Right now, I am sure the cooler heads will prevail and going forward, if we do see a liquidity injection happening on the NBFC side, then such a situation may not happen going forward.


What is there on your radar? What would you buy today, tomorrow, this week, next week?There has been a clear shift in the last 10-15 days and some amount of interest has started coming back in the midcap side of the market. Some of the stocks that we are looking for would include Tata Global because once you see the shifting of consumer business from Tata Chemicals, it could add up to around Rs 150-crore-odd to the EBITDA of the company. 

There is a smallcap company called Deepak Nitrite where for some of their businesses, growth will be strong and ultimately the earnings growth could be in excess of 100% over the next one year, whereas the multiple is less than 10x for this particular company. We have also talked about some of the other stocks like Ipca Labs. 

In addition to that, a high ROE business could be something like Crompton Greaves Consumer which looks quite attractive considering that the ROE profile of the company is in excess of 30%. We feel that particular market should grow at around 16-17% over a period of time. These are some of the stocks we like from the midcap basket at this particular point of time. 


Is there anything that catches you interest in pharma basket because many believe that a big overhang got lifted for Sun Pharma. DRL has been a favourite in any case and valuations are in favour of the pharma sector in general?Absolutely. On the domestic side, we are clearly seeing some amount of improvement happening in volume in this sector. In terms of stocks we like, we believe stocks like Ipca Labs where the earnings growth is going to be more in the range of 26-27% CAGR over the next two years is clearly one stock where we are seeing an industry leading volume growth happening. That is one stock that we really like. 

We had turned bullish again on Sun Pharma last month after being negative for the last two years. We feel that the risk reward is quite good. The domestic business as well as the rest of the world business is good enough to take care of the existing valuations of the company is available. A price target of close to Rs 500 is easily achievable over the next one year in case of Sun Pharma. We have been slowly aligning our portfolio more towards pharmaceutical sector relative to what the allocation was in the last two months. 


Is there any PSU which you think would be a viable option if disinvested?Power sector is one where we clearly see an opportunity going forward in terms of growth. We would be interested in a company like Power Grid. Other than that, in the case of the PSU banks, we would be interested only if we see a change in management on change in ownership.


We have been tracking the move on some of the OMCs given the crude concerns. Higher oil prices may actually be sustained for a while. What would you be doing with some of those stocks right now?First of all, the consensus view now is that what has happened is a temporary issue where oil has now gone up to $68 and as supply improves, you will see oil going down. I do not think that is going to be the case because overall the risk premium for crude has definitely increased for the next couple of months. That is a reality that one needs to look at.

If we do see a war happening with Iran, you could see some of the other middle eastern countries also getting involved and not only Israel or US. It could be a very large risk to the market, especially for say Asia. Most of the countries are net importers of oil. In India, we have seen how the rupee has reacted. So from an OMC perspective, I would not like to bottom fish those OMCs. The risk reward right now is not favourable because no one is expecting crude to continue at $75-$80 which could be a possibility going forward if the tensions do not ease over the next couple of weeks."

31,2019-09-23,PowerGrid,"By broadening the scope of the mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending, the government has effectively facilitated the concept of CSR to be turned into corporate innovation responsibility (CIR). The move essentially provides a nudge to companies to spend up to 2% of their profits on supporting research and innovation.

To be sure, companies were allowed to grant money from the CSR kitty to tech-incubators located within academic institutions approved by the Centre. The government has now expanded the scope of spending CSR budget on incubators funded by central or state governments, or any agency or public sector undertaking of central or state governments, and making contributions to public funded universities, IITs, national laboratories and autonomous bodies (established under the auspices of ICAR, ICMR, CSIR, DAE, DRDO, DST, ministry of electronics and information technology) engaged in conducting research in science, technology, engineering and medicine aimed at promoting sustainable development goals.

This has the potential to give rise to more public-private partnerships in scientific discovery, innovation and technical education, a tradition that is well developed and followed in the West but not so in India. It will encourage Indian companies to support research in the areas of their expertise or interest.

Indian companies largely have a poor record of investing in research, development and innovation. Data from Bloomberg shows that only 34 of the 50 Nifty companies invested in research and development (R&D) in 2018-19. Their cumulative expenditure stood at Rs 20,890 crore. Incidentally, ten of these companies spent more on CSR than on R&D. Five public sector undertakings – IOCL, BPCL, NTPC, Power Grid Corporation and GAIL – spent more on CSR than research.

Against this, the 50 Nifty companies spent a total of Rs 7,093 crore on CSR. With research funding allowed to be made from the CSR kitty, companies that had been hesitant on spending on CSR would now be more willing to support innovation that may potentially help their business. Pharmaceutical companies are a case in point. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, for instance, spent Rs 1,977 crore on R&D in FY19 but only Rs 3.9 crore on CSR. Such companies can now easily marry the two objectives of supporting research and drug discovery as well as doing social good in the process.

Banks and financial service institutions, which do not report any expenditure on R&D, can look at investing part of their CSR budget in research on financial inclusion, digital banking and new technologies in digital banking.

The government has pushed the ball in India Inc’s court. The moot question is – will it deliver?"
29,2019-09-23,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Traders on Dalal Street were still in a jubilant mood on Monday after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's corporate tax cut on Friday, taking benchmark indices further ahead. Good news on the US-China trade front and positive cues from global peers further boosted the mood back home.

BSE Sensex rallied 1075.41 points, or 2.83 per cent higher, at 39,090.03, while NSE Nifty ended at 11,603.40, up 329.20 points or 2.92 per cent. 

In the 30-pack Sensex, 16 stocks ended in the green and 14 in the red with Bajaj Finance finishing as best performer and Infosys the worst. L&T, Asian Paints, ITC and Axis Bank too joined Bajaj Finance on the gainer’ list, jumping up to 9 per cent. 

Tata Motors, Power Grid, NTPC and Tech Mahindra were among the other Sensex stocks that declined. 

The BSE Midcap index advanced 3.08 per cent outperforming benchmark Sensex. The BSE Smallcap index rose 2.73 per cent. 

BSE Capital Goods index recorded 6.55 per cent gain on the sectoral return chart followed by Bankex, Finance and FMCG index. 

In terms of index contribution, HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and ITC were chart toppers while Infosys, TCS, RIL and Power Grid were the top drags on Sensex. 

Experts believe market is set for further rise. “Markets will witness a revival in enthusiasm as the newly announced fiscal measures will give relief from the slowdown fears in the domestic market. FIIs now have a good reason to come back to India and this progressive step will stimulate consumption & ignite capex cycle,” said Vinod Nair, Head Of Research at Geojit Financial Services.


Factors behind the market rally:

Corporate tax cutThe corporate tax rate cut is still the biggest reason why the market is up on Monday. The cut will benefit the top 1,000 companies in tune of Rs 37,000 crore, according to CRISIL. The measure will cost the exchequer in tune of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. The rate cut brings down the effective taxes on profit for big companies by up to 28 per cent and for relatively smaller companies the same comes down by 13 per cent. 


GST Council decisionOn Friday, the GST Council reduced taxes on a number of items and services to boost consumption. The biggest beneficiaries of the tax cuts would be hospitality and tourism industry as the highest tax slab has been reduced to 18 per cent. Rooms prices below Rs 999 will be tax exempt, those between Rs 1,000 and Rs 7,499 will be taxed at 12 per cent and rooms priced above Rs 7,500 will be taxed at the rate of 18 per cent. 

Status quo on taxes on tobacco also cheered the market participants as the Street was expecting a hike in taxes. 


US-China trade warHopes of an interim Sino-US tariff deal increased after the two countries described their talks as ""productive"" and ""constructive"". US Trade Representative's office issued a brief statement characterising the two days of talks with China as ""productive."" Similarly, China's Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as ""constructive"", and said they had also had a good discussion on ""detailed arrangements"" for the high-level talks in October. Additionally, the United States removed tariffs from more than 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies.


Nifty breaks 50, 200DMAsOn daily charts, Nifty broke above the 50 and 200-day moving averages (DMAs) that indicated a bullish trade setup. Friday's rally also negated fears of Nifty testing its swing low of 10,637 anytime soon. The 11,100-11,150 zone, which posed a strong resistance earlier, will now act as a support for the index on the downside, said Mohit Khanchandani of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

		}Top 4 stock recommendations for this week of 6NextPrevPlay SlideshowTop Weekly Recommendations23 Sep, 2019The euphoria on the Dalal Street is running high and wild following Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's cut in corporate tax. However, technical indicators suggest that there are chances that such a massive move can push the market into a period of consolidation. Here are four stocks that could prove good trading plays this week:NextJSW Steel | Buy Above: Rs 238 | Target Price: Rs 26023 Sep, 2019The stock is seen forming base of confirmation of a trend reversal. After a prolonged downtrend from 427, the stock formed a low near 201 and formed a trading zone between 201-225 area. After good deliberation in this congestion zone, the stock has attempted a breakout. The price has closed above the 50-DMA. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period which and also shows a bullish divergence against the price. The price has also closed above the upper Bollinger band. Though a minor pullback inside the band cannot be ruled out, the up-move has good chance of continuing. Any close below 218 should be treated as a stop-loss for this trade.Next Tata Steel | Buy Above: Rs 368 |Target Price: Rs 41023 Sep, 2019Over the past several weeks, the stock has held its bottom formed near 325-340 zones and has successfully pulled back. After trading in a capped range for a while following a sustained downtrend, the stock is showing signs of a potential reversal. The prices have inched above the 50-DMA, and in the process, the RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high. The PPO stays positive while daily MACD is seen inching higher near the zero lines while trading above the signal line. On the weekly chart, the RSI has just moved above 30 from the oversold territory which is a positive indication. Any close below 349 should be treated as a stop-loss for this trade.Next Bharat Forge | Buy Above: Rs 424 | Target Price: Rs 46523 Sep, 2019In a secular downtrend in form of a falling channel, the stock tested the levels of 376 from the highs of 675-680. Currently, it has attempted to revere the trend. It has penetrated the falling trend line, and in the process, it has closed above the upper Bollinger band. The upward breakout has good chance of continuing even if we see a temporary pullback inside the band. The RSI has marked a fresh 14-period high, and it appears to be breaking out of the pattern. The RS line, when compared against the broader markets is seen penetrating its 50-DMA. A move that takes it to the 200-DMA cannot be ruled out. Any close below 405 should be treated as a stop-loss for this trade. NextCipla | Buy Above : Rs 463 | Target Price: Rs 49823 Sep, 2019The stock has strayed much away from it's mean and is due for some technical pullback. After drifting below its multipoint support in the range of 500-505, the stock went on to test the low near 449 levels. It has held this support twice and is now attempting to pullback. The PPO stays positive, and MACD remains in continuing buy mode. The RSI is seen taking pattern support and has shown positive divergence against the price. The weekly charts have shown formation of a candle with a long lower shadow near the oversold area and the stock may see some up move that would take it near to its 50-DMA. Any close below 445 should be taken as a stop-loss of this trade.Next"

34,2019-09-24,PowerGrid,"In the Nifty, only about 15 odd stocks would be trading above the historical averages. The entire BSE mid and small cap are trading well below the historic levels, says Abhiram Eleswarapu, Head of India Equity Research, BNP Paribas. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

We have moved 8.5% on the Nifty since the corporate tax cuts were announced. The EPS upgrades which have come in for Nifty earnings are in the 7-8% range. Is the best already in the price or do you think the prices can move much higher than what the upgrades are?The first-order impact of these tax cuts are pretty much in the price in the last two days. For example, in our coverage area, the effective tax rates earlier were about 29% odd and that will fall to maybe about 23%. That leads to about 8% odd potential earnings upside and the Nifty move in the last two days has been about 8.5%...


It captures it all.It practically captured all of that. What is more interesting is that apart from just this move, there are a couple of first-order effects. One, equity investors have got an immediate benefit compared to just about anybody else and the second point is that the government has probably given a strong message that they are willing to do what it takes to pull the economy out of the current situation and that is what most investors will probably take away. 

It is interesting to note that in the Nifty, only about 15 odd stocks would be trading above the historical averages. The entire BSE mid and small cap are trading well below the historic levels, probably one standard deviation below and therefore this move could broaden the number of stocks that investors could look at. 

So far, we have had a very narrow sort of a move. That will be the first-order impact. The second order impact is more interesting and that is the impact on the real economy. It is much more difficult to quantify. It may not happen in the next few days, probably in the next few months or years also. The tax cuts should boost infrastructure spending, setting up new capacity, etc. 


Does that not happen overnight?It does not happen overnight. That is the reason why the horizon provided is until 2023 and the option to allow foreign companies to come in and set up shop in India. Also, it is timed well, along with the China-US trade war. So it is just possible that we attract some of that investment. That is the interesting part on the investment side. 

It is a bit more complicated in consumption sector. The hope obviously is that when you cut tax rates, companies will reduce product prices and boost demand. But if you do the calculations, that is more possible on the consumer staple side, if at all and possibly on select products. The price cuts could be measured as well leading to a slight improvement in demand in products where the demand is elastic. 

However on the consumer discretionary side, small cuts in prices do not usually change volume and we just calculated in our work today that at best, auto companies could cut between 0% to 1% on prices and they may not do that at all! So the impact on the consumer is a lot more measured.


Given that we have seen the government step up on all fronts, there is still a call that until we see divestment or some impetus to government spending, we would not see a complete 360 degree turnaround. But at least some of these measures are expected to boost lending. What can we expect over the next couple of quarters?Let us look at some of the positives for the second half. First is of course what we just had on the tax cut. You have to acknowledge that in the last 2-3 months, the government has announced several measures around lending, for improving liquidity and money is being handed out to the consumer on the rural side through the PM Kisan scheme. Only a part of that money is being paid out. That could happen in the second half of the year. The monsoons were reasonably good. 

I would say there have been quite a few growing positives for the second half. You cannot avoid the negatives of course. Some of them could be a little more structural in nature. For example, on the rural side wages are quite poor, unemployment is rising in the urban side and all that leads to lower savings rates. Transmission of rate cuts has not really happened. RBI has cut interest rates by quite a bit, about 110 bps this year. But the lending rates are practically stable there or even have increased in some cases. 

There is no doubt that there are several negatives as well. What one needs to bear in mind is that last week around this time, there was extreme pessimism in the market. Globally, growth is slowing everywhere but it is very possible that central banks across the world act on monetary policy and that could probably help a market like India. So I would say we have to be kind of balanced on this, take the positives, take the negatives and go back to the homework.


Do you think companies will pass on the tax benefit to the consumers?As I mentioned to you earlier on the discretionary side, I doubt whether they will pass on that benefit.


In terms of new investments?New investments absolutely. There are many areas, especially in autos, where several companies are running well above their usual utilisation levels. For the economy as a whole, the utilisation levels are above 75%. It is obviously a requirement that the company set up a new capacity, but these decisions do not happen overnight. They happen over time.


What if they are content to wait and watch?If they are already on the fence and the tax cut only helps their costs, they will probably do it quicker than we expect.


For an investor, what does it mean? Have you missed the bus already in the last two days? If you were not fully invested, if you were sitting on cash, have you missed the ride already? Do you think there are midcap and smallcap stocks where the catch-up has just begun? If you have missed the rally over the last two days, you have to be kind on yourself. You cannot expect announcements like this on a daily basis. It is okay if you missed it. But going forward, as I said, the best of the earnings upgrade is in the price. We follow a very systematic pattern for creating portfolios and we call them quality less. We have two variants -- one of growth and one of value. We are looking at intersection of companies that satisfy quality requirements for reasonable earnings growth and have decent valuation at the same time. 

It is impossible to find a company that satisfies all these requirements but we are trying to find the best fit and today the stocks that dominate those lists are in the financial services space and insurance. We have several companies on consumer staples which are probably likely to benefit more than discretionary.


Let’s start with the financial services list first. Where do you find a congregation of all these parameters that you talked about?It is available mostly in private banks and not just now, but over the last 10 years or so, if there was one space which benefited from all the themes in India starting from premiumisation, penetration and digitisation, that was private banks. The next could potentially be insurance and that is why these are the two sectors that we are most positive on.


The consumption trend is pretty clear. What about Power Grid, GAIL among largecaps? What are you looking at when it comes to that segment?I would not be able to comment on individual companies but we follow a systematic approach. Some stocks have moved a lot in the last few months or days and therefore they have become expensive and dropped out of the list and there are others which are less expensive and would get into the list. That is the most common reason for stocks moving in and out on a short term basis."

SBI shares tank 7%Stock price of State Bank of India (SBI) tanked to a four-year low on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to ‘equal weight’. A market-wide profit booking also weighed on the stock, which tumbled 7.37 per cent or Rs 22.30 on BSE to close at Rs 280. This was the biggest single-day fall of the script in last four years.

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits” for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India. The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list” of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries to smaller names including Manappuram Finance , Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.

“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,” he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.”



India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.

Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9 per cent while small cap names gained 7 per cent. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3 per cent in the last three sessions.

The gains show that the “first round impact” of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.

Here are the key insights from the report



Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6 per cent above Tuesday’s close
Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75 per cent of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

It owns 65% in the listed PTC India Financial Services (PFS).

Wholly-owned subsidiary PTC Energy has a portfolio of 289 MW.

The company’s shareholders are focusing on its core business of power trading and exiting non-core businesses, a company spokesperson said. PTC has sought shareholders’ approval for the share sale.

PTC decided to exit both businesses because its shareholders, as well as those of its promoters, have been demanding optimisation of resource allocation, people said.

“Over the period, PTC has invested about Rs 1,400 crore in these companies.

These two companies are engaged in the sectors that need continuous capital infusion, which is difficult to fund on a consistent basis from the PTC balance sheet,” said the second person.

PTC has sought shareholders’ approval to dilute up to a 26% stake in the financial services firm from the current 65%. Sources said dilution would depend upon the valuation.

“In case of good valuation, the company may exit completely. Or, it can retain 26% stake but give ma-nagement control to the successful suitor in the first phase. It may also enter into a binding agreement with the successful bidder to sell the residual stake in future,” said the person.

In 2017, some of the institutional investors in PTC proposed to appoint their representative on its board, citing undervalued stock and financial inefficiency.

“The background of the proposed transactions comes from an increasing focus on efficient capital allocation.

The subsidiaries have business in financial services and energy assets. The synergies and fit of these business with PTC’s core operations have diminished over the past 5-6 years. At the same time, the electricity market is growing and throwing up new opportunities,” said the first person, who is close to one of the shareholders.

PTC Energy has an equity base of Rs 654.11 crore. It recorded revenue from operations of Rs 331.47 crore in fiscal 2018-19 and a profit before tax of Rs 74 crore. It operates wind energy projects — 50 MW each in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, and 188.8 MW in Andhra Pradesh.

PTC India Financial Services is classified as an infrastructure finance company by the Reserve Bank of India. PTC has invested Rs 754.77 crore in the company, which recorded a profit before tax of Rs 281crore on revenue of Rs 1,336.51 crore in fiscal 2019."

55,2019-09-30,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Centre's recent move to lower the corporate tax rate is a positive development for the power sector as it is expected to save Rs 2500 crore a year for the state distribution companies, ratings firms Icra said on Monday. 

The move would allow power generators with cost-plus power purchase agreements (PPAs) to pass on tax cuts to power distribution utilities, an official statement issued by the ratings agency said. 

As per Icra's estimates, the extent of benefit that would accrue to discoms from the power generation and transmission segments, mainly from central and state utilities, would be about Rs 2500 crore annually.

Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president and group head - Corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “The benefit so accrued to discoms in turn would enable them to lower their cost of supply and hence, reduce the gap between average tariff and cost of power supply by about 3 paise per unit sold at all India level. However, the extent of reduction in gap for the discoms would vary across the states depending on the mix of cost plus and bid-based PPAs and share of supply from central sector companies.”

Within the overall annual energy generation of 1250 billion units in FY2019, about 67% is cost-plus tariff based predominantly from central and state sector utilities. The central government entities like NTPC Ltd, NLC India Ltd, Damodar Valley Corporation, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and NHPC Ltd have cost-plus tariff structures, leading to pass through of lower tax incidence to the discoms, the statement said. 

Also, the state-owned power generating companies and power transmission companies, would be benefited from the lower tax incidence, which would be passed on to the discoms under the regulated cost- plus tariff structure. 

The effective tax rate for most of these central sector utilities over the past two years was in the range of 21%-23%, partly due to availability of tax holiday benefit (where MAT is applicable) for a large portion of their projects.

The power generation projects including renewable power projects having PPAs based on competitive bid- based tariffs and under the erstwhile preferential tariff route are expected to benefit from the lower tax rates. 

For a wind or solar power project commissioned recently, ICRA estimates the reduction in tax rate will improve the internal rate of return by 40 basis points, though the impact on debt coverage metrics is not material. 

For projects commissioned prior to March 2017 and availing the tax holiday under Section 80- IA, it remains to be seen, if the MAT credit entitlement accumulated during the tax holiday period can be set- off against the tax liability under the lower tax option in future, the statement said."

56,2019-09-30,PowerGrid,"Gujarat energy minister Saurabh Patel said here on Thursday that the state government's rooftop solar panel scheme aims to cover two lakh households by March 31 next year.

Under the scheme, people can install solar panels for electricity generation on the roof of their houses, and if there is surplus electricity, they can sell it to the power grid.

""1,600 MW of solar power will be produced through rooftop solar panels in Gujarat by 2021-22,"" the minister said at an event here, adding that the government aims to cover two lakh families under the scheme this fiscal.

The state government had made a provision of Rs 1,000 crore in the current year's budget for the scheme, he said, adding that the households which install solar panels will get 40 per cent subsidy from the government for 2 KW capacity and 20 per cent subsidy for 3 KW to 10 KW capacity systems.

The beneficiaries can avail of subsidy either under the state scheme or the similar Central scheme.

The subsidy will also be given to housing societies and residential welfare associations for installing rooftop system for powering common amenities such as water pumps and lights in common areas.

Consumers can select any of the 450 firms empaneled by the government for procuring the solar rooftop systems."
0,2019-10-01,PowerGrid,"The markets have given a thumbs-up to the recent favourable change in the corporate tax rate. But for a large number of market veterans and savvy investors a key concern still remains. Would it revive demand across sectors which can improve sentiment in markets materially? There is no clear answer to this.

Unfavourable developments — both globally and domestically — have made it difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for the slowdown in demand. After the pace of Chinese consumption slowed down, the US-China tariff war and high crude prices emerged as global worries. This together with lack of visible signs of earnings’ growth closer home complicates the whole strategy of investing in safe and profitable asset classes.

To deal with these factors, it is important to follow the conservative strategy of investing in balanced schemes — the idea of seeking out best bets in both equities and debt markets.

Among balanced schemes, SBI Equity Hybrid is the top performer thanks to its conservative approach. The scheme’s fund managers Dinesh Ahuja and R Srinivasan have constructed a large cap-focused portfolio with safe government bonds and AAA-rated instruments. In the past five-year and ten-year periods, it has given 11 per cent and 12 per cent returns while its peers have given returns of 8.4 per cent and 10.5 per cent in the same period, respectively.

1,2019-10-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Around 7 stocks rose to touch their 52-week highs on NSE in Tuesday's session.

Among the stocks that touched their 52-week highs were BPCL, Cinevista, Container Corporation of India, Elgi Equipments, Grand Foundry, Hindustan Foods and Siemens. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty index was trading 37 points down at 11,437.45 while the BSE Sensex was trading 137.04 points down at 38,530.29. 

Overall, 14 shares were trading in the green in Nifty50 index, while 36 were trading in the red.

While IndusInd Bank, Coal India, YES Bank and Grasim Industries were trading in the red."
2,2019-10-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: While domestic stocks have recovered a lot in the rally since the corporate tax cut, one of every 10 NSE-listed stocks lacks momentum and could be in for selloff in the coming days, suggests moving average convergence divergence or MACD.

The momentum indicator has signalled bearish crossovers on 156 counters, hinting at possible downsides.

These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included blue chips such as HDFC, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Power.

Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indiabulls Ventures, Thomas Cook, Cadila Healthcare, Reliance Capital, L&T Finance Holdings and Adani Gas are a few other stocks that look weak on the technical parameter. 











Some of these stocks took heavy beating on Tuesday morning. Indiabulls Housing fell 7.09 per cent to Rs 237, Indiabulls Ventures plunged 10 per cent to Rs 111, Tata Power fell 1.76 per cent to Rs 61.40, Thomas Cook declined 0.5 per cent to Rs 134.40 and Tata Power and Hero MotoCorrp were down 1.5 per cent each.

Among others, HDFC Bank traded 0.7 per cent higher at Rs 1,236, Tata Motors was up 0.43 per cent at Rs 117.90.

The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Meanwhile, data showed 13 stocks are showing bullish trends. They included Power Grid, Gujarat Gas, Hindustan Zinc, JSW Energy, NIIT and Redington, among others. 



Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty50, the 11,400-11,700 range will be keenly followed from here on, said Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking. “A sustained trade above 11,510 level can trigger a move back towards the 11,600-11,700 range, while the 11,370-11,400 zone remains a strong support. Bank Nifty, which was the culprit in Nifty’s Monday losses, is approaching a multiple support zone formed by key averages and retracement levels and a turnaround from this level cannot be ruled out. The directional bias remains positive, as long as Nifty holds the 11,200 mark,” Chavan said.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said there seems to be multiple support points around the 11,400 mark and a positive close on Tuesday could have a bullish connotation.

“The market will show strength if Nifty manages to close above 11,610. Contrary to this, a close below 11,390 shall extend its correction towards the 11,251 level. Positional traders with high risk appetite can consider fresh buying around these levels with a stop loss below 11,382 on a closing basis for an initial target of 11,695,” he said. 


Understanding MACD
 A close look at the stock chart of Indiabulls Housing shows whenever the MACD line has breached below the signal line, the stock has shown a downward momentum and vice versa."

India’s surprise $20 billion tax break to companies bodes well for high dividend-yield stocks that benefit in a low-rate environment, according to ICICI Securities.

Assuming companies pass on the profit gains from the reduction as dividends, the payout of the NSE Nifty 50 Index may immediately jump 37 per cent as a slowing economy prompts businesses to go slow on new investments, the firm said.

“Sectors where growth is slow and stable but cash-flow generation is high should step up the payout to at least three-fourths of their profit because new investments will be risky in a slowing demand environment,” analysts Vinod Karki and Siddharth Gupta wrote in a note Monday.

High-dividend strategies also perform better in times of falling global and local yields, the analysts wrote. Benchmark yields in India have declined 70 basis points this year after the central bank cut its policy rate four times in Asia’s most aggressive easing cycle. A fifth reduction is widely expected when the authority reviews borrowing costs Friday.



“Interest rates globally are headed lower along with improving liquidity and hence, real yields in India could dip further as the Reserve Bank of India expected to cut rates incrementally,” the analysts wrote.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month unexpectedly slashed the corporate tax rate on local companies to 22 per cent from 30 per cent in an effort to boost growth from a five-year low. Analysts expect the decision to improve earnings for India Inc. by up to 10 per cent


Excerpts from the report:



Top picks include ONGC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd., Coal India, Hero Motorcorp, NMDC and Power Grid.
Higher dividend payout to also help improve the government as state-run companies are big contributors.
Share of financials, largely state-run banks, in high dividend yield strategy peaked in 2014 and is the lowest since 2007. Software stocks now have the highest ever representation within the high dividend portfolio."
4,2019-10-01,PowerGrid,"There are a number of PSUs that pay pretty decent yields and that is where the money is going to start moving, says Pashupati Advani, Founder, pashupatiadvani@globalforay. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Everyone is talking about a change in dynamics and how the sentiment has altered. But you are not utterly convinced?What I have seen is that Diwali came early with the finance minister lowering taxes for new companies and for some of the old companies as well. Of course, in India, we are used to having to look at the fine print but the market revalued itself whether Nifty was at 10,700, 10,800, 10,900 and now it is set for 11,300, 11,400, 11,500, 11,600 type range. It moved up basically because people did the calculation as to how much the index should go up.

 The small and midcaps are not really benefiting yet but it is early days yet because I think that people need to change the way they do business and figure out how to make money in this new scenario. I guess we are going through to a point where the long-term objective is to have taxes without allowing any exceptions, more like the US and it will probably take us a few years to get there because right now we have lots of exemptions.


How critical is it that the central bank comes out with rate cuts this week? Do you expect them to cut rates this time around as well?We are in a situation where a lot of things are not going up at all. You really need to cut rates to stimulate the economy. The government provident fund has increased the rate. I do not know what is going on there because it is also a very big pool of money. But hopefully, all countries in the world are bringing rates down. We are also going to bring rates down and we are also trying to raise money overseas as a government in which case that money will cost less here. That is a way of improving liquidity in the system because when you do not give people earnings in banks, then they have to look for alternative assets and then they look for risk assets and hopefully that means the equity markets.


Where does one look for investing right now I mean how willing would you be to go in for some of the riskier assets looking from a more long-term point of view?What has happened is that people who have lived in western countries for many years have been used to 1%, 2% type rates on their bank deposits, sometimes even less and negative in some cases. So they are looking at riskier assets. What is happening as a trend is that people are not expecting markets to go crazy but they are getting into high yield stocks. 

Again in India, most of the yield stocks are PSUs. The government wants money and they want the companies to pay out the dividends. The government also benefits from the dividend distribution tax. So, it is a win-win for them in all pieces. There are a number of PSUs that pay pretty decent yields and that is where the money is going to start moving.


Which are the ones you are looking at?We like the ones in power sector like Power Grid and PTC and REC and there are quite a few of them, paying 4%, 5% yields once a year. If you miss the dividend season this year, they may be pushed to give special dividends in the early part of next year as well. That is certainly a sector one should look at. Also, investment trusts are coming up which are going to be yield driven as well. That is a combo where people can take their money that is sitting in bank deposits and hopefully the banks are still going to be in business when they open the paper in the mornings because that has been the trend for the last few months. I think they will be looking at those stocks.


Online sales have gotten off to a great start for the festive season. But what about overall consumer demand and consumer sentiment picking up on account of the festive season? Definitely, we have to see the breakup of the numbers for rural versus urban and rural demand is still there. We have had a decent monsoon and September has been excess rainfall but it will take us a month or two to see its impact. But the fact that people are spending is again an indication of good things to come and that will start the process of the multiplier effect of money and hopefully will take us off the downward spiral.


Where else are you finding opportunity because a lot of market experts that we were chatting with believe that it is the mid and smallcaps where the opportunity is ripe right now?India has always been a market of value and for value, you have to stock pick. The challenge with the small to midcaps right now is that if you have money to grow, you have to go to a bank to get money because the NBFCs are kind of shut for the day. The amount of work that you have to do to give somebody Rs 20 crore versus Rs 200 crore is the same and so banks are reluctant to give it to the SMEs and they are the people who need the growth capital. 

I think the finance minister has given some benefit to them but we are not seeing that playing out yet. But it will. Indians are opportunistic and at the end of it, all the good companies with good managements are going to attract the money and grow.


Have you bought anything afresh in the last three months?I have bought a couple of yield stocks. 


Can you be more specific?I would rather not be specific as our regulators are not very friendly about these kinds of things.


 What makes you bullish on the pharma space? Are you seeing opportunity across the board or is it very specific select names?
The health insurance industry in this country is getting more customer friendly and some of the states are also going to go for insurance for everyone. That means people will be able to get medicines and we are a country which has got very high diabetes, very high heart disease and those kind of generic drugs are going to improve. 

India has always been a story of the domestic market first and these guys have been looking outwards, but they are all starting to look inwards as well. The other thing is that the larger pharma companies who were getting notices from the US and Europe last year to clean up their manufacturing plants, have gone and done capex. They will benefit and I personally believe that the rupee is going to get a little weaker and that will also help them."
5,2019-10-01,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI:India has drawn up a comprehensive plan to monetise assets across sectors to raise about Rs 90,000 crore in this financial year, a move aimed at helping the government make up for the revenue loss on account of giveaways announced to boost the economy.

The plan envisages monetisation of assets worth Rs 15,000 crore in the aviation sector, Rs 20,000 crore in the power sector, Rs 7,500 crore in shipping, Rs 25,000 crore in national highways and Rs 22,000 crore of railways assets, a government official told ET.

The proposal will soon go to the Cabinet for approval, said the official. A committee led by NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has set strict time frames for all nodal ministries to invite bids for the projects after multiple consultations with them. Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba is steering the entire plan. “The government is aggressively pushing for asset monetisation to bring in operational efficiency,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.

The NITI Aayog will continue to work with ministries to identify other assets as the government progresses on its drive to monetise a large number of assets. The Aayog has developed a dashboard to track real-time progress on the targets given to each ministry, the official said.



The asset monetisation plan comes in the wake of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing a series of measures over the past one month to revive economic growth after GDP growth fell to six-year low of 5% in the first quarter of this fiscal. The massive reduction in corporate tax alone will result in revenue foregone of Rs 1.45 lakh crore.

The government has already pressed the pedal on disinvestments, with a group of secretaries on Monday giving its goahead to strategic sales in BPCL, Container Corporation of India, Shipping Corporation of India, THDC India and Neepco, as it aims to raise Rs 1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in this fiscal.

In the aviation sector, the Aayog has identified six airports – in Trichy, Indore, Bhubaneswar, Varanasi, Amritsar and Raipur – for asset monetisation. It hopes this will fetch the government Rs 15,000 crore while transmission lines of Power Grid Corporation, when sold in two tranches at an interval of six months, will help mop up Rs 10,000 crore each over the next one year.

Likewise, 11 shipping assets have been identified, including berths operated by Port Trusts, that are likely to fetch Rs 7,500 crore. Besides, the Aayog has proposed that 25,000 km of roads be monetised over the next three years, starting with 10 stretches in the first tranche for Rs 5,000 crore. The cumulative earnings from highway monetisation are expected to be Rs 25,000 crore. For railways, the Aayog has proposed that 150 passenger trains be run by private players in three tranches, with 50 trains in each slot. This is expected to fetch Rs 22,000 crore."

8,2019-10-07,PowerGrid,"India's development cooperation with partner countries is based on equality, mutual respect for sovereignty as well as freedom of choice, and not on competition, conditionalities or prescriptions, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on October 7.

Addressing a gathering marking 55 years of India's development partnership programme, Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC), he said the countries of global south are important partners for India.

""Together, we represent the aspirations of 6.3 billion people of the world. Many of us have historical ties dating back to centuries, be it through mercantile trade or culture. Our forefathers have struggled together against colonial bondages. Today, our collective bilateral trade stands around USD 220 billion,"" he said.

India's development cooperation and support to the cause of multilateralism flow from the philosophy of inter-connectedness and interdependence which reflects commitment to 'Vasudeva Kutumbakam (world is one family), Jaishankar said, hailing the ITEC programme.

Over the last 55 years, ITEC has been a vehicle to share India's vast and unique experience of growth and development through capacity building and training of more than 200,000 government officials and professionals from 160 partner countries of the global south in premier institutes of the country, according to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).

At the event, Jaishankar launched the e-Vidya Bharti and e-Arogya Bharti -- tele-education and tele-medicine project for Africa, which is one of the largest projects being executed by the MEA.

This project will enable African students to access premier Indian education through the comforts of their homes and offer Indian medical expertise to African doctors and patients alike, Jaishankar said.

Development cooperation has always played a central role in India's foreign policy and the country has been committed to remain a steadfast and reliable developmental partner by sharing its own vast development experience of over seven decades, he said.

""India's relations with partner countries are based on the principles of equality, mutual respect for sovereignty and freedom of action and choice. It is not based on competition, conditionalities or prescriptions,"" Jaishankar said.

India's belief stems from the spirit of solidarity to enhance mutual learning for shared and sustainable growth, he said.

""These are also the cornerstones in our capacity building initiatives which span from Latin American countries to Pacific Island countries, as we traverse similar paths of development,"" Jaishankar said.

Developing countries are blessed with bounties of nature and enjoy demographic dividend, but they are faced with similar and daunting challenges such as population resource imbalances, rising inequities along with rising aspirations of the youth, climate change, technologies that change all too quickly, almost ruthlessly, that they have to keep pace with, he said.

""In the wake of these challenges, we need to expand our partnership choices in foreign cooperation and resolve to collaborate more closely to press ahead with our SDGs (sustainable development goals),"" he said.

Several announcements for enhancement of ITEC training slots have been made during the recent bilateral visits and also at the various multilateral engagements such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), IAFS-III, Caribbean Community (CARICOM), FIPIC, he said.

These capacity building efforts are also in line with India's regional priorities with 'Neighbourhood countries being First' and Africa being central in the scheme of things, Jaishankar said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also envisions India's collective and inclusive development through his emphatic call for 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas Sabka Vishwas' (Co-operation of all for development of all) and also through flagship schemes such as 'Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikaas Yojna' (Skill India Mission) which highlight the role that skills play in nation building, Jaishankar said.

He said that to make the benefits of these development schemes accessible to the last person in the remotest of region, the PM has pushed for digitisation of the delivery of flagship schemes.

""India seeks to be leader in Climate Change Action. India's initiative of the International Solar Alliance led by the vision of our Hon'ble PM is testimony to the fact that we are committed to a clean and sustainable future for the children of tomorrow,"" he said,.

""We are fast moving towards use of clean technologies and e-vehicles for reduction of fossil fuel dependency and emissions,"" Jaishankar said.

The target of production of 175 GW of renewable energy that India set for itself as part of the Solar Alliance Initiative and its integration in the main power grid, is well on its way to be achieved, he said.

""India believes in a shared future. Sharing of capacities leads to formation of professional and economic inter-linkages which in turn generate the ecosystem for co-creation of mutually beneficial policies and technologies,"" he said.

Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, Minister of State for Defence Shripad Yesso Naik, Secretary Economic Relations in the MEA, T S Tirumurti, diplomats from various missions of countries, senior officials from the Indian government and ITEC institution, were among those present on the occasion."
9,2019-10-10,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Fall in bank stocks led to a decline of almost a per cent in benchmark indices on Thursday, but a host of other factors too played spoilsport on Dalal Street. Worries over economic slowdown became more pronounced with Moody's slashing India's GDP forecast and possibility of a lackluster earnings season did little to lift market mood.

Global markets too remained somber as investors were cautious ahead of the US-China trade talks starting today.

Moody’s Investors Service cut GDP forecast for 2019-20 to 5.8 per cent from earlier estimate of 6.2 per cent. It attributed the cut to an investment-led slowdown that has broadened into consumption, driven by financial stress among rural households and weak job creation.

BSE flagship index Sensex ended at 37,880, down 298 points or 0.78 per cent while its NSE counterpart Nifty slipped below the 11,250 mark to close at 11,235, down 79 points or 0.70 per cent.

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank were among the top drags on Sensex.

Only eight out of 30 index stocks settled higher with Bharti Airtel leading the charge. The scrip rose 5.05 per cent to Rs 377.40 as the telecom operator raised $750 million (about Rs 5,330 crore) from investors based in Asia, Europe and the US through a hybrid financial instrument.

RIL, HUL, HCL Tech, Power Grid and Sun Pharma were among other gainers.

IndusInd Bank, YES Bank, Tata Motors, Vedanata and ICICI Bank were the worst performers, falling up to 6.15 per cent.

Among mainboard stocks, shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance ended 18.85 per cent lower after the Reserve Bank of India rajected merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank late Wednesday evening. The scrip hit 52-week low of Rs 187.50 intraday. Shares of LVB hit too new 52-week low at Rs 25.65.

The BSE Midcap, down 0.87 per cent, fell in line with benchmark Sensex whereas the BSE Smallcap with a decline of 0.57 per cent fared marginally better.

Bank and financials were among the two worst performing indices on BSE on weekly futures and options expiry day. BSE Bankex tanked 2.61 per cent and BSE Financials 2.03 per cent. BSE Realty with a drop of 2.06 per cent was close behind.

Telecom stocks gained the most following Jio's decision to charge 6 paise per minute for voice calls made by its users to networks of rivals companies to recover a charge that could last beyond the previously set December 31 deadline. Market experts said the decision may boost the bottom line of Jio as well as competitors, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, leading to a surge in their stocks.


Expert View""Nifty is expected to trade in a narrow range of 11,300-11,100 in the very short-term. Banks underperformed due to concern over slippage and on-going crisis in the sector. The preview analysis of Q2 results is muted due to no real increase in demand and prices. This may impact the performance during the month,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services."

13,2019-10-11,PowerGrid,"All through September, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company went around shopping FMCG, PSU, financials, insurance, power and pharma stocks as the broader market witnessed big ups and downs following a major corporate tax cut.

BSE benchmark Sensex ended the month 4 per cent higher.

India’s second biggest fund house by asset under management bought over 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and PSU hydropower producer NHPC. Shares of these companies are down over 10 per cent each on a year-to-date (YTD) basis till October 9.

The money manager also bought more than 20 lakh shares each of Axis Bank, Equitas Holdings, Cipla, ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, GAIL (India), NTPC, BHEL, Power Grid and Kalpataru Power Transmission.

Barring ICICI Bank (up 20 per cent YTD), Kalpataru Power Transmission (up 16 per cent YTD) and Axis Bank (up 9 per cent YTD), other stocks are down 41 per cent YTD.

Financial stocks are drawing interest again following the recent debt and credit crisis in the market.

 “We are positive on select private banks and insurance counters, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Lombard,” said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Power stocks, which have taken a huge beating for several months, too are buzzing again.

“Traction in power demand could be a tad softer in the ensuing quarters. We look ahead to the new Electricity Act, which is expected to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament. We maintain our preference for NTPC, CESC and Tata Power,” Edelweiss Securities said.



ICICI Prudential also bought additional shares of IT majors HCL Technologies (18 lakh), Wipro (5.88 lakh) and Tata Consultancy Services (4.64 lakh).

Country’s largest IT services firm TCS on Thursday reported a 1.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 8,042 crore for September quarter, which was below Street expectations.

Haitong Securities has cut the target price for TCS to Rs 1,925 (Rs 2,170 earlier) post Q2 numbers. “We were surprised by the quantum of the miss on both revenue and operating profit margin in Q2,” the brokerage said.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added Bank of Baroda (16 lakh shares), Punjab National Bank (15.43 lakh shares), LIC Housing Finance (11.50 lakh shares), YES Bank (7.80 lakh shares), Kotak Mahindra Bank (5.28 lakh shares) and HDFC Bank (4.01 lakh shares) in the financial space.

On the other hand, it added Bharti Airtel (11 lakh shares) and Vodafone Idea (4.77 lakh shares) from the telecom space. Telecom stocks got a lift on Wednesday after Reliance Jio announced plans to levy a call connect charge on customers, easing the price pressure on its rivals.

Swiss brokerage UBS said Jio’s move is “a positive development for the sector, with a potential revenue and Ebitda upside of 10-12 per cent and 35-40 per cent,” since it will result in a higher outgo from the customer.

“If all operators start charging 6 paise per minute for all outgoing calls, the annual sector revenue and Ebitda can increase by Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively, although these numbers would trend downwards with gradually balancing (voice) traffic patterns,” UBS said.

The positive impact on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), it said, could be 13-15 per cent for Airtel, 55-60 per cent for Vodafone idea, and 32-36 per cent for Jio.

The fund house has also raised bets on the insurers, including SBI Life Insurance, General Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI Lombard General Insurance. These stocks have continued to outperform the broader indices amid the NBFC crisis this year.

Emkay Global Financial Services is overweight on ICICI Prudential (IPRU) and SBI Life Insurance (SBIL). “The volatility in equity markets and higher surrenders are the key downside risks for IPRU. For SBIL, the reduction in promoter stake to meet the minimum public shareholding (MPS) guidelines (needs 2.1 per cent stake sale by September 2020) is a key concern,” it added.

In the auto and auto ancillary sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 9.77 lakh shares of Ashok Leyland, followed by Motherson Sumi (6.19 lakh shares), Minda Industries ( 5.49 lakh shares) and Maruti Suzuki (1.34 lakh shares).

The fund house also checked into Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, Polycab India, Rail Vikas Nigam and Wheels India. On the other hand, it completely exited Asahi India, Hatsun Agro, Jet Airways, Monsanto, Shalby, Tata Communications and Techno Electric.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 431 companies, and sold in 89 across sectors. It held 550 stocks as of September 30.

Tata Power, SAIL, Larsen & Toubro, SJVN, Hexaware Tech, ONGC, Spice Jet, JSW Energy, Container Corporation, Infosys, Asian Paints, CESC, Avenue Supermarts, MCX, Coal India, Engineers India and Gujarat State Petronet were among the top stocks the fund house offloaded during the month."

“Banks and other stakeholders have been seeking clarity on the provision of credit facilities to InvITs. The matter has been examined and it has been decided that banks may be permitted to lend to InvITs subject to…conditions,” the Reserve Bank of India notified all banks on Monday.

The central bank in the notification has told banks to lend to these funds ‘without prejudice to generality’, and have tighter credit policies and monitoring mechanisms, especially to those which have exposures to Special Purpose Vehicles or SPVs.

An Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvITs) is Collective Investment Scheme similar to a mutual fund, which enables direct investment of money from individual and institutional investors in infrastructure projects to earn a small portion of the income as a return.

“Banks shall put in place a Board approved policy on exposures to InvITs which shall inter alia cover the appraisal mechanism, sanctioning conditions, internal limits, monitoring mechanisms… Banks shall lend to only those InvITs where none of the underlying SPVs, which have existing bank loans, is facing ‘financial difficulty’,” said the central bank.

The fund house bought over two crore shares of Axis Bank in September amid buzz that the government may offload a part of its stake in the lender held via Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). The stock climbed over 3 per cent in the month.

Analysts have been largely bullish on the private lenders, including Axis Bank lately. “If I want to play safely, I will buy HDFC Bank.

NEW DELHI: Climbing for the sixth-straight day, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended Friday's trading session with gains, supported by index heavyweights RIL and HDFC Bank.

Firm equity inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and better-than-expected results from a few companies boosted sentiment, according to experts. Data on China's GDP growth being the slowest in nearly three decades fell on deaf ears, as domestic investors remained unfettered.

FM Nirmala Sitharaman indicating further stimulus in FY20 also kept market participants optimistic.
BSE Sensex closed 246.32 points up, or 0.63 per cent at 39,298.38, while NSE Nifty ended at 11,661.75, up 75.4 points or 0.65 per cent.UK secured a Brexit deal with EU on Thursday, three years after the vote to leave the bloc, but UK PM Boris Johnson must still win favour in the parliament to get the agreement approved.September-quarter earnings have proved to be a mixed bag with a few largecaps beating analyst estimates, while others reported underwhelming results.

BSE Power index recorded 2.68 per cent gains on the sectoral return chart followed by capital goods, metals and industrials index.


Global markets:On the global front, both Asian and European stocks stumbled after data showed China's GDP growth slowing to an almost three-decade low, which dragged down the positive sentiment stemming from UK and EU striking a Brexit deal.

23,2019-10-18,PowerGrid,"Demand for electric power transmission and distribution equipment in India is forecast to rise 8.2% per year to $15.8 billion in 2023, the Freedonia Group, a division of MarketResearch.com, has predicted in a recent report on the transmission and distribution sector.

Upgrades and expansion of the nation's underdeveloped electricity sector – both to reduce the large amount of power currently lost during transmission and to improve access to electricity in rural areas will provide strong opportunities for growth in the country, as consumers switch away from alternative sources of power such as generators.

""India has set goals toward diversifying its energy sources to include renewable options – including solar, wind, and hydropower – which will necessitate the installation of additional transmission capacity,"" the report mentioned. In contrast, the overall global demand for electric power transmission and distribution equipment totalled $141 billion in 2018 and is projected to climb 4.0% annually to $172 billion in 2023.

Factors supporting increases include strong growth in China - by far the largest national market - which will account for 33% of new demand rapid industrialization in India, the third-largest market for these products in the world growing populations, particularly in developing countries where electrical infrastructure is still being established continued integration of electricity generated by renewable energy sources into existing power grids.

27,2019-10-25,PowerGrid,"In what appears to be a major attempt of sabotage, unidentified persons suspected to be militants, cut out a portion of two limbs of 400 KV electricity transmission tower in Chitragam village of Shopian in southern Kashmir.

If the tower was damaged and sabotage was successful, most of the areas in Kashmir Valley could have been pushed suddenly into darkness for many hours and amplified load shedding for many days to come.

The armed forces noticed the damage in tower number of 348 of Kishenpur-Wagoora transmission line when they were on a search operation in Chittragam villagein wake of the killing of two non-local truck drivers-Ilyas Khan and Zahid Khan from Rajasthan - who were shot dead around 7:30pm on Thursday. The two spots are just few hundred meters away in Chitragam village.

J&K police has registered a case for destruction of public property and are investigating whether the same militant group is involved in the killings of non-locals and damaging the electricity tower. ""They have used gas cutters to damage the two limbs of the electricity tower,"" said an army official at the spot.

This transmission line, which comes under Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, is one of the major electricity transmission lines that connects Kashmir Valley to northern power grid. ""This is a major incident of its kind and most probably militants could be behind this. But we are investigating the details,"" a senior CRPF official told ET.

Soon after the damage was discovered a group of armed forces was deployed immediately at the spot to safeguard the electricity tower for the whole night. The power department engineers arrived around 12:30pm on Friday to repair the damages.""This line has the potential to transmit 700MW to 800MW electricity which is a major chunk of 1300MW electricity consumption of Valley,"" said another senior government official.

J&K police officials claim that militants are desperate to show their presence and instigate a reaction among the masses as there were no protests after the abrogation of special status of the state.

""We are not sure who did this. But this is clearly an act of frustration which would have created trouble for locals. There are people who want to create trouble and incite a reaction from masses,"" a senior police official told ET."
31,2019-10-29,PowerGrid,"RIYADH: India will invest a massive USD 100 billion in oil and gas infrastructure to meet energy needs of an economy that is being targeted to nearly double in five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday as he sought investment from oil kingpin Saudi Arabia and other nations to boost supplies.

Speaking at Saudi Arabia's annual investment forum, also known as 'Davos in the desert', Modi promised stable, predictable and transparent policy regime to catalyse foreign investments.

""India is investing heavily in oil ad gas infrastructure,"" he said adding as much as USD 100 billion will be spent by 2024 in creating additional oil refining capacity, laying new pipelines and building gas import terminals.

The world's third-largest energy consumer is 83 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and about half of its gas needs are shipped from abroad. Its per capita energy consumption is a fraction of the global average and it is now investing heavily in physical infrastructure as well as city distribution to boost availability in a growing economy.

Saudi Arabia is India's second-largest supplier of crude oil and New Delhi is keen to expand this partnership beyond the buyer-seller relationship into a strategic one with cross investments.

Modi highlighted the recent opening of the fuel retailing sector for non-oil companies to lure investment in the world's fastest-growing consumption centre.

""India needs investments in the energy sector to meet the demand of a fast-expanding economy. And I request energy companies present here to take advantage of this opportunity,"" he said.

Modi said Saudi national oil company Aramco has decided to invest in the 60 million tonnes a year West Coast refinery project in Maharashtra - which will be Asia's biggest refinery.

Aramco, whose planned initial public offering is touted to be as big as the size of the Indian economy, too is keen to venture into fuel retailing and the petrochemical sector so as to lock-in consumer for its oil in a world that is fast-moving towards renewable energy sources and electric vehicles.

""I want to ensure you that India's rate of growth is going to rise further. We are taking steps for the growth of our economy,"" he said. ""We are improving on our ease of doing business ranking. Due to political stability, predictable policy, and big diverse market, your investment in India will be most profitable.""

Stating that infrastructure is a technology multiplier, he said it not only provides investment opportunity but it also important for the growth of the business.

""The requirement of physical infrastructure is in developing countries. Asia requires USD 700 billion per year for infrastructure development. We have set an investment target of spending USD 1.5 trillion on infrastructure development in the next few years,"" he said.

This target includes oil and gas plus other infrastructure such as roads, airports, and ports.

The prime minister said India is targeting to nearly double the size of its economy to USD 5 trillion in the next five years. ""Roadmap for reaching the USD 5 trillion economy target is ready. The target is not only about quantitative growth but also about improving the quality of life of every Indian.""

He said five big trends impacting global businesses are technology and innovation, infrastructure, human resources, compassion for the environment and business-friendly governance.

Transformative technologies such as Artifical Intelligence, Genetics, and nano-technology have become part of daily life, he said adding India has become the world's third-largest startup ecosystem.

""Indian start-ups are acing everything, from food delivery to transport, to hospitality, to medical treatment, to tourism,"" he said urging venture funds to invest in start-ups in the country.

Stating that infrastructure is an opportunity multiplier, he said infrastructure is needed for the business to grow.

India, he said, is adopted an integrated approach for infrastructure development. ""India is integrating infrastructure through one nation one power grid, one nation one gas grid and one water grid, one nation one mobility card, one nation one optical fibre network.""

Infrastructure growth in India will be in double-digit and there is no possibility of capacity saturation.

For international investment depends on quality manpower and so skilling of human resources is essential, he said, adding 400 million people will be skilled in different streams in 3-4 years.

""International trade agreements should not be restricted to goods alone. Manpower and talent mobility should be an integral part of it,"" he said."

The project intends to provide 44,000 micro solar domes in households of marginalised (SC and ST) communities in rural areas in West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Assam, Odisha, Tripura, Manipur, Rajasthan, and Bihar, the institute said.

Around 20,000 micro solar domes are to be installed in the first phase from November 2019 to February 2020, according to the statement.

Prof. Priyadarshi Patnaik, joint PI (Project Investigator) from IIT Kharagpur, said, ""Micro solar domes will be given to households based on their need.""

With funding from the Department of Science and Technology of the central government, the institute has initiated the unique project to push for ""solar energy adaptation among marginalised rural communities"".

The project will help to light up homes of those who are either not connected to the conventional power grid or face irregular power supply for some reasons, the statement said.

A 'micro solar dome' operates as a clean energy source during day and night hours, an official said, adding that it is ideal for slums and rural houses.

In the first phase of the project, solar domes will be installed while the second will involve R&D.

Some micro solar domes have already been installed as preparatory work by NBIRT at villages in Tripura and rural- belt, affected by the cyclone 'Fani', at Chandaka in Odisha."

Fitch raises India's FY20 deficit forecast to 3.6% Fitch Solutions on Wednesday raised India's fiscal deficit forecast to 3.6% of the GDP for this fiscal year, from 3.4% previously, due to weak revenue collections resulting from sluggish economic growth and government's sweeping corporate tax rate cut. Fitch said it was revising the fiscal deficit forecast as revenue collection is likely to fall far short of the projections in the FY2019/20 Union Budget due to weak GST and corporate tax collections.


IMF seeks transparency on India's fiscal mathNew Delhi needs to become more ""transparent"" on the fiscal numbers as it is a ""laggard"" among the G20 peers on this front, a senior official from the International Monetary Fund said here on Wednesday.

13,2019-11-08,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors has begun the second phase of fundraising for its infrastructure fund Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus Fund, and is likely to close the fund at $750 million by early next year.

Edelweiss Infra has launched the road show and is in discussions with global pension funds, insurance companies and endowment funds to raise about $375 million (Rs. 2,600 crore) to invest in raods and energy assets in India.

Edelweiss had marked the first close of the fund in May, raising $375 million and is likely to deploy the fund before December 2019.

The assets are acquired through two new platforms — Sekura Energy and Sekura Roads backed by Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus fund (EIYP).

Sekura Energy had acquired two operating power transmission assets from Essel Infraprojects — namely Darbhanga-Motihari Transmission and NRSS XXXI (B) Transmission last month. The stake in the two other under construction assets would be acquired post commissioning. The total enterprise value of the energy assets would be about $750 million.

In June, Sekura Roads had acquired two annuity road assets from Hyderabad-based Navayuga Group for an enterprise value of $150 million.

“Buying and aggregating goodquality operating assets is a viable long-term opportunity to not only generate reasonable risk-adjusted returns for our clients but also to contribute to the infrastructure development of India,” said Subahoo Chordia, Head of Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield+ Fund.

“There are many global funds which does not have presence in India. Such global funds and domestic investors look for a professionally managed independent platform through which they can participate as a long term opportunity,” he added.

Edelweiss Infra also plans separate Infrastructure trusts or InvITs, for roads and energy platforms in next couple of years.

Emergence of infrastructure assets in India as an investment class for cash flow yield is turning to be a popular trend.

Both global and domestic investors are looking to invest in good-quality operating infrastructure assets for long-term cash flow based returns. One of the challenges for them is to find an independent and a professionally managed platform which brings alignment.

“Emergence of independent Infrastructure funds or InvITs will be critical to channelize this large pool of capital to buyout operating infrastructure yielding assets and support India in meeting its infrastructure development needs,” said Subahoo.

India requires an investment of around Rs. 50 lakh crore for infrastructure development over the next 5 years, according to estimates.

InvITs of long-term revenue generating assets like toll roads and power-transmission projects are becoming popular among longterm investors or pension funds.

""InvITs should gain popularity with retail investors considering they have a capability of delivering more than 10% (post tax) annualized liquid return to investors, especially when the equity market is likely to continue with it’s 8-10% annualized return (pre-tax), as has delivered in the last 5 years,"" said Vishal Seth, Managing Director, Financial Reporting and Transaction Advisory, Protiviti India.

Currently, there are two listed InvITs — IRB InvIT Fund (by IRB Infrastructure Developers), IndiGrid InvIT Fund (Sterlite Power Grid Ventures) and two private InvITS — IndInfravit, sponsored by L & T Infrastructure Development Projects and Brookfield-led India Infrastructure investment trust.

Infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) issuances to grow five-fold to over Rs. 2 lakh crore in the next two years, said a July 2019 CRISIL report."
11,2019-11-08,PowerGrid,"ET Intelligence Group: Free cash flow (FCF) of 98 manufacturing companies in the BSE 200 index turned negative in FY19 for the first time since FY13, showed data from Bloomberg. FCF, which is the cash left after paying for operating expenses and capital expenditure (capex), reflects the ability to invest in future growth. It was negative Rs 13258 crore (cash outflow) in FY19 compared with over Rs 73632 crore in FY18 and much lower than the peak of Rs 1 lakh crore in FY16. About a third of the sample companies reported negative cash flow.

A negative capex during the times of buoyant demand is desirable since it is an indication that the companies are building adequate capacities to cater to future demand. However, when the demand scenario is bleak, capacity utilisation is low. It means return on invested capital will be lower than anticipated thereby straining the balance sheet.

“Falling FCF is a worrying sign for the health of the companies amid sluggish demand as it shows pressure on revenue and operating margins,” said the chief investment officer of a leading domestic mutual fund.

Capex by large companies in the energy sector including Reliance Industries (RIL), Indian oil (IOC), NTPC and Power Grid Corporation was the major reason for drop in FCF. The FCF of the energy companies was negative Rs 26573 crore in FY19 compared with average positive free cash of Rs 41879 crore in the previous five fiscals. If one excludes the negative free cash flow of RIL, the sample’s FCF improved to Rs 56409 crore from the negative reading. Still, it was the lowest since FY14.

The sample companies undertook Rs 4 lakh crore worth of capital expenditure in FY19, the highest in the last six years. The cumulative capex in the past five fiscals was Rs 24.5 lakh crore. In addition to the bulging capital expenditure, the sagging demand across sectors lowered return generated from the existing asset base.



The sample’s asset turnover ratio — a gauge of how frequently assets have been used — fell to 1.5 in FY19 from 1.8 five years ago. The average receivable days increased by three days to 49 during the period.

“PMI data suggest that companies extended credit terms to their debtors to support revenue growth. Also, debtors are taking more time to pay,” said Prithviraj Srinivas, economist, Axis Capital.

Two major consumer companies Hindustan Unilever and United Spirits have indicated after their second quarter earnings that there is pressure on liquidity in the system, which is affecting revenue growth.

On the positive side, given that RIL, the biggest contributor to capex, is nearing the end of the capex cycle, the situation is expected to improve from hereon. RIL incurred a capex of Rs 41722 crore in the first half of FY20 compared with Rs 72506 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. According to Bloomberg estimates, the sample is expected to clock Rs 1.6 lakh crore free cash flow in FY20."

15,2019-11-08,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: After downgrading India’s sovereign outlook, Moody’s Investors Service on Friday downgraded its view to 'negative' from 'stable' on many top Indian companies, including SBI, HDFC Bank, TCS, Infosys, BPCL, NTPC, NHAI and GAIL. 

Moody’s has downgraded outlook on companies belonging to information technology, infrastructure as well as oil and gas sectors. In total, the rating agency on Friday cut outlook on 21 Indian firms.

Other financial institutions that have seen a downgrade are Exim Bank, Hero FinCorp, Hudco and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC).

However, the agency kept rating and outlook unchanged on Bank of India, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank and Union Bank of India.

Ratings of the above-mentioned financial institutions are unlikely to be upgraded in the next 12-18 months, Moody’s said.

The agency also downgraded the outlook on eight non-financial corporates to negative from stable. They are BPCL, HPCL, Indian Oil, ONGC, Oil India, Petronet LNG, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. 

It also downgraded outlook on a number of sovereign-linked infrastructure companies. They include NTPC, NHPC, NHAI, GAIL, Power Grid, Adani Green and Adani Transmission.

In case of Exim Bank, Hudco, IRFC and SBI, Moody’s Investors Service said close links between these four companies and the government is the key reason for their downgrade. Moody’s believes that these companies will receive government support in times of need.

For HDFC Bank, it reasoned that due to the “strong linkages between a bank's business and the sovereign credit profile, including by way of large direct exposure to government debt and exposure to common underlying operating conditions, the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of a bank is capped at the sovereign rating of the country that it operates in”.

“Moody's does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's rating action. Moody's does not apply any corporate behavior adjustment to the banks and views their risk management framework as consistent and commensurate with their risk appetite,” the New York-based rating agency said in a release.

""Ratings for Infosys and TCS are constrained to no more than two notches above the sovereign rating. Therefore a sovereign rating downgrade will also result in downgrade of the A3 ratings of Infosys and TCS,"" says Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice President -- Senior Credit Officer.

Moody’s earlier downgraded India’s outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’. The rating agency said its outlook partly reflects lower effectiveness of the government and policy in addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses than it had previously estimated. This is leading to a gradual rise in debt burden from already high levels.

Meanwhile, Moody's has also upgraded the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of GAIL to ‘baa2’ from ‘baa3’, based on its expectation that the company will maintain strong financial metrics over the next 2-3 years; a situation which is more consistent with a baa2 standalone profile."
16,2019-11-09,PowerGrid,"Kolkata: Moody's Investors Service on Friday downgraded its rating outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ for a number of leading Indian financiers and utilities, such as State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and NTPC, after having lowered the sovereign rating.

The global rating firm cited the close links of these companies with the government as the reason behind the rating outlook. The revision in outlook was for six financial institutions and some other firms operating in the infrastructure and power sectors.

In the financial institutional space, rating outlook on Exim India, Hero FinCorp, Hudco and IRFC were revised to negative while it kept the outlook unchanged for Bank of India, Canara Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate and Union Bank of India.

“Lowering the outlook of companies has nothing to do with their business prospects. Investors need not worry,” said VK Vijaykumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

Moody's said that it “does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's (Friday’s) rating action.”


It does not apply any corporate behaviour adjustment to the banks and views their risk management framework as consistent and commensurate with their risk appetite.

“The close link between the four companies (Exim India, Hudco, IRFC, SBI) and the government of India is the key reason Moody’s has changed the outlook for these companies to negative from stable,” the rating firm said.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank has strong linkages between its business prospects and the sovereign rating profile. For Hero Fincorp, Moody’s expects India’s economic slowdown may negatively impact the financial strength of its parent Hero Moto-Corp, and thereby its ability to support its group company.

“Given the negative outlook on the sovereign and bank ratings, SBI, HDFC Bank and Exim India's ratings are unlikely to be upgraded over the next 12-18 months,” Moody’s said. But it could upgrade the baseline credit assessment (BCA) of SBI and Exim India, if these banks demonstrate improvement in their asset quality, supported by recovery in profitability and capital levels, as well as maintaining stable funding and liquidity.

“An upgrade of HDFC Bank's BCA is unlikely, because the BCA is already at the same level as the sovereign rating,” it said.

Meanwhile, Moody's said it expects BoI, Canara, OBC, Syndicate and Union Bank would continue to enjoy a very high level of support from the government.

“Under these support assumptions, even if the sovereign rating is downgraded by one notch to Baa3, the support uplift should be sufficient to keep the final ratings unchanged at Baa3,” said Moody's. This situation is the key driver of Moody's affirmation of the five banks’ ratings.

But the ratings of these financial institutions are unlikely to be upgraded over the next 12-18 months while their BCAs can be revised on better asset quality and funding profile.

In parallel, the rating firm has downgraded the outlook on a number of sovereign-linked infrastructure companies, such as NTPC, NHPC, NHAI, GAIL and Power Grid. Outlook on private sector companies Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission was also revised to negative."

Company Financials

For the quarter ended 30-09-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 9051.29 crore, down -1.40% from last quarter sales of Rs 9179.63 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 2523.64 crore in the latest quarter. 

Investment Rationale

Power Grid's Q2 profit was along expected lines, said Edelweiss. Importantly, capitalisation of assets picked up pace and jumped 2 times sequentially, it said. The management is confident of commissioning the Raipur-–Pugalur line which is critical to meet its FY20 capitalisation guidance, said Edelweiss. Apart from new project wins, any development on asset monetisation through the investment trust (InvIT) platform is a key monitorable. Power Grid offers 13% earnings growth visibility over FY19–21, said Edelweiss. This, along with its inexpensive valuation and 4% dividend yield, is comforting, said Edelweiss."

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 13.50 points lower this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Ambit Capital has maintained buy rating on Magma Fincorp and lowered target price to Rs 59 from Rs 68. Poor track record of execution, deteriorating asset quality and lack of pricing power expose Magma to vagaries of market liquidity crunch, said Ambit. Shrinking margin profile with poor levers around growth would continue to keep RoA/ RoE muted. But Magma’s seasoned retail book doesn’t warrant deep discount valuation to 3-year rolling crosscycle average. Shares of Magma Fincorp ended down 5.4 per cent at Rs 46.6 on Friday.

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on Eicher Motors and revised target price to Rs 17,000 from Rs 15,000. Eicher Motors reported 24 per cent YoY decline in consolidated Ebitda in Q2 of FY20 led by weak volume growth and margin pressures in VECV and Royal Enfield businesses. Kotak Institutional expects volume pressure to persist in FY21 due to (1) shift towards BS-VI engines and (2) increase in competitive intensity. Shares of Eicher Motors ended up 1.3 per cent at Rs 21700.85 on Friday.


• Emkay Global has maintained buy rating on Amara Raja Batteries and revised target price to Rs 781 from Rs 760. Despite the steep fall in OEM revenues and lower realizations, Amara Raja’s second quarter revenues declined only marginally by 3 per cent YoY, said Emkay. The brokerage expects revenue/earnings CAGRs at 8 per cent/16 per cent for FY19-22. Average ROE/ROCE will likely to be strong at 17 per cent/22 per cent over FY20-22, it said. In addition, free cash flow generation should remain healthy at an average of Rs 4.2 billion/year over this period. Shares of Amara Raja Batteries ended down 1.2 per cent at Rs 654 on Friday.

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Dr Lal Pathlabs and increased target price to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,330. The company's Q2 results were ahead of estimates, with another quarter of strong volume growth. Overall, volume remains the point of focus, helping the company expand into the rest of India and reducing dependence on its home market of Delhi/National Capital Region (NCR), it said. The brokerage has raised FY20-22 EPS estimates by 8-12 per cent to reflect recent tax cuts. Shares of Dr Lal Path-Labs ended down 2.9 per cent at Rs 1451.80 on Friday."

37,2019-11-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is seeking legal opinion on the wider impact of the Supreme Court’s order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), including whether it is applicable on a larger group of non-telecom companies holding telecom licences, and if so, the process to be adopted to raise demands from them for its dues.

“We are taking a legal opinion on the order’s wider ambit… we will actively work on the matter as legally advised after the telcos’ issue is addressed,” an official said.

Lawyers say that several companies — including GAIL, Power Grid Corporation, Delhi Metro, RailTel, among others — that are non-telcos but hold telecom licences to provide a range of offering such as internet services, national and international long-distance services and VSAT services, could fall under the DoT’s wider licence fee ambit. This, after the Supreme Court, in its order, equated gross revenue — for arriving at AGR — with “total revenue of licensee company”. Further, the court held that revenue arising out of non-telecom activities, with certain exceptions, will have to be included in gross revenue.

The official added that clarity is needed since there is ambiguity on the wider impact of the judgment. “Some companies likely to have been impacted by the judgment might not even know that DoT may raise demands and issue notices,” he said.

A second official said the government is dealing with a peculiar situation where even public sector units with telecom licences could be staring at huge liabilities. “This could be a case of revenue going from one pocket of the government to another,” he said and added that individual companies were assessing the situation and would work with their administrative ministries to resolve this matter. One particular option would be to take cabinet exemptions for such cases.

The DoT last week issued notices to mobile companies and internet service providers (ISPs) to compute and pay the amount that they now owe the government on account of the Supreme Court verdict.



The apex court has mandated that the dues be paid up within three months of the October 24 order. Telcos are staring at licence fee, penalty and interest dues of nearly Rs 93,000 crore, as per DoT’s submissions to the apex court, but are seeking relief. Including spectrum usage charges, the dues go up to over Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

Industry estimates similar dues on non-telecom companies may amount to nearly ?2.28 lakh crore, if calculated since the time of getting their respective licences. These companies till now have been paying miniscule amounts as licence fee, if at all, to the DoT.

Government officials expect the non-telecom companies too to seek a clarification on the SC order’s ambit. The DoT has already ordered its nodal bodies to issue notices to ISPs, along with telcos and virtual network operators.

A senior official of association representing ISPs in India, warned that if the ambit of the judgment were to be widened, the impact could run into a much higher figure. “If it includes everyone, then there’s no end to who may be asked to pay and how much. Many of the licence holders under ISP category were not legally obliged to pay any licence fee before 2014, but now they may have to,” he added."
38,2019-11-19,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government is well within its rights to waive penalty and interest on dues that telecom companies owe following the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), senior advocate Harish Salve said in a legal opinion to Bharti Airtel.

If the government is of the view that burdening the telcos with immediate recovery of arrears will result in impairing their operations and that a larger public interest will be served by revisiting the imposition of penalty and high interest rates, “there is nothing in the judgment of the Supreme Court that would prevent the government from acting appropriately”, Salve said in his legal opinion which has been annexed in an Airtel letter to communications and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, also marked to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

He said the government could also allow more time for payment of the principal amount of the shortfall.

Salve’s legal opinion on the SC order that backed the government stand on including non-core items of revenue while computing AGR, were cited by Bharti Airtel in the November 18 letter, a copy of which was also marked to principal secretary to the PM, PK Mishra, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba. Gauba is heading a panel of top officials set up to suggest ways to restore the sector’s health.

Salve added that Bharti Airtel would be “well advised” to approach the government to make out a case to revisit the imposition of penalty in the larger grounds of public interest.

Referring to the inclusion of components such as trade discounts, discounts on prepaid tariffs and forex fluctuations in the computation of AGR, Salve in his legal opinion said that in the past, the telecom tribunal headed by a retired judge had held that the demands of the government were “illegal”. He added that the tribunal examined 13 heads of income and held that most of them could not be included in AGR.

The legal opinion of retired Supreme Court judge, Justice AK Sikri, were also annexed in Airtel’s letter to the government.



Sikri backed Salve’s legal opinion and was cited in the letter as saying, “This would demonstrate that the dispute raised by the TSPs (telecom service providers) was not frivolous. It cannot be said that the view of the Supreme Court in this case is the only possible view or that the view of the tribunal is totally absurd. In my view, no case for penalty was made out.”

Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the telcos worst affected by the order, are expected to file review petitions this week. They have appealed to the government for relief.

Airtel faces licence fee, spectrum usage charge, interest and penalty dues of over Rs 41,000 crore and has sought a waiver of penalty and interest, which together contribute to almost 75% of its estimated liabilities.

Airtel also wants interest to be levied only from the date of the AGR judgment and a 16-year payment period for the dues after a moratorium of two years. It said if interest must be levied, it must be at rates of government securities plus a small spread, say 1%, to compensate the government for notional loss of interest. It has even proposed keeping SUC outside the ambit of the demands because it was not part of the SC order.

It said companies such as Power Grid Corporation of India, GAIL and RailTel, which possess telecom licences to offer internet and national long-distance services, should be treated at par with telcos. According to Airtel’s estimates, these non-telecom companies would be liable to pay the government close to Rs2.27 lakh crore in dues after the SC’s order.

The company said failure to provide relief would allow for a “possible bankruptcy” of licensee companies and the loss of millions of direct and indirect jobs. It also predicted there would be bad loans for Indian banks running into a few lakh crore rupees and a ripple effect on vendors, retailers, kirana shops and related services like advertising and transportation, which could again lead to the collapse of more companies."

40,2019-11-19,PowerGrid,"More than three dozen firms in the portfolio of the country’s biggest institutional investor, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), reported more than 50 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

These companies are from across sectors such as paints, financials, cement, defence, pharma, paints, metal, insurance and PSUs.

Analysts have turned bullish on some of them post Q2 numbers. 

Stocks up the pecking order in LIC portfolio are the country’s biggest mortgage lender HDFC, biggest lender by assets managed SBI and major power players NTPC and Power Grid. These companies posted between 50 per cent and 400 per cent rise in profit during the quarter.

HDFC Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on SBI with a price target of Rs 389. “Positive surprises on asset quality can trigger a re-rating,” the brokerage said in a report. On a year-to-date basis, SBI shares advanced 7.57 per cent to Rs 322 till November 15.

On the other hand, power majors NTPC and Power Grid each dented LIC’s portfolio by over 5 per cent so far this year. 

Edelweiss Securities said the recent corporate tax cut would not majorly impact the power sector, as it will be a pass-through for companies following the regulated business model. 

“Taking a cue from the weakness in power demand, we are pruning our FY20 and FY21 demand forecast to 3 per cent and 5 per cent from 5 per cent and 6 per cent earlier,” it said. In an October report, the brokerage maintained its preference for NTPC.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Adani Ports, Adani Transmission, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Indraprastha Gas, GSK Pharma and The Federal Bank are among other top stocks in the portfolio.

Only those LIC stocks which reported over 50 per cent increase in Q2 profit along with a rise in net sales were considered for this report. The screener threw up 37 companies from largecap, midcap and smallcap segments as of November 18. LIC held 370 stocks in its portfolio as of September 30 and out of them only 287 have announced September quarter number till date.

Garden Reach Shipbuilders, which delivered nearly 145 per cent return to LIC year to date, reported more than 300 per cent rise in profit on over 100 per cent increase in net sales in Q2.

The warship builder posted a net profit to Rs 59.02 crore for the second quarter of this financial year, on the back of higher revenue. It had posted Rs 12.78 crore profit for the corresponding period of 2018-19. The company had as many as 22 projects are at various stages of construction, with an order book of Rs 27,400 crore.

Bengal & Assam Company, Bharat Dynamics, Adani Transmission, Caprihans India, Chambal Fertilisers, Hudco, Gateway Distriparts, Indian Bank, ABB India, Hindustan Aeronautics and Granules India were among the companies that posted more than 100 per cent YoY rise in net profit for the quarter.

Among other midcaps and smallcaps, Aditya Birla Capital, Pfizer, The New India Assurance, Dalmia Bharat Sugar, Torrent Power and Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Granules India posted between 50-110 per cent YoY rise in net profit on up to 50 per cent increase in net sales.

In the financial space, Aashish Agarwal, Executive Director, Head of Research, CLSA has a preference for banking and non-lending financiers over NBFCs.

“A few trends would continue to play out in the banking sector; a) banks will gain market share at the cost of NBFCs, b) savings will continue to go towards insurance and asset management companies. So, these companies are in a sweet spot of high growth and decent profitability,” he said."

Expert Take
“Market turned positive due to buoyancy from telecom stocks supported by tariff hike plans. Positive vibes also witnessed in PSU banks having exposure to distressed assets. Gains in Pharma, energy and infra stocks pushed markets higher while losses in Auto, metals and consumer stocks limited the gain. Fear of downgrade in FY20 earnings due to slow pace in consumption demand and industrial growth may consolidate the market in the near term,” -- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

43,2019-11-21,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Central public sector undertakings (PSUs) will acquire more than two lakh hectares to set up 47,000 mw of green power units under a new plug-and-play model, aimed at accelerating solar capacity expansion by derisking projects from land acquisition and availability of transmission corridors as well as reduce tariffs by up to 20 paise per unit.

Under the new model, PSUs under the power and renewable energy ministries will acquire the land through fully-owned SPVs (special purpose vehicles). The land may be purchased outright or leased from state governments and private land owners. State governments too can take full ownership of SPVs in suitable cases.

Central utilities such as PowerGrid will set up the transmission infrastructure for these locations. This will result in a hassle-free staging arena — called ‘ultra-mega renewable energy power parks’ hosting aggregate capacity of 4,000 mw each — for promoters without having to worry about stumbling over land acquisition or transmission issues. The projects within a park will be given out on the basis of tariff-based bidding.




“Land acquisition and power evacuation are the two main risks for renewable energy projects. Where you have land, transmission may become an issue and vice-versa. The new model de-risks the projects and reduces financing cost for promoters. Naturally, the tariffs will come down,” power and renewable energy minister R K Singh said in response to a TOI query.

Renewable energy secretary Anand Kumar said making the state government a stakeholder will cushion projects from transience in land laws. “This is a transparent system, removes inefficiencies in the land acquisition eco-system and promises a stable administrative and fiscal outlook for projects,” he said, adding the PSUs can earn by taking part of tariff revenue as rent or can opt to sell out at a later stage.

Singh said the PSUs were in the process of forming SPVs, with promising outcomes in Gujarat and Rajasthan. “I spoke to the Rajasthan chief minister and he has agreed to offer more attractive terms for land. The state cabinet is expected to clear the proposal shortly. Gujarat too has offered land in Dholera,” he said. Kumar said SECI (formerly Solar Energy Corporation of India) will bid out the 4,000 mw Dholera project by December 31.

The model envisages individual projects of 2,000 mw within a park. But projects in multiples of 600 mw will also be allowed in multiple locations in cases where new transmission lines have to be laid. In cases where transmission links already exist, projects will be allowed in multiples of 250 mw. Floating solar projects too are covered under the model, wherein the minimum size could be be 50 mw."

Analyst said that fall in IT stocks amid reports of changes in US work visa requirements aimed at protecting American workers fuelled the overall weakness in the market. Also, concerns over delay in US –China trade deal and Fed minutes fueled negativity in global markets.

Analysts said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on developments around the US-China trade deal and India’s July-September GDP data due next week. The GDP data which is due on 29 November is likely to indicate whether the slowdown in the Indian economy has deepened.

53,2019-11-25,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) will “fight” any attempts by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to seek additional licence fees on the basis of a recent Supreme Court ruling, beyond the amounts that the state-owned enterprise has already paid, a senior official said.

The official at the power transmission provider said the Supreme Court order did not apply to non-telecom companies like PGCIL and therefore it would stand by its earlier assessment of licence fee.

“It should have been specified in the contract,” the official said, on the licence fee that the company has to pay to the government based on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR).

The official said PGCIL would not make any further payment to the DoT, and added that it had already paid Rs 59 crore as license fee. “We will fight it,” he said, when asked about the options that the company had in front of it, including exploring a legal recourse. “Transmission income added as miscellaneous income in the demand is unjust.”

PGCIL sees telecom business as an opportunity to leverage its existing power transmission network. It had also been entrusted with the responsibility of implementation of System Coordination and Control projects in various regions for better overall coordination and effective management of interconnected grid networks.

Telecom services contribute about 2% to the company’s revenue, while power transmission accounts for nearly 95%. The company made Rs 742 crore in 2018-19 from its telecom business, which puts the licence fee at Rs 59 crore.

PGCIL is one of the several companies in the country which, lawyers say, could be affected by a wider interpretation of the apex court order of October 24, where it had said all revenue belonging to a telecom licensee — not just revenue from telecom services — should be accounted as gross revenue, for calculating AGR.

Following this, Bharti Airtel, in a November 14 letter to telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, sought that all telecom licence holders, even if they were non-telecom companies, should be treated at par with the mobile phone companies while seeking additional licence fees. Airtel estimated that PGCIL should be liable to pay an additional Rs 43,544 crore in licence fees, interest, penalty and interest on penalty.

Airtel further said DoT should demand licence fees, penalties and interest on penalties from about 40 such non-telecom licence holders, demands from whom could be nearly Rs 2.28 lakh crore. Telecom licensees pay 8% of AGR as licence fee to the government. The order mandated licence holders to pay in three months.

The DoT on its part has issued notices to all licence holders to give their own assessment of licence fee and pay it within the stipulated time frame, even as it takes a legal opinion on how to deal with non-telecom companies.

PGCIL has ISP (Internet Service Provider)-A and National Long Distance (NLD) licences, which the official said are different than those that fall under the ambit of the Supreme Court’s order.

When PGCIL signed the licence agreement with DoT, it was clear that only telecom revenues would be considered for the purpose of calculation of licence fee, the official said.

PGCIL maintains separate accounts for ISP and NLD licences and makes provisions every year. Even miscellaneous income from these businesses is accounted for, the official added.

But some legal experts say that any entity with a telecom service licence, including Internet service providers, satellite communication providers, cable operators and even companies in the power, steel and railway sectors, may be liable to pay AGR-based fees."

Technical analyst- Inst. desk, Ashika stock broking
Where we are: Status quo continues at the Dalal street, as Nifty despite multiple attempts failed to stage a breakout of the sideways trading range. The level of 12000 remains a strong psychological resistance for the index. On the other hand, Nifty Bank remained buoyant and staged a relative outperformance in the week gone by while the IT index which was trading sideways also declined sharply in Friday’s trading session. Sectoral positioning still indi-cates market participants are not risk-averse at this point.


What is in store: On the weekly scale formation of the “Doji “candlesticks pattern for the last three weeks indicates indecision and absence of a directional trigger. The index failed to stage a breakout of its prevailing range i.e. 11800-12000. However, price after a reversal from its intermediate high now stays near the 61.80% Fibonacci ratio of the above range; thus, some respite may take place while for a directional trigger one must wait for any decisive sign of range breakout. The level of 11800/11700 remains a key support pivot in the short term. In the Nifty Bank index from the relative strength point of view and throwback to key breakout zone, the addition of a long position is advised on a dip up to the 30800 (Spot) level.

What traders can do: In general phase of indecision results in whipsaw trades thus we expect a rise in the volatility is likely. On the stock-specific front, we recommend the addition of longs in Maruti, Power Grid & L&T expecting upside of 6% & more with stop loss of 3% while follow-up correction in Tata Elxsi may take place."

59,2019-11-25,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The Committee of Secretaries (CoS) set up to suggest relief measures for the telecom sector has been ‘disbanded’, a top government official said, indicating that the two-year moratorium on spectrum payments is possibly all that the sector will get for now.

“They (telcos) have been given a two-year moratorium (from spectrum payment), they’ve got relief of Rs 42,000 crore,” the official said, adding that nothing more should be expected. When asked specifically if the CoS had been disbanded, the official said “yes”.

On whether a new inter-ministerial panel could be constituted to provide relief for the Rs 1.47 lakh crore adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues, the official said, “No, it is a SC-defined matter”.

This official also appeared to rule out any relief for non-telecom companies including staterun units such as Power Grid, Gail and RailTel that have been affected by the AGR order.

“...why didn’t they (non-telcos) fight (in court), who asked them not to do it? Elementary accounting procedure is that if there are pending dues, then contingent provision should have been kept in books of accounting. It is their statutory obligation,” he said.




COAI Still Hopeful
The government, on the recommendations of the CoS, last week cleared a two-year moratorium on payments for spectrum bought in auctions, a move aimed at providing cash flow relief to carriers such as Vodafone idea ( Rs23,920 crore) and Bharti Airtel (Rs 11,746 crore).

But the government didn’t reduce the 8% AGR that the telcos pay as licence fees, as was widely expected. Neither did the panel nor the government provide any relief on the AGR-based dues that mobile phone companies face after a recent Supreme Court order. Carriers need to pay the dues in less than three months.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who face combined AGR dues of over Rs 89,000 crore to be paid in less than three months, have filed review petitions seeking a review of penalties and interest on the dues, and questioning some components of the non-core items that the court said should be included while computing AGR of telcos. If forced to pay the whole amounts, the telcos say they have doubts over continuing as going concerns.

“We trust this does not mean the government has ceased to look at the long-term relief and sustainability of the industry. We hope these issues will continue to be looked at and decided upon by DoT through existing channels of decision making,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). COAI represents all private telecom operators.

Analysts last week said the sector needs more measures.

“While deferment of spectrum auction payment is in line with our expectations, no decision on licence fees reduction is clearly negative…We note that if the Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel face challenges in paying the annual spectrum payment of Rs 12,000 crore and Rs 6,000 crore, respectively, then it will be more challenging for them to pay AGR dues of Rs 53,000 crore and Rs 35,600 crore immediately,” Credit Suisse said in a report.

Telecom companies have also asked the government to reduce their total incidence of tax and levies from the present levels of 33%, and reduce spectrum usage charge to 1%, respectively. ET had reported previously that the DoT may ask the finance ministry to refer the pending issue of refunding input tax credits of telecom companies worth Rs 36,000 crore to the GST Council, which the telcos have been asking for as well."

65,2019-11-27,PowerGrid,"New Delhi: The Union cabinet will soon consider what would be the country’s first exchange traded fund for corporate bonds, Bharat Bond ETF, a government official has said. “The product is ready to be rolled out... It will soon go to cabinet for approval,” the official told ET. It is likely to be rolled out in mid-December, the person said.

The ETF will have bonds of some central public sector units as underlying.

The move is part of the government's efforts to enhance depth in the bond market and draw retail investors to the debt products.

More than a dozen PSUs’ bonds would form part of proposed ETF, said a person familiar to the deliberations on the matter. PSUs likely to be part of the bouquet include National Highways Authority of India, Indian Railways Finance Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, Nabard, Exim Bank, Nuclear Power Corporation, REC and Power Grid, the person said.

The government official quoted earlier said the minimum size of investment for ETF will be kept at 1,000 units, providing ease of access to investors.

Net asset value of the ETF, also to be traded on exchange, will be declared several times during a day and the portfolio will be visible to investors.

PSUs participating in the ETF will be using the vehicle to raise funds now and subsequently use it as part of annual fund raising as well, the official said.

“The idea is to deepen the market for all stakeholders,” the person said, adding that further bond issuances by PSUs will bring liquidity in the corporate bond market.

The ETF would offer returns upwards of 7 per cent, higher than fixed deposits and tax-free bonds, the official said.

The proposal was first announced by late Arun Jaitley in his 2018-19 budget speech. “The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management will come up with more ETF offers including debt ETF,” he had said.

Edelweiss Asset Management is the asset manager for the proposed debt ETF, which seeks to cater to borrowing needs of CPSEs and other public sector entities."

67,2019-11-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Real-time power market is expected to kick in from April 1 next year, following which consumers including discoms or captive users can buy power at exchanges just one hour before delivery, said a senior official on Wednesday.

At present, the consumers including discoms or captive users can buy power one day prior in Day Ahead Market (DAM) at power exchanges where trading is done for two hours daily from 10 am to 12 noon.

""We are hoping that real-time power market will kick in from April 1, 2020. The hearing (of stakeholders) on the draft regulation on real-time power market is complete,"" Central Electricity Regulatory Authority Commission (CERC) Chairman P K Pujari told reporters on the sidelines of the 22nd India Power Forum 2019 here.

Pujari further said ""it is not that real-time power market will kick in immediately after the finalisation or approval of the regulation by the CERC. In order to bring it, we have to put a system in place. So we have to give time. There is need for a software (trading solution) for that and people need to be educated about that.""

The main purpose of introducing real-time power market is to deal with the renewables interference and better portfolio management by discoms, gencos and other consumers.

With more and more renewable energy capacity being added to power grid, there would be need for sudden ramp up and down sizing of supply.

Consumers including discoms can plan their energy supplies in a better way and gencos would be able to increase or decrease their output accordingly.

A senior Indian Energy Exchange official told that under the proposed draft regulation, there would be 48 session of half an hour each in a day. That means the trading of electricity would be done round the clock.

The official further said that after the closing of hour-an-hour session, the power delivery can be scheduled at an interval of one hour.

Thus, if a consumer buys power in a session between 1:30 pm to 2 pm then the power supply can be scheduled as early as 3 pm the same day."

No private sector company has qualified. 

About 50 bids were received from private companies for tenders floated under the Centre’s second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (Fame-II) scheme, but the companies did not qualify as they had to bid through nominated agencies for the states, sources said. 

Two of the private bidders told ET declined to comment till the results of the tenders are made official. 

""We will evaluate the results and the documents once an official statement about the results is made,"" an executive at one of the private bidders said. 

Of the Rs 10,000 crore Fame II scheme, Rs 1,000 crore has been earmarked as subsidy for setting up the charging stations. 

The Department of Heavy Industry received a total of 100 bids from public and private companies in response to tenders for setting up public charging stations for electric vehicles. 

EESL emerged as the qualified bidder for setting up about 600 charging stations in about a dozen cities, while REIL won 1,000 tenders. NTPC is likely to get contracts for 200 charging stations, while PowerGrid may qualify for about 10 charging stations. 

A senior EESL official said the company would set up charging stations in a dozen cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Noida and Chandigarh. 

REIL will set up the charging infrastructure in about 50 cities. 

Urban local bodies of Dehradun, Guwahati and Tirupati; and municipal corporations of Navi Mumbai and Bhubaneswar also could bag some of the contracts. 

About 1,000 charging stations will be set up in about seven cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, with populations of over four million, sources said. 

The focus of the Fame II scheme is electrification of public and shared transportation and laying of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. 

The government targets to set up one charging station for every three km in cities and every 25 km on both sides of highways. The tariff for supply of electricity to electric vehicle public charging stations shall not be more than the average cost of supply plus 15%, according to the power ministry’s guidelines. The states will fix a ceiling on service charges for the public charging stations. 

Early last year, the ministry had issued a notification clarifying that setting up charging stations for electric vehicles will not require a separate licence under the Electricity Act, 2003. 

The power ministry issued guidelines in December last year for charging infrastructure, under which it asked public charging stations to install both Japanese and European charging platforms."

76,2019-11-30,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: The government will likely need sizable privatisation income over the next five years given the fiscal pressures, with BHEL, GAIL India, Hindustan Zinc and NALCO likely to be the possible candidates, according to foreign brokerage CLSA.

PSU stocks with limited scope for privatisation such as ONGC, NTPC, Power Grid, Indian Oil Corporation, and Coal India, may continue to face selling pressures.

“The government has earned $12 billion via PSU stock sales through ETFs in the last three years and fear of more such sales will put supply pressure in the market on non-disinvestment candidates,” said CLSA.

However, the chances of the government concluding the BPCL privatisation before the end of the current financial year is challenging, the brokerage said.

“The experience of three previous successful cases back in 2001-2002 shows that privatisation is a time-consuming process and takes 6-16 months between global tender and deal consummation, thus, concluding the BPCL privatisation before Mar’20 is challenging,” said CLSA.

CLSA said weak tax collection growth and stimulatory measures by the government have created a fiscal shortfall of over ₹2 lakh crore in the current financial year. The government has set a fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of the GDP for the current financial year.

The brokerage believes that the disinvestment target may only grow going forward especially if more tax cuts happen and as other potential non-tax revenue sources are already constrained.

“Even assuming a 50-70 bps (basis points) relaxation, the current year’s record $15bn (billion) disinvestment target may only grow, especially if more tax cuts happen,” said CLSA.

The brokerage said the government’s total holding in listed PSUs is $174 billion of which financials account for $61 billion and those are unlikely to be disinvested in the near future.

Sale of SUUTI holdings is an easier option, but the government only has about $4.8 billion in the two stocks – Axis Bank and ITC – which can be easily sold, said CLSA."
0,2019-12-02,PowerGrid,"The recent performance of the Indian stock market is not in sync with economic fundamentals. While the market continues to hit all-time highs, macro indicators paint a dismal picture of the economy. The weakness comes across through numbers that show declining core sector growth, falling consumption, likely fiscal slippage and lower GDP growth projections. Some experts believe that deteriorating macro fundamentals are due to structural issues that will create obstacles on the road to economic recovery. As markets cannot remain isolated from the economy for a long period of time, one can expect high volatility in the near future.

Generally, volatility analysis is done using the returns a stock or an index generates and such returns are calculated for different time frames—weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly. Statistical tools like standard deviation and beta are often used for volatility estimation and for identifying stable or low volatile stocks. Instead of looking at volatility from the returns side, how about looking at companies that have displayed low volatility in their core fundamentals like revenue growth or EPS growth over a period of time?

Companies that maintain stability in principal fundamentals tend to control systematic or market risks better than the rest. Stability in revenue growth implies pricing power and durable demand for the company’s products or services. On the other hand, stability in EPS growth indicates operational efficiency and cost control. To identify such companies, the consolidated numbers showing sales revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth were analysed for the past 10 financial years, starting from 2009-10. Over 700 companies with market cap greater than Rs 500 crore were considered. Similar growth numbers were extracted for the aggregate BSE500 index.

Standard deviation of the series of revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth were worked out for the companies and for the aggregate BSE500 index. Only companies that reported positive adjusted EPS in all of the past 10 years were included in the analysis. To identify companies with low volatility in financials, only those with standard deviation of revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth less than that of the BSE500 index were filtered out. Only 22 companies passed these filters. The past 5-and 10-year average return of this group was 82% and 413% respectively. The BSE500 delivered 42% and 133.3% returns during the same period. All returns are absolute and point to point. The numbers clearly show that stocks with stable financials outperformed the market substantially. To look at the future potential of these shortlisted companies, only those that are covered by at least four Bloomberg analysts and those with a 1-year forward price potential greater than 10% were included.

Out of the seven companies, NTPC, Power Grid and Infosys have also shown stability in their RoEs (%). The standard deviation of these stocks based on their last 10-year RoE is less than the standard deviation of the average RoE of the BSE500 index.

5,2019-12-05,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government said the Supreme Court order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) will be applicable to all telecom licensees, which includes companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and others, even though they were not party to the dispute between phone companies and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). This implies that companies with even minor telecom businesses may have to pay dues based on their entire revenue with retrospective effect.

“While most of the licensees of DoT were not direct party to the dispute, the ratio of the judgement will be applicable on all the licensees,” said communications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, answering a question in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. This is the first time the government has confirmed that the apex court’s ruling on the definition of AGR will also impact non-telecom companies, which may leave the firms that have telecom licences having to pay in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore, according to one estimate.

According to the DoT website, there are 3,468 telecom licensees across the country, including Power Grid, GAIL, Airports Authority of India, the National Stock Exchange, Ministry of Home Affairs, Cabinet Secretariat, Delhi Metro Rail Corp, NTPC, ONGC and Rail-Tel, among others. Many companies hold multiple types of licences under the same name. The minister did not specify the amount due on this account, while giving a list of licence holders in Karnataka.

On October 24, the Supreme Court decided in favour of the government’s contention that all revenue, including from non-core sources, would count as gross revenue for calculating AGR. The court mandated compliance with the order in three months or January end.

Licence holders have to pay about 8% of AGR to the DoT as fees. While the telecom companies that were directly party to the case owe the government about Rs 1.47 lakh crore — most of it owed by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — the industry estimates that non-telecom companies may have to pay about Rs 2.28 lakh crore, calculated since the time they got their respective licences.

These licences that non-telecom companies have are for services such as internet access, national long distance calls, international long distance calls, V-Sat and captive services among others. Until now, they have been paying little by way of licence fees since revenue from telecom services was marginal.

For instance, state-run Power Grid gets 2% of its revenue from telecom services while power transmission accounts for nearly 95%. The company made Rs 742 crore in FY19 from its telecom business, putting its licence fee payment at Rs 59 crore. But under the expanded definition as per the October verdict, AGR would include all of its FY19 revenue, which is Rs 35,661 crore.

DoT on its part has already issued notices to all licence holders for their own fee assessment following the verdict and asked them to pay the amount within the stipulated time frame, even as it has sought legal opinion on how to deal with non-telecom companies.

Bharti Airtel has told DoT that all telecom licence holders, even if they were non-telecom companies, should be treated at par with the mobile phone companies while seeking additional licence fees. Bharti Airtel has estimated that PGCIL could be liable to pay an additional Rs 43,544 crore in licence fees, interest, penalty and interest on penalty.

A lobby group representing internet service providers (ISPs) has already written to the Prime Minister’s Office seeking its urgent intervention as any move to seek dues would have “serious financial implications” on oil and gas companies, power producers, the railways, data centres and others that have obtained telecom licences but were not part of the litigation involving telcos. This will lead to a “financial crisis in many small and medium ISPs that have operations in rural areas,” it has said. The Internet Service Providers Association of India has also sought a legal opinion on the applicability of the Supreme Court order on ISPs."

17,2019-12-09,PowerGrid,"CHENNAI: Irumbai, a village in Vanur taluk in Villupuram district would soon become the country's first fully solar-powered village. 

The Tamil Nadu Energy Development Corporation (TEDA) plans to complete the work within two to three months. The agency is awaiting the completion of local body polls to move ahead with the project.

The state government has allocated 2.2 crore from the State Innovative Fund for the project. The project aims to study the socio-economic impact of energy conservation, besides creating awareness on sustainable and renewable energy. A 170kWp ground-mounted solar farm would be established in 4,000 sq ft area in the village. It would supply three-phase uninterrupted power to the village, managing director of TEDA, M Asia Mariam told TOI. More villages would be covered under the scheme by TEDA in the future, she said. 

Once the solar farm is established, the village would be off the Tangdeco power grid. The excess solar energy generated by the pilot project would be sold to Tangedco, and the revenue generated from it would be utilized for research work. The unit has been designed to generate 150% of the actual power requirement of the village. ""The village will not remain in darkness, even if there is continuous rain or low solar power generation for a couple of days. It will be further enhanced to face the challenges that may arise in future,"" general manager of agency S Sankara Narayanan said. 

The village was shortlisted after a detailed energy audit survey five years ago. ""We have replaced the streetlights, fans and other electronic appliances with energy-efficient appliances,"" said Narayanan."

21,2019-12-10,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The government has warned all telecom licence holders against any delays in the payment of dues related to adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and has asked them to seek clarifications by December 13 on any doubts that may not have been covered in the recent Supreme Court judgment.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) asked all telecom licence holders, including non-telecom companies, to speed up the process of self-assessment of AGR-based dues and their payments in a letter written last week. Some 15 telcos need to pay over Rs 1.47 lakh crore, which could rise further, the government has said. Industry estimates peg the money owed by nontelecom companies, which hold nearly 3,500 licences, at around Rs 2.28 lakh crore.

The top court had given companies three months to make the payments in its October 24 order.

“Any issues should be pointed out in the comprehensive representation to be submitted, but in no case the self-assessment and payment of dues are to be delayed,” said the December 5 DoT letter, which ET has seen.

“The comprehensive representation shall be submitted within a week (latest by December 13),” the letter said.

The Supreme Court decided in favour of the government’s contention that all revenue, including that from non-core sources, would be counted in calculating AGR. Licence holders have to pay about 8% of AGR to the DoT as fees. Telcos also pay about 3-4% of AGR as spectrum usage charges (SUC).

Soon after the ruling, the DoT had asked all telecom licence holders to self-assess and submit their dues to the government within the stipulated three months.

The government recently made it clear that the AGR order will be applicable to all telecom licensees, which includes companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and others. These companies, which may have minor telecom businesses, may have to pay dues based on their entire revenue with retrospective effect. Non-telcos, including internet service providers (ISPs), have urged the intervention of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to resolve this issue.

“In this regard, it is pointed out that over a course of time, multiple representations related to LF (licence fee) assessments were received from various licensees for consideration by the department,” the DoT said in the letter. “After the judgment, most of these have been settled and for any remaining issues, a comprehensive representation needs to be submitted to the department.”

Further, the DoT has sought comprehensive year-wise and circlewise representations, but not on issues decided by the court order.



Last month, Bharti Airtel, facing dues of over Rs 35,500 crore, Vodafone Idea (over Rs 53,000 crore) and Tata Teleservices (nearly Rs 14,000 crore) filed for a limited review of the judgment. While Airtel has sought a review of the interest, penalty and interest on penalty, Vodafone Idea’s petition has further urged the Supreme Court to have a “relook at the amounts attributed to notional revenue”. Later, Bharti Airtel appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the telco and the government to agree on the quantum of AGRbased dues that need to be paid and the timeline for payments.

To prepare for the payments, Bharti Airtel’s board approved a proposal for the company to raise up to $4 billion, out of which it plans to raise $3 billion initially through a combination of equity and debt."

36,2019-12-12,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal called on the government to ensure that the Indian telecom market continues to have three private carriers. He also urged the Centre and the judiciary to give “sympathetic consideration” to the industry’s appeal for relief after the Supreme Court’s order on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) left companies struggling.

Mittal also said the telecom regulator needs to urgently intervene to fix a floor price for tariffs. This, he said, is required for the average revenue per user (ARPU) to rise to Rs 200 initially, and to Rs 300 over time, for the industry to be healthy and sustainable.

“The situation is dire — it is a matter of survival for everyone. Vodafone (Idea) is in losses, Airtel is in losses, (state-owned) BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd) is in losses,” Mittal said.


‘We’ve been Killing Each Other’
“There is one competitor who has unlimited access to finances — I wouldn’t comment on that but the situation is bad,” he said soon after a meeting with Department of Telecommunications (DoT) secretary Anshu Prakash on Wednesday.



“We have gone through several crises but this is the most difficult time for the industry,” Mittal added.

The presence of more companies is key to consumers being well served by competition.

“It is absolutely essential that we have three (private players) plus one (state-run) players,” he said. “Lower the taxes and find ways and means to support the sector in one form or the other.”

He urged the Supreme Court to consider Bharti’s review petition with understanding.

“The honourable SC needs to look at our review petition from the point of view that there are unintended consequences and lots of other companies, including public sector, are coming into this unreasonable AGR definition, which could have never been the intention,” he said.

He was referring to the government’s recent clarification that the AGR order will be applicable to all telecom licensees, which includes companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and others. These companies, which may have minor telecom businesses, may have to pay dues based on their entire revenue with retrospective effect.

“Our legal team were perhaps not able to persuade the honourable Supreme Court on the unreasonableness of DoT’s AGR interpretation but equally, I think DoT didn’t realise the unintended consequences on the larger ecosystem,” said Mittal, adding that the government should have a “sympathetic view” towards the industry.

Mittal said his comments were in the context of statements made by both Vodafone Group CEO Nick Read and Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, both of whom have said in the recent past that the Indian telco will have to shut if it doesn’t get any relief on AGR dues.

“It will be very self-serving for me to say that two plus one is fine. I, as a person who has watched this industry from scratch — I was the first private sector guy in telecom — so, from that point of view I think India needs three plus one,” Mittal said, referring to analysts who have said that Bharti Airtel stands to gain if Vodafone Idea collapses. He pointed out China, the world’s largest market, has three and the US has four operators.


MORATORIUM NOT ENOUGH
The recent two-year moratorium on spectrum payments won’t do much to help Vodafone Idea unless there is relief on the AGR dues. “Otherwise, it is just deferment with interest,” Mittal said.

Vodafone Idea was left facing statutory dues of over Rs 53,000 crore, as per the telecom department’s calculations, following the October 24 Supreme Court verdict that broadened the definition of AGR to include non-core items. The amount could go up, the government has said. Bharti Airtel faces over Rs 35,500 crore in additional dues comprising licence fees, spectrum usage charges (SUC), interest and penalties.

Both telcos, which have filed separate review petitions, reported record losses of over Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 23,000 crore in the July-September quarter, respectively, owing to provisions for the AGR dues. The government has previously said it can’t give AGR relief, unless directed to do so by the court.

Licence holders have to pay about 8% of AGR to DoT as fees. Telcos also need to pay 3-4% of AGR as SUC.

Fifteen telecom companies that were directly party to the case owe the government about Rs 1.47 lakh crore. The industry estimates that non-telecom companies that have telecom licences may have to pay about Rs 2.28 lakh crore, calculated from the time they got their respective permits.

Mittal said that non-telecom companies such as GAIL, RailTel, Power Grid and Delhi Metro will now be charged licence fees even for the sale of gas or train tickets as per the wider interpretation of the apex court ruling, which shouldn’t be the case.

“Ramifications were huge and therefore the review petition is in front of the honourable SC and we hope they will look into this whole thing,” he added. He said the AGR dues have added to the woes of the industry, which has been swamped by “unprecedented competition” for over three years—since the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016—which has hurt balance sheets and caused financial stress, triggering the exit of eight operators.

“In the quest for being in the market, we have been killing each other for three and a half years,” Mittal said. “It is an odd situation — we need a digital ecosystem to support new age industries but equally, the industry is in a crisis”.


RARE SITUATION
He added that setting a floor for tariffs was essential.

“It is a rare situation where we have written to the Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), saying please regulate us, because the industry is killing itself. Tariff needs to go up, industry needs to become viable,” said Mittal. “Also, the fact that the three of us (Airtel, Reliance Jio Infocomm and Vodafone Idea) have written to the regulator says something. First time, the COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India) has an agreement to write something.”

Last week, all three carriers, through COAI, asked the sector regulator to establish floor pricing for data services soon. Due to fierce rivalry, tariff correction was not possible voluntarily by any carrier, it said.

“My own view is India needs to be eventually at Rs 300 (ARPU), per month which means customers at low end need to pay about Rs 100 and higher end need to pay Rs 450-500, where they are consuming a lot,” he said.

The government needs to lower levies to help the industry.

“You can’t have telecom services being taxed like the sin tax! 30% of revenues are going in one form or the other—that must come down,” said Mittal.

He urged the telecom ministry to take up issues such as lowering licence fees and SUC in some forum, given that the panel of secretaries set up to provide relief to the industry didn’t take decisions on those matters.

Mittal wasn’t hopeful of a refund of the Rs 36,000 crore input tax credit lying with the finance ministry, given the government’s finances.

“It is our money sitting with the government and even if they cannot refund it, can they at least offset it? Rs 36,000 crore, this is sizeable sum of money, we get no interest on this but we pay interest,” said Mittal.

He said however that Bharti Airtel was fighting it out in the market place.

“We are in a better situation—we have now decided to raise funds,” Mittal said. “However, if you have to go in for network expansion, invest in newer technologies, bid for 5G spectrum and then build a 5G ecosystem which India deserves, then industry needs to be viable.”

Referring to the Bharti Airtel statement in the fiscal second quarter regarding concerns about viability if it couldn’t raise money on its terms in the face of the AGR dues, Mittal said, “That is an accounting standard… They (auditor Deloitte) called it out. It isn’t my interpretation or view of the company… It is a standard and that is why we are in the market to raise money.”"
59,2019-12-12,PowerGrid,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest mutual fund house by assets, did brisk shopping in November, buying select pharma, largecap and midcap IT stocks, besides a few PSUs, FMCG and metal & mining stocks.

Nifty advanced 1.50 per cent during the month.

The fund house also offloaded shares of some of the performing stocks in the largecap space, including ICICI Bank (2.50 crore shares) and Reliance Industries (43.79 lakh) as they hovered around record high levels. The fund sold nearly 25 lakh shares each TCS and SBI and 5 lakh shares in ONGC during the month.

The AMC bought 40 lakh to 1.50 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC, government-owned GAIL India and Coal India and drug major Sun Pharmaceuticals.

Sun Pharma turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore against a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore reported for the same period last financial year.

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other major buys in November included Aurobindo Pharma, REC, NTPC, NHPC, Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, Lupin, Tata Steel, PNC Infratech, Neyveli Lignite, Infosys and Adani Ports, Delta Corp, Rites, Indian Hotel, J Kumar Infraproject and Persistent Systems, among others.

The fund house added 10 to 42 lakh additional shares of these companies during the month.


Watch | Smallcaps don't necessarily grow faster: Prashant Jain


In his recent interaction with ETMarkets.com, Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC AMC, said the entire market is reasonably valued, except for the consumer pack, which is trading above their long-term averages.

“Profit growth is recovering and the interest rate is low, which are good for valuations. The government has taken some good steps by cutting corporate tax rates, which would drive profit growth and encourage the manufacturing supply chain to be set up in India,” Jain said.

He also though the strategic divestment route for offloading government stake is very positive for PSUs, and this would encourage foreign inflows and lift valuations of public sector companies,” he said.

The fund house also added shares of several IT players during the month, including Tech Mahindra (4.19 lakh shares), Firstsource Solution (3.87 lakh shares), eClerx (0.64 lakh shares), L&T Technology (0.50 lakh shares), HCL Technologies (3,040 shares) and Newgen Software Tech (6,200 shares).

Elsewhere, it bought InterGlobe Aviation (4.84 lakh shares), Mishra Dhatu Nigam (8.15 lakh shares), JSPL (6.53 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (7 lakh shares), Power Grid (6.12 lakh shares), Tata Global Beverages (3.75 lakh shares), Bajaj Electronics (7 lakh shares) and LIC Housing Finance (2.95 lakh shares).

Other largecaps and midcaps HDFC AMC accumulated during the month included JMC Projects (34,600 shares) and Dr Reddy’s Labs (32,102 shares). YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and M&M Financial Services drew interest of the AMC in the financial space.

Last week, there were reports that the AMC was keen on participating in the capital infusion of YES Bank.

“Any business with reasonable quality, a sustainable business model and fair value or below-fair value is a reasonable investment. Smallcaps and midcaps vastly outperformed the largecaps for four years since 2014. That outperformance led to higher valuations. The correction seen in last two years, those excessive valuations have gone. Going forward, as valuations converge, we are not going to see a significant difference in the performance of largecaps, midcaps and smallcaps,” Jain said.

In the broader market, the BSE500 index gained 1.17 per cent last month, while BSE Midcap index rose 1.48 per cent and the Smallcap index 0.02 per cent, suggesting a widening of the market momentum, which had moved only a couple of largecaps till the previous month.

On the sell side, HDFC AMC sold over 5 lakh shares each in BPCL, HPCL, Federal Bank, Punjab National Bank, Voltas, McLeod Russel, Avenue Supermarts, Adani Power, ICICI Prudential, Repco Home and Tata Power, during the month.

It completely exited Ashok Leyland, Biocon, Info Edge, Ircon International, Lemon Tree and SAIL.

Godrej Consumer Products, Muthoot Finance and Sun TV Network were among the stocks the fund house entered afresh."

37,2019-12-12,PowerGrid,"ET Intelligence Group: The Supreme Court’s directive to telecom service providers to pay the pending dues pertaining to the underpaid licence fees and associated penalties and interest could adversely impact the non-telecom companies including GAIL, Oil India, and Power Grid Corporation.

This is because a small portion of revenues (under 2 per cent) of these companies comes from the optical fibre cable (OFC), which these companies have laid across their gas and power distribution networks. However, according to the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) does not distinguish between telecom and non-telecom companies and considers entire revenue of the companies for the calculation of the penalties.

The total pending payment related to AGR dues for non-telecom companies is around Rs 2.3 lakh crore and more than 90 per cent of this is from the thee three listed companies.

The AGR liability is the highest for GAIL at around Rs 1.2 lakh crore, followed by Rs 40,000 crore for Oil India, according to Emkay Global, a domestic brokerage house. For Power Grid, the liability is estimated to be around Rs 22,000-25,000 crore. In case of GAIL, gas transmission, gas marketing, LPG and petrochemicals segment form a major chunk of the revenue. GAILTEL, the company’s telecom arm has an OFC network of 12,000 kilometres.

Bloomberg
A senior official at Power Grid told ET that at the time of signing the licence agreement with the telecom ministry, it was made clear that only telecom revenue would be considered for the purpose of the licence fees. “It has therefore surprised us to know that core earnings are used to calculated AGR dues,” he added.

Power Grid’s telecom revenue increased by 9.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 663.3 crore in FY19. Its total telecom network increased by about 27 per cent to over 60,900 km. These non-telecom companies are in the process of filing their responses in the next few days to the AGR demand.

The uncertainty surrounding the final outcome and any prolonged arbitration may keep the upside limited for their stocks until clarity emerges about the treatment of AGR for non-telecom companies."

67,2019-12-13,PowerGrid,"SBI Mutual Fund, India’s third largest asset management company, loaded up a number of undervalued PSU stocks in November as the buzz over divestment grew.

The fund manager bought nearly 3 crore shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) during the month, data available with corporate database ace Equity shows. It also acquired 2.26 crore shares of Power Grid Corporation and 1.31 crore shares of peer SJVN.

BHEL is said to be one of the companies the government is mulling to disinvest to reach its divestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore for 2019-2020. The government plans to lower its stake in BHEL to 26 per cent from 63.17 per cent now.

Following these reports, global brokerages CLSA upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘sell’. It cut earnings estimates for this financial year, but raised price target to Rs 67 from Rs 54 on a rolling forward estimates and rerating on divestment. The stock trades around Rs 45 on BSE.

Stock plans received 13.1 billion rupees ($184 million) in November, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. The flow compares with 60 billion received in October, and is the smallest since June 2016. Here’s what the top three asset managers bought and sold: NextHDFC AMC's new buys/exits 13 Dec, 2019India’s largest money manager held $21 billion in equities, with financials accounting for 34% of stock assets followed by industrial companies at 13%.

NextICICI Pru MF added/reduced stakes13 Dec, 2019Next
Taking a contrarian view, the fund house added 10.57 lakh shares of YES Bank, which is battling liquidity issues, and now, it holds 4.62 crore shares of the beleaguered lender.

Reuters data showed just seven analysts out of 36, who track a stock, have positive opinion on it while 13 recommend ‘sell’ and six have rated it as ‘underperform’. 10 analysts have ‘hold’ on the scrip. Throughout November, the stock hovered around the Rs 70 mark, and lost 3 per cent during the month. 

Among new additions to the SBI MF’s portfolio was SRF, Engineers India, ICICI Securities and newly listed CSB Bank that debuted on the bourses on December 4. The fund house bought 6.3 lakh shares of the bank.

The fund house’s investment team led by Navneet Munot completely exited Apollo Tyres, Clariant Chemicals, Kalpataru Power Transmission, NIIT Tech, Neuland Laboratories and Shreno (unlisted) in November, as per Ace Equity data. 

It dumped over 3 crore shares of Vodafone Idea during the month. The telecom services provider is in deep trouble as it owes the government over Rs 53,000 crore apart from registering massive operating losses.

In another theme-based selling by SBI MF, it reduced exposure to insurance stocks as valuations in them touched sky high. The fund house sold 61 lakh shares of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, 14 lakh shares of HDFC Life Insurance and 6 lakh shares of ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The trailing 12-month price to earnings ratio of HDFC Life stood at 80 while for the ICICI twins were 61 and 56, respectively.

Other stocks that the fund house sold in November are ICICI Bank, Ashoka Buildcon, Bandhan Bank, Motherson Sumi, Axis Bank, Aavas Financiers, Minda Corporation and Axis Bank, among others.

November was a tepid month in terms of equity inflow into mutual funds as it crashed 78 per cent month on month to a net Rs 1,311 crore, Amfi data shows. Inflows into equity mutual funds was 6,026.38 crore in October.

SBI MF is the largest equity investor among all mutual fund houses. As of November 30, its equity asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 1.87 lakh crore and its overall AUM was next only to HDFC AMC’s Rs 3.86 lakh crore and ICICI Prudential AMC’s Rs 3.71 lakh crore."
70,2019-12-13,PowerGrid,"Those are midcap stocks which are not going to remain in a five-year bear market. Also strategic PSUs and top 5 public sector banks are going to be the top compounders in the next 10 years, says Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities. Excerpts from an interview with Nikunj Dalmia of ETNOW.

You have been making a case you would put money into small and midcap stocks. There is reasoning that mid and small cap stocks are trading at a discount because of technicals and FIIs selling and fund selling. But there is no appetite for these stocks now. There is value but the value could remain deep value for a long, long time.
You are absolutely correct, but the fact remains that at this point of time, quality is crowded and risky in my opinion. Everyone is basically into those 10 or 15 stocks. Just an indicator, Kotak Bank has a market cap of Rs 3.3 lakh crore and on the other side, Bank of Baroda, PNB, Canara, Union, Corporation Bank put together do not even come to half that market cap despite their deposit books in the liability side as well as the asset side being multiple times of Kotak Bank. Are you telling me that those banks are going to shut down and Kotak or HDFC is the only bank that will survive?

 This is a time to take those courageous calls. I do not know if tomorrow or four weeks later, those same good quality stocks in B group would turn. No one knows. It is like what we were experiencing last year in January 2018 and December 2017, when no one was looking at the largecaps and the midcap were an extremely crowded trade and then everything collapsed! 

 This is the time to stick your neck out but I obviously cannot say whether this is going to happen in the next two weeks, four weeks or six weeks. I am not that kind of an investor. I expect to make money two, three or five years later where am I going to make money. I feel this is the time to be courageous and start building a portfolio. 


When stocks go into a bear market, it takes time for them to revive. When midcap stocks corrected in 2008-2009, it took them five years to come out from that hole. It has only been two years since the 2018 corrections. The midcaps may just hang in there for another two years! Meanwhile, largecap stocks will keep giving such great returns that you feel left out.That is exactly what you are going to live with. But I disagree with you that largecaps are making substantial gains barring the 15 or 20 Nifty stocks. It is wrong to say all largecaps are making huge money.Whether it is L&T or ITC, neither have made any money in the last two years. 

 I am not saying that go and buy the entire midcap index at 500. Within midcaps, I can easily make a list of 100-150 good quality, low leverage companies which are substantially prominent and large in their own markets, in their own businesses but at this point of time no one wants to look at them. That is where the opportunity is. Those are the stocks which are not going to remain in a five-year bear market. 

 Yes, as a basket, mid or smallcaps may remain where you correctly said. In any case, we cannot go back and lean on history because I do not think any one of us in our living history has seen these kind of developments and these kind of carnage in the financial markets and in the main street, in the main system! Clean up of NPAs, IBC, GST rollout and the pain that we all are going through. This is a transformation period. So we cannot in any way go back on history and project forward as to what will happen. Times have changed dramatically and we have to realise that we have to adjust to these new realities that are coming to us as investors, corporate business managers and promoters.


You are a long term investor. Give me some themes or ideas where you will buy and stick for the next three, five or seven years. What are your high conviction long-term bets? See I am absolutely clear there are certain timeless companies and brands in the country which are not going to shut down. They are going to survive cycles and I am going to bet on these. One, which you know I have very openly bet on and which everyone in the market knows has tremendous potential is the largest stainless steel player in the country - -the Jindal Group. Both Jindal Stainless and Jindal Stainless Hisar are more or less the same. If you look at the combined enterprise value of both companies, they would not even total up to $2 billion. But between them, they control 50-60% of the stainless steel industry in the country. 

 Stainless steel is something that is being used in railways, defence, production, in construction and everywhere else. What you are trying to tell me is that the entire 50% or 60% of the Indian organised stainless steel market is just worth $2 billion and I can buy a player in $2 billion or $2.5 billion in value? So, three-five years down the line, something is going to definitely change for this company. 

 Dabur is another timeless brand. I do not know Dabur but I am giving you just another example. It has not performed for the last year or so. 


If you have the patience to ride them out, if you have the patience to see another 10 or 20% down in them and then make that 50% gain. then go for the timeless gems which are in a slump.-Sanjay Dutt
 Look at companies even in the public sector; there are companies like Power Grid which controls 1.7 lakh km of power lines across the country. So, whether you are solar, thermal or nuclear -- you need to roll power across the country from transmission lines on transmission networks. The entire enterprise value of the company would just be about $4 billion! So are you telling me the largest power consumer country over the next few years which is going to be India, you can own the entire grid for about $4-5 billion? No way. This is going to change. 

 Okay we may say nothing will happen with PSUs. We have sat on HPCL and BPCL for 10 years and what they are doing to make money? But it is very difficult to say when these things are going to turn. Similarly, I can go down and find so many other ideas. Power Grid is one that I own; Exide Industries is another one . I own a very small position. That company is going into EV batteries. If you need batteries, the first brand that comes to your mind is Exide. At this point of time something like a $2 or $3 billion enterprise value. 

 These are all quality names, these do not have questionable promoters and neither are they highly leveraged companies. These are very manageable leverage or in fact zero leverage with marquee managements, marquee brands and promoters. Similarly, I can go on with many ideas like these but you need to have patience to invest in them. They are not going to give you returns in four weeks, four months or 12 months even. If you have the patience to ride them out, if you have the patience to see another 10 or 20% down in them and then make that 50% gain. that is where you got to be.


You are not talking about long term bets. What do you make of your experience with the ADA companies? Would you call that a misjudgement, a learning? Phenomenal learning! I have lost a lot of money. I have lost more than I could ever think of in life in those companies, but that is exactly where we learn. In the last three or four decades in the markets, none of us have experienced such times, none of us ever thought groups like ADA, Zee, Essar would go through what they are going through. But we must understand these are times which are going to totally change the face of a Indian business and Indian markets. 

 We ourselves are opening our eyes as to what we need to do before we need to invest. I am sure these lessons are going to remain for a long time and of course quite a few will be wiped out, quite a few will start rebuilding our lives, like we all are trying to do now.


We have seen the obsession as well with low debt. But that is an ideal scenario and one cannot really work with that. What is your outlook on some of those companies?One should not have an obsession with low debt. One really needs to go and look at the consolidated position of a group and where the promoter is stretched. One lesson we have all learnt is if the promoter has four or five companies and even if company is in trouble. you are sure that the other companies are going to have pain also. Therefore we need to do much deeper analysis. I would say that it is a very important lesson that we learnt for corporate India as well as for investors like us who got lost in those go-go momentum where everything was good and a growth of 6%-7% was taken for granted. 

 We got to look at optimum debt, at enterprise value as well as coverage ratios, interest and debt services. This kind of learning has been an eye opener for all of us. I have been in the market from the late 90s and we never saw debt as a bad four letter word. Trying to understand the implications of debt and how much stress case situations can companies and cash flows do is what it has taught us in this crisis.


When do you think this tipping point would come where markets would say you need debt to grow, you cannot have a situation where only startups and no debt only brand companies will fuel economic growth? When would markets say go for good companies with reasonable debt and well managed businesses?I am already seeing this trend because in the last three to four weeks. some of the savvy investors have started looking at ideas that have started coming out from very savvy broking houses. They have already started differentiating. The time is to start picking up now.

 Whether you are going to have to hold those good quality stocks with manageable leverage for the next two, three months before they start to stop losses and start going up, is very difficult to guess. But I am reasonably sure that we are at the end of this whole cycle of correction. Yes, there may be a little more pain left in a few more pockets but I think most of it has corrected now and companies are starting to look at borrowing money and negotiating good rates. If you ask good quality companies, they are able to get money from banks at much lower rates. 

 Yes, pockets like NBFCs are still facing a problem. The government still needs to address some issues there but behind-the-scenes, the government is doing a lot of work. Companies are also starting to look ahead and have cleaned up substantially. A case in point was the ICICI Bank move of the last four five weeks, led by a few savvy fund managers who realised that that was the place to be. You will find similar examples across the market. There are a lot of pockets like that.


What is the large compounding story for the next 10 years? Is it still private banks or could it be insurance or something else?Spaces like insurance are going to be evergreen in India for the next many years. Whenever you get negative periods, add insurance and asset management companies as steady and stable bets. But I think the compounding 2x, 3x, 4x bets are there in a lot of good quality second tier names, good managements which have learnt their lessons but are still not being rerated by the market because everyone is crowding into quality. 

 The one play which I am willing to take a risk on and bet on in the next five years is going to be strategic PSUs. Beginning with BPCL, there is going to be a lot of PSU action in the next four to five years and I am convinced because I have seen what the government is now looking at. The government has no option and perhaps the government is very clear that they need to get out of most of the companies where there is no strategic sense. There is no need for a government company to be there present whether it is consumer focussing etc. 

 PSU is one place where you can safely bet for some 2x to 5x ideas over the next five or eight years. There is going to be a lot of big stuff there whether is going to be restructuring, management changes, governance issues, strategic divestments, a lot of focus is going to come in there. No PSU is going to get money being poured into it just for nothing. They have all started becoming accountable. 

 I feel exactly the same for the top five public sector banks. They are all beefing up. If you go and ask anyone in the market, particularly the ones who are consumer focussed businesses like automobiles etc, see how aggressive banks like State Bank of India and a lot of other banks have become in even auto financing etc. 

 So, that is another play. If you are going to bet on the economy you need to bet on a few four, five PSU banks which will actually make you money and it is not just the private banks which will keep getting market share. A lot of work needs to be done, these are just one or two themes that I have been looking at.
 I maybe wrong and so therefore we need to discipline and learn from our stop loss levels but I think these can play out and are worth a risk reward right now.


What is the stance when it comes to auto, lots of sound bites coming in from the likes of RC Bhargav, Anand Mahindra saying that we will see green shoots of recovery, while there is not going to be any big bang turnaround. Is there any select opportunity within the auto space?I am a little confused there because auto has got major structural issues that we are dealing with. Som whether it has got to do with a shift to EVs, whether it has got to do with the shared commute concept or whether it has got to do with public transportation in metros and metro lines starting to work in cities. So, that is one place I still do not have a call. It is going to be very difficult to actually spot the next winner and I do not find anything that is dirt cheap that I can go and buy and take a risk on it. 

 They are all well owned or maybe over-owned to quite an extent and are not cheap. That is something I would be underweight on. I would probably have a Maruti in my portfolio which I do not have right now, but if I have to at the right price or maybe an M&M. But there also, I am a little worried about the business model. Auto is one place where I am a little confused right now. I am confused and I am doing a lot of work on it right now. I do not want to take a call right now. But some key auto ancillaries whether it is EV or otherwise will still be needed. Like one example that I have in Exide, those plays can be looked at. So, irrespective of what the trends pan out, these companies would be beneficiaries."

79,2019-12-16,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal Monday ruled out any suo motu or proactive support to the ailing telecom sector but said that the government is in continuous discussions with the industry.

“Government proactively or suo motu cannot take an action on this (AGR) but I assure you that we are in continuous dialogue,” Goyal said, and added that the revenue issue pertains between the top court and the industry. 

In October, the Supreme Court settled a decade-and-a-half long dispute between the incumbent telecom companies and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on AGR, leaving telcos facing as much as Rs 1.47 lakh crore worth of dues to the government. 

“Government has also acquired stress. RailTel will have to shell out some Rs 80 crores. BSNL too has a stress. I am told GAIL has a big problem. These will have to be sorted out in consultation with the Supreme Court,” Goyal said.

Public sector firms too have been impacted by the apex court’s decision. Several non telecom firms with telecom licenses such as Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), PowerGrid, Oil India and GAIL that together owe more than Rs 2 lakh crore as AGR dues are also expected to file a review petition since telecom is not their core business. 

Following the top court’s verdict, ailing telecom carriers already sitting under a cumulative debt of more than Rs 7.5 lakh and plagued with falling revenue further stressed and demanded Centre’s immediate intervention.

The government on the back of recommendation from a group of secretaries, allowed a two-year moratorium on spectrum payments to incumbent telecom players.

Earlier, Vodafone Idea and met government officials, and according to Goyal, the executives demanded to defer the two years’ dues without affecting the net present value, which the Centre accepted.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have a maximum exposure in the wake of AGR ruling, and have been asked to pay nearly Rs 53,000 crore and Rs 35,000 crore respectively.

“So I think when the government wants to help, it will also need the sector willing to take some proactive measures,” he said.

Goyal also said that the telecom sector is finally investing in technology to upgrade their systems and make them relevant to market demands which according to him, is a good sign, and added that it was something they should have done five years ago.

With upcoming spectrum sale including 3300 Mhz - 3600 Mhz frequency range for next generation networks is around the corner, the stressed sector is finding it hard to bid for new airwaves owing to high price."
78,2019-12-16,PowerGrid,"RAJKOT: The housing societies built for the people of lower income group under the Pradhanmatri Aawas Yojna (PAY) are all set to go green. The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) on Saturday begun a pilot project with installation of solar-wind hybrid windmills at one of projects on the Sant Kabir road, know as Smart Ghar B Scheme.

One such solar-wind hybrid windmills can generate power up to 1.2 KW, which will be utilized for common utilities of the housing society. This hybrid system can generate both wind and solar power. 

According to RMC, this windmills five meter tall have been installed on the terrace of one of the seven towers of Smart Ghar B Scheme. It has four batteries to store power for 24 hours. 

If the operational at 100 per cent capacity, the hybrid system will generate 10,000 units of electricity per month that can power at least 35 street lights of 40 watt each. 

RMC commissioner Udit Agrawal said “The green power will be used for common facilities like street light and water works. If it is successful we will install similar hybrid systems in other towers also.” 

Rajkot city engineer Alpna Mitra said, “Currently the power generated is off-grid and is stored using batteries. Gradually we plant to connect it to the power grid of PGVCL so that we can get rid of batteries and sell the extra electricity to discoms.”

RMC officials said that this arrangement will also ease the burden of society maintenance on the members."

76,2019-12-16,PowerGrid,"Largecap stocks will continue to outperform, the smallcap stocks will sparkle for a while and die out eventually, say Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Are we headed for a better 2020 with the fundamentals catching up or are we still in a grey area?I would be very sceptical about the economy getting much better. It might get much worse in the first two quarters before it gets better. Generally speaking, it is also off-season. You cannot expect the economy do very well. But if you are expecting a better 2020 for the stock market, overseas developments are going to be the most important factor. They are looking wonderfully well positioned with the China deal and enough liquidity. More importantly, the same theme continues and that is the disturbing part. The largecaps continue to outperform, the smallcaps sparkle for a while and then they die out eventually. So, nothing new is going to happen. 

Unfortunately 2020 is going to be the same old drudge. For the economy and fundamental to catch up, it depends on which company you are talking about. During the RBI credit policy, all the big influences from Mumbai were saying what about vegetables? Who cares? I heard the argument last night saying milk price hike? Who drinks milk in any case nowadays! We are all vegans in any case. So I think this dichotomy of haves and have not will continue to plague this economy and till the policy changes dramatically differently, you will see the same stock market results as you have seen in 2019, no different.


We have got the budget coming up. Any expectations that that could provide some answers or is it really beyond any announcements for now? Actually before the budget, the GST Council meeting is very important for two reasons. One, of course, is the more popular one that what happens with the states’ money; but more important is the move to raise the GST rate. That is going to be the biggest trigger for a selloff at least in the small and the midcaps. If that increase takes place, it is going to hurt the small and midcaps much more. 

I just told the investors what a lovely way to spend 2020! Do not exercise your brains, index is your best friend, largecaps is your friend. In fact, I am telling investors there would be lesser worry in 2020. 


Even within the largecaps, where do you see maximum potential for further returns? Do you feel things will remain steady because even within that pocket, some are starting to see a clear revival of interest? Let us talk about a deep cyclical. Even SBI is starting to see more of potential investment today as opposed to say a couple of quarters ago.Are you serious about the potential of PSU bank? This is an arbitrary stock, a gambling stock. They are nothing to do with fundamentals. Do you have an account with SBI? I do not. I do not know anybody with an account with SBI. Today is a day of great news for all nationalised banks. They are recovering a lot of money from ArcelorMittal. But, they will find enough reason to have another write off. They already have the Mudra loans coming in. They have the discom power loans coming through. 

If the numbers are correct, the finance minister said Rs 4- 5 lakh crore has been disbursed in the last two or three months to a small sector. It is not going to come back if it has been disbursed. I am not even sure if it has. Do not worry about it. Nationalised banks will sparkle. They will have a good day and then they will come back and give you enough reasons why they will have a write off. 

I am not sure there is a story there. I am sure there is enough space for day traders, weekly traders, monthly traders to go in and out of these stocks. They give you very good returns and they lose big money for you. But is there any investment case? You got to be serious. Nobody opens an account with a PSU bank anymore.


When we talk about private banks, what do you think is the scope of opportunity? Where do you see the valuations versus what are they trading at now?It does not matter because you are looking at a monopoly situation. Tell me how many countries are there where three or four banks and one or two NBFCs control 70% of the portfolio and the trade in the market. As the fear starts, you saw literally the doggedness of the Yes Bank financing situation. IDFC Bank has made losses all its life, maybe one quarter profit here or there. You saw RBL raising funds to cover up the losses, where IndusInd bank is.

So imagine a situation of a country the size of India, where you have a HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, now maybe ICICI Bank and Axis Bank -- four largest banks controlling most of the new initiatives in the market and maybe a Bajaj Finance or HDFC. Seven companies are controlling the NBFC space. The valuations will catch up. Do not worry about it. But, you are talking of a monopoly financial institution situation which is unprecedented in the world.

Tell me how many countries are there where three or four banks and one or two NBFCs control 70% of the portfolio and the trade in the market.-Ajay Srivastava

When it happens, as equity investors, you have to be smart to take benefit of it. I do not see any reason why you need to worry because in 2020, who is the competitor against these four or five banks? They have behaved very responsibly on pricing. They have been good boys in the market. Who is the competition you see for any of these banks? None exist. There is a clear path that investment should continue, additions should be made and there would be corrections there. You will never find a monopoly like this ever in the world.


What do you make of PFCs like Bajaj Finance, which says that the market share will only go up?Bajaj Finance is a little tricky because the valuation is really stratospheric. Over 10 time book values for an NBFC is difficult to fathom and if HDFC Bank’s finance companies start to come into place and if Kotak starts to come into play, this will get crowded. Plus, if all the issues of commercial vehicle financing and personal loan issues start to come into play, the stock will underperform the regular banks. I personally think that is too expensive, the market variables are not in the best frame of mind at this point of time. I would rather be on the side of the bank than be on the side of NBFCs at these valuations.

It has surprised everybody always. Every year, we say it is too expensive. I would hold myself to say yes it surprises everybody but for the time being, it is going to be tepid rather than rocketing share price.


We have for the first time started to see some positive commentary coming in some of those metal names or commodities. Would you keep those stocks on your radar to see if there is any potential for some of the names to turn around?I have a big holding in metals for some time now. I was not expecting a China deal but simply the dividends are phenomenal. There are only few four or five companies in metal that you can invest in. I am of the non-ferrous side. On the ferrous side, I have one or two investments. 

You cannot go wrong in that, given that the valuations below book value one really make money. Most are debt free with very good dividend track record. Some of them are PSUs which give some benefits and one of them is the largest private sector metal company which of course as a promoter needs the money at the end of the day. So, he gives large dividends as well. 

It is not only a capital play, it is also a dividend play. That is why I said buy these, keep these and relax because ultimately three-four years down the line, you will find that 40% of your cost has been covered by dividend and rest is all gravy train. I do not believe that there will be a big turnaround in the capital side. The prices will go up appreciably, but I believe that there is no way they can go down below these prices. Number two, the is dividend stream should continue.


If there is a cycle in some of the commodities that you are talking about, would you expect dividends to increase quite significantly?There has been a lull this year. Last year was boom time for most of the metal stocks and so large dividends came. This year perhaps, the current dividend has been a little lower and one of the companies, Vedanta, has still to declare the dividend. We do not know where it is going to come, but we know promoter compulsion will ensure dividend comes.

If the cycle turns and the cash flow becomes better, that is all the reason why dividend should increase. Even if it does not, there is enough spare capacity in terms of debt holding. The almost debt free nature ensures that shareholders get rewarded in any case -- because either it is a PSU or it is the private sector where the promoter needs the money. 

Both ways promoter or the company needs money at the end of the day. The dividend is coming in a little lower and if the cycle turns, then you are looking at mega dividends. It is pretty okay. The risk and return is pretty okay in the favour.


Within healthcare, what would you look at -- pharma plays, hospitals or diagnostics? I have a huge amount of healthcare stocks. I have pharma and hospitals. I do not have diagnostic anymore. We sold off diagnostic last week because we thought the valuations were peaking out to that extent. It was a more like a trading call long term. 

Of course, India needs all the diagnostic capabilities and the biggest signal is the price increase and the government sanction. From a fearful environment of price reduction, we are talking about government being pragmatic enough to hike prices. We have already seen that the MNC pharma companies have already shot up in advance. In the last six months, they have reached historic highs and so they have done well. 

Indian pharma companies are yet to turn around. You have mentioned some development on Sun Pharma but valuation wise, pharma is at the best level possible. There is huge global PE interest in the company. You can buy pharma companies. They have a lovely Indian franchise and if the government mood has changed now to allow price increases, we will be in a good place.

There are really two or three Hospitals you really have two or three companies we have gotten shares in all the companies. We are waiting for the deleveraging or the promoter to happen to real value to come into this place. Investor wise, it is a safe place to be but not a spectacular place. It is not going to excite you but it is going to keep you safe.


When you talk about Indian pharma franchises, do you mean something which has exposure to US or something which has more exposure only to India?More exposure to India. Glenmark, Sun Pharma or Cipla -- we have shares in all of them. You will find that the valuation of the pharma companies that do not have US business, is significantly higher. Now give me a good reason why a good quality pharma company supplying to the Indian market should not be at a good multiple close to consumer?

We are in a transition stage, where the US impact will start to slow out and people will start to understand that there is an Indian franchise built in these companies which are superior to consumer goods. It will take some time, but the discovery will see the share price get a very healthy return. It is not going to happen tomorrow, but it is already taking place. It will accelerate as time goes by and as GST rates are hikes, that will be game changer for this industry.


Would you want to play any infra capex story or you would want to stick to consumption or the banking names?I have a few infra stocks and strangely, these are the stocks which give very high dividend. Dividend yields are upwards of 5% to 8%. They have not given any capital return but they are giving a healthy return in spite of the odd downturn. We are a buyer there in terms of infrastructure stocks, but we have played a little differently. 

We started to buy the reach of say Indigrid the transmission company. We have gone REITS of real estate. Instead of buying companies, if you are buying REITS, you might be better off in the infrastructure space at least on the power side. 

You saw the problems of PowerGrid. That side of infrastructure is a little tricky at this point of time. We do not buy construction companies because we never know the profitability of those contracts in five, seven or 10 years contracts. The story is in REITS, it is not in the companies."

""The 5G trials will start in the last quarter of the current financial year,"" the official said. 

Another senior government functionary said that any proposal on 5G must address twin considerations - first adoption of new technology, and imperatives of national security. The official said that 5G should not be linked to general spectrum auctions - which is expected to take place in March-April next year. 

The technology for 5G is yet to evolve, and major global players are themselves in the process of evaluating the ecosystem and use cases for 5G. It has phenomenal potential of speed and futuristic applications, the official added. 

To another question on implication of the Supreme Court's adjusted gross revenue (AGR) verdict on non telecom companies, the official said that certain PSUs like DMRC, Powergrid and Railtel have given their representation to the telecom department, which is being examined. These PSUs have approached the government saying that additional statutory dues should not be levied on them."

85,2019-12-17,PowerGrid,"In times when markets trade at high valuations and it becomes difficult to gauge its direction, it makes sense to stay invested with balanced advantage or dynamic asset allocation schemes.

Depending upon the valuation of markets, balanced advantage schemes allocate 40-60% of their portfolios to equities and the remaining portion in arbitrage and debt products. This flexibility helps to a considerable extent to tide over the prevailing uncertainties in the markets, especially in the long term.

Among balanced advantage schemes, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund is the top performer in the past five-year and 10-year periods. It has given returns of 9.2% and 12% in the past five-year and 10-year periods, respectively, when its peers generated average returns of 8.9% and 9.7% over the same time periods. The scheme’s fund managers S Naren, Rajat Chandak, and Dharmesh Kakkad have constructed a balanced and well-diversified portfolio which includes a fair amount of well-placed large- and blue-chip companies and AAA-rated debt securities. Retail investors may consider adding this scheme to the portfolio with an investment horizon of at least five years as such schemes tend to do well only in the long term.

An excellent scheme that has performed over a long period. Ideal for conservative investors. They can invest lump sum. The flexibility in shifting investments from equity to debt and vice versa depending upon the attractiveness of each asset class suits retail investors. To a large extent, this flexibility helps protect the portfolio value better in a down market."

81,2019-12-17,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL) has asked the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to waive the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Rs 4,990 crore, said its chairman Pravin Kumar Purwar.

“The AGR impact on BSNL is minimal. We have asked the DoT to waive the amount payable,” Purwar told ET, adding that an equity infusion could also be considered.

BSNL has to pay a licence fee of Rs 2,099 crore and spectrum usage charge (SUC) of Rs 2,890 crore to the DoT, following the Supreme Court verdict in October asking mobile service providers as well as other entities having a telecom licence to pay dues on account of AGR calculated on overall business.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have the maximum liabilities of nearly Rs 53,000 crore and more than Rs 35,500 crore respectively, while newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm has the lowest liability of around Rs 60 crore.

On December 13, BSNL sent a letter to the telecom secretary, seeking a reprieve on account of AGR outgo, but the DoT has yet to take any decision. BSNL, the fourth-largest telecom operator in the country, posted a net loss of Rs 13,804 crore in 2018-19.

The top court has asked the companies to pay their dues within three months from the October 24 order. Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices have filed a review petition seeking waivers on interest and penalty as well as interest on penalty. Other state-owned firms such as DMRC, PowerGrid, Oil India and GAIL, which together owe more than Rs 2 lakh crore as AGR dues, as per the SC’s ruling, are also expected to file review petitions, arguing that they shouldn’t be liable for licence fees since telecom is not their core business."

80,2019-12-17,PowerGrid,"India’s weightage in the MSCI Emerging Market index is set to rise as the Finance Minister on Friday confirmed implementation of the Budget announcement of increasing the statutory foreign portfolio investment limit in a company from 24 per cent to sectoral foreign investment limit effective April next year, said Morgan Stanley.

“Using the current list of constituents, we expect MSCI India’s weight to rise by about 70 bps (basis points) in the semi-annual index review of May 2020, implying passive flows of US $2.5 bn (billion),” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said MSCI India’s weightage in MSCI EM will go up to 9.6 per cent from 8.9 per cent.

Companies have until March 31, 2020, to reduce the FPI limit through an approval of the board of directors and a special resolution passed by shareholders. Such companies will retain the option to increase the FPI limit to a maximum of the foreign sector limit at a later date.

“Once the FPI limit increases, it cannot be reduced. Thus, unless companies pass board and shareholder resolutions, all companies in India will irreversibly have their FPI limit at the sector limit after 31st March 2020,” said Morgan Stanley.

The foreign brokerage said India’s free float market capitalisation rank has been lower compared to its market cap and GDP rank because of high promoter holdings and low foreign investment limits which has constrained active and passive allocations to India from abroad.

Larsen & Toubro, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, Britannia, Tata Steel, Bharti Infratel, Titan, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra and Divi's Laboratories are among the stocks that are likely to see the most increase in weightage given the subsuming of foreign limits.

Among the public sector stocks in the MSCI India index, NTPC, Power Grid, HPCL, Petronet LNG, Container Corporation and REC could see an increase in weight.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Holdings, United Breweries, Power Finance Corporation, Biocon, Indraprastha Gas, ACC and MRF are the large-cap stocks in the BSE 200 index that could be included from the subsuming of the foreign limits."

98,2019-12-18,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Financials have emerged as India's biggest wealth creators over a period of 2014-2019 for the third consecutive year, led by private banks and NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), but sustaining this leadership may be difficult for the sector.

These are the findings of the annual wealth creation study published by Motilal Oswal Securities. Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director, has been publishing this study every year for the last 24 years.

""Sustaining its No. 1 position will be a challenge for the financial sector,"" the study added.

The report pointed out that in FY20, the financials sector witnessed a major crisis, triggered by the default of IL&FS, and several leading banks and NBFCs have seen a sharp rise in non-performing assets and provisions for the same.

""Overall, with Indian economy in a tailspin, the financials sector will find it challenging to lead wealth creation during the next study period -- FY15-20,"" the study said.

In terms of share of the wealth created, IT sector was the biggest loser over the last five years, while oil & gas sector was the biggest gainer.



During this five-year period, the top five sectors accounted for 85 per cent of the total wealth created.

PSUs' (public sector undertakings) wealth creation performance on the other hand was weak in the same period.

Only nine PSUs -- IOC, HPCL, BPCL, Power Grid Corporation, Petronet LNG, Indraprastha Gas, LIC Housing, Bharat Electronics and NBCC -- created wealth

""Privatisation is the only solution. It’s more than evident that the bureaucratic culture and lack of entrepreneurship in PSUs prevent them from effectively competing with their private sector counterparts,"" the study said."

The sentiment was further bolstered as China unveiled a new list of tariff exemptions for imports from the United States, days after the world’s two largest economies announced Phase one of the trade deal, a report said.

Earlier, the markets fluctuated between gains and losses in volatile trade as investors turned cautious after Donald Trump became the third President in US history to be impeached.

The House of Representatives formally charged Trump with abuse of power and obstructing the Congress, setting up a Senate trial next year that will decide whether the US President remains in office after three years.

Analysts said that trading volumes were low amid lack of fresh cues with year-end holidays around the corner.

They also said that market participants are waiting for fresh triggers on both domestic and global fronts for more clues. Any new developments around the US-China trade deal may also influence the market mood in the coming days.

Expert Take
“The bulls remained in charge despite sideways trading session. Market breadth was mildly positive. Overall midcaps and smallcaps have done quite well recently and are expected to continue to deliver going ahead. Metal sector is likely to remain in limelight. Nifty is headed for our target zone of 12,400-12,450. Immediate support is placed at 12,150 and traders should be positioned on the long side,” -- Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst, Indiabulls Ventures. 

Global marketsOn the global front, Asian shares pulled back from highs on Thursday as investors took some money off the table ahead of holiday trade and looked to fresh data on the state of the global economy.

102,2019-12-19,PowerGrid,"Tata Mutual Fund is betting on divestment in PSUs and corporate banks to generate alpha in equity mutual fund schemes. It is a matter of time before the government thinks how it can get the maximum cash out of select PSUs. The government is already moving towards privatisation of BPCL and there are talks about some other companies as well.

“A slowdown in growth and a shortfall in tax collections could trigger the next round of privatization. Given the high fiscal deficit the privatisation theme could come back,” says Rahul Singh, Chief Investment Officer (Equities), Tata Mutual Fund. He believes select PSU pockets make sense looking at the government’s intention to privatise and monetize assets. The fund house has added stocks like BPCL, HPCL, NTPC, Power Grid and BHEL in its large cap fund portfolio.

In addition to PSUs the fund house finds value in corporate banks and the trio of ICICI bank, SBI and Axis constitute 25% of its large cap fund."
99,2019-12-19,PowerGrid,"Private funding of infrastructure has surged to a record this year, with infrastructure trusts (InVTs) paving the way for long-term financing of bridges, roads or ports since banks are less keen to lend to these long-gestation and capital-intensive assets.

The likes of Reliance Industries, IRB Infrastructure, India Grid Trust and Oriental Infratrust have collectively raised Rs 53,291 crore this year, showed data compiled by Bajaj Consultants, a Mumbai-based firm engaged in InVT advisory. In 2018, companies raised an estimated Rs 1,500 crore via InVTs.

""Global institutional investors find merit in such asset-backed hybrid InVT instruments unlike individual investors, who will take time to understand the product,"" said Shivam Bajaj, director at Bajaj Consultants. ""The regulatory structure appeals to offshore investors looking for safety and yields in emerging market investments.""

Barring Power Grid Trust, all other deals have happened through private placements this year.

In 2017, when the instruments were introduced, about Rs 8,200 crore was raised.

Global investors, including Singapore sovereign fund GIC, Brookfield, KKR, and AIIB have invested as they were keen in private deals instead of public issuances.

“This is a product ensuring that global investors can hold commercial/beneficial interest in infrastructure projects,” said Arka Mookerjee, partner – equity capital market at J Sagar Associates. “This is also a more tax-efficient structure. A lot of local issuers are exploring this structure this year.”

Most of the InVTs are backed by road assets that earn attractive yields for investors.

InVTs yields on an average earn 12-15 percent internal rate of return (IRR), dealers said. Such levels look lucrative to international investors from developed economies when rupee-dollar exchange rates are stable.

About $17 trillion worth of papers are yielding negative returns worldwide in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America.

Many supranational or sovereign or pension fund investors, including Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Internal Finance Corporation (IFC), and the South Korean government fund, are said to be keen on infra projects.

The Bharat Mala Project (Ring Road Project), and the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Corridor are among the assets finding backers.

Government-owned entities too find it a way out to raise money through this alternative way, with Power Grid kick-starting its Rs 10, 000 crore InVT.

In July, Reliance Industrial Investments & Holdings, a wholly owned unit of Reliance Industries, entered into binding agreements with Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners, to invest in Tower Infrastructure Trust, which will own 100 percent of equity capital of Reliance Jio Infratel with 1,30,000 towers. The size of this InvT was at Rs 25,215 crore, this year’s largest.

Brookfield Asset Management-backed India Infrastructure Trust was the second largest at Rs 13,010 crore."

107,2019-12-20,PowerGrid,"Mumbai: Brokerages see high probability of moderate returns for the Indian equity market in 2020 amid stretched valuations, likelihood of economic slowdown continuing and limited room for fiscal stimulus by the government. BNP Paribas has an ‘overweight’ stance on the Sensex and expects the benchmark to reach 44,500 in 2020. Maybank Kim Eng is ‘neutral’ on the Indian stock market in 2020 with a base case Nifty target of 11,600. ICICI Securities has a December 2020 target of 13,100, saying that the sharp run-up in the market since August has reduced return expectations for 2020.



BNP Paribas

The firm has an overweight stance on Sensex and expects it to reach 44,500 in 2020. BNP expects further cuts in India’s GDP growth estimates as the consensus estimates do not seem to reflect the recent deceleration fully. The room for the government to do fiscal stimulus through increased spending or further tax cuts seems limited due to stretched fiscal position, said BNP Paribas. Private investments are unlikely to pick up anytime soon and asset quality pressure on financials does not appear to be behind yet, said BNP. The brokerage is overweight on India despite macro-economic headwinds because Indian equities are one of the rare compounders in Asian markets. Ease of stock selection and availability of diverse range of sectors to invest remain bright spots, said BNP.

Investment picks: Private banks, insurance, frontline IT companies and investing in undervalued rebounders.


Maybank Kim Eng Securities

The brokerage has neutral view on India for 2020 with base case Nifty target of 11,600. While macro outlook on India is clouded, the brokerage is bullish on private banks, telecom companies, cement, power and gas utilities, software and tractors. A more broad- based participation of stocks and sector rotation is a more likely trend in 2020, said Maybank Kim Eng. The brokerage’s bull case target for Nifty is 13,400 and bear case is 9,900. The government’s bold actions in the Budget in February 2020 may bring positive catalysts such as fiscal expansion to carry out capex and cut in personal income tax/GST, said Maybank.

Investment picks: ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, UltraTech, Mahanagar Gas, Dalmia Bharat, Mahindra, HCL Tech, Mphasis and Tech Mahindra. Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors are top sell recommendations.


ICICI Securities

The brokerage has a Nifty target of 13,100 by December 2020. Absolute returns for the Nifty in 2020 will be constrained by the sharp run-up in stocks during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019 which has stretched valuations, said ICICI. Skepticism towards risk assets could continue in 2020 as global central banks’ appetite for gold continues especially in an environment of negative rates in developed economies, said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has an overweight stance on financials, consumer discretionary and industrials.

Investment Picks: Bandhan Bank, IndusInd Bank, Cholamandalam Finance, LIC Housing, HDFC Life, SBI Life, Jubilant Food-Works, Westlife, Trent, Greenply Industries, Dabur, Balkrishna Industries, TVS Motor, L&T, Engineers India, Bharti Airtel, GGL, GSPL, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Tata steel, UltraTech, and Shree Cement.


Credit Suisse

The financial services company expects India’s economic slowdown to continue in 2020. Credit Suisse expects narrow market performance to continue for now as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the ‘safe’ stocks. “Till growth uncertainty continues (we expect for another six months), we expect this “quality bubble” to stay inflated and market concentration to remain high,” said Credit Suisse. Equity flows have settled at higher-than-historical average levels and foreign flows should continue to support the market, it said.

Investment picks: SBI, ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life among financials, Bharti Airtel in telecom, Power Grid among utilities and Tata Steel among metals. The brokerage has a minor overweight on pharma and IT."

112,2019-12-22,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications has sought Rs 1.72 lakh crore in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's ruling on revenues that need to be taken into consideration for payment of government dues. Sources with direct knowledge of the development said DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking Rs 1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence. 

 In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government. 

 The firm told DoT that it had obtained ISP licence in 2002 for a period of 15 years, which expired in 2017. But GAIL never did any business under the licence and since no revenue was generated it cannot pay any amount. 

 On IP-1 and IP-2 licences, GAIL has told DoT that it generated Rs 35 crore of revenue since 2001-02 and not Rs 2,49,788 crore that has been considered for levying past dues, they said. 

 Sources said the dues being sought are more than three times the networth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned. 

 The Supreme Court had on October 24 ruled that non-telecom revenues earned by firms using spectrum or airwaves allocated by the government will be considered for calculating statutory dues. 

 While telcos such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea may have had non-telecom revenues generated from using the government licence and spectrum, firms such as GAIL had no such revenue. 

 DoT is seeking Rs 1.47 lakh crore from all telcos in past statutory dues. 

 Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking Rs 1.25 lakh crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence. 

 PowerGrid says it has an adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of Rs 3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to Rs 22,168 crore. 

 Infrastructure provider category- I (IP-I) are those infrastructure providers who provide assets such as dark fibre, right of way, duct space and towers to the licensees of telecom services. 

 GAIL has a vast network of gas pipelines and it laid optic fibre along it to provide bandwidth to third parties.

119,2019-12-24,PowerGrid,"By Andy Mukherjee
Thirty years ago, India endured its last big financial crisis when it had to send gold held in the central bank’s vaults over to London to borrow hard currency from the Bank of England. Luckily, the flights landed safely, and so did India.
The turnaround in economic thinking triggered by that balance-of-payments humiliation saw the state shed controls on production and imports. The emergence of a globally attuned software services industry as well as vibrant capital markets — which India opened up to the world faster than China — helped spawn entrepreneurship and create a middle class. Hundreds of millions were lifted out of poverty; the 1990-91 crisis became the starting point of two decades of rising prosperity.

All that progress is now at risk because of a very different failure. Growth is crashing. Jobs have gotten scarce. Investments have cratered. Profits have vanished. Tax collections are low; government deficits high. Debt has surged, but there isn’t enough loss-absorbing cushion either on corporate balance sheets or with financial intermediaries to allow orderly deleveraging. India isn’t in the midst of an external crisis. It’s grappling with a vicious internal cycle of defaults.



More crucially, what’s missing is the national determination of the 1991 reforms. Economist Manmohan Singh, then a newly appointed finance minister who later became premier, invoked Victor Hugo in his budget speech: “No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come… the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea.”

Unlike Singh, current Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a career politician who won a resounding popular mandate in 2019 for a second five-year term. There’s no dearth of slogans and goals — such as a $5 trillion economy by 2024 from under $3 trillion now. Yet except for a recent move to make India a low-tax enclave for manufacturing units fleeing the U.S.-China trade war, there isn’t much of a plan in place. It’s not even clear if a search for enduring solutions will get under way in 2020, or if the economy will just muddle through.

Today’s problems result from past successes. In a withering critique of what he calls a “finance-construction growth model,” Princeton University economist Ashoka Mody has rightly blamed India for ignoring labor-intensive manufacturing. The country has shortchanged its blue-collar workers, especially women, whose participation rate in the workforce has swooned. A nation of 1.3 billion people is producing only what 150 million affluent customers want.

With rampant automation everywhere, a bulging low-cost labor force isn’t the advantage it once was. Even in software exports, cloud computing and digital technologies have diminished the value of work done by Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. engineers in maintaining bulky enterprise software for global corporations. Can India in the 2020s try to reinvent its finance-construction model so that it works for everyone and not just for a few thousand financiers in Mumbai? Here are some ideas.

*First, India must reinvent infrastructure financing. The sudden collapse of highly rated infrastructure operator-financier-owner IL&FS Group in September 2018 was the last straw. The nation was already reeling under a disastrous 2016 ban on 86% of the currency in circulation. Modi’s demonetization failed in its goal of freezing out ill-gotten wealth: It depressed consumption and pauperized farmers and tiny businesses instead. Then came a botched-up goods and services tax in 2017. After IL&FS went under, the economy gave up. 



*IL&FS was a monster. To ensure a cash-strapped government never again allows another cabal to exploit India’s hunger for roads, power plants and sewage disposal units for private riches, the country should adopt the Australian model of asset recycling. This means privatizing existing infrastructure, including power grids, government land, roads and commercial real estate, with an explicit promise to use the proceeds to build new public assets. That will make privatization politically palatable. 

*Tap long-term money. Rather than being stuck with defaulted bonds of IL&FS, India’s Employee Provident Fund should be owning revenue-generating domestic hard assets alongside the likes of AustralianSuper Pty and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and India’s own fledgling National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd.

*Having enough public funds to invest means being able to employ the private sector as contractors. Partnerships, in which the private sector shares the risk of building new assets, don’t have a great track record in India. They lead to inflated costs, corruption, and disputes. As a high court judge noted about an IL&FS-backed water supply project: “Water started flowing (or trickling down) to the common users, both industrial and domestic, in May 2005. What flowed thereafter appears to be only litigation.”

A new model for infrastructure, supported by more flexibility to companies when it comes to acquiring land or engaging labor, would give India a shot at large-scale manufacturing — for domestic markets as well as exports. 



However, there’s a shortage of income and savings. Channeling meager resources to productive activity via deposit-taking banks may have been the only way after India disbanded its development finance institutions. That didn’t work well, as is clear from the $200 billion-plus pile of dud corporate loans on banks’ books. Nor did switching credit delivery to nonbanks — which rely on wholesale funding — produce desired results. Shadow financiers gave too many loans to developers for homes that never got built. Capital markets became casinos where brokers lure day-traders with additional leverage on already-leveraged derivative products.

Not many of India’s one dozen state-run banks will survive. Technology will render their deposit-taking privilege obsolete over the coming decade. A lender’s expertise will lie in using big data to find customers with stable cash flows, originating credit against those cash flows, and selling to investors. This is the model that shadow financiers, caught napping making loans for long-term assets using short-term borrowings, are gravitating toward. India should give them a nudge. 

The part of India’s finance-construction growth that survives will be worth saving. It may be no less important to the country’s future than the software firms of the 1990s that had honed their skills on domestic projects like computerization of railway tickets. They hit the global scene once the Y2K millennium-change scare stoked demand. 

Coming out of the current crisis is priority. But without trying to pick winners, India should also be getting its financial industry ready for the opportunities the 2020s may have in store."

123,2019-12-26,PowerGrid,"People are looking at green shoots of recovery and agricultural produce as main triggers for the markets. Says Nischal Maheshwari, CEO- Institutional Equities, Centrum Broking. Excepts from an interview with ETNOW.


It is a flat market but what do you reckon are going to be the key triggers that would move the markets in 2020?There are two or three things. The most important thing would be that people would be looking out for the first signs of recovery and that is really important. Most of the people are looking out for green shoots. 

The second important thing is about the agri produce. The Kharif crop has been good and sources on the ground say that the sowing has been good for the winter crop (Ravi crop). This is one of the most important triggers. 

Third obviously is going to be the Budget. But I for one, do not have much expectation from the Budget. So, first two things is what people are really going to focus on.


People have been waiting for the entire disinvestment programme to unfold with regards to BPCL and some of the other PSU. Are you still keeping them on your radar? What is your reaction to the news that the disinvestment may have got deferred?Our view always was that March 31 deadline was a very aggressive timeline for the divestment of such a large company to be achieved. We are not very disappointed because we always knew and this is going to be a tough sell -- both Air India and BPCL. Yes market would be disappointed because the divestment target was largely dependent on that. Otherwise, it is still a long way off.


The government is still committed to the divestment agenda, it is just being pushed back. How much room does the government have for announcing any major steps this time?I do not think the market is expecting that there is going to be rate cuts, personal tax cuts in the Budget. There is no room at all. So, whether it is GST collection or divestment, the two revenue sources seem to be adding up. I do not see more sops coming in the Budget.


Do you believe there would be much excitement for the Reliance stock in anticipation of Reliance Retail listing?The bifurcation of these three companies into separate units will definitely unlock Reliance’s value. There is no doubt about it. But we have to get more details of this valuation which is being talked about. You cannot be talking about double the valuation of D-Mart because D-Mart’s margins are almost double that of Reliance on the EBITDA levels. It is a much more profitable business and D-Mart itself according to me is hugely overvalued. We have to be cognisant of that fact also. So excitement is there but when the real number comes, I do not think this kind of valuation will sustain.


We have seen the asset quality improve after a long gap of seven years. It seems to be one of the key takeaways from the RBI report. How are you viewing the fact that the gross NPAs have improved to about 9.1% versus 11.2% last year?There are two things to it. One is obviously in the last two years. we have seen corporate growth. The overall pie of the asset is growing and as a percentage, it keeps on coming down. The second thing is we are not seeing anything incremental. The major ones have already been accounted for in the last six to nine months. Incrementally, I see these numbers keep on coming down. The major beneficiaries should be PSUs which have been punished quite a bit. On the other hand, private sector corporate banks have already run up quite a bit. So PSUs should be the major beneficiaries out of this.


Do you think this is the right time to get into power and utilities plays? Do you expect a rebound across some of these beaten down names? If so, what are your preferred bets within the pack?We have liked utilities and in a falling rate environment, utilities tend to outperform because they have got a fixed rate of return. NTPC, Power Grid have been our top two picks in that category. I am still not in favour of power manufacturers, equipment manufacturers -- be it BHEL or anybody else, because we still do not see visibility as far as order book is concerned for most of them. 

At the moment, one should restrict to the utilities. Other than NTPC and Power Grid, the third one that has played out well and has been our top pick for the whole year is the gas sector. It will continue to do well going ahead also. Restrict yourself to the utilities rather than going into the manufacturing side."

138,2019-12-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Owing to firm cues from global peers and strong foreign fund inflows, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended 1 per cent higher on Friday to snap their three-day losing streak. Reliance Industries and banking stocks were at the forefront of the rally.

The market breadth leaned in favour of buyers. The BSE advance-decline ratio stood at 3:2, indicating for every five stocks that traded, three rose.

Investor optimism was boosted by hopes that the US and China would soon sign Phase one of trade deal. This pushed Asian markets higher while the European markets opened at a record.

Meanwhile, inflows from foreign institutional investors (FII) is another reason that's driving indices. FIIs have poured net Rs 6,170 crore in Indian equities so far this month.

Market at a glance

Expert Take
“The bull clawed back strongly after profit booking witnessed in the earlier session. Market breadth was healthy as midcaps and smallcaps continued to perform well. All sectoral indices were in the green. Nifty continues to remain in a strong uptrend and we maintain our target of 12,400-12,450. The near term support is placed at 12,100 and dips should be utilised to build long positions,” -- Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst with Indiabulls Ventures."
137,2019-12-27,PowerGrid,"NEW DELHI: Positive developments on the US-China trade deal front and fund infusion in some PSU banks by the government boosted sentiment on Dalal Street on Friday. Stocks benchmarks Sensex and Nifty were on track to snap three-day losing run.

BSE benchmark Sensex was trading 411 points or 1.00 per cent higher at 41,575 while NSE barometer Nifty was at 12,249, up 122 points or 1.01 per cent around 3.15 pm.

Nifty PSU bank was the biggest sectoral gainer on NSE, up 2.57 per cent. All but two constituents of the index were trading in the green. The biggest gainer was Indian Overseas Bank that added 6.19 per cent to Rs 12.


Here are four factors driving the rally:

US-China trade dealPositive comments from the US and Chinese camps about the trade deal encouraged traders to move towards riskier assets.

China's Commerce Ministry said on Thursday that Beijing and Washington were still in the process of completing necessary procedures while maintaining close communication to sign the deal.

US President Donald Trump had said earlier said he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will have a signing ceremony to sign the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal agreed to this month.


PSU Banks to get further boost?Shares of PSU banks surged ahead of a key meeting between Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and bank chiefs on Saturday. The meeting, which comes a month ahead of Union Budget, is also expected to take up discussion on non-performing asset recovery through both NCLT and non-NCLT means apart from a review of financial performance of the lenders and their business growth.

Moreover, three banks announced capital infusion from the government -- Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank, and Indian Overseas Bank.


FII inflowsForeign institutional investors (FII) have been bullish on Indian markets in December. This has supported domestic indices, pushing them to new highs. FIIs have poured net Rs 6,170 crore in Indian equities so far this month. This follows Rs 25,231 crore inflows in November. In 2019, the foreign have pumped in nearly Rs 1 lakh crore into domestic stocks.


Global cuesIndian markets took positives from their global peers as most major markets across the world gained on Friday. Asian shares scaled an 18-month high. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 0.7 per cent to 555.42, a level not seen since mid-2018. It is up more than 16 per cent so far this year. Japan's Nikkei was off 0.4 per cent, but on track for a near 19 per cent rise this year, matching the annual increase of 2017.

Australia's benchmark index rose 0.4 per cent. Chinese shares gave up early gains with the blue-chip CSI300 down 0.1 per cent. In early European trade, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures added 0.4 per cent, German DAX futures rose 0.6 per cent while FTSE futures were up 0.5 per cent.

In the overnight trade, the US market hit record highs. The Nasdaq crossed the 9,000-point mark for the first time on Thursday. In an indication of a positive start on Wall Street, the S&P 500 e-mini futures gained 0.12 per cent on Friday.


Technical factorTechnical indicators point that some strength and stability should be expected in the market if the index manages to sustain above 12,222 on closing basis, according to Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

“However, in such a scenario in the next couple of sessions, it can retest recent swing highs of 12,293 where as in best case if the same strength prevails next week also then Nifty may head towards 12,350,” Mohammad said.

He added that on the downside it is imperative for the index to sustain above 12,157 as breach of this shall only negate today’s optimism but can also threaten the recent low of 12,118."

139,2019-12-28,PowerGrid,"MUMBAI: Indian stock indices snapped their three-session losing streak on Friday to end at a gain of 1% as global markets rose and investors bought into banking, energy and auto stocks on hopes of a turnaround and relief measures from the government.

The BSE Sensex rose 411 points, or 1%, to close at 41,575.14 and the NSE Nifty was up about 119 points, or 1%, to close at 12,245.80. Axis Bank emerged as the top Sensex gainer with a 3% gain followed by Power Grid Corporation of India, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries with gains of 1.7-2.3%. Foreign portfolio investors purchased local shares worth Rs 81.4 crore on Friday while domestic institutional investors bought local shares worth nearly Rs 126 crore.

The PSU Bank index led the rally with a 3% gain. State-owned lenders surged ahead of a meeting between the Finance Minister and chiefs of public sector banks on Saturday with the market expecting some announcement regarding new measures to revive lending and boost credit flow to non-bank lenders. Investors also expect public sector lenders to gain from lower yields on government bonds after the RBI on Thursday announced the second tranche of ‘Operation Twist’ worth ?10,000 crore.



 Whether the gains in the market sustain will depend on expectations surrounding the union budget on February 1.

“We are not expecting major buying ahead of the budget and see the Nifty trading in the 12,000-12,300 range,” said Shiv Diwan, co-head, Edelweiss Institutional Equities. “The market is already a tad expensive and measures to boost growth are needed for the broader market to pick up,” said Diwan.

MSCI India is trading at 21.8 times one-year forward earnings while the MSCI Emerging Market index is at14.6 times. Indian markets have gained 1.6-1.9% so far in December after the US-China trade tensions eased and UK’s pro-Brexit conservative party won the elections. The two events have helped sentiment and flows into emerging markets, including India, where local news flow on the economy have been weak. So far this year, FPIs have pumped in money in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore — the highest annual inflow since 2013.

The union budget will be the key focus in the first few weeks of the year besides the US Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. On the budget front, whether the government eases fiscal deficit target will be closely watched and whether it announces a cut in personal income tax rates.

“The government seems to have exhausted pretty much every weapon it had from an economic and social perspective. In light of the successive state election defeats, it seems only logical that the much talked about relief of personal income tax could become a reality in Budget 2020,"" said Rahul Arora, CEO, institutional equities, Nirmal Bang.

“Anything consumption driven, retail private sector banks, consumer staples, durables, electricals and auto stocks could do very well in the run-up to and just post the budget. It would not surprise me to see the Nifty at 13,000 just before or just after the budget and that could be a multi-year top for the market,” said Arora.

Rohit Srivastava, founder, Indiacharts.com, expects the Nifty to touch 12,600 in the weeks ahead of the budget. “The market trend is looking bullish as the index is forming higher top-higher bottom trending pattern on charts, which suggests the bullish sentiment should continue for a while,” said Srivastava."
140,2019-12-29,PowerGrid,"After sending out notices to firms such as gas utility GAIL for crores of rupees in past dues, the Department of Telecommunications has said that any relief to non-telecom companies from payment of enhanced levies can come only from the Supreme Court.

The Telecom Department is current ""examining"" the replies given by the state-owned non-telecom corporations on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, a senior official said.

""They have sent their replies, which we are examining. We believe that they will have to go to Supreme Court to seek notification or clarification on whether they are included or not included in this (Supreme Court order). That is for them to seek,"" the Telecom Department official told PTI.

There are certain cases where players were parties in the court and in those cases the companies are bound by the court order. Some parties have also filed review petition, the official noted.

""Then there were others who were not parties, they will have to take a call because our assessment is that it will be applicable...we are examining the issue but in our assessment they will probably have to go to SC to seek a clarification,"" the official added.

As it is, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies owe the government nearly Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past statutory dues. These AGR liabilities arose after the Supreme Court in October this year upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses for calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fees to the exchequer.

The apex court allowed three months to the affected companies to cough up the amounts due to the government.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has meanwhile made it clear that the AGR order will apply to all licencees, including companies such as GAIL, RailTel, and Power Grid.

As things stand today, such players, despite a smaller telecom exposure, may have to pay liabilities computed on their entire revenue.

Non-telcos, such as internet service providers (ISPs), had argued that DoT has unnecessarily imposed the order on internet service providers, many of which are run by entrepreneurs in smaller cities and towns. It had also sought intervention of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to resolve this issue.

The DoT has sought Rs 1.72 lakh crore in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's AGR ruling.

DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking Rs 1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence. In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.

Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking Rs 1.25 lakh crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence. PowerGrid says it has an AGR of Rs 3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to Rs 22,168 crore."
141,2019-12-29,PowerGrid,"PANAJI: The Centre can explore the possibility of installing hydro-power generating plants in Mahadayi basin of Goa region if feasible sites are identified, Union Power Minister R K Singh has said.

Goa is also looking into the possibility of installing hydro-power plants at two of its prominent dams, according to state Power Minister Nilesh Cabral.

Singh met Cabral at the Power Grid Corporation's facility at Colvale village, located about 20 km from here, on Saturday.

After the meeting, Singh said if Goa identifies some sites for hydro-electricity projects in the Mahadayi basin, then the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) would look into its feasibility.

""If you (Goa) indicate some sites to us, I will ask the NHPC to come and investigate the sites, and if it is feasible, then we will set up hydro-power plants,"" he said.

The Mahadayi river, which originates in Karnataka, meets the Arabian Sea at Miramar near Panaji.

Both the states are locked in a dispute over sharing the Mahadayi river water.

Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant recently announced construction of six dams over the Mahadayi river basin falling under the state's jurisdiction.

Cabral said the possibility of setting up hydro-power plants at the existing Selaulim (in South Goa district) and Anjunem (North Goa district) dams was also being explored.

""We have dams at Selaulim and Anjunem, both have in- built tunnels. Earlier, it was not feasible to generate power there. But with the different structuring (technology), as the minister (Singh) has explained to us, we have asked for their say on these two plants, whether power can be generated,"" Cabral said.

Goa does not have its own power generating plant and is dependent on other states for the supply."

The Centre aims to reduce electricity transmission and distribution losses in the country to 15 per cent in next two years, Singh said here on Saturday. 

He met Goa Power Minister Nilesh Cabral at the Power Grid Corporation's facility at Colvale, located about 20 km from here. 

After the meeting, Singh said, ""The total loss of all power distribution companies in the financial year 2018-19 was Rs 27,000 crore. That is huge. Because of the losses, the discoms are under stress."" 

He noted that the discoms were facing issues related to purchase of power, maintenance and others. 

""I have to help the discoms of all states to make them viable by reducing their losses,"" he said. 

Listing the targets for 2020, Singh said in some states the transmission and distribution losses were very high. In addition, there were also commercial losses, related to metering, billing and bill collection. 

""Overall, last year the aggregate transmission and distribution loss for the entire country was 18.5 per cent. We want to bring it down to 15 per cent in next two years,"" the minister said. 

Talking about achievements of the NDA government, Singh said the power sector has a undergone huge transition. 

""Before our government came to power, we had a power deficit. We did not generate enough power for our requirements before 2014. There used to be load-sheddings. We have made the country surplus in power generation,"" he said. 

Singh said India was now exporting power to Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. 

""Now, the whole country is unified into one grid...we can generate power in Kashmir and supply to Kanyakumari,"" he added."
