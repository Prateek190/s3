2,2018-01-12,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity markets are likely to see a positive start on Friday, tracking Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX Nifty) and global cues. 
Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 40 points, or 0.37 per cent, higher at 10,397, indicating a positive start for the Nifty50 in India. 
Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session:


TCS: India’s largest software exporter reported a net profit of $1.01 billion on revenue of $4.78 billion for the quarter ended December. In rupee terms, it reported a profit of Rs 6,531 crore on revenue of Rs 30,904 crore.


Infosys: The second largest IT major will announce its quarterly numbers today. Brokerage firm KR Choksey Shares and Securities believes that Infosys may report a growth of 1.4 per cent in dollar revenues for Q3 FY18 with a cross currency tailwind of 14 bps. It said that Infosys' muted growth will be on account of seasonal weakness and poor show at BFSI and retail segments. The numbers will be out around 3.45 pm. 


Gujarat NRE Coke: The National Company Law Tribunal’s Kolkata chapter has ordered liquidation of Gujarat NRE Coke, a company that failed to resolve the Rs 4,900-crore default case. But, there is twist. For the first time under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the dedicated bankruptcy court has mandated to liquidate a company as an “ongoing concern”, which is aimed at protecting about 10,000 jobs.


Karnataka Bank, GAIL: Sintex, GAIL, Karnataka Bank and RIIL are among a dozen companies which will report their quarterly earnings today. 


Capital First:  Capital First said that it explores various opportunities on a continuous basis amid market talk that the Mumbai-based non-banking finance company could be considering a merger with IDFC Bank, which is up for sale.


Reliance Industries: A media report suggested that Reliance Industries' telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm is planning to create its own cyptocurrency, JioCoin.


Adani Enterprises: Billionaire Gautam Adani is the latest to jump into the affordable mortgage lending business, with Adani Enterprises, the holding company of the Adani Group, looking to set up a housing finance company that will offer home loans through realty developers and will also lend directly to retail customers.

Bharati Defence: Lenders to Bharati Defence and Infrastructure have asked interested parties to provide a resolution plan for the company which is facing insolvency proceedings at a bankruptcy court. The company faces claims in the range of Rs 8,500 crore from financial and operational creditors.


Amtek Auto: The UK-based metals group Liberty House and Deccan Value Investors, a US-registered hedge fund have emerged as top contenders for auto component maker Amtek Auto which is in bankruptcy courts awaiting resolution, said two senior officials familiar.


Tata Motors:
HSBC has maintained ‘buy’ rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 500. Tata Motors’ domestic/traditional India business is on the path of recovery and has the potential to make a difference to the stock price in the coming years, said HSBC. 


Pidilite Industries:
 CLSA has retained ‘sell’ rating on Pidilite Industries with a target price of Rs 870. Pidilite remains one of the best franchises in the building materials space but we believe valuations at 40 times FY20 earnings basis leave little room for upside, particularly given a 13 per cent earnings CAGR over FY18-FY20 period. 


Telecom stocks: The telecom regulator may reduce international termination rate (ITR) — a charge paid by international operators to local networks that receive calls — by almost half from the current 53 paise a minute, a move that would deal a body blow to India’s top telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular which receive bulk of international calls. “ITR could be 25-30 paise a minute,” said a person aware of developments, asking not to be named. “It may be announced very soon.


Varun Beverages: has concluded the acquisition of PepsiCo India's previously franchised rights for the state of Chhattisgarh.

Shree Cement: Board of Shree Cement at its meeting has approved the acquisition of majority equity stake in Union Cement Company, UAE. The Company has also signed the Definitive Agreement in this regard with the sellers.


Indiabulls Real Estate: The company through its wholly-owned subsidiary Yashita Buildcon has entered into a binding and definitive agreement to acquire a prime and newly constructed commercial building, having leasable area of approx 2.5 lac sq ft in Gurugram.


Texmaco Rail & Engineering: The company has incorporated a subsidiary namely, Texmaco Defence Systems."
3,2018-01-15,Shree Cement,"ET Intelligence Group: One of India’s low-cost cement producers Shree Cement’s acquisition of the UAE-based United Cement Company (UCC) is a right step in its comprehensive expansion strategy without stretching its balance sheet. Besides several operational advantages, the acquisition is expected to boost the company’s earnings per share (EPS) by 5-7 per cent in the very first year.

UCC, operating in the UAE region for the past 46 years, has a clinker capacity of 3.3 MT and a grinding capacity of 4 MT. It is estimated that the installed cement capacity of the UAE is close to 41 MT. It means that over 10 per cent of the UAE’s capacity is with UCC. And if one adds the clinker capacity, the share of UCC may exceed 15 per cent of the UAE’s total installed cement capacity.

Long legacy and reasonably good share of the UAE’s cement industry add to stable earnings’ prospects for Shree Cement. Also, analysts point out that UCC has operating profit margin in the range of 22-23 per cent in the past four years, which is quite encouraging in a region of the size of the UAE. UCC’s plants are close to Ras Al-Khaimah’s port through which it serves cement demand in the Gulf, the Middle East and East Africa regions. Cement demand in these regions is fairly stable.



As regards the valuation of the deal, the company would be paying $305.24 million (Rs 1,940 crore). This amount would be paid through internal accruals.

At the end of FY17, Shree Cement had liquid investments amounting to Rs 3,390 crore. The acquisition has taken place at an Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA of 8.8 and its replacement cost (EV/tonne) of $76.

According to analysts’ estimates, listed cement companies — Fujairah Cement Industries and Gulf Cement Company — in the United Arab Emirates are trading close to EV/EBITDA of 8.6 (trailing). This means the acquisition is not that expensive.

This acquisition of the company shows that Shree Cements is cautiously on the right path of achieving its target of total capacity of 40 MT by FY20 from 29.3 MT at present. This expansion would materialise without much leveraging the balance sheet given its strong cash flows, internal accruals and cost efficiency. The expansion is also timely as the industry is yet to enter a peak demand cycle.

On the valuation front, Shree Cement’s enterprise value (EV) was 19.4 times its FY19 projected EBITDA. Though this looks a bit expensive, this premium is justified given its strong earnings’ growth, almost pan-India geographical presence and light balance sheet.

In the December 2017 quarter, the company’s net sales grew close to 20 per cent to Rs 2,236.2 crore on a year on year comparison. Due to high power and fuel costs and tax, the company’s net profit grew by 7.3 per cent to Rs 252 crore in the quarter on a year on year comparison.

The company’s sales volumes increased by 8.3 per cent in the December quarter in comparison with the last year’s December quarter. Its realisation in selling per tonne of cement improved by 8.4 per cent to Rs 4,007."

1,2018-02-01,Shree Cement,"Cement companies are expected to see superior volume growth given the government's focus on housing for all, smart cities (99 already identified) and building toilets under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

 It is expected cement companies may clock 7-8% of volume growth by the third quarter of the next fiscal from close to 6% volume growth at present. Cement companies which have expanded--whether organically or inorganically, this Budget should serve as turn of demand cycle. It must be noted that 60-65% of cement demand comes from housing segment and hence the aforementioned initiatives are expected to create cement demand of over 5.5 million metric tonnes.

This should boost revenues of cement companies which have pan-India presence and balance sheet strength. These companies are Ultratech Cement, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat, The Ramco Cements."
3,2018-02-16,Shree Cement,"MUMBAI: UltraTech Cement, India’s largest manufacturer of the primary building material, believes that acquiring debt-laden Binani Cement in the ongoing spell of industry consolidation would not breach the monopoly watchdog’s threshold norms on market dominance.

“There is no concern of coming under the scanner of the Competition Commission of India,” Atul Daga, chief financial officer of UltraTech Cement, told ET. Daga said that in Rajasthan, where Binani’s India operations are based, Shree Cement is the largest player with a capacity of 19 MT. Ultra-Tech's installed capacity in the state is 8 MT. In this scenario, even after the possible acquisition of Binani's 6 MT plant in Rajasthan, UltraTech's combined capacity of 14 MT will still be lower than that of the market leader.

India is the world’s second-largest cement market after China, and is also the second-biggest producer of the commodity that is the world’s least priced manufactured item. High freight costs and concentrated limestone mining locations have made cement a highly regionalised business in India, with market dominance determined and assessed on the basis of regional boundaries.

India’s capital-intensive cement industry, where growth is typically correlated with the broader rate of economic expansion by a factor of about 1.2, is in its second major spell of consolidation in the past decade and a half. At the vanguard of the list of buyers in this round of consolidation are Nuvoco, UltraTech, and the Dalmia Bharat group.

The bid deadline for Binani Cement ended on February 12. Along with UltraTech, others who have bid are JSW Cement, a consortium of Dalmia Bharat and Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakishan Damani, Heidelberg and True North-Ramco. Ultra-Tech’s Daga also added that with a total of 17 cement players operating in Rajasthan and Gujarat, there is enough competition in the two markets, preventing monopolies.

In its previous decisions, CCI has looked at a minimum of two states and a maximum of six states that are associated with the plant state in terms of inflow and outflow of cement to decide the relevant market for the acquirer."
4,2018-02-19,Shree Cement,"MUMBAI: A Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund consortium leads bids for debt-laden cement maker Binani Cement, exceeding Aditya Birla-led UltraTech Cement’s offer by a few hundred crore rupees, said several people aware of the matter.

The consortium has offered to pay more than Rs 6,300 crore for Binani, while UltraTech Cement came a close second with its bid of Rs 6,100 crore, they said. The Dalmia-Bain Piramal offer is a combination of cash and equity with the latter forming a small portion of the total value. However, UltraTech Cement would score higher in the technical and management qualification, experts said.

On the other hand, lenders’ concerns regarding the Competition Commission of India (CCI) potentially red-flagging concentration of UltraTech’s market share in the Gujarat market could play a role in deciding the winning bid, they said.

To be sure, UltraTech CFO Atul Daga told ET last week its bid for Binani doesn’t face any competition scrutiny risk as its market share in the Rajasthan market is well within limits with Shree Cement being the bigger player there. Still, with the company having more than 30% of the Gujarat market, getting CCI clearance could take between 70 days and five months, a delay that won’t suit lenders. They want the resolution to take place before March 31, said one of the persons. UltraTech declined to comment.




The other entities didn’t respond to ET queries. Six entities were vying for the asset, including an alliance of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakishan Damani; Heidelberg; JSW Cement and True North-Ramco. That made for an aggressive contest for one of the companies referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) last year for insolvency resolution. The fact that the offer values are more than the debt value ensuring the banks have to take minimum haircut implies bidders are highly keen on the asset. 

The 6.25 million tonne Binani Cement has a presence in Rajasthan, a location that will give Dalmia entry into the northern and western markets. It currently has a strong presence in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in the south. Another aspect that makes the cement company attractive is its limestone reserves of 378 million tonnes, a key raw material in cement manufacturing. Dalmia Bharat has a capacity of 9 MTPA.

This was also one of the assets that underwent a second round of bidding after lenders’ estimate of its liabilities changed. In the first round, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Cement had emerged as the highest bidder with an offer of Rs 5,900 crore. The bid deadline for the asset ended on February 12 and a decision by the committee of creditors (CoC) is likely to be made in a few weeks.

Binani owes about Rs 3,884 crore to lenders, which includes loans acquired by Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. from banks and dues to State Bank of India, 
Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda."
6,2018-02-22,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity market failed to maintain winning momentum on Thursday as Fed's hawkish stance and RBI's concerns over rising inflation weighed on investor sentiment.

The domestic market also took cues from the US stocks, which again ended lower on Wednesday amid rising treasury yields.

The Sensex ended 25 points down at 33,819.50 with Sun Pharma (up 3 per cent) being the top gainer and Dr Reddy's (down 2 per cent) the worst laggard. Nifty50 lost 15 points or 0.14 per cent to 10,382.70, with 34 components in the red and 16 in the green.

PSBs slip, private peers gain
Shares of public sector banks once again slipped in trade, which saw Nifty PSU Bank index ending 0.50 per cent lower at 3,155. Out of 12 constituents, 10 declined, while two ended in the green. Shares of Punjab National Bank once again emerged as the top loser with a fall of 2.77 per cent. Indian Bank (down 2.59 per cent) and Union Bank of India (down 2.42 per cent) were next in the queue. Nifty Private Bank index ended 0.23 per cent up at 14,072.80, which helped the headline Nifty Bank pack end in the green at 24,955.20 with a gain of 0.07 per cent.




Goldman cuts price targets for PSBs
Foreign brokerage Goldman Sachs cut its earnings forecasts and price targets for three state-run lenders -- State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank -- after the Rs 11,400 crore PNB scam came to light. “Potential risk aversion and a greater focus on operational controls after the fraud may hamper growth in the near term,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.


Vix declines further
India Vix, the volatility barometer, eased further on Thursday. The index slipped 6.83 per cent to 14.8325, suggesting normalcy returning to the market. The Vix has declined more than 10 per cent in the last two sessions, reducing the pace of selling pressure, said Chandan Taparia, Derivatives & Technical Analyst at Motilal Oswal. 




KPR Mill spurts
Shares of KPR Mill climbed over 4 per cent after the company's board approved buyback worth up to Rs 108 crore through tender route at Rs 810 apiece. Shares of the company settled at Rs 723.95 apiece, up 4.35 per cent on BSE.




Spurt in open interest
Shares of Shree Cement witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest at 70.91 per cent, followed by Marico (65.79 per cent) and Berger Paints (58.96 per cent).




@52-week lows
As many as 61 securities hit their 52-week lows in today's trade. Some of the notable names include Bosch (down 1.61 per cent), Gitanjali Gems (down 5 per cent) and Max India (down 2 per cent). On the other hand, seven scrips surged to 52-week highs in trade.




Broader markets bleed more
The BSE Midcap index lost 0.54 per cent to settle at 16,322.14 with Biocon (up 6 per cent) being the top gainer and Vakrangee (down 5 per cent) the worst laggard. The BSE Smallcap pack shed 0.43 per cent to 17,723.73."

I am Swati Verma who will take you through the day's trading, mixed with views, cues and insights from top market watchers.

Market turned indecisive again as weak global leads, set off by rising US bond yields, cast their shadow. The last day of February derivatives series saw some lacklustre trading.

Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty settled on a flat note at 33,820 and 10,383, with a negative bias. Losses in auto, bank, and FMCG stocks offset IT and pharma gains.

Dollar's strength came as a boon for the IT pack as much of their revenue comes through the US currency.

5,2018-02-22,Shree Cement,"ET Intelligence Group : Although cement demand has historically been better in the March quarter, large cement manufacturers with more than 15 million tonnes of capacity may not report any material rise in operating profit margins.

This is due to their inability to increase product prices in the first two months of the quarter. In the nine months to December 2017 quarter, their margins were 15-30 per cent depending upon the reach and pricing power.

The demand strength from the real estate, individual home builders (IHB) and infrastructure segments plays crucial role in price trend. This time around, demand from the real estate and IHB segments has been weak thereby curtailing major increase in cement prices.

While demand from the infrastructure segment has been stable, it accounts for just over one-fifth of the total cement demand.

It may not significantly offset the slowdown in real estate, which forms nearly two-thirds of the total cement consumption. Within housing, rural housing accounts for 30-35 per cent of the demand, and the rest is owing to urban housing.

Besides weak demand, cement companies are facing higher input costs. In the second half of 2017, prices of petcoke, imported coal and diesel rose sharply. In January 2018, Coal India increased price of linkage coal, which would add to the cost of cement production.

Despite higher raw material costs, companies have been unable to raise prices on sequential basis, unlike in the past when there was a price increase during the March quarter.

Except in the eastern region, cement prices have been range-bound in rest of India. Low-cost housing is driving demand in the eastern region. The average all-India cement price has not moved up from the December quarter levels of Rs 285 per 50 kg bag. In the eastern region, cement price is 3-10 per cent above the all-India average.

Investors will be better off by enhancing their exposure to large pan-India companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and The Ramco Cement. These companies will be able to raise sales volumes once the demand picks up given their size and geographical reach."
8,2018-02-28,Shree Cement,"ET Intelligence Group: A day after India’s oldest cement manufacturer and its major local shareholder called off their nine-monthold merger talks citing “certain constraints”, shares of both ACC and Ambuja Cements slid in the range of 2-4 per cent on the Mumbai exchanges.

LafargeHolcim, the global parent of the two that together make up India’s second-biggest cement capacity after UltraTech, decided against an immediate formal union late Monday while saying that a merger “remains the ultimate objective.”

Analysts cite the expensive transfer and stamp duty charges involved in transferring mines between ACC and Ambuja Cements as among the key reasons the formal union is stalled. The inability to extract articulated synergies immediately may cause both stocks to face headwinds in the short term.

Under a common ownership, ACC and Ambuja have been operating in different markets with utmost consideration to the fact that both would not expand capacities in each other’s regions to avoid overlapping of operations. ACC has considerable presence in the southern and central regions, while Ambuja has a dominant presence in the western and northern regions. The rationale behind the merger was to save costs at the parent level.

LafargeHolcim had guided that the merger would help in cost savings amounting to Rs 780-900 crore. The parent expected to save Rs 360-420 crore by optimising the supply chain between the two companies. In addition to this, by sharing fixed costs such as human resources, marketing and sales, procurement and finance, the parent planned to save Rs 420-480 crore.

The announcement on calling off the merger discussions has also coincided with rising input costs for the capital-intensive industry, where UltraTech, the Dalmia Bharat and Shree Cement have significantly added capacity and utilisation in the current cycle of consolidation.

In the past nine months, the prices of key raw materials such as pet coke and coal have gone up considerably. Besides this, there have been issues related to the availability of sand, which further adds to the cost of manufacturing cement. Furthermore, cement prices have been weak in the past nine months, providing little scope for margin expansion at least in the short-term. Given this, the merger would have saved some costs for the parent in terms of its Indian operations.

On the valuation front, based on the December 2018 estimates of Kotak Institutional Securities, ACC and Ambuja Cements are trading at a price to earnings multiple of 27.4 and 31.2, respectively. At these price points, the stocks seem fairly valued and adequately capture earnings prospects for the next two years."

After the exclusion of Aurobindo Pharma, it seems that the weightage of pharmaceutical sector in the Nifty50 could slide further this year.


A study by Centrum Broking on potential Nifty50 
exits suggested that three pharma names Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Lupin could be shown the door in the forthcoming index reviews.


Aurobindo
Pharma would cease to be a Nifty50 component from April 2.

""The removal of 
Aurobindo Pharma from Nifty reflects the ongoing pharma sector downturn resulting in only 4 pharma stocks Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and Lupin remaining in Nifty50, with aggregate weightage of mere 3.2 per cent,"" the report said.

Meanwhile, with Bajaj Finserv's entry, the NSE barometer will feature 11 stocks from BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector. This will take BFSI stocks weightage in the index to 33.7 per cent from 33.3 per cent at present, the brokerage said.

Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc, JSW Steel, Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products, Motherson Sumi are some of the stocks that have potential to be a part of Nifty50 going ahead.

Piramal Enterprises MRF, Shriram Transport Finance and Shree Cement are a few other potential Nifty50 stocks.

The 
index is a diversified 50-stock index, which accounts for 12 sectors of the economy. The index reconstruction after considering several criteria such as the free-float market caitalisation of the company, average impact cost during the last six months, trading frequency and so on.

Brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects Hindustan Zinc to deliver healthy volumes going ahead to strong management focus, investment in drilling and human resources. ""We maintain a bullish zinc price outlook and expect LME to average at $3,800/t in FY19 and little lower at $3,200/t in FY20. Ebitda is expected to increase 45-50 per cent, driven by volume growth, cost reduction and favorable LME,"" the brokerage said.

Another brokerage JM Financial likes JSW Steel given its lowest conversion cost and premium realisation for its products against products of peers. ""We factor in Ebitda per tonne at Rs 8,500/8,700 for FY19E/20E, respectively. We roll forward to FY20 to arrive at our SOTP fair value of Rs 300 per share,"" the brokerage said 
after the company's Q3 numbers.

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher noted that the rural demand has been recovering and Britannia Industries has been gaining market share from both organised and smaller players. The company is expected to launch 50 new products/ variants in FY19."

NEW DELHI: The Nifty50 index opened with a gap up and tried to surpass the 10,300 level, but it fell short as the indices drifted lower from the day’s high of 10,296. The indices saw bearish contradictory patterns on a daily scale, which is generally sign of initialisation of sideways momentum. 

The indices respected the recent swing low of 10,141, and unless this level gets negated with a close below this level, the expectation of consolidation will remain. Now, it needs to hold above its immediate resistance of 10,276 to witness a rally towards 10,333 and then 10,400 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,141 and then 10,100 levels, which is near to its 200 DEMA.

On the option front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,000 followed by 10,200 while maximum Call open interest was at 10,500 followed by 10,400. Call writing was seen at 10,300 followed by 10,590, while Put writing was seen at 10,200 followed by 10,150 level.

0,2018-07-05,Shree Cement,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Cement makers in the world’s second-biggest market for the commodity have recently raised prices in select local pockets, but the increases largely apply to bulk sales to builders and infrastructure providers — or the nontrade segment of the industry.

Analysts who met dealers stocking cement bags that are ultimately used by individual home builders (IHBs) said that prices have risen in select regions by 3-5 per cent in June, when compared both with the year-ago and month-ago periods.

On a month-on-month basis, except the west, prices rose in the range of Rs 315-330 per 50 kg bag in June. Against last year, except in the south and west, cement prices in the ‘rest-of-India’ region climbed 3 per cent-5.5 per cent.

Still, competition and the industry’s increasing dependence on nontrade business, which has both bargaining power and suffers from cyclicality, should limit the ability to raise prices further.

Yet, raw material and freight costs continue to rise, foretelling significant margin pressure for manufacturers in an industry where dominance is defined by on-the-ground presence and the proximity of output sources to consuming markets.

Deepak Sharma, director of strategy at Kanvic Consulting, a management consulting firm, said: “Between 2018 and 2021, there will be an incremental supply of 80 MT.

This capacity is happening across the board by large and mid-sized players as well as new entrants. As a result, by 2021, there is a forecast of excess supply of over 170 MT, which will keep industry-wide capacity utilisation below 70 per cent.”

Sharma added: “As a result of this, there will be pressure on earnings. In our assessment, the industry’s volume growth will be in the range of 5-7 per cent between FY18 and FY21.”

Kanvic Consulting expects that in the next three years, after incremental capacity addition, the industry will remain fragmented and market share of top 10 players will remain flat.




Analysts say that central, eastern and northern regions should generate stable demand: west and south may be volatile. Kanvic Consulting believes that those with robust supply chains, distribution managements and logistics are likely to do well. Among these players are UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement."
1,2018-07-07,Shree Cement,"Nifty continued to tread choppy waters signalling the ongoing phase of correction. However, the 50-pack is just a mirage; the real action is happening in smallcap and midcap indices, which have most likely made a bottom and are ready to move higher.

Negative sentiments had whacked down these smallcap and midcap shares by around 25-30 per cent and in some cases by almost 50 per cent. Herd mentality of the market has brought down even good quality smallcap and midcap shares to reasonable levels and the same should be bought for higher returns.

On the other hand, IT shares are at the other end of spectrum. The IT index have risen 36 per cent in a year and since the earnings season is ahead, IT shares will most likely disappoint given that the sharp runup will not keep pace with the earnings growth of around 10 per cent YoY growth expected in general.

Therefore, we expect some amount of correction in this sector as we enter the earnings season next week.


Events of the Week
This week all eyes were on the 41st AGM of Reliance Industries, where the company unveiled the group’s ambitious plans for a fibre-based home broadband service. Mukesh Ambani stated that Reliance Jio will be roll out home broadband service across 1,100 cities and will target close to 50 million homes.

Moreover, the launch of Jio was just a trailer, an array of services which Reliance now wants to deliver/cross-sell to the last mile consumers are huge and varied across sectors, which hitherto are serviced by brick-and-motor establishments.

These will now be catered through Jio’s digital platform. Some businesses operating in cables and distribution will clearly be disrupted. Reliance might come head-on with Amazon and Netflix of the world in the future and hopefully create huge shareholder wealth.


Technical Outlook
Nifty50 is still moving in a sideways trading band giving no clear signal. However, Nifty Smallcap Index is clearly showing that the market is sitting on support levels and is ready to move higher from oversold levels.

The market is near its lower channel of two standard deviation corrective channel, which makes a compelling case for the prices to move higher than go down. The Nifty Smallcap index has completed a 61.8 per cent correction from the demonetisation lows of December 2016 to the February 2018 highs, which is a healthy price correction.

Traders can go long at current levels with current weekly lows as stops.






Expectations for the Week
The market is awaiting and fearing the outcome of the trade war between the US and China, but realistically $35 billion of purported tariff goods is insignificant when seen from a larger scheme of things (total imports $506 billion). This fear will create an opportunity for investors and traders to lap up shares and take long positions.

Sectors that are likely to rise in this earnings season are cement (Ultratech and Shree Cement), HFCs (Indiabulls Housing Finance and CanFin Homes), realty (Indiabulls Real Estate and Godrej Properties) and infrastructure (KNR Construction and Dilip Buildcon). Additionally, sectors that are expected to underperform are IT, metals and FMCG. Investors must follow a buy-on-dips strategy and accumulate quality stocks in their portfolio for a long-term horizon.

3,2018-07-16,Shree Cement,"If you have a strong conviction on a stock but are worried about the gestation period, investing may not be your cup of tea. Maybe, you should trade!

Some 10 stocks from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) took 20 years for gestation, but have delivered up to 2,619 times return in this period. They were penny stocks back then; five are part of the elite Nifty50 club today. They are Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UPL, Lupin and Titan Company.

Others which made their investors millionaires included Bajaj Finance, Shree Cement, Gruh Finance, JSW Steel and Ashiana Housing.

No, it has not been a steep climb for any of them. UPL, Titan, and JSW Steel tested investors’ nerves for several quarters or even years before they took off. 

That’s what you face on the path to richness. 

Ian Cassel, a well-known microcap investor, said in a recent tweet: “Every multibagger will have long periods (even years) of stagnation, as fundamentals backfill, old shareholders get bored, and new shareholders enter.”

So how long is it, really?

UPL remained in the Rs 3-8 range all through 1998-2003; Titan traded in the Rs 2-4 range around the same time. The former is at Rs 637, today and latter at Rs 832.

Shares of Eicher Motors have rallied 2,61,772 per cent from Rs 10.70 on July 12 in 1998 to Rs 28,020 on July 12, 2018. The company has no debt on its books and continues to redeploy cash for further expansion and product innovation.

Data available with Ace Equity showed Eicher’s net profit swelled to Rs 1,712.90 crore for the year ended March 2018 from Rs 23.50 crore reported for FY01. Net sales soared over 20 times during this period. 

An investment of Rs 55,000 in Eicher Motors shares in 1998 would have become over Rs 14 crore today. 

Kotak Mahindra Bank is the second biggest gainer on the list, up 1,29,337 per cent from Rs 1.10 in July 1998 to Rs 1,394 at last Friday’s close. Net profit of the lender multiplied over 50 times to Rs 4,084.30 crore for the year ended FY18. In comparison, shares of HDFC Bank rallied 16,022 per cent from Rs 13.40 to Rs 2165 in the same period.

Brokerage Sharekhan says Kotak Mahindra Bank is among a handful of banks that have been able to maintain strong asset quality in sharp contrast to most banking peers that have become fraught with challenges. Kotak Bank is well positioned to capture incremental market share in the advances market.

“With PSU banks hobbled with non-performing assets (NPA) and capital-related issues, private banks (such as Kotak Bank) have a great opportunity to grab market share and gain access to attractive clientele,” the brokerage said in a report.

UPL has multiplied investor wealth by 647 times in last 20 years. The scrip jumped from Rs 0.90 on July 13, 1998 to Rs 582.70 on July 12, 2018. Net sales and net profit have soared manifold in the same period.

UPL is engaged in the crop protection business, comprising agrochemicals, industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and specialty chemicals.

HDFC Securities in an April report said UPL’s long-term prospects remained positive led by its focus on branding and launch of innovative products, maintaining geographical presence and catering to major crops.

It has increased its share in the global agrochemical market (4 per cent in CY16 against 3 per cent in CY14), and improving Innovation Turnover Index, which rose to 19 per cent in FY18 from 15 per cent in FY17. The company has been investing consistently in backward as well as forward integration, resulting in better cost management.

Shares of pharma major Lupin have rallied 46,370 per cent to Rs 885.30 from Rs 1.90 on July 13, 1998, while Titan has soared 35,415 per cent to Rs 808.90 from Rs 2.30 during the same period. 

Lupin’s profit has jumped from just Rs 2.90 crore in FY2000 to Rs 1,344 for the financial year ended March 2018. It is the market leader in 51 out of the 158 products it sells in the US generic market. As many as 109 of its products feature among the top three in the US generic market.

Lupin plans to launch around 30 new products in the US during FY19. With 163 ANDAs pending approval by USFDA, Lupin is poised for good growth, according to Centrum Broking. The management has guided an EBIDTA margin of 19-21 per cent and single digit decline in revenues for US generic business in FY19.

Titan’s bottomline has soared to over Rs 1,150 crore in FY18 from Rs 25 crore in FY05, while top line has grown 15 times.

The previous financial year turned out to be a robust one for the company, with the jewellery division delivering healthy expansion in bottomline and topline. Revenues for the jewellery division grew 25 per cent YoY to Rs 13,257 crore.

Recent regulatory changes such as demonetisation and GST have led to market share gains for the company, while its enhanced focus on wedding and high value studded jewellery and favourable gold exchange policy has also helped grow topline. The management remains upbeat on the growth outlook for the jewellery division with plans to grow revenues at a compounding rate of 20 per cent till FY23. 

The size of India’s jewellery industry is pegged at Rs 2,50,000 crore, of which Titan’s Tanishq brand has just 5 per cent market share. This provides immense opportunity to enhance market share, going forward."
4,2018-07-18,Shree Cement,"As far as crude prices are concerned, these are very short-term trades, Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO, Yes Securities, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


A quick reaction on UltraTech. Do you expect a similar trend from the rest of the cement pack in terms of the Q1 performance?
They have managed to not only maintain margins but actually to grow it. If the trend continues for other cement companies, which is what we would like because for the last three of four quarters they have managed to show a volume growth. It means demand is catching up but unless margins are maintained or continuously grown, volume growth would not reflect in the bottom line, something that UltraTech has managed to pull off. If the other companies in the cement pack are able to do that, it will be a good start for building the base for a portfolio for the long term.


But do you think what UltraTech has done is a reality for the cement sector? Dispatch numbers have been fine but is there a scope for pricing to improve?
The margins have improved. This means pricing has improved. At some point of time, they have to either cut down cost which I do not see happening immediately and that means that they have to get better realisations for the products they are selling in the market.


Other than UltraTech, the focus on cement has largely been with the regional players. Look at Ramco Cement or a Shree Cement for that matter. It has really not been about some of the bigger names in terms of their financial performance. I do not completely track ACC and Ambuja, but it has really been a story of finding investments with regional players. Would you agree?
If you look at the capacity utilisation for the larger players, most of them are in the range of 72-75%. That is why there has been operating margin pressure and they have to raise utilisation rate to 80-85%. This is the figure which most of the regional players are already functioning with and the return on equity, return on investment for most of these companies have been good. You will not see the same rate of returns coming in from the larger players. You need a large demand boost so that the capacity that they have built up is used to the levels that we want it to.


Do you think what Zee has done with its numbers can be seen as a trend in the making for broadcast businesses in general? With ad revenue picking up, is it back to business or is this just an aberration and very case specific?
It is case specific. The overall economy has to grow at a larger pace. There are two problems with ad pressures that are coming in. Most of the clients are asking for reduced cut as far as giving ads by itself are concerned. There is a lot of pricing pressure that is coming in even in the ad space overall. Zee has managed to maintain it because it is a large spread-out business. The Hindi version ends up getting a larger amount of ad revenue because that has a coverage into the hinterlands of India and that is what makes a difference. The others do not have that specific advantage. You will have to wait for the economy to go through a large turn before you see these companies starting to make sizable amount of returns on ad revenues.


What has been the expectation on Bajaj Finance? Is there a scope for disappointment if at the numbers do not match up to the Street estimates?
Bajaj Finance is a story that has played out and valuations have gone proportionately out of shape. If Nifty is today at 11,000 plus, it is only because of few names that have held. In the larger broader markets, midcaps have tumbled and there has been a lot of pain in the smallcap space. Money has gone to performers in those sectors and who have managed to give consistent CAGR growth for the last three or four years when times have been tough. Market leaders that have done extremely well and have managed to continue to grow have been given higher multiples by most of the fund managers who have liquidity at this point of time.


Has the tide now turned for OMCs given the kind of sudden cool-off that we have seen in global crude prices, Would you say this is just a near term trade?
It is a short-term trade that is there clearly. Crude remains a political agenda across the globe and it is not going to get sorted off in a hurry. Plus, trade pressures are also there. So as far as the crude prices are concerned, these are very short-term trades.

As fast as it had gone up, it has come down in the same manner and the stocks have also reacted in the same fashion. These are trading positions that you can have in your portfolio. It is very difficult to read and track commodity stocks for a pure retail investor."
5,2018-07-25,Shree Cement,"MUMBAI: Shares of cement companies rallied on Tuesday after sector major ACC reported strong results for the quarter ended June with some witnessing their strongest gain in recent years. Analysts said ACC’s surge triggered a sentimental rally in these stocks.

ACC led the surge in the sector with a 13% gain to Rs 1,473.25 — its biggest one day rise since March 2001. India Cements, Sagar Cements. UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement jumped 3-9%.

“These stocks were beaten down on fall in volume and pricing pressure. In the June quarter some of the cement companies have surprised on volume and margins front. I believe the sector will outperform this year and ACC could touch ₹1,850,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP-Markets and Corporate Affairs at IIFL.

Edelweiss expects the ongoing financial year to be a landmark year for the cement Industry on the back of robust volume with incremental demand emanating from the confluence of revival in affordable housing projects, rural demand and increased infrastructure spending by the government.

A good start to the earnings season in June’2018 quarter further substantiates this thesis, said Edelweiss. “Despite multiple micro challenges like spike in pet coke, diesel prices, shortage of linkage coal, coupled with subdued average realization, the industry has delivered reasonably decent operating performance,” it said.

Even after the surge in Tuesday’s session, cement stocks are down for the year. ACC itself is down 15% so far in 2018. Mangalam Cement, India Cements, Sagar Cements, UltraTech Cement and Andhra Cement are down 3-38%.

Prateek Kumar, analyst at Antique Stock Broking said the surge in cement stocks was primarily a rub off effect of ACC earnings.

“ACC has given strong performance in the quarterly results which had a rub off effect on the other companies in the sector. However sustenance would depend on how the results for other companies are in the space,” said Kumar."
8,2018-07-25,Shree Cement,"In a setback to 10 major cement producers, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal today dismissed their plea against the around Rs 6,300 crore penalty imposed by fair trade regulator CCI over alleged cartelisation in the sector. The appellate tribunal also upheld the quantum of penalty imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI), observing that the fair trade regulator has imposed the minimum fine. 

Some cement makers as Ambuja Cement, Ramco, JK Cement and UltraTech said they are consulting with their legal teams and intend to challenge the order before the Supreme Court. 

""We find no merit in these appeals. They are accordingly dismissed,"" said a two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya. 

Regarding the Rs 6,300 crore penalty, the tribunal said: ""So far as the quantum of penalty order is concerned, as we find that the CCI has imposed mere minimum penalty, no interference is called for against the same."" 

Passing an order on August 31, CCI had imposed a penalty of more than Rs 6,300 crore on 10 cement companies for cartelisation, along with their lobby group Cement Manufacturers' Association. 

The makers are Ambuja Cements, ACC, Jaiprakash Associates, Century Textiles & Industries, Ramco Cements, JK Cement, India Cements, UltraTech, Nuvoco Vistas Corporation and Binani Cement. 

CCI had also slapped a Rs 397.51 crore fine on Shree Cement Ltd for unfair businesses practices, through a separate order. 

Commenting on the NCLAT order, Ambuja Cement said: ""While the company is yet to receive the order of NCLAT, it believes that on merits it has sufficient grounds for a successful appeal and intends to file the same with the Supreme Court."" 

JK Cement said: ""The company has been legally advised that it has a good arguable case on merits. Accordingly, the company shall file an appeal to Supreme Court to challenge the impugned order within the time prescribed under the law."" 

Ramco Cement also said it proposes to move the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order. 

Leading cement maker UltraTech said: ""The detailed order is awaited, upon examining the same, the Company will take appropriate action, as advised by its lawyers.""

The CCI order had come after the Builders Association of India had alleged anti-competitive practices by the Cement Manufacturers' Association (CMA) and 11 cement manufacturing companies. 

CCI then had probed the issue and passed an order on June 20, 2012, holding the cement makers guilty and imposing penalty. 

This was challenged by them before the Competition Appellate Tribunal (previous appellate authority), which set it aside on December 11, 2015, asking the CCI to pass a fresh order. 

Later on August 31, 2016, CCI passed a fresh order, holding them guilty of violating the Competition Act, 2002 by acting in concert to fix cement prices as well as limit and control the production and supply in the market. 

This was again challenged by the cement manufacturers before NCLAT, which now has appellate jurisdiction over CCI, which upheld the fair trade regulator's order. 

""We have noticed that the Commission not only looked into 'Sate-wise Market' but also 'Region-wise Market' and range of percentage change in prices between 2007-2011,"" NCLAT said, adding that CCI has also highlighted the unprecedented trend for the percentage increase in the prices in all the five regions."

Going ahead, it's going to be a policy week as many major central banks are going to declare their monetary policy. 

Here’s an in-depth look at these and other factors that are likely to steer market this week - 


RBI's rate-setting meetingThe RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to meet during July 30 to August 1 for the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2018-2019. The six-member monetary policy committee of the central bank headed by Governor Urjit Patel in June meet bit the bullet and hiked the repo rate – the short-term lending rate – by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent.

Speculations are rife that the bank will hike interest rates for second time on Wednesday as inflation risks mount. 


Next batch of quarterly earningsCorporate earnings will continue to dominate the Street's proceedings in the coming week. Among notable names, Axis Bank, HDFC, Idea Cellular, Tech Mahindra, IDFC and Shree Cement are slated to declare their June quarter results on Monday. Bank of India, Dabur India, Power Grid Corporation of India, Tata Motors and Vedanta will announce theirs on Tuesday. Indiabulls Housing Finance and Marico are expected to unveil their report cards on Thursday. Nestle India and Titan Company will declare theirs on Friday.


US Fed meetUS Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed had hiked its benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter percentage point in June and indicated that two more increases are likely this year. The move pushed the funds rate target to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.


BoJ and BoEBank of Japan (BoJ) will unveil its interest rate decision on Tuesday. According to a report by Reuters, it might be doing some ‘jinarashi’ i.e. preparing markets for some changes to its unique, ultra-loose monetary policy. BoJ had left its key short-term interest rate unchanged at -0.1 per cent at its June 2018 meeting.

This apart, Bank of England (BoE) will declare its interest rate decision on Thursday. Governor Mark Carney is looking to throw off his “unreliable boyfriend” tag and do what he and his colleagues have been threatening to do for a while - raise UK interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75 per cent, reports Reuters. BoE left its key bank rate on hold at 0.5 per cent on 21 June 2018.


Auto stocks in focusAutomakers will start releasing their sales numbers for July from Wednesday. Auto firms including cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, reported a higher double-digit growth in sales in June. Auto major Maruti Suzuki India posted a robust growth of 44 per cent in the domestic sales with 1.34 lakh units in June as compared with 93,057 units the same period last fiscal.


TCNS Clothing listingShares of TCNS Clothing will get listed on BSE and NSE on Monday. The initial public offer (IPO) of the women's apparel maker was subscribed 5.27 times during its IPO. The Rs 1,125 crore public offer received bids for 5,79,79,780 shares against the total issue size of 1,09,99,828.


What tech chart sayThe Nifty50 index on Friday formed a bullish candle similar to the 'Bullish Marubozu' pattern on the daily and weekly scales. Friday's opening gap remains unfilled, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities. “A long bull on the daily time frame chart and a similar candle on the weekly chart indicate strength in the upward move. The weekly momentum oscillator is signalling strengthening of the upside momentum in the Nifty50,” the expert said.


US jobs dataUnited States non farm payrolls data for July will be unveiled on Friday. The country added another 213,000 jobs in June, although the unemployment rate rose to 4 per cent, according to a report by CNBC. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected a nonfarm payrolls gain of 195,000 and the jobless rate to hold steady at 3.8 per cent, which had been tied for the lowest since 1969, the report added."
10,2018-07-31,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Domestic shares were thrown off balance on Tuesday as weak global cues and some panic selling in industry heavyweights such as HDFC twins, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ITC and TCS made investors wary.

Morgan Stanley on Axis Bank
Morgan Stanley has maintained 'overweight' on the stock with a target price of Rs 620. The private lender on Monday logged 46.30 per cent YoY fall in net profit at Rs 701.09 crore for the quarter through June. 

The brokerage said first quarter of FY19 was relatively a stable quarter. Coverage on total bad loans was stable. It says the focus will shift to RBI approval for new CEO of the bank. 


Macquarie on Shree CementMacquarie has maintained 'Outperform' on the stock with a target price of Rs 21,500. It observed that cost headwinds persist, but are peaking out. The brokerage expects margin recovery ahead. The company's net profit fell 36.5 per cent YoY to Rs 279.5 crore, dragged down by dismal operational performance.


CLSA on HDFC
The brokerage has 'Buy' rating with a revised target of Rs 2,480. Earlier, it was Rs 2,430. The brokerage sees healthy growth in core earnings in years ahead. It sees its ROE (return on equity) expanding to 17 per cent in FY18-21.


Deutsche Bank on Gujarat Gas
It has maintained 'Buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,030. The brokerage said margin of the company has improved and is likely to strengthen further. It reiterates Buy on 55 per cent EPS (earnings per share) CAGR over FY18-20E."
0,2018-08-01,Shree Cement,"Sharekhan has a hold call on Shree Cements with a target price of Rs 18,910.

The current market price of Shree Cements is Rs 17,219.80.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Shree Cements price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by Sharekhan:

Higher opex and interest dents net earnings: For Q1FY2019, Shree Cement Limited revenues grew 19.4 per cent y-o-y to Rs 3,070 crore. Growth was mainly driven by an 18.7 per cent y-o-y rise in volume growth (higher volume growth in East albeit on low base and healthy volume growth in North). The realisation declined by 2.4 per cent y-o-y and 1.3 per cent q-o-q, as cement prices stayed subdued in the North. EBITDA per tonne fell by 37.2 per cent y-o-y to of Rs 763, as per tonne operating expenses rose 11.7 per cent y-o-y. Further, higher interest (up 71 per cent y-o-y) partially offset by lower effective tax rate (9.0 per cent in Q1FY2019 against 19.5 per cent in Q1FY2018), thus leading to 36.5 per cent y-o-y decline in net profit to Rs 279.5 crore. 


Cement division hit by higher opex; Power division sees volumes and realizations rise: The cement division’s performance was affected by a rise in costs on all fronts. Freight costs rose 14.1 per cent y-o-y per tonne as diesel prices increased. Power and fuel costs jumped 28.6 per cent y-o-y per tonne on higher pet coke prices. Other expenses increased 10.4 per cent y-o-y owing to forex loss arising from unhedged debt in books, led by an acquisition in the UAE. Employee costs too rose on addition of staff on the Gulbarga capacity expansion. Consequently, EBITDA per tonne fell 37.2 per cent y-o-y to of Rs. 763. The power division posted EBITDA of Rs. 42 crore in Q1FY2019 compared to EBITDA of -Rs. 1.4 crore in Q1FY2018 on account of higher volume of 45.1 crore units (vs. 28.4 crore units in Q1FY2018) and higher realisation of Rs. 4.4/unit (vs. Rs. 3.4/unit in Q1FY2018).


Outlook: Incremental capacity to sustain revenue growth during FY2019-FY2020: Shree cement added 3 mtpa capacity during Q1FY2019 at Gulbarga, Karnataka which should materially contribute towards volume from September 2018. The expansion will also take its total installed capacity to 37.9 mtpa from 34.9 mtpa in FY2018 end. The incremental capacity and an improving demand environment is expected to aid a 16.4 per cent volume CAGR during FY2018-FY2020, leading to a 20 per cent CAGR in standalone revenue for the same period.


Valuation – Downgrade to Hold with revised PT of Rs. 18,910: We have fine-tuned our earnings estimates for FY2019 and FY2020, factoring higher other expenses leading to lower operating margins during these years. Consequently, we have slashed our price target to Rs. 18,910. We also downgrade our rating to Hold on account of a limited upside and the stock’s higher valuation.


Key risk: Increased power costs (driven by rise in pet coke prices) and freight costs (due to higher diesel prices) remain key downward risks to our call."
1,2018-08-28,Shree Cement,"Investors on Dalal Street became richer by nearly Rs 15 lakh crore in just 40 trading session, as sustained buying in largecap stocks as well as fund inflows by domestic institutional investors supported market sentiment.

The total market capitalisation of all the BSE-listed firms soared to around Rs 159 lakh crore on August 28 from Rs 144 lakh crore on July 2. However, falling rupee, US-China trade war concern and weakness in emerging market currencies kept market participants cautious.

Benchmark equity index BSE Sensex closed at a fresh record high on Tuesday, while the NSE Nifty index ended above the 11,700-mark for the first time ever.

On further movement of the equity market, Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities in an interaction with ETNow said, “Nifty is inching towards 12,000 and medium to long-term, we are very bullish on the market and as well as the economy. But yes, there will be short-term jerks coming in betw een. We are advising our investors to keep pumping money on all these jerks and triggers.”

In terms of wealth creators, oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries added over Rs 2.25 lakh crore to its market capitalisation during the period. Share price of the company jumped 37 per cent to Rs 1,318.20 on August 28 from Rs 961.10 on July 2. 

Still, brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities has reiterated ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 985. 

“Our reverse valuation exercise suggests that investors have not only priced in a robust energy segment performance in RIL’s current valuations, but also ascribed the enterprise value (EV) of leading players in key sectors that are being targeted by RIL’s platform narrative—Bharti’s India business (telecom), Avenue Supermarts (retail), Flipkart (e-commerce) and key players in the media sector (content ecosystem),” Kotak said in a report.

Tata Consultancy Services has added Rs 80,381 crore to its market cap since July 2. ITC (Rs 59,890 crore), State Bank of India (Rs 40,919 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 39,591 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 38,027 crore), Bajaj Finance (Rs 36,788 crore) were among other top grossers in terms of m-cap.

In terms of share price, companies such as Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, SORIL Infra Resources, Adani Enterprises more than doubled investors wealth during July 2-August 28. 

Other names including Atlas Jewellery Sharp India, Tiaan Ayurvedic & Herbs, Alora Trading Company, Sawaca Business Machines, Birla Cable, Danube Industries, Sport King India, SPL Industries, Gangotri Textiles, Zenlabs Ethica, Diamines & Chemicals and MM Rubber rallied 100-191 per cent.

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “On the earnings front Q1FY19 numbers have been above expectations and we remain confident that rural demand will pick up in the coming quarters. With government focusing on cleaning up the banking sector there may some short-term pressure on banking names, but the worst is behind.”

Jani prefers stocks in the private banking space and feel that they will outperform their PSU peers. Stocks such as HDFC Bank and RBL Bank remain among preferred picks. He also believes that market will continue to be volatile in the short term on the back of global fund inflows and general elections in 2019. “Any correction should be used by investors to add quality companies,” Jani said.

Capital Goods, Teck, Consumer durables, Metal, Auto and Realty index also rallied up to 8 per cent during the past 40 trading sessions.

Foreign portfolio investors have poured over Rs 4,000 crore in domestic equity markets since July this year. However, they offloaded shares worth Rs 6,000 during the first half of 2018. On the other hand, net investment of domestic institutional investors stood over Rs 71,000 crore on YtD basis.

For investment perspective, global brokerage CLSA has recommended few largecap stocks for investors. The financial services firm sees value in HDFC (target price: Rs 2,480), IndusInd Bank (Rs 1975.95), Infosys (Rs 1,560), ITC (Rs 390), Mahindra & Mahindra (Rs 1,120), Maruti Suzuki (Rs 11,300) and Sun Pharma (Rs 750)."
0,2018-09-25,Shree Cement,"Increasing pessimism in markets arising from the crisis in the banking sector along with macro-economic headwinds such as depreciating rupee and high crude oil prices warrant exposure to safe bets. These safe bets mean large-sized companies which have the capacity and size to weather any untoward developments in their respective sectors.

Among the large-cap schemes, investors can consider investing in SBI Bluechip scheme with an investment horizon of at least three years. The company’s high exposure to well-placed large-sized companies with a small portion dedicated to mid-sized companies would be an appropriate choice in the present market conditions wherein a large number of macro-economic and industry issues are pointing to uncertainty in earnings’ growth trajectory.

There are two factors investors need to bear in mind while investing in the scheme. One, the scheme has consistently performed better than its peers in falling markets. Two, the scheme has done well only in the long-term period which means that investors need to keep in mind at least five years in mind before investing in the scheme. Besides, the investment style of the scheme is geared towards more of multi-cap investing covering as much companies as possible in the large-and mid-sized categories. This has boosted the scheme’s performance as it is not particularly focused on large-sized companies. In the past five and 10-year period, the scheme has given 18% and 13% returns, while its benchmark index Nifty 100 TRI has given 15% and 12% returns respectively in the same period.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund manager Sohini Andani has maintained extremely diversified portfolio covering companies from auto, FMCG and financial sectors. A few prominent companies which are part of the scheme’s portfolio are Tata Motors, Yes Bank and Shree Cement.

1,2018-09-25,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks settled in the positive terrain for the first time in six sessions on Tuesday, on gains led by bank, financial, pharma, auto and FMCG heavyweights. 

Emerging from the worst losing streak of 2018, the market started building on the gains of the late afternoon session, as sentiment got a boost from LIC's comment that it won’t let IL&FS collapse.

0,2018-10-05,Shree Cement,"Nifty 50 companies are likely to report 11.4 per cent year-on-year growth in net profit for the September 2018 quarter. At 7.4 per cent, profit growth in the previous quarter had fallen below 10 per cent after three consecutive quarters of double digit growth. Revenue is expected to grow by 11.6 per cent in the September quarter, which would be the seventh consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Growth in revenue and profit in the year-ago quarter was 11.6 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.

Improving trend in the financials of top companies may offer some solace to investors amid a sharp drop in benchmark indices over the past few weeks. S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have lost over 7 per cent in a month. The current market turmoil is likely to result in mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio of companies, especially banks and finance companies. Its extent is difficult to measure at the aggregate level but may cause some pressure on the bottomlines.

Select companies in the automobiles, banking and finance, consumer goods, mining, and IT sectors are likely to support overall growth of the sample. The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by 18.8 per cent in the September quarter, faster than 15.2 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin is likely to expand by 60 basis points to 21.6 per cent.




SECTOR TREND

AUTOMOBILES
Two-wheeler companies are likely to drive earnings growth of the sector for the September quarter due to sustained volume growth despite many disruptions. The floods in Kerala and new rules of registration in Bengal did impact the volume growth. The volumes of Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto grew 6 per cent and 26 per cent, while that of Maruti Suzuki fell by 1.5 per cent during the quarter. The operating margins may shrink by 50-100 basis points due to higher input prices.


BANKING, FINANCE
Banks with higher exposure to corporate loans such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank may show deceleration in new bad loan recognition for the September quarter. Other banks with greater retail exposure such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank are likely to report sustained momentum in advances. Rising interest costs may put pressure on margins. In addition, mark-to-market losses on investments may widen due to a sharp fall in the stock market.


CAPITAL GOODS
A sustained order flow from the government should support the growth of capital goods companies. Project execution is picking up as most of the slow moving orders are out of the system. The order inflows momentum of Larsen & Toubro shows that it will be able to meet its order inflow and revenue growth guidance.


CEMENT
The September quarter is again expected to be driven by volume growth rather than price increase.

Cement volumes of the top five players by capacity Ultratech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to increase by 10-25 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter. Their revenue is likely to grow by 8-15 per cent while net profit may drop due to higher pet coke prices.


FMCG PREVIEW
A gradual recovery in rural demand may support the performance of FMCG companies. However, a below normal monsoon remains a concern. Companies are likely to raise product prices to pass on the higher input costs.


IT
A sharp depreciation of 4.3 per cent sequentially and 8.1 per cent annually in the average rate of the rupee against the dollar and momentum in projects on the digital platform will be the key growth drivers for the sector in the September quarter. TCS and HCL Technologies are expected to fare better while Wipro may continue to face pressure on the topline.


PHARMA PREVIEW
The September quarter performance of pharma companies is likely to indicate the bottoming out of price erosion in the US generics market. In the absence of any major launch in the US, companies are likely to report lack-lustre performance. There has also been rationalisation in the R&D expenses. The management commentary on the business prospects in the US market would be crucial.


METALS & MINING
Base metal companies such as Hindalco and Vedanta are likely to see a subdued quarter due to flat product prices year-on-year. LME aluminium prices were 2-3 per cent higher while LME zinc prices were down 10 per cent . A weak rupee would partially offset these negatives. JSW Steel and Tata Steel are likely to report decent quarters due to firm steel prices and weak rupee advantage.


POWER
Although monsoon is seasonally the weakest quarter for the sector, power companies are likely to report good growth. Power generation may grow by 6 per cent year-on-year. Higher merchant tariffs will help. It may turn out to be a decent quarter for a sector which has remained weak for the last several years.


TELECOM
The competitive pressure will continue to eat into profits and profitability of the telecom operators. Which means the commentary may not be much different for the second quarter compared with the past several quarters."
1,2018-10-08,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: The recent bloodbath in the domestic stocks has hurt small investors as hard as the country’s top billionaires.

The across-the-board selloff eroded market capitalisation of many bluechips, resulting in notional losses in the value of promoter stakes. 

Mukesh Ambani, who owns oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries, has $50.7 billion in wealth as of August 28, a day before the BSE Sensex hit an all-time high of 38,989.65 on August 29. He is now worth $39.5 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaire index shows.

The owner of the world’s largest oil refining hub at Jamnagar has lost all the gains he made so far this year on the surging shares of Reliance Industries, the second-most valued stock in India. RIL scrip has corrected 20 per cent (till Friday) from its all-time high of Rs 1,328.75 (hit on August 29). On Monday, RIL shares saw a 5 per cent rebound to trade at Rs 1,098 on BSE at 1300 hours.

Another group stock, Reliance Industrial Infrastructure, has lost 40 per cent of its market capitalisation (m-cap) so far this year. Year-to-date, Ambani's wealth has shrunken by $750-odd billions. 

Kumar Mangalam Birla, who owns the Aditya Birla group, saw eight group companies erode nearly Rs 60,000 crore in market value. Six of the eight listed stocks have declined up to 70 per cent this calendar, data available with Ace Equity suggests. Vodafone Idea (Rs 23,000 crore), Grasim Industries (Rs 16,000) and UltraTech Cement (Rs 14,000 crore) have been the biggest wealth destroyers. On Monday, Birla's wealth stood at $5.91 billion, against a high of $9.38 billion hit in January. Year-to-date, he has lost $3.16 billion. 

Gautam Adani, whose Adani Group has interests in ports, logistics, shipping and rail, coal mining and management and energy, with renewable and, thermal power generation and transmission and agro commodities, has taken a $3.8 billion hit year-to-date, data showed.

Adani was worth over $11 billion in earlier in January. On Monday, he was worth $6.57 billion.

Among five of the group’s listed stocks, four – namely Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (SEZ), Adani Power and Adani Transmission – have lost Rs 40,494 crore in combined market value this calendar. Adani Green, the renewable energy business, on Monday traded at Rs 32, marginally higher than its June 2018 listing price of Rs 30.

Vikram Lal of Eicher Motors, known for iconic motorbike brand Royal Enfield, has lost $2.63 billion from his networth so far this year to $4.24 billion. Eicher Motors shares are down 28 per cent year-to-date, but traded with solid gains on Monday.

Wipro’s Azim Premji, steel tycoon and ArcelorMittal owner Lakshmi Mittal, Sun Pharma’s Dilip Shanghvi and Shree Cement’s Benu Gopal Bangur have seen wealth erosion of $1-2 billion erosion in 2018."

The Nifty50 opened in the positive and witnessed a strong recovery of around 180 points to settle Wednesday’s session at 10,480. The index finally negated the formation of lower highs after six sessions and formed a bullish candle on a daily scale.

Recently, it had taken support at its rising trend line by connecting the major swing lows of 6,825, 7,893 and 10,200 levels on the weekly chart. Now an immediate hold above 10,350 can extend its bounce towards 10,500-10,550 zone and even higher, while on the downside, supports are seen at 10,300 and then 10,200 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 10,000, followed by 10,500, while maximum Call OI was at 11,000 followed by 10,800. There was Put writing at 10,400 and 10,500 levels, while Call unwinding was seen at all the immediate strike prices.

The option band signified a hold of support at lower levels with a broader trading band between 10,300 and 10,600 levels.

India VIX fell 9.38 per cent to 17.91. A decline in VIX from higher levels with a topping out formation has resulted in short-term stability and triggered an immediate bounceback. Now VIX has to further cool down below 16-15 levels to extend the market recovery.

Bank Nifty formed a strong bullish candle with the bigger real body of gains of around 3 per cent and almost recovered the losses made in the previous week. It saw a strong momentum till the end of the session led by buying interest in many private and PSU banks. Now it has to cross and hold above 25,000 to extend its bounce towards 25,500 and then 25,650 levels, while on the downside, support is seen at 24,750.

Nifty futures closed positive at 10,468with a gain of 1.50 per cent. Longs were seen in Bajaj Finance, NIIT Tech, KSCL, Repco Home, Kotak Bank, ZEEL, PVR and ICICI Bank, while shorts were seen in Shree Cement, Bharti Infratel, Infosys and TCS, among others.

5,2018-10-11,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Mirroring weakness in global stocks, domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty received severe blows on Thursday, as stocks fell like a pack of cards amid brisk selling across sectors. 

Yet, the Indian market was better off compared with its Asian peers, which sank up to 6 per cent. Taiwan’s TSEC 50 Index plummeted 6 per cent, Shanghai SE Composite Index 5 per cent and Nikkei225 4 per cent. 

FPI outflows in the wake of a strengthening dollar, rising bond yields in the US and wobbly global crude oil prices worsened the plight of emerging markets, including India. 

The Sensex closed the day 760 points, or 2.19 per cent, down at 34,001, while Nifty settled 225 points, or 2.16 per cent, lower at 10,234.

Midcaps and smallcaps fell in line with the benchmark index, with the midcap index plunging 2.34 per cent and smallcap index settling 1.41 per cent. 


Let’s walk you through the highlights of Thursday's session:

Rupee inched near 74.50The rupee inched closer to the 74.50 mark against dollar amid buying in American currency by banks and exporters. The US Federal Reserve’s apparent determination to increase interest rates over the next 12 months has driven up US Treasury yields, which have been further bolstered by good economic data. However, rupee recovered a little as trade progressed. At the time of writing of this report, the domestic currency traded at 74.10, down by 11 paise. 


Who dragged my SensexAll but three stocks -- ONGC, YES Bank and Hindustan Unilever -- suffered losses in the Sensex pack. Infosys emerged the top drag, followed by HDFC, Tata Consultancy Services, State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank. Falling nearly 6 per cent, SBI was the top loser in terms of percentage loss. Tata Steel, Vedanta, Mahindra & Mahindra and Infosys lost up to 4 per cent. 


Rs 2.63 lakh cr investor wealth goneThursday’s trading turned terrible for the domestic equity market, as investors lost more than Rs 2.63 lakh crore of their wealth as market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms declined to Rs 135.77 lakh crore from Rs 138.40 lakh crore.

Besides a slight slump in global crude prices, reports that the government may not push oil companies to share increased subsidy burden set the mood for the OMCs. However, Reliance Industries and Oil India declined up to 1.19 per cent. The BSE Oil & Gas index closed the day 2.88 per cent higher at 12,879.

Let's run you through today's market highlights:

Oil prices at two-month lowOil prices fell near $75 a barrel to its lowest since late August on concerns of weak demand and ample supply after Saudi Arabia promised that it will keep oil market adequately supplied in the wake of US sanctions on Iran. Moreover, a fall in global equities due to weak prospects of economic growth amid fears of an intensifying trade war cast their shadow. According to Reuters, the International Energy Agency expects a slower oil demand growth for 2019 due to a slowing economy.


Rupee gains weightThe oil cool-off rubbed off on the rupee as the domestic currency closed higher today, offering more hope to market participants. Rupee's rise is a major relief for the market as current account deficit swells on a weak rupee, which distorts India's macroeconomic mathematics. 


Who moved my Sensex?Bharti Airtel, surging 11 per cent, stood out as the top Sensex gainer, followed by Asian Paints (up 4.49 per cent), IndusInd Bank (3.21 per cent), HDFC (3.02 per cent), Hindustan Unilever (2.06 per cent) and Larsen & Toubro (1.76 per cent).

Airtel's stellar showShares of telecom giant Bharti Airtel shot up on Wednesday on reports of fundraising through stake sale in its Africa business. Airtel Africa, a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel, on Wednesday said it raised $1.25 billion through a primary equity issuance from six global investors, including SoftBank Group Corp, Warburg Pincus and Temasek Holdings. The funds will be used to reduce existing debt of about $5 billion and grow its Africa operations, Airtel said in a regulatory filing. Shares of the company closed 10.79 per cent up at Rs 316.75 on the BSE. 


Bajaj Auto plumbed 52-week lowBajaj Auto plunged nearly 5 per cent to its 52-week low of Rs 2,460 on the BSE today, before closing at Rs 2,475.30, still down 4.30 per cent. The stock dropped even as the company posted a 4 per cent year-on-year rise in profit at Rs 1,152 crore for July-September. Total revenue jumped 21.63 per cent to Rs 7,986.79 crore in Q2 FY19 over Rs 6,566.43 crore in Q2 FY18.

On the other hand, Grandeur Products, Sportking India, Tiaan Ayurvedic & Herbs, Coastal Corporation, Dalal Street Investments and Kothari World Finance featured among 28 stocks that scaled 52-week highs.


Rs 1.05 lakh crore wealth createdThe cumulative market capitalisation of BSE companies jumped by 1.05 lakh crore as the m-cap jumped to 1,35,24,629 crore from Rs 1,34,19,627 crore today.

0,2018-11-19,Shree Cement,"I would bet that metal -- ferrous as well as non-ferrous -- would see a better price regime hereafter, but cement as a commodity would be doing even better than metal, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How closely are you tracking the telecom story? Are they investment worthy just yet?Definitely. The hike in could mean a little bit of a breather, coupled with the government considering some kind of moratorium for payment of AGR dues. Some kind of a lifeline would be available to the incumbent telecom companies. This is where you might see some amount of market interest getting revived in these companies. 

However, the fundamental point of view remains whether these companies would be in a position to attract new money into the books and probably expand infrastructure which is required. At the same time, they would be in a position to offload some of the infrastructure assets that they have been carrying in their books into separate companies or InvITs and probably release that bandwidth of money for reaching the last mile as far as the connectivity to the consumer is concerned. All these issues would remain interesting to watch out for. In my view point, it is not a simple proposition though I do agree that concessions on AGR dues as well as this hike would mean some amount of breathing space for these stocks and probably the market would also see a little upside in these stocks.


What is your take on Tata Steel?I can see the company has a complete control over the cost management part of the business. Wherever assets are not producing enough bottom line performance, they are unlocking those assets and getting out of the business. That is a corrective strategy which is leading to a better cost structure. Should we see a larger trade treaty between India and the US, we would have a greater stability in various commodity prices globally. I would bet that metal -- ferrous as well as non-ferrous -- would see a better price regime hereafter. 

In such situations, most of the Indian companies should also benefit because India is in the capex mode and various infrastructure projects are underway. The demand scenario is not doubted in the country. So there is demand and price stability. When commodity companies have lower input cost in form of crude oil on power related cost, it is a win-win combination for this cyclical industry. Maybe you should see relative stability into the commodity and stock prices here after.

We have been seeing an up move on some of the cement stocks. Buy calls are coming from those who believe the cyclical upturn will unlock a lot of opportunity in some of the cement names. Are you looking at cement stocks?We probably have a conviction that cement as a commodity would be far better than metal commodity proposition. It would have a relatively higher amount of demand scenario. The thrust is on infrastructure and at the same time, efforts are being made to revive the construction industry. From that perspective, cement would see better times going forward. 

Fortunately, the price regime is quite stable as far as the cement outlook goes and that is once again positive. The input costs are also remaining positive. We like some of the regional plays. The companies which have larger capacity operating from a good region like Ramco Cement, is where we preferred these kind of companies. 

Even the UltraTech kind of a pan India companies also remain quite a strong play going forward as also Shree Cement. Selectively we like companies with a larger capacity where they get the advantage of this kind of a better demand scenario and better price outlook. So, cement is certainly a commodity play. 


RBL Bank is a stock where the street is divided. Is the worst behind it or are a lot of skeletons still left in the cupboard?I would like to believe that the worst is behind but honestly would not be fully comfortable till the time I see some validation of these assumptions. The bank probably has the ability to come out of this particular situation but this particular situation should be seen for at least one more quarter after which if they give no negative surprises. After that, probably I would like to confirm that the worst is behind them."

2,2018-11-27,Shree Cement,"Who does not want big compounders in an equity portfolio? There are 14 multibaggers on Dalal Street that reported over 100 per cent rise in September quarter profit along with an increase in top line. And many analysts look positive on them. Good case to take a serious look at these names?

With a 37,834 per cent leap in 10 years, Avanti Feeds emerged top gainer on the list. The scrip jumped to Rs 528.60 on November 22 from just Rs 1.40 on November 23, 2009. The company, engaged in shrimp processing and manufacturing of prawn and fish feeds, reported a 155 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit in Q2FY20 on over 41 per cent rise in net sales.

But the stock trades at a price 47 per cent below its all-time high of Rs 1,000.

In Q2FY20, average shrimp prices (Mexican Shrimp-30 count) in the international markets reached $13.1 a kg (up 10% YoY), which resulted in a spike in domestic farm gate prices to Rs 430-450 a kg, benefitting the sector, Edelweiss Professional Investor Research said in a report.

“We have revised our earnings estimates for the company upward by 12 per cent for FY20E and 13.5 per cent for FY21E,” Edelweiss said about Avanti Feeds in a October note.

Fairchem Speciality (up 5,073 per cent), Alkyl Amines Chemicals (up 3005 per cent) and Deepak Nitrite (up 2,713 per cent) are other similar cases on top of the list.

Fairchem posted an 837 per cent YoY rise in September quarter net profit, while Deepak Nitrite grew its bottom line 532 per cent and Alkyl Amines 106 per cent. These companies also posted 50-150 per cent increase in net sales for the quarter.

Equentis is positive on Deepak Nitrite (DNL) with a 15-18 month price target of Rs 431-462.



“DNL is favourably positioned to capture opportunities emerging across the chemicals and specialty chemicals landscape. We expect 16 per cent CAGR revenue growth and 27 per cent CAGR PAT growth over FY19-24E. We assign a ‘Buy’ rating to the stock. Going ahead, we expect DNL to benefit strongly from the healthy outlook for the India chemicals industry, which is growing at 8-10 per cent annually,” the brokerage said.

Other players on the list came from trading, rubber and plastic products, consumer foods, breweries and distilleries, real estate, pharma, cement and agriculture sectors, among others.

Black Rose Industries, which posted 113 per cent YoY rise in net profit in Q2, rose from Rs 2.10 in 2009 to Rs 81 as of November 22, 2019. Cupid, Kingfa Science & Technologies, DFM Foods, Shervani Industrial Syndicate, Associated Alcohols, Suven Life Sciences and Venky’s India gained 1,000-2,700 per cent in last 10 years.

Kolkata-based investors Soumya Malani and Arun Mukherjee in a recent note said Kingfa is set to report highest annual sales and profits since inception this financial year.
“Anything that can do so well under such slowdown only showcases what it can do when the sentiments changes for good. We remain positive on the future prospect of the company,” they wrote.

Among the established names, shares of Indraprastha Gas jumped 1,125 per cent and those of Shree Cement 1,088 per cent since November 23, 2009.

Shares of Venky’s India, Shervani Industrial Syndicate, Cupid, Kingfa Science, Associated Alcohol are still down over 50 per cent from their respective all-time highs, while Alkyl Amines is short of its record high by 5 per cent, IGL and Suven Life Sciences by 8 per cent each.

KR Choksey Shares and Securities earlier this month gave a ‘buy’ recommendation on Indraprastha Gas (IGL) with a price target of Rs 498.

“We continue to be positive on the long-term performance of the stock, with IGL being a strong player in city gas distribution (CGD) segment. Rising environmental concerns in NCR region will likely lead to encouraging conversions of automobiles creating higher demand,” the brokerage said.

3,2018-12-14,Shree Cement,"The three months to December could turn out to be rather disappointing for investors in cement stocks as prices remain stagnant, or show insignificant growth, in a quarter that marks the beginning of the seasonally strong period of demand for the industry.

According to various estimates, in the past two weeks, cement players have been unable to raise prices, and all-India selling rates have shown an insignificant growth of 2 per cent.

There are several factors that have discouraged cement players from raising prices in the December quarter.

Over the past three to four years, cement demand has shifted disproportionately to the non-trade segment from trade, which otherwise fetches higher margins and better realisations. The non-trade segment comprises companies, governments and other entities that directly buy cement from the manufacturers. Trade segment means manufacturers selling cement to distributors and dealers, which sell to retail customers.

Within the non-trade segment, infrastructure is driving demand but it is not enough to encourage players to raise prices as infrastructure segment accounts for 15-20 per cent of cement demand.

The trade segment attracts demand from housing sector, which generates 60-65 per cent of cement consumption. Since construction has slowed down in the housing sector, the demand from the trade segment has been fairly unstable and almost stagnant. Besides this, in the non-trade segment analysts point out that payments from the government entities have been slow. This has affected the working capital cycle, which in turn has created liquidity issues.



Incremental capacity addition has also been a key factor. In the next three years ending FY21, the industry would expand capacity by 60-65MT. This incremental capacity will likely limit any scope for players to raise prices as the focus would be on generating volumes instead of value. In such a situation, companies would not benefit from the softening in coal and diesel prices as they will have to pass on these benefits by selling cement at relatively attractive rates.

The lack of pricing power is likely to persist for at least two years as demand from the real estate sector, which accounts for the bulk of the sales, has been rather weak. Given these factors, there would be pressure on operating profit margins at least for the second half of the present fiscal. This indicates falling or flat realisations on sale of cement.

Taking into account these factors, it is very likely that demand may improve only in select pockets — in specific regions — than on a pan-India basis. The eastern and central regions are likely to see relatively stable demand, especially from the infrastructure and lowcost housing segments. Shree Cement, Heidelberg Cement, Ultratech Cement, and Ambuja Cements have strong presence in these regions."
4,2018-12-21,Shree Cement,"The profitability of Indian cement companies should recover from the recent lows, but the pace will be slower than expected, said Morgan Stanley, downgrading its view on the industry to ‘in-line’.

The financial services company has downgraded UltraTech Cement to ‘equalweight’ from ‘overweight’ and cut target price by 17 per cent to Rs 4,116. It has also cut rating on Grasim Industries to ‘equalweight’ and lowered target price by 25.5 per cent to Rs 958.

Morgan Stanley has maintained ‘underweight’ ratings on Shree Cement and JK Lakshmi Cement, and an ‘equalweight’ rating on Ambuja Cement. ACC is Morgan Stanley’s only ‘overweight’ rated stock in the sector due to operating leverage and valuation relative to history.

Shares of UltraTech Cement ended down 1 per cent at Rs 4,047.30. Grasim Industries ended down 3.1 per cent at Rs 830.90.

Cement companies’ earnings in the first half of the ongoing financial year 2018-19 (April-March) was disappointing due to weaker-than-expected cement prices and higher costs, said Morgan Stanley.

The firm raised FY19 demand growth estimate to 9 per cent from 7.5 per cent due to strong first half of financial year 2018-19. However, it sees downside risks in the urban and semi-urban real estate segment even as infrastructure-led demand is likely to be sustained.

Morgan Stanley expects industry capacity utilization to rise a modest 1 percentage point from a year ago in the next financial year 2019-20, to 79 per cent. Potential moderation in demand in the second half of FY19 also caps upside risk to prices, said Morgan Stanley."
0,2019-01-04,Shree Cement,"The Nifty 50 companies are expected to report moderation in topline growth for the third-quarter of FY19 on account of slowing momentum in some sectors and a stronger growth base in the previous year’s corresponding quarter. The growth may be faster in the fourth-quarter as the benefit of lower raw material costs to manufacturing companies is expected to reflect fully by then.

According to ETIG estimates, the aggregate revenue is likely to grow at an eight-quarter low of 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter compared with 13 per cent growth in the year-ago quarter.

Net profit will grow by 6.7 per cent, making it a third consecutive quarter of single-digit growth. Automobiles, cement, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and telecom companies may report subdued numbers, whereas private sector banks, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and information technology (IT) companies may show improvement.



“In the December 2018 quarter, we will see the impact of lower industrial metal prices. Crude prices also have fallen. This will help consumers of commodities and crude oil -based fuel and raw materials. The rupee depreciated by 9 per cent, which will affect importers and borrowers of foreign capital,” said Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities. Except tin, other metal prices have fallen by 14-26 per cent while the crude price has dropped by 24 per cent from the year-ago quarter.

The operating margin is expected to be marginally lower by 30 basis points (bps; 100 bps = 1 percentage point) to 20.5 per cent year-on-year.

Analysts believe that growth may resume in FY 20 as stability gradually sets in the banking sector thereby improving credit availability in the system. The street expects 18-28 per cent growth in the Nifty 50 earnings per share. “This will be facilitated largely by the turnaround in corporate banks’ profitability. However, performance of the other key sectors of oil and gas, and metals could depend on global growth conditions and domestic policies.”


Sector Trends

AUTOMOBILESSales volumes of the majority of listed auto companies either fell or grew in single-digits barring Bajaj Auto. Average discount level remained elevated amid dismal festive demand and mounting dealer inventory. This is likely to put further pressure on margins of auto companies.


BANKINGProvisioning requirement is expected to reduce as the rate of new bad loans reported by banks gradually abates. A lower yield on longterm government bonds should result in higher treasury income. These factors may support profit growth.


CAPITAL GOODSA sustained order flow from the government will support topline growth in the December quarter. Execution is picking up as companies have reduced the proportion of slow moving orders over the past few quarters.

The commentary by Larsen & Toubro, the country’s largest infrastructure company, will be keenly watched since the number of order wins that the company reported to the stock exchanges during the quarter was lower than expected.


CEMENTAll-India average cement price fell by nearly 2 per cent to Rs 308 per 50kg bag year-on-year in the December 2018 quarter. Intense competition has kept players away from raising prices even though demand has improved marginally across regions. Realisations therefore may remain under pressure despite lower raw material prices. Large-sized companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cement, Dalmia Bharat and Shree Cement are likely to post 10-15 per cent volume growth, but their revenue growth will be capped at 3-9 per cent.


FMCG PREVIEWFactors including the extent of festive demand and the effect of lower GST rates will be crucial for the FMCG sector. Rural demand, which has been a key growth driver for the past few quarters, may show signs of moderation. Flaring crude oil prices in the previous quarter will have a lag effect on the sector’s margins in the form of higher input costs. A drop in GST rates may offer some respite.


IT
A weaker rupee against the dollar will boost realisations of the IT exporters though the benefit will be marginally offset by unfavourable movement in other major currencies. The dollar-denominated growth may remain at 2-3 per cent quarter-on-quarter given a seasonally weak quarter.


METALSPrices of most commodities declined in the December quarter. Steel price declined nearly 15 per cent, a negative for players such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel. A drop in the aluminium price will affect Hindalco and Vedanta. Vedanta, which has an oil exploration division, would also be impacted due to the falling crude prices.


PHARMAPharma companies may report subdued performance given the headwinds in the US and the domestic markets. A deceleration in price erosion in the US generics market may offer some relief to pharma exporters. Investors would be keen on seeking clarification from Sun Pharma on corporate governance front."
1,2019-01-08,Shree Cement,"In the past year, the Nifty Midcap 100 index has fallen close to 9.4%. In this steep fall, there are select quality midcaps which could show a reasonably good earnings recovery. Historical data point out that in a long-duration cycle (more than five years), the recovery in earnings growth in mid-sized companies has been far higher than big ones. Keeping this in mind, investors who intend to participate in such growth stories may consider investing in schemes that have particular focus on quality mid-sized companies.

Among such schemes, Kotak Emerging Equity is placed well as it has developed quite a diversified portfolio in the midcap universe. The scheme invests 80% of its corpus in mid caps, close to 7% in large caps and 12.25% small caps. Such diversification in size and themes (bottom-up stock selection approach) has paid off for the scheme as the scheme’s fund manager Pankaj Tibrewal has put up commendable performance especially in the longer duration. The scheme has given 11% and 23 % returns in the past three- and five year periods, while its benchmark index, Nifty Midcap 100 TRI, has given 10% an 18.5% in the same period, respectively. This scheme is strictly for investors who believe in the market wisdom of high risk, high return investment.

Expert Take

Harshvardhan Roongta,
CFP, Roongta Securities
This is a pure mid-cap fund which has been in existence since 2007. For a mid-cap scheme it is important to evaluate its performance on the basis of how it has managed the sharp downturn in the markets. During the bearish phase, the scheme’s returns have fallen lesser than its benchmark index and in the bullish phase, it has given higher returns. This scheme is suitable for investors willing to take higher risks and hold it for at least five years."

5,2019-01-24,Shree Cement,"Reliance Securities has a buy call on Shree Cements with a target price of Rs 19,600.

The current market price of Shree Cements is Rs 15,823.20.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Shree Cements price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage-

Double-digit sales volume growth drives revenue: SRCM’s sales volume grew by a healthy 11.4 per cent YoY (+5 per cent QoQ) to 5.93mnT (including clinker of 0.29mnT). Notably, cement volume stood at 5.64mnT (+7.4 per cent YoY and +4 per cent QoQ), while clinker volume grew strongly by 292 per cent YoY and 37 per cent QoQ aided by healthy demand environment in its key markets. Consequently, its revenue grew by 21 per cent YoY (+8 per cent QoQ) to Rs27.8bn. Power volume stood at 446mn units (+63 per cent YoY and +12 per cent QoQ) with an average tariff of Rs 4.96/unit (+32 per cent YoY and +10 per cent QoQ).


Healthy operating performance on firm realisations and profitability from power: Better-than-estimated improvement in realisation and superior profitability from power division aided SRCM to report better operating performance with adjusted EBITDA increasing by 21 per cent YoY to Rs6.9bn vs. our estimate of Rs6.4bn. Cement operating cost/tonne stood at Rs 3,247 against Rs 3,051 and Rs 3,322 in 3QFY18 and 2QFY19, respectively. We expect SRCM’s operating performance to improve further in subsequent quarters mainly due to the recent decline in fuel prices.


Outlook & valuation: We believe SRCM has been moving in the right direction in its pursuit to dominate the markets by adding capacity at regular intervals, which we believe will help the Company to grow market share with strong profitability without much stress on the balance sheet. Hence, its premium multiple is expected to sustain, which can be supported by thin liquidity and meagre non-institutional holdings. Recent commissioning of new capacities is likely to aid SRCM to gain further traction, going forward. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with a downwardly upwardly revised target price of Rs 19,600 (16x FY21 EBITDA)."
0,2019-02-01,Shree Cement,"The government's decision to increase allocation to Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) by 22% augurs well for cement manufacturers amid weak demand for more than three years. The government raised the allocation to PMGSY to Rs 19,000 crore from Rs 15,500 crore according to the revised estimates for the current fiscal.

Among cement players, Ultratech Cement, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat, The Ramco Cements and Ambuja Cements are expected to benefit from this increase in allocation to PMGSY. 

Rural cement demand is expected to grow better than the urban demand. Nearly half of the cement demand from road construction is attributed to PMGSY. Under the scheme, the government has connected 15.8 lakh habitations or 89% of the total rural habitations through pucca roads. 

Under PMGSY scheme, the government has targeted construction of 57,000 km of rural roads. According to various analysts' estimates, road construction under PMGSY has grown at compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5% in the past five years ending FY17. In the next three years ending FY21, this scheme is expected to generate cement demand in the range of 42-47 MT."
1,2019-02-07,Shree Cement,"Coal India, NBCC, IDFC Bank First, Ashok Leyland and Eicher are going to be marquee names where you will 
  
  
  make money, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP, Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is your take on the RBI policy? Is the rate cut of 25 bps what the markets were looking forward to? What did you make of it?
The rate cut has left all the analysts on the sidelines of both the equity market and on the credit side. Nobody was expecting a rate cut and nobody was talking of Nifty at 11,000 and beyond. Those are both proverbial points. Now credit will expand over a period of time but the sentiment is extremely positive. 

The new RBI governor has done a lot to reinstate confidence in PSU banks, in NBFCs and over a period of time, I see most of the problems getting sorted out. There is an overhang from the IL&FS issue but a large part of that is telling you that some of the NBFCs which have stretched themselves extra are definitely going to be hit. 

But the larger picture is that banks are going to be in a sweet spot because they may not transmit the entire 25 bps and cost of funds will fall for them. Also you are in an environment where inflation, yields are at multi-year lows. This is much in order, given that even the Fed is now sounding dovish. 

On equity markets, the left out feeling was there and most people are still doubting the rally because selective largecaps have made this high. The broader market has still underperformed but that is the way equity markets are. The broader market may start to catch up and you could see consolidation in the largecaps.


You believe that auto is a good contrarian bet. You like Eicher as well as Ashok Leyland. What is the rationale?
I liked Eicher very much below Rs 20,000, Maruti at Rs 6,500 and Ashok Leyland at Rs 81. All three have given a stellar rally. The rationale was that autos for the last three years has been the biggest consumption driver. There has been one or two quarters of NBFC fiasco and the insurance part may have played out negatively. Consumption spending is coming back and we are very bullish on the broader market. 

Autos as a consumer discretionary will see valuations very much in buyer’s favour if you were buying the fear. I continue to be overweight on Maruti, Eicher, Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland by the way will be the largest bus-maker not in India, but globally. They are getting huge traction on some of the EU orders on electric vehicles and so on.

The bus and the LCV market is now looking very bright for slightly longer term. Autos and metals as a contrarian have played out well. We still think there is at least 10% upside in the likes of Maruti and Eicher.


What exactly is your take on the cement space? The overall demand-supply mismatch has narrowed down significantly. What is the view on the general trend within the cement basket?
Cement has been a slight bit of a laggard in the sense that volumes may have played out but margins and the price of petcoke has affected profitability. But this is a one to two quarter hiatus. 

Low-cost housing continues to be the theme and let us not look at the next three months, but months beyond the election. You will see a huge capex from both the private and the government side gathering steam and cement is a no-brainer. If you have a slightly longer-term view, on this correction, accumulate UltraTech and ACC. You can add JK Lakshmi Cement and Shree Cement. Shree Cement by the way came out with the best numbers as their margins were highest amongst the lot and that trend can continue. Cement and commodities could be a huge outperformer in the second half of 2019.


How have you looked at the steps that have been taken? These efforts to create fewer but stronger banks with large balance sheets?
These are welcome steps. You merge some of the bad apples with the good ones and you are opening that synergies of space and more economies of scale play out. Obviously, it will have short-term dampener because the bad banks will take time to be recapitalised. But banks have been well recapitalised and if you stick with the larger ones, then there is a huge amount of wealth to be created given capex revival and write-backs for corporate facing banks. The likes of State Bank, BOB and Can Bank can be huge outperformers. 

Their numbers will prove from the March quarter, when we see a lot of write-backs on infra, power and some of the resolutions of IBC. IBC is the powerful tool. Only, these stocks can take some time before the return on balance sheet improves. It is a very welcome step if you get fewer banks with more consolidation and mergers, but in the short run, they may not create too much wealth for you. It is only in the longer term that they play out well.


What is view on Coal India and NMDC?
Coal India is a proverbial value play with 8.5% dividend yield and the results this quarter will be the best in 18 quarters. At 11 times price to earnings, I have never seen it cheaper. Obviously there is the overhang that at Rs 260, the government sold some of its stake and so on but PSU stocks are trading at abysmal levels. ONGC, NTPC, GMDC, even Coal India. Once we are through elections, PSUs will create a lot of wealth in the second half.

We have seen that most of the PSUs have been performing excellently in their business lines. So, Coal India becomes a no-brainer. I do not rule out a 25% upside. I know it has been a laggard but that is where a value pick comes. 

With that, you can also add NBCC, one of my old stocks which has not performed much but I can reiterate that this is an excellent company. It has pan India visibility in tier I, tier II cities where order flows and construction activity are picking up in a big way. 

GMDC dividend yield is extremely attractive and NMDC also, given that iron ore prices are moving up. This means the steel cycle and commodities are expected to do well globally. Definitely, these would be contrarian buys with a 25% upside by the end of the year.


Which are the pockets that could take the markets higher in the next phase? 
Autos, metals, consumption and construction are looking good. As a sector, consumption has been a huge outperformer -- whether it is durables or discretionary or staples. Even though valuations are looking stretched, they still seem to be the best place to be. The other caveat is that we have had a very good rally from 10,500 back to 11,200. Nifty maybe pricing in everything here. You may consolidate but not see too much on upside over there. 

It is the broader market which I think can come back and that will again depend on soothening of a lot of ex-factor, the ADAG problem, DHFL. Sooner, rather than later, people will try to get into better names like IDFC Bank First. I have been extremely bullish on this stock. This is a doubler in next two years. It is going to be one of the biggest gainers on the fiasco. So be stock specific.

Coal India, NBCC, IDFC Bank First, Ashok Leyland and Eicher are going to be marquee names where you will make money, but I think maybe the index is done for the time being. You will wait for more colour, closer to the election but it will be the broader market which should stand to gain in the next month or so. 


When will L&T start performing?
That is a good question but you have to be patient. Look at the numbers from Siemens, Cummins. They are both telling you that industrial capex is reviving. The L&T management is extremely bullish. Remember that these stocks will not trade at a significant discount to better valuations because in two quarters they can come out with numbers which they have not done in 12 quarters. 

So L&T, ITC are no-brainers. If you are a value investor, you will make a lot of money. The problem is they may have been in range for some time and the market is justly rewarding some of the outperformers. But these are extremely good stocks to own and must-haves in your portfolio."

3,2019-02-26,Shree Cement,"When 54,000 tonne of MP Birla cement was despatched from its seven pan-Indian units — the most in a single day for the century-old group — Sandip Ghosh could not help but feel vindicated. Along with his introvert boss Harsh Vardhan Lodha, the former Unilever and Lafarge executive and a clutch of professionals have been the biggest change agents for an empire that has braved generational changes, bereavements and a legal tumult over two decades, emerging reinvigorated.

It’s been a trudge, sometimes downright frustrating. Blending legacies with agility and efficiency initiatives is always fraught with risks of disruption. Then there’s the Rs 4,800-crore acquisition of Reliance Cements, which catapulted the flagship business into the top 8, bringing in premier brands, modern plants, access to raw material and an opportunity to expand.

“When I came on board,” quips Ghosh, executive director, Birla Corporation, “I was seeking a good closing innings for my professional career. After three and a half years, I can smile (and look) back with satisfaction.” No doubt, Ghosh has the last laugh, riding on a 1,314% jump in market cap over 10 years.


SCENE I
It’s not too long ago that the clannish, conservative Marwari business community had given up on the MP Birla Group — cement, jute, cables, guar gum et al. In 1999, matriarch Priyamvada Birla courted sensation by bequeathing her husband’s entire empire to her friend, consigliere and chartered accountant RS Lodha and his family. The fierce legal challenge from a unified Birla clan was inevitable. What was unfathomable was how a “professional” and “family outsider” would withstand it.

But the zealously private Harsh Vardhan, who took over after his father RS Lodha’s death in 2008, thinks differently. Single-minded in focus and mandate, he says, “Size doesn’t matter. Our goal is to be the most profitable.” It’s typical Alex Ferguson management copybook from a diehard Manchester United fan. As a school friends puts it, “Don’t let his introverted self or baby face trick you. It completely belies his drive and dedication. He’s a man out to prove himself.”




Under Lodha’s watch, even the lossmaking jute business at Birlapur, the first manufacturing unit of the entire Birla Group, has turned profitable and is diversifying into fashion, lifestyle and ecofriendly packaging.

The group’s networth has more than doubled since 2004 to Rs 11,000 crore, including unlisted and investment companies. Over the last five years, listed flagship Birla Corp, which houses the largest business in the portfolio, has outperformed Nifty’s 12% returns with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.20%. For the cables business, it is even more stark — an average of over 50%.

“The group has been growing from strength to strength,” agrees Hemant Kanoria, chairman, Srei Group. “Profitability is improving. Group companies are clocking growth.”

The legal battles, claims and counter-claims of fraud, malfeasance and misconduct are still dragging on, but away from the kerfuffle, employees are revitalised and processes streamlined. Naturally, profitability has seen a big upswing.

“I was very pleasantly surprised to see his (Lodha’s) remarkable efforts and capabilities to provide leadership to Birla Corp and make it one of the fastest growing and successful enterprises from eastern India,” adds namesake Harshavardhan Neotia, chairman, Ambuja Neotia Group, another corporate headquartered in Kolkata.


CEMENTING SUCCESS
There are three principal pillars to this change — people, marketing and operations. In a group that’s always been proud of its matriarchal value systems, Lodha has had to imbibe change gradually. And nowhere is this more evident than the cement operations. Capacity has ramped up to 15.5 million tonnes per annum, from 10 mtpa, with plans to double it by 2025.

Unlike several of its peers that are battling post-merger integration challenges, Birla Corp has seamlessly integrated Reliance’s operations within two years. It was actually an acquisition on a rebound, after its initial plans of buying two of Lafarge’s units got stuck over transfer of mines.




“If we didn’t buy, we would have been in trouble,” admits Pracheta Majumdar, chief management adviser, Birla Corp. “Earlier, even achieving 25,000 tonnes was a Herculean task. Our plants were old and strong brands almost nonexistent.” Now, the group has the widest portfolio, with brands at all important price points — from super premium to regional champions, popular and even niche ones for non-trade channels.

The Reliance capacities are all running at 85%-plus while bigger competitors are struggling to scale up to 60% plant capacity. Of total volumes, 32% is premium grade, from nil only three years ago, while 87% is blended cement.

“MP Birla’s new management has become more aggressive,” says Hari Mohan Bangur, managing director, Shree Cement, another community patriarch. “They are doing well in the market. Today, Birla Corp is an important name in the cement industry and has maintained its market share.”

Riding piggyback, brand and services extensions such as chemicals and wall putty have also kicked off.

For the first time, an inhouse marketing team has been created to leverage the group’s heritage and enhance the brand identity that is built on heart and strength. The former is exemplified through numerous schools and charitable hospital trusts, and the latter through cutting-edge joint ventures with premier MNCs — be it Ericsson, Solvay, ABB or Furukawa.

And though the history of alliances in India has been highly chequered, “MP Birla always chose the best global partner for technical expertise and R&D. The culture of JVs permeated deeply,” feels DR Bansal, a 53-year veteran, who has worked with all four chairmen, starting with MP Birla himself. “The goodwill is still intact under the leadership of the Lodhas.”

Of course, a strong brand with a clear message is imperative, especially for businesses such as cables or cement. Most Birla factions have interests in cement and their brands often compete. Ghosh explains, “From Orient Cement, to Birla A1 to Birla Gold or UltraTech, everyone is a Birla cement. It was sold as a commodity and people linked it to individual plants, which often ran as independent profit centres. It was critical to stand out.”

MP Birla Cement brand didn’t register, or even if it did, it was perceived as basic and low-brow. “In some markets, we were known as ‘Ghoda Chhap’ after Chetak, one of the heritage brands from Rajasthan. We had to undergo two levels of transition — at the group corporate level and through a harmonisation exercise to create defined brand architecture,” Ghosh adds.

By clearly defining brand propositions, cross-selling and branding became possible. That, in turn, helped bottomline and production ramp-ups. As a cascading effect, even future talent acquisitions became easier.

“Within the mid-tier group of Prism, MyCem and others, Birla Corp’s premiumisation efforts have paid off handsomely. It is 3x the volume of others and that is reflected in trade margins,” says a Mumbai-based cement analyst not wishing to be identified.

Even in the larger Birla empire, barring the AV Birla Group, most are floundering. CK Birla’s Orient clocked one of the worst results in the industry. BK Birla’s Kesoram and Century Cements too are struggling. In perspective, MP Birla has indeed come back strongly after a long hiatus.


DIVERSIFIED ACHIEVEMENTS
The company’s jute division has also improved after modernisation, including addition of a large number of new looms. From incurring a cash loss of Rs 13.03 crore in 2006-07, the division reached a cash profit of Rs 28.28 crore in 2017-18. In the December quarter of 2018-19, net jute sales grew 45.5% to Rs 95.6 crore. Ebidta, however, was subdued at RS 5.5 crore, largely due to surge in raw jute prices.

The listed trio of Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Cables comprise the cables business, which is expected to be rejigged to simplify operations. From manufacturing a variety of capacitors, optic fibre, power and telecom cables to engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) contracts, the bet is 4G and, more importantly, the impending 5G revolution.

“Over the next two to three years, we will be comfortable with our position as well as industry growth. To derisk and expand our cables business, we may look overseas,” says Lodha.

This business too has withstood turbulence since the time Harsh got associated with the business as a 20-something professional in the early 1990s, when Priyamvada Birla, or ‘Badi Ma,’ took charge after her husband’s death.




A disheartened senior management proposed a sell-off. “Badi Ma’s pragmatic business decision stopped the team from doing so,” recalls Lodha. The extra high voltage and high voltage cables segments relied heavily on government expenditure for infrastructure and power sectors, which did not live up to promise. “She realised the cables business would take time to stabilise before it starts paying off and asked the team to focus on making the business competitive and profitable, rather than entering a blame game for the losses,” he adds.

It paid off even as she took canny business decisions like shutting down the synthetics and carbide divisions, along with Bally Jute.

Lodha’s keen interest in the business and aptitude in handling sensitive situations since 2008 brought him close to his core team, many having worked for decades. “When he took over the reins, he was young and senior team members doubted his ability. Today, we have no doubts. Birla Furukawa has grown three times in fibre operations under him,” admits old-timer Bansal. The change of guard was seamless.

At 50 years of age, audacity comes naturally to Harsh Vardhan Lodha. “He is one of the rare breed who has the DNA of both an entrepreneur and a professional. That way he can rely on his gut instinct, yet be risk averse. It’s a perfect balance,” says a Kolkata-based investment banker, who has worked with him closely over the years. “So he lets his board and management work independently, but during strategic calls, he effortlessly leads from the front.”

Perhaps, counter-factually, if the inheritance had not accompanied such anguish, the Lodhas may have succumbed to cowboy bravado and perished. But with their every move under scrutiny, being sure-footed became second nature."
0,2019-03-05,Shree Cement,"Private banks and cement companies are where money would flow in said, Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder, 
Complete Circle Consultants, in an interview with ET Now. Also, one can be selective in consumption and tactical in OMCs, says Chadha. Edited excerpts: 


What is it that the market is pricing in? It seems this is a pre-election cheer which is coming in a tad too early?
It is a little early to call it pre-election cheers but what has happened is that while the entire market continues to focus on the geopolitical risk, a lot of other risks which the market was concerned about have abated a little bit. 

2018 was a year when we had some central banks hiking rates like in US and some of the emerging markets like India and Indonesia. There were some central bankers who were more accommodative. Probably this year you will see all central bankers being more accommodative. US is already indicating a pause in balance sheet contraction. India has already had a rate cut. China has now guided for lower end of the GDP at 6%. You could see both monetary and fiscal stimulus there. 

You will probably have a synchronised central bank accommodative stance this year which is positive for EMs. Also the threat of a full-blown trade war seems to have abated a little bit. Also India has really underperformed the EM basket. The emerging market index is up 11-12%. China is almost 18-20% up and we had underperformed. So. it could be a bit of catching up as well.


Which are those names which you would like to be part of your portfolio? Any particular segment within housing finance companies where you are more optimistic?
In the housing finance space, we have to differentiate the balance sheets. It looks to be a homogenous space, but it is not. A lot of the names have been under pressure -- the likes of Edelweiss or Repco or even Motilal because of their Aspire incurring losses. 

In case of L&T Finance, 60-65% of the book is mortgaged. The balance is developer loans and LAP. Also, NHP does not regulate HFCs as strongly as RBI does for some of the others in terms of banks. I also expect more regulation to come in once this crisis is fully taken care of. 

Within the HFC space, one safe bet is HDFC Limited. They have about six million homes which they have financed. They have a right combination of consumer and institutional book. Even if you see the institutional book, they are more focussed. The growth is coming from the lease rental discounting and construction finance and not much from the corporate loans to developers. We are a little selective here. I would consider something like a Can Fin in HFCs, where 80% of the book are linked to the salaried class, which again are mostly government employees. 

We have to watch out on the liability side. It should be more granular and on the lending side, the exposure to developer loans and the LAP should be a little lower. On consumer finance, the obvious position which I have been maintaining for long is Bajaj Finance. 


You seem to be betting on NCC. What kind of potential do you see over here? What is the long-term target price and do you believe now is a good time to enter?
We are positive on three fronts. They have a order book of more than Rs 34,000 crore, even in last quarter, they had a good EBIT with 12% margin. Most of these orders are government PSU backed. It is one of the largest construction companies right now. 

The only concern is the working capital days which is about the highest in the industry. Their receivable days are about 200 vis-à-vis about 120 for the industry. The safer bet could be L&T in the largecap space which is not necessarily construction, but the entire engineering construction -- the ECC space. In Q4, they have guided for almost Rs 40,000-50,000 crore of order book and in the first nine months, they were at about Rs 1.2 lakh crore.

If they have a Rs 40,000-50,000-crore order book, they will be on course to hit about 10% to 12% growth in orders and the good part is that there is improvement across the metrics. It is not only in terms of the diversification of orders. There are orders from hydrocarbons and refineries because the oil prices have been a little better. There are airports, water supply and they have this time re-categorised the orders into broadly four categories -- which is significant, large, major and mega. I am not really talking about the small orders which are Rs 1,000 crore. There is improvement in working capital cycle as well. So, in this space, we are fairly positive on largecap L&T and midcap NCC.


Tata Motors clocked it is best single day gain in about three years’ time. Do you think Tata Son’s business rejig to cut costs, the fact that they have assured that JLR turnaround is round the corner and the kind of rebound that we have seen in the Feb auto sales would that give you conviction to be a medium or long-term buyer in Tata Motors?
It is interestingly placed. If you see its sales breakup, the passenger cars actually grew 2% in Feb where the CV and the overall business was down. In case of JLR also, the US sales were up about 29%. If you add Germany, Italy and US and put together as a cluster minus China, it grew about 16%. 

There is lot of action in terms of ramping up their I-PACE model. There are couple of more SUV models on the Range Rover platform. So it will be an interesting space to watch out and I think Tata Motors has been attractive sub-200 for a long, long time. 

I think what has happened is that every quarter you had some disappointment or the other. I would like to watch out for Brexit and the China factor because that is where the high margin because US is mostly low margin sales. China is where they have the higher margin as well as volumes sales coming up. So, maybe with news of China cutting 3% VAT on manufacturing, there could be a slight improvement in their China sales.

In domestic business, the response to Harrier and some of the new SUVs which they are coming is quite good in terms of their dealer checks we have done. So it is an interesting one. If you want to buy it right now, maybe 20% now and then wait for a quarter and then maybe gradually accumulate.


Would you buy into Eicher sub Rs 20,000? The stock has recovered much from there and seeing a big move today?
A lot of pain was in the price when the stock was at around Rs 19,000 and sub 19,000. The numbers of February were also a little disappointing as it was approximately 64,000 units versus 70,000 which this fleet was expecting. If you look at it, the strike in one of their plants meant a loss of 3,000 units. So, it is a larger trend which is playing out here. I will not be a buyer right now on Eicher. I will try to wait and watch because I like to see two trends here, one is their new models which are at the 650 cc which is the Interceptor and the Terminator.

Also often not discussed is the commercial vehicle segment and they have some good technology in the medium weight commercial vehicles. We probably will have to see whether the CV cycle is on the downturn or it is a temporary phase. But it is good to add on dips. You can wait and watch for now on some of these auto names, but as I said lot of pain is in the price.


How are you playing the consumption theme? Do you believe that within the consumption space, you would tend to be very selective?
I would be. Every election in India is like a mini QE (quantitative easing). You see the cash in circulation goes up. It has already gone above the pre-DeMo level and a lot of the parallel side of the economy comes into the mainstream with the kind of spending we see.

We are already seeing government transferring about Rs 28,000 crore to the farmers which is part of the basic income support. There will be more loan waivers and as you get closer to election, there will be probably a lot of spending by the political parties. So. that makes me positive. 

There are two-three spaces I like here. The FMCG packs stands out, I like Nestle and HUL in the staples. Nestle is likely to launch about 13 t0 15 new products, you could have a topline growth of 15% after a long, long time and followed by a margin expansion or may be 80 to 100 bps. So, that looks attractive. 

HUL has come off a little bit in the last previous trading sessions. The food and the beverage segment after the acquisition would give them the distribution reach to add on to those gains so positive there. 

I also like some niche consumption plays which are like the pressure cooker and the kitchenware makers like a TTK prestige the market itself will probably grow 3 to 4x as rural areas are only 20-30% penetrated. 

I also like some of the while we have spoke about Info Edge right and Zomato probably the unlisted space has an advantage on the food aggregator side but I like Jubilant for the fact that there has been a good price correction. They are cutting down on their Dunkin Donuts outlets which did not pan out well. They have already cut down from 70 to about 35. The same store growth is about 20-21% and they are now venturing into the Chinese Kitchen which will probably give them some variety to take on to these food aggregator so those are some of the ideas in the space.


How would you approach not just OMCs but also some of the other names like ONGC and some of the gas names like MGL, IGL?
There are two parts to the portfolio. One is buy to hold which is your HDFC and Bajaj Finance and Asian Paints of the world and one is buy to sell. A lot of these OMCs, some of the PSU names you spoke about possibly fall there. One has to be a little tactical in OMCs. HPCL for example at sub-200 was a good buy. It was almost book value. 

Also we have to look at the marketing infrastructure. Some of these are virtually oligopolies. There are chances of obvious government regulating through tinkering with excise duties and subsidies. HPCL, in particular, is one of the largest lube based refineries in India. If I were to be a little tactical here, I will probably pick up HPCL. 

You are right about the city gas distributors. MGL looks very, very good. We are already seeing three-wheeler sales turning positive for most of the auto makers even in February. So domestic connections, increasing three wheelers moving to the CNG and slightly lesser regulation in the gas space compared to petrol and diesel, gives them an edge. 

But again you have to be more tactical here. Some of the other PSU names where you can be a little tactical is NTPC. It is trading at about 11 times. It has a good dividend yield. The coal production is up by almost 7% after a long time. The dispatches are up about 3%. It is a virtual monopoly play. This is almost like 7-8% dividend yield on it. So maybe that part of the portfolio could be looked at, but as I said tactically.


In the next leg of the rally, where do you think the contribution is going to come in from sectorally?
If you see the overall report which has come last year on the entire banking sector, the private corporate banks are getting the bulk of the flows. If you look at for example current accounts, the share of PSU bank has even fallen from 58% last year to 54%. In deposits, they are losing market share and by deposits I mean saving, current and term deposits. 

Once you lose current account share, it basically means that cash management is being handed over to the private banks. The corporate loan fund are going to the private banks which affects the PSU banks’ trade, their fx income and it has a cascading impact on their overall fee and interest income. 

So they will continue to gain market share and bankex typically grows one and a half times GDP. If private banks can gain market share, probably they will grow at 15% to 18% as a category. Also, the credit cost is likely to come off by 100 bps for private banks largely led by ICICI and Axis. Now on a large base, a 1% reduction in credit cost would translate to Rs 5,000-7,000 crore of bottom line movement. That is one space which is looking very good. 

Some of the construction names we have discussed in the capital goods space looks good. Cement valuations look very, very attractive. There have been a price hike of Rs 50 to Rs 60 on an average in south, about Rs 30-40 in other parts of the country. Good picks here could be Shree Cement which is largely north based and ACC as well because the stock has been a little under pressure due to having older splant and some of the clinker capacities are not really coming through. So, these are the broad sectors, which liquidity would chase."
1,2019-03-07,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: The recent hike in cement prices amid rising demand has made investors take a relook at the sector, which has gone through a rough patch in the recent past. 

Many brokerages and independent analysts say the price hike will help improve margins and increase profitability of cement manufacturers over the next two years. 

“The recent hike in cement prices will boost operating profit of cement firms at a time when costs are falling and demand is rising,” said a Crisil report. 

Cement prices rose by Rs 24-25 per 50kg bag in February. The southern region saw the steepest hike, with Hyderabad recording a Rs 77 rise per bag, followed by Rs 62 per bag in Chennai and Rs 52 per bag in Bengaluru.


Others
So has the pricing power returned to this sector?

Analysts are not sure. “Pricing power will come only when capacity utilisation improves,” says Jiten Parmar, Co-founder of Aurum Capital. 

“Currently the capacity utilisation is around 78 per cent. When it crosses 82 per cent, the sector will have pricing power,” he said. 

Excess capacity has been a major challenge for the sector despite the increased government spending on the construction and infrastructure sectors. Government policies and measures remain key monitorables in the near term. 

Cement production increased 11 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in January 2019 — reaching the highest production level ever — despite a high volume base last year. The production growth from April 2018 to January 2019 stood at 13.6 per cent year on year. In most regions, production increased amid slowing demand.

Uncertainty on the sustainability of the price rise is another factor to keep an eye on. “Prices may come down in the southern region because of overcapacity,” Parmar said. 

Finding the core of the sector's trend is difficult as the market for this sector is highly region-specific. “Different regions can behave differently. So even though the overall picture looks promising, we need to adjust our views region wise,” Parmar said. 

Analysts advise looking at the northern region at this juncture. “We prefer companies with higher exposure to the northern region, as North is expected to witness the maximum improvement in capacity utilisation,"" said Motilal Oswal Securities. 

The brokerage’s top picks from the cement space are all plays the ‘North’ theme such as Shree Cement and JK Cement. It also likes ACC, which the brokerage says is on a growth capex mode and should witness improvement in profitability."
2,2019-03-14,Shree Cement,"HDFC Mutual Fund’s chief investment officer Prashant Jain has become the first Indian fund manager to complete 25 years managing a single fund. He achieved this in 2019 with HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund which has generated an alpha of 9.54 per cent over the Sensex since 1994, Morningstar Direct data show.

HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund (the erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund), launched in February 1994, is the largest equity-oriented fund in India with assets of Rs 37,395 crore as of February 2019. The fund, now categorised as dynamic asset allocation (equity can be 0 per cent to 100 per cent), in its earlier avatar as HDFC Prudence Fund (a balanced fund). Data from Morningstar Direct show that when compared to other global funds managed by a single fund manager for 25 years and above, Jain’s fund has generated an alpha of 9.54 per cent over the Sensex, second only to legendary Peter Lynch who managed Fidelity Magellan till 1977, generating an alpha of 10.92 per cent.


Anthony Bolton managed Fidelity Special Situations from December 17, 1979 to December 31, 2007 and generated an alpha of 9.2 per cent. HDFC Balanced has returned an annualised 18.48 per cent since inception.

Financial planners point out that one of the main reason for Jain’s success is his ability to identify market cycles ahead of time and ride through cycles. For example, he made the most of the IT-driven rally between 1995 and 2000 by buying Infosys that multiplied 113 times. Between December 2000 and December 2017, Jain was quick to spot the capex/banking and commodity stock rally identifying stocks like BHEL which rose 35x, L&T 33x, Reliance 19x and Tata Steel 16x and SBI 14x. In the next cycle between December 2007 and December 2017, where FMCG and pharma stocks rallied he bought HUL which rose 8x, ITC 5x, Lupin 8x and HDFC Bank 6x.

Currently, Jain is betting on corporate banks, utilities and capex with stocks like Infosys, ICICI Bank, SBI, L&T and NTPC being the top holdings in his portfolio. Jain has had his shares of misses as well. He missed multi-baggers like Kotak Bank, IndusInd Bank, Eicher Motors and Asian Paints. Then there are a number of stocks where he exited early. Though he was quick to spot Shree Cement and made 10 fold returns, he sold off early at Rs 700. Similarly, he sold out Page Industries early on at Rs 7,000.

“Jain has a sharp ability to spot cycles ahead of time. He adopts a long-term approach to stock picking, sticks to his investment mandate and is not worried about underperformance in the short term,” says Himanshu Srivastava, senior research analyst at Morningstar India.

While Jain’s strategy has worked in the long term, it has also tested investor patience in the short term. “The transition years, where he books profits and identifies stocks to ride the next cycle have been the most difficult for Jain, as returns lag those of peers in the short term. However, if you consider block of 3 or 5 years the returns are good,” says Deepak Chhabria, CEO, Axiom Financial Services."
3,2019-03-27,Shree Cement,"Moat is a concept that was brought into the forefront of investment discussions by Warren Buffett. He made it fam ous by describing it as, “But all the time, if you've got a wonderful castle, there are people out there, who are going to try and attack it and take it away from you. And I want a castle that I can understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it.”

A business with a moat would imply one which has higher earnings power, higher margins and higher returns on capital than one without. A good way to think about moats is by asking yourself, if prices can be increased without loss of customers or can competitors reduce price and take away the customers of the company?


Some sources of sustainable competitive advantage can come from the following:


Better products – Google, Apple etc
Intellectual capital (Patents / Copyright) – Big Pharma, Disney
Lower cost structure – Shree Cement, Tata Steel
Captive customers (high switching costs for customers) – Banks, Corporate ERP systems (e.g. SAP)
High entry barriers to business (huge capital, licence, hazard, geographical dominance etc) – ONGC, Maruti, Microsoft Windows
Economies of scale – Incremental cost of production reduces – Android
Distribution (ability to reach more customers) – Hindustan Unilever, Amazon etc
Better known brands, which help customers reduce search efforts – Nescafe, Levi’s, Pidilite (Fevicol) etc

Just having a well-recognised brand does not comprise a moat. The brand needs to be able to translate into better and higher earnings power. For example, Sony is a globally well-recognised brand in consumer electronics. But will anyone pay a significantly higher price for a Sony TV today? A good brand is one which is able to reduce search costs for alternatives for a consumer. It becomes an automatic choice. And that can become a very powerful tool for a company.

Moat comprises of two components – sustainable competitive advantage and competitive advantage period. Most of the time, investors focus on only the first. In real life, the second (the duration of time when the competitive advantage period plays out) is equally or sometimes, more important.

As we have seen in history, very few companies are able to sustain for very long. We only have a handful of companies which used to operate a hundred years back. In the US, which has a much longer documented history of capital markets, General Electric is the only company which has remained a constituent for over a hundred years. If we look at the Sensex when it was first constituted, the list of companies was as follows: Asian Cables, Ballarpur Industries, Bombay Burmah, Ceat, Century Textiles, Crompton Greaves, Glaxo Smithkline, Grasim, GSFC, Hindalco, Hindustan Motors, HLL, Indian Hotels, Indian Organics, Indian Rayon, ITC, Kirloskar Cummins, L&T, M&M, Mukand, Nestle, Reliance Industries, Scindia Shipping, Siemens, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Tata Steel, Zenith.

A large number of these companies either have ceased to exist or are a pale shadow of their former selves. This just goes on to prove that a competitive advantage does not last indefinitely. A company needs to continuously work at widening its moat.

As an investor, even if we are able to identify a company with an apparent moat, we need to continuously keep an eye out for the changes to its competitive position."

The Nifty50 remained highly volatile throughout Thursday’s session amid RBI’s policy review and traded in a broader range of 100 points between 11,560 and 11,660 levels. It formed a bearish candle and lowe r lows on the daily scale, but managed to hold above the crucial support at 11,550.

The index has seen a negative divergence with its RSI indicator, as Nifty recently made two swing highs at 11,572 and 11,761 levels, while the RSI indicator hit the 80 and 75 levels, which indicated a pause in the positive momentum at higher levels.

Nifty has made a new lifetime high at 11,761 but follow-up action is required above the same to extend the fresh leg of the rally. Now, Nifty has to hold above 11,550 level to witness an upward move towards 11,760 level, while on the downside support has shifted to the 11,480-11,450 zone.

On the Options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 11,000 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 11,800 levels. There was Call writing at 11,800 followed by 11,900 levels, while Put writing was seen at 11,600 followed by 11,200 levels. The Option band signified an immediate trading range between 11,500 and 11,800 levels.

India VIX fell 0.69 per cent to 18.65. As it holds at higher levels, it requires a cool-off to shift the market base to higher levels.

Bank Nifty failed to hold above 30,250 level and drifted sharply towards the 29,800 mark. It formed a bearish candle on the daily scale and remained under pressure for most part of the session. The index has been forming lower lows for last four sessions and closed near the 29,888 level. Now it has to surpass the 30,250 level, else there could be more profit booking towards 29,500-29,250 zone, while hurdles are placed at 30,500 level on a closing basis.

Nifty futures closed in the negative at 11,680 with a loss of 0.42 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Shree Cement, SRF, Indiabulls Housing and IndiGo while shorts were seen in Ambuja Cement, BPCL, KSCL and Repco Home.

1,2019-04-05,Shree Cement,"Mumbai: Nifty 50 companies may report a spike in March quarter net profit — the highest in two years. However, the aggregate topline growth of the Nifty 50 companies for the period is expected to be in single digits for the first time in at least nine quarters following a sluggish demand scenario.Net profit is seen rising faster on account of a lower base and exceptional costs in the case of some companies in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, the sample’s revenue is expected to grow 7.6 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of FY19. This compares with a robust 22.1 per cent growth in the December 2018 quarter and 15.1 per cent increase in the March 2018 quarter. Net profit is likely to grow by 32.2 per cent, the sharpest jump since the March 2017 quarter when it grew 44.8 per cent. In the preceding quarter, aggregate profit had fallen significantly by 24.6 per cent due to the sharp loss reported by Tata Motors, which took a $4 billion write down on account of its Jaguar Land Rover unit.

‘Pick-up in Growth Expected’

“Revenue growth on a year-on year basis may be slow compared to the previous three quarters as the base prices of most commodities had grown in Q4 of last year,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.

The sample’s operating profit is expected to grow by a sharp 181 per cent largely driven by Coal India. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported higher employee benefit expenses due to revised pay for executives. This had reduced operating profit, thereby creating a low base.

Higher operating profit will likely expand the sample’s aggregate operating margin to 18.9 per cent for the March quarter from 7.2 per cent a year ago.

While the demand scenario looks dull, growth is expected to resume gradually in the coming quarters following the general election that will be held between April 11 and May 19 with counting on May 23.

“Liquidity squeeze is now slowly easing and hence the growth momentum could gradually pick up,” Jasani said. “Monsoon predictions (including that of El Nino developing) will be closely tracked. US-China trade negotiations and the general global growth slowdown fear could impact sectors and companies focussed on global trade.”

Sector Performance

Automobiles

Record high inventory at dealers and moderation in demand are likely to dent earnings growth. Tata Motors is likely to remain affected due to pressure on volumes at JLR.

Banks

Barring bad loan news related to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), the pace of slippages or identification of new nonperforming assets is expected to slow down further in the March quarter. Top private banks with greater exposure to corporate lending such as Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are expected to report better numbers. Net interest margins are likely to be under pressure given the liquidity crunch.

Capital Goods

Orders from state governments and public sector enterprises will support order inflow growth. Larsen & Toubro is expected to meet order inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent for FY19 following orders from heavy civil infrastructure and water and effluent treatment.

Cement

In the March quarter, all-India average cement prices rose 4 per cent to Rs 334 per 50 kg bag. The southern and eastern regions have shown an improvement in prices. Large companies such as ACC, Ambuja Cements, UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to report volume growth of 15-20 per cent year-on-year and revenue expansion of 15-17 per cent. Given benign raw material prices, net profit is likely to grow at a faster 20-35 per cent.

Consumer

March quarter results are likely to be impacted by moderation in demand amidst increased competitive intensity. Advertising expenditure may increase but will be offset by lower raw material prices. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post a resilient performance. Higher product prices may support ITC’s profitability.

Information Technology

Seasonal weakness amid unfavourable currency movements are likely to affect the performance of IT companies. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies are expected to report 1.5-2.5 per cent growth in dollar-denominated revenues. An indication from company managements on budget spending by clients will be crucial in determining demand trend for FY20.

Metals

A weaker rupee provided comfort to most domestic commodity companies as it made them more competitive. Realisations will also be higher as prices are in dollars. After a fall in the latter part of 2018, commodity prices, including those of steel, aluminium and copper, either stabilised or bounced back. The domestic steel companies raised prices thrice in the March quarter, leading to a 7-8 per cent price increase. This will support profit growth.

Pharmaceuticals

In the March quarter, pharmaceutical companies are likely to continue the improvement in performance seen in the preceding quarter. The receding headwinds in the US generics market are likely to support the performance of companies. Sun, Aurobindo and Cipla are expected to register better performance while Lupin is likely to underperform."

4,2019-04-23,Shree Cement,"Deutsche Bank has raised earnings per share estimates for cement companies under its coverage by 3-14% on assumption of better all-India pricing growth. 

The bank said Indian cement prices have been strong having gained 10% so far this year as industry cost leaders have lowered the competitive intensity and attempted to improve profitability after a weak calendar year 2018. Deutsche has raised its all-India pricing growth assumption by 6% year-on-year for the ongoing financial year from 4%, and has estimated that more upgrades are likely on the Street as improving realization trends are factored in.

Deutsche Bank has retained its buy call on ACC and raised target price to Rs 1,830 from Rs 1,790, and lifted target price to Rs 21,600 from Rs 19,330 on Shree Cement. 

The bank has raised target price on Ambuja Cement to Rs 235 from Rs 230 and increased UltraTech Cement target price to Rs 4,575 from Rs 4,240. 

Deutsche has raised target price on Ramco Cements to Rs 790 from Rs 785. 

Shares of these companies ended mixed in a subdued market on Tuesday. Shree Cement, UltraTech and Ramco ended down 0.2-0.6%, that of ACC and Ambuja ended up 0.3% and 0.1% respectively. 

While the bank has buy ratings on all these companies, ACC and Shree Cement are its top picks in the cement space. 
However, Deutsche sees demand growth moderating and believes monsoon will hold the key for recovery in demand. 
""Demand growth across most parts of the country has eased from the heightened double-digit levels seen in CY18, with channel members indicating demand has tapered to around 6-7% in recent months and is likely to be below 5% in April. 
They indicated a combination of election activity and low water tables have impacted volumes,"" said Deutsche. 

The India Meteorological Department has predicted a near normal monsoon this year at 96% of long period average while private forecaster has estimated that monsoon will be below normal at 93%."
3,2019-04-23,Shree Cement,"Fear and greed tend to affect us and that is what we have to try to overcome in the market, said Kunj Bansal, Partner & CIO, 
Sarthi Group, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

At a time when we are seeing volatility spike, rising crude oil prices, how should one stay light and in position?
It has come after the market reached life high and barely corrected for a day or two from there -- 1% or 2%. When one is at a life high, the valuations tend to be expensive and it certainly becomes difficult to take a very short-term call on the market. 

If anyone wants to take a short-term call, one should be cautious and slightly worried about the sharp movement that the market has seen in the last one and a half to two months, close to 8%-9% of the indices. 

But one of the factors that in the recent past seems to be dominating the market movement is the oil price hike. The other factor is that the result season has started and that is something which is going to have an impact on individual stocks. General elections come every five years and the result will be out on 23rd May and that could have some shorter term impact on the market. 

If at all anyone wants to take a short term call, one should be cautious but those corrections also give an opportunity to buy on dips. If one is looking at around six months plus kind of view on the market, which is where we will again see the commercials, the economies, the numbers, the macro and micro dominating the stock performance and the market performance.


Will you buy on a 10% correction? I am not looking at Nifty individual stocks because some stocks have already corrected?
Yes, of course. Let us keep in mind that a 10% correction is a big correction. I am assuming that you are talking of largecap indices which will mean around 12%, 13%, 14% correction in the mid and smallcap indices and 15% to 20% correction in individual stocks. So, yes indeed! Let us also keep in mind that, fear and greed tend to affect us and that is what we have to try to overcome in the market. 

At a 10% correction, the market would have built in a lot of negatives including weak results. It would have possibly built in a further rise in oil prices which of course will have a negative impact on the macro economy. It also would have possibly built in some unexpected, unstable coalition kind of government which will have impact on the commercial and economic policies. It would have built in some of these factors and that is where the valuations would become attractive. Right now, we are close to life high and at life high you do not expect the valuations to be comfortable. In case of a 10% correction, the news flow would be far more negative than what it is today, but then good news and good prices do not come together. The bad news flow at that point of time will offer us good prices to invest and that is what we will do.


When it comes to earnings, bulk of the IT companies that have come out with their numbers. Infosys’ result is a bit mixed; TCS has come out with a very decent set. Wipro was a bit of a disappointment with the cut in margin guidance. How are you looking at prospects of the IT sector going forward?
From an investment point of view, we are at close to life high and valuations high. If at all one has to invest in this kind of a market, IT sector makes sense. Although historically IT’s valuations have not been anywhere comparable to consumer goods or consumer durables or the banking and financial services.

In terms of overall financials, the sector has been having a close to double digit growth. When we compare it to other sectors, their predictability is far lesser including for FMCG. Sometimes the rural growth or degrowth tends to affect them, sometimes the urban growth or degrowth tends to affect; weather patterns -- extended summer or extended winter and all those things -- have a bigger impact and as a result, the predictability of earnings for that sector is very low.

 Here you have a reasonably double digit growth with a very decent predictability with good margins, with cash flows, with regular dividends and now regular buybacks getting offered. In terms of risk adjusted investment, if one has to look, IT is a very good sector to invest in. So, my view there would be positive, One should be investing continuously although the share prices have moved in the recent past but given the way the companies have given highly differentiated results, it will have to be a very differentiated investment approach there. 

In terms of individual stocks, TCS despite having risen so much and reaching the upper end of its valuation, still remains a good investment. Infosys and Wipro are completely avoidable. It is difficult to understand what those companies are doing. Besides management issues, that Infosys continues to have, there is compression in the margins. But overall, as a sector, I am positive on IT.


What is your view on the cement pack? 
There are two-three things that one should look for in the cement sector. The top most factor is whether there is volume growth, with its ups and downs included, if we look at the last three-four years or so. We have had mixed views, mixed opinions, mixed numbers and mixed developments on the infrastructure sector, growth on investments, lack of private sector capex which has been compensated by government capex continuing. 

Volume growth has continued to be in the range of 5%-6% on the lower side to 7%-8% volume growth on the upper side. Despite having mixed observations on our economy, in last three-four years, this has been one sector which has been continuing to report growth. Taking that factor further, obviously the next thing is the margins. 

Leaving aside, last one and a half quarter, there were pressures on the margins because increased raw material costs have settled in and we saw some uptick in the margins of cement companies selectively in the December quarter. We should see that trend continuing in the March quarter.

In March, we have seen sharp movement, sharp upward movement in some of the cement stocks. Shree Cement is one. If I saw correctly, it is probably trading at a 52-week high and as a result, obviously at a reasonably high valuation. I see the growth continuing there even if I take the next one year view. 

Margins which were under pressure are improving and despite being commodity-oriented companies, there is a reasonably decent control on the leverage broad as a sector overall. There are some companies which are of course quite net cash positive. Some are borrowing but a very limited borrowing with well controlled leverage.


What is your reaction going to be if SoftBank indeed decides to invest in Jio? 
It is positive from two-three angles. They are getting the backing of a strong financial investor. There may not be a technological input from them. Two, this will result in cash flows. It has to be seen what is the structuring that they do. If the money that will be flowing in is not through the sale of shares from the holding company, then the money would not come into the holding company and cannot be used to retire debt. But if it comes that way, then that will be helpful to reduce debt. 

If it comes as a subsidisation of Jio business, then it will be used for further expansion, which is where, given the way the industry is currently shaped up and the way the aggressiveness is likely to continue, they will continue to need money.

Overall, it is positive. The details can only be worked out when one has finer granular details on valuations, stake sale, actual amount of money flowing in etc. 

Also, nobody knows what will happen to the market in the shorter term but I am looking at it from the point of view of six months from now. So, by October-November, assuming that all the political related volatility has set in, the market would continue to attract FII interest. I think a large part of FII money will keep looking for largecap liquid names and which is where we know Reliance with the largest market cap almost Rs 8.5 lakh crore, will keep attracting buying interest from FIIs, besides the domestic interest that has also continued. This stock will continue to be in demand. Keeping the shorter term volatility aside, it is a positive development and from investment recommendation also, it is a positive in the medium term."

6,2019-04-26,Shree Cement,"From a long-term perspective, it does not look like a structurally very big change is happening for Idea or Airtel, said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, 
  
  
  , in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

What is your assessment of the kind of earnings that we have seen so far? Will there be a recovery or an improvement in headline numbers?
Yes, generally we see that the initial round of results that come in are in line or better than expectations. The back-benchers who are the culprits in pulling down the overall results come in later. So far, we have seen good numbers from banks like HDFC Bank; on the corporate banking side, we have seen good numbers from Axis. 

The auto sector has given weaker numbers but that was on expected lines. The volume details were already out. The negative surprise from Maruti in terms of the margins was something which will impact the segment for some more time but so far, the overall results have been broadly in line with expectations so far. 


Within pharma, are you looking at any specific names as good buys?
Pharma has so far been a mixed bag, a difficult sector to track because a lot of things are happening apart from the regulatory actions. A lot of these companies -- some of which are able to crossover to get a clearance - -are seeing some positive reaction. A lot of these companies are unable to do that and are consistently getting observations one after the other and are getting impacted. 

Apart from that, the pricing pressure continues to impact the pharma space. Volume growth is another factor, wherein the US and Europe is yet to pick up. Overall, only a handful of them have been able to do well. One of them is Divi’s Lab, which has consistently done well. It has cleared all the regulatory challenges and has been reporting good numbers. 

Apart from that, companies like Dr Reddy’s and Lupin on the larger front and Auro Pharma are starting to report good numbers and expectation of good delivery apart from the comfortable valuations are something are aiding some of these names in pharma space. 


Is there anything that appeals to you in the cement space? Do you believe that the overall cycle is turning fairly positive and that the demand supply mismatch now seems to be narrowing? Are fundamentals in favour of the space?
Cement is a very interesting space currently because of the subdued numbers that they have been reporting for quite some time. However, the capacity utilisations have now picked up. A lot of consolidation has happened, no new capacities are now being added and finally we should see going into FY20 some of the improvement in realisation and some raw material pressures easing off leading to healthy margins. 

Volumes for the space have been pretty strong. In the last couple of quarters we have seen the heavyweights reporting high single digit to some of the smaller names reporting double digit volume growth as well. It was the main concern was on the realisation front as well as on the cost front. 

In the last couple of months, the south-based companies have been increasing the prices which led to some volume not picking up in that space. However, in north- based companies, consolidation has happened and these should do consistently well. So, it is a structural change.We saw that in the very strong numbers for UltraTech Cement. It is much better than expectation and the street is becoming incrementally positive towards the stock. 

We are preferring some of the pockets in the cement space right from UltraTech, Shree Cement and JK Cement which is again a north-based player and Ramco Cement which in the southern market looks attractive in the overall cement space. 


What is your sense on the earnings of Piramal Enterprises?
I briefly had a look at the headline numbers. On its own it is a good set of numbers but compared to street expectations, there has been a miss and there was an one-time expense that the company has taken which is negatively impacting the sentiments as of now. 

Otherwise, the other broad operating parameters look pretty steady. Once we have a con-call with the management, things would get clarified. The street would take in things as it would get more details about the numbers and that should allay the negative sentiments. 


What is the expectation from Yes Bank? I guess one would be looking out for what strategy Ravneet Gill has in mind for next one to two years?
We are expecting a 24% year-on-year on loan book growth, mainly driven by the retail banking business. The NIMs are expected to remain stable at 3.4%; we expect PAT of about Rs 970 crores for Q4. 

The key things to watch out for is the fund-raising plans that the bank would have. That is a major block in terms of how the bank is able to grow in future. Due to management issues, they have not been able to come down and raise equities because at the pace they are growing, they would need fresh equity to charter their new growth plans. 

We have been hearing the news of a change in the entire top management. How the new CEO takes that forward, who are the new people who would join would definitely be something that the street would watch out for.


What is your take on the telecom space as a whole? The two incumbents are readying their war chest to take on rival Jio. Is there some potential for upside? 
Telecom has been another interesting sector at least in the current juncture where we are seeing two of the three larger players are coming out with rights issues, raising a war chest as you rightly said. The only issue is one needs to be cognisant of the fact that how long will this war chest last, given that the new player Jio is consistently on the prowl for market share.

They would need to continuously do a higher capex to move to the newer technologies, upgrade the service networks and the likes. So yes, at the current valuation, it does look like that on the back of the current fundraising, both Airtel as well as Idea could see some decent upside. We have also heard the Reliance management is still looking at increasing market share and not much of ARPU gains.

So for some more time, this fight would continue but eventually there would be some improvement in ARPUs which would help the entire sector. However, from a long term perspective, this does not look like a structurally very big change happening especially for the Idea as well as Airtel because of the capex-heavy nature. The debt would not go off. They would need to pay for the existing spectrum that they have bought and the incremental capex required for moving up the technology ladder would continue to keep up pressure on the balance sheet. 

So it is a tactical opportunity right now and may not be a long-term opportunity for retail investors."
7,2019-04-30,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market trod water on Tuesday, as investors resorted to profit booking on disappointment over March quarter earnings of select bank and auto heavyweights, including YES Bank and Hero MotoCorp. 

Weak global sentiment, a 1 per cent rise in crude oil prices, caution ahead of US Fed policy review and speculation over key macroeconomic data such as March fiscal deficit and infrastructure output data were the other key factors that hit investors’ risk appetite. 

Gains in IT shares, including those of Infosys, HCl Technologies and TCS, despite a stronger rupee, helped the market pare much of the losses. 

""Investors resorted to profit booking as weak results from banks and auto hit investor sentiment. However, a late recovery in IT and metal stocks helped minimise losses,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Sensex closed 36 points lower at 39,031 while Nifty settled 7 points down at 11,748.


We walk you through the highlights of Tuesday's session:

YES Bank suffers biggest-ever fall Shares of the private lender closed 29.23 per cent down at Rs 168, logging its biggest-ever percentage fall in a day. The lender disappointed the Street with its March quarter numbers on Friday. Several analysts have downgraded YES Bank and cut price targets after the lender reported its first-ever quarterly loss.


Jet shares extend lossesShares of Jet Airways declined 8.37 per cent to close at Rs 153.30, extending the losing streak into a third consecutive session. The scrip has come off 10.48 per cent in last three sessions. ET reported this morning that a section of its employees has evinced interest in bidding for the airline and is scouting for investors to get the airline flying again. 


TVS Motor falls ahead of Q4 nosShares of TVS Motor Company closed 4.03 per cent down at Rs 486 ahead of its fourth quarter numbers. Post-market hours, the company said its March quarter profit fell 19 per cent to Rs 134 crore from Rs 166 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. 


Godrej Prop tanks despite strong Q4 nosGodrej Properties reported a 270.53 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 156.66 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. It had posted a net profit of Rs 42.28 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. However, the numbers failed to cheer the market and the stock shed 3.20 per cent to settle at Rs 829.70. 


Hero MotoCorp shares fall 4% Shares of Hero MotoCorp closed 3.51 per cent lower at Rs 2,512.65 after it reported a 24.51 per cent year-on-year fall in profit at Rs 730 crore for March quarter. Brokerages have trimmed price targets on the stock by as much as 8 per cent. 


RCap shares plunge 8%Falling for the third day in a row, shares of Reliance Capital closed with a loss of 8.47 per cent at Rs 132.85. In the last three sessions of losses, shares of the company have come off 14.48 per cent. As per an ET report, Reliance Home Finance (RHFL) and Reliance Commercial Finance (RCFL) will seek to raise funds through the sale of fresh equity as holding company Reliance Capital is willing to cede ownership to new investors at the right price. 


Kotak Bank flat after Q4 nosPrivate lender Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 25.24 per cent year-on-year rise in standalone profit at Rs 1,407.80 crore for the March quarter as provisions fell sharply. Shares of the company closed 0.65 per cent higher at Rs 1,387.


156 stocks hit 52-week lowsAs many as 156 stocks, including Hero MotoCorp, MRF, Cox & Kings, HEG, Rallis India and Reliance Power, hit their 52-week lows on BSE. On the other hand, Aurobindo Pharma, UPL, Wipro, Bajaj Finserv, HCL Technologies, PVR, Shree Cement and SRF were among the 40 stocks that hit their 52-week highs.


Over 200 stocks hit lower circuitsAs many as 201 stocks, including Indiabulls Integrated Services, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Eveready Industries, Mahamaya Steel Industries, 8K Miles Software Services and Prabhat Dairy hit their lower circuits. On the other hand, Signet Industries, 63 Moons Technologies, Prakash Steelage and Darshan Orna were among 102 stocks that hit their upper circuits. 


122 stocks signal potential fallMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bearish crossovers on 122 counters on BSE. Among them were Mindtree, Jaiprakash Associates, ITC, Rain Industries, Biocon, Hero MotoCorp and Fortis Healthcare and Jubilant Life Sciences. Meanwhile, 54 counters, including JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, BPCL, Hathway Cable, PVR, Hexaware Technologies and Oil India, showed bullish crossovers."
0,2019-05-02,Shree Cement,"ITC, Nestle, Marico and United Spirits are the four consumer stocks that can emerge as value creators, said Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Which two-wheeler or four-wheeler stock would you buy in this decline? 
We are very optimistic on three names: a) Ashok Leyland. Given that they are enlarging their market share in both LCV and MHV segments; their new intermediate commercial vehicle (ICV) launch has taken off brilliantly and that they would be manufacturing 50% of the buses and out of that, a large share would be in Gujarat on the EV side. They are now looking at CIS countries to improve their content on the export side. So Ashok Leyland is no brainer at these prices. 

b) Eicher, given that we know there were ten days of manpower hours lost because of the strike in the Enfield factory but now it is up and running. Their franchise is growing strongly and at 20,000, there is an extremely good risk reward for a 20% upside. 

c) Bajaj Auto. Again their pan sub-continent sales and margins which they sacrificed for gaining market share has played out well and Bajaj Auto is now going to take on Enfield head on. 

These three stocks would stand out. But as a whole, if you are looking for the best wealth creator in the last seven-eight years and you are getting a price opportunity, then you should be buying some mutual funds or a SIP in some of the largecaps which could stand to gain out. Tata Motor would be a dark horse but the price performance has played out well. We still think if it comes closer to Rs 180-190, it will again become a very good value play.


The larger picture continues to be that while numbers in itself were fine, but even with Britannia, we are seeing the management talking about weak macros going ahead as well. Would you look at value when it comes to this segment of the market?
Britannia numbers are slightly disappointing but otherwise this stock has been on a tear and it has been gaining market share. The time margins have been slightly skewed.

But if you want to play that segment, there is ITC. A disclosure -- ITC has been one of our top picks and relatively has done nothing -- but on the downside it does not break Rs 265 and now it is finding strength close to Rs 305-310. 

ITC has gained a huge market share in the biscuit market and they have sacrificed margins to gain market share. Now those businesses are stabilising. I would expect ITC to be a dark horse to give you at least a 50% upside in the next two years. So ITC, Nestle, Marico would be standouts. Britannia on corrections I would avoid at this price. The other three are going to be outperformers. You can add United Spirits given the ascent and the numbers which their franchise model has turned out. A large part of the consumption market is now raring to go with the hot summer. These could be relative value creators in the next six to nine months. 


Two years ago, nobody thought there could be such a pronounced slowdown in the entire HFC space. If HFC disbursements are slowing down, what does that mean for consumer durables, for discretionary and other allied sectors?
Look at the performance of cement majors. UltraTech numbers were the best ever you heard. 104 million tonnes of capacity and utilisation playing out. Margins are much better than expected in a lean season, which tell you a) cement and steel demand is up and running. b) A large number of men from the boys have been sifted out in the NBFC/IL&FS fiasco; and c) Low-cost housing as a theme continues to remain robust given the numbers, if you compare it with an HDFC. Gruh Finance has been in the eye of the storm after that merger and in the small ticket Rs 10 to 15 lakh, it has been an outperformer as far as numbers and earnings go. At 15% growth rate for quarter on quarter, I do not know how many 10-12 quarters I have seen but yes there is evidence of that. 

The three catalysts – one, low interest rates globally; two, bond yields touching new lows and three, the transmission effect -- a large part of PSU and other retail banks are now taking the market share away from NBFCs. The second half could be fairly robust and the numbers from quality names like Godrej and Oberoi, both are showing a lot of traction on the upside. 

You will have to take it with a pinch of salt, if you want to be , in the names which have shown a pedigree management and outperformance in this fiasco. I could name UltraTech, Shree Cement, ACC on the cement side, HDFC, LIC Housing and maybe a dark horse in L&T Finance on the second side and thirdly it would be some of the building companies – NBCC and dark horse called Shankara Building Products which has weathered a lot of storm and could outperform in the next one year.


There is no linearity in Federal Bank’s numbers; Q2 was good, Q3 was not that interesting. The management believes the worst of the NPA cycle is behind them but I do not see any evidence of growth. Why should one buy an old private bank , when growth is slowing down? 
The simple answer is that if Kotak is seeing a gain in market share on the largecaps, then surely Federal Bank, DCB are going to take a prime part of the problem which have been plaguing the NBFCs and we see more of plateauing over there. Stick with pedigree names. The worst of the eye of the storm was during the Kerala floods. You had mouthwatering valuations at that time. There is a lot of froth now. But on a valuation basis and given that a lot of money comes in through the NRI route in Kerala and their franchise, all the three banks would stand out in that order. We want to be here growth is going to be an outperformer because of the NBFCs and credible management, which all three have displayed over the last one year."
1,2019-05-04,Shree Cement,"The domestic equity market showed extremely divergent behaviour during the week gone by. While the smallcap index Nifty100 was down 1.5 per cent, Nifty50 was almost flat with a downward bias. Even Nifty500 index, which covers 75 per cent of the market cap, traded sideways. Sectorally, weakness was visible in the auto sector, which is the biggest barometer to measure the mood of the masses.

Given the precipitous fall in April numbers for passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and tractors, prices of auto players should have tanked. However, despite the headwinds, these companies have stood their ground and haven’t fallen drastically. This is solely because of the impact of ‘Global Liquidity’.

Given the US Fed’s status quo on interest rates at least for this year, global liquidity will flow into emerging countries like India where they can capture 7.5 per cent kind of growth, whereas the US economy is expected to grow at 2.5 per cent. This will also lead to massive dollar inflows which can take the rupee to Rs 65 66 level by the year end.


Event of the Week
Just when we thought the NBFC crises is taking a breather, the condition has resurfaced. With rating agencies downgrading Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Capital’s long-term debt, the market has turned wide eyed in fear. This debt implosion could have further cascading effects if RBI and the government do not act quickly. Hopefully post elections, things should be under control. Nonetheless, such turbulence is not reflected in the stock market yet.


Technical Outlook
Nifty50 is hovering near its all-time high level, neither breaking highs nor breaking lows. Though smallcap indices have cracked, Nifty50 is still resilient, indicating that eventually the highs will be breached and Nifty will move into a new territory. However, in the intermediate period, till such time the breakout does not occur, it is better to avoid trading. A decisive break above 11,900 should be used as an opportunity to go long or a break below 11,550 should be taken as an opportunity to go short.

Agencies

Expectations for the Week
The domestic market is expected to remain choppy over the next few weeks due to the quarterly earning numbers and the overhang of the election outcome ahead. Among various sectors, IT is expected to witness some cooling off as it has run up a lot. Private sector banks and cement companies, especially Ultratech and Shree Cement, can also experience some profit booking while PSU banks led by SBI can bounce back.

The smallcap and midcap space is more likely to experience an uptick as sentiment towards the likelihood of yet another term for the ruling party grows. On the commodity front, avoid metals as commodity prices are correcting internationally. Investors should start looking for stocks in the smallcap space and keep them on their watchlist till the election outcome on May 23.

Nifty50 closed the week 0.35 per cent down at 11,712"
2,2019-05-06,Shree Cement,"By Ashish Chaturmohta Head – Technical & Derivatives, Sanctum Wealth Management

Current chart structure, according to technical analysts, looks sluggish and investors are advised to remain light on positions. Some of the technical picks where investors can catch dips for 10-15 per cent return in short term are DMart, NHPC, Bharat Forge, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Motors, they said.


Where we are: Month of April was a range bound for the market and May has got off on the same note. Though Nifty witnessed breakout above previous high of 11,760 and touched new all-time high of 11,856 last month; market is largely sideways in the range of 250 points since last five weeks.


What is in store: Index hasn’t broken its previous swing low of 11,550 thus, maintaining sequence of higher highs and high lows. Hence 11,550 becomes pivotal support level for the market. However, breaking below 11,550, market will see break in current uptrend and profit booking will emerge in the market initially towards 11,350-11,310 levels. On the upside 11,800-11,860 will act as resistance zone for the market. Crossing above 11,860 on sustainable basis, Nifty will see fresh breakout. Then Index can rally initially towards 12,000 and 12,300.


What could the investor do: In Nifty weekly options, maximum open interest for Puts is seen at strike price 11,700 followed by 11,600; while for Calls it is seen at strike price 11,800 followed by 12,000. Good amount of Call writing was seen in 11,800 and 11,850 indicating as immediate resistance zone for the market. India VIX closed at 24.03 up by 10.7 per cent for the week. After some relief in volatility the previous week, it has picked up again. Expect VIX to remain at elevated levels and rise further as markets heads towards election results later in the month. On stock specific front UPL, DCB Bank, Reliance Industries, Shree Cements and ICICI Prudential Insurance are showing strength."
3,2019-05-21,Shree Cement,"Reliance Securities has given a hold recommendation on Shree Cements with a target price of Rs 21,000.

Shares of Shree Cements traded at Rs 20,613.95 around 1:30 pm on 21 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.


March quarter highlights:



""Shree Cement (SRCM) reported a strong operating performance in 4QFY19 aided by healthy cement sales volume and improved cost efficiency. Ebitda grew by a strong 35 per cent YoY and 19 per cent QoQ to Rs 850 crore in-line with our estimate,"" the brokerage said.
EBITDA per tonne stood at healthy Rs 1,103 against Rs 958 in Q4FY18 and Rs 1,067 in Q3FY19.
Sales volume, including clinker, grew by strong 13.3 per cent YoY and 23 per cent QoQ to 7.3mnT, while power volume stood at 382 million units (up 11 per cent YoY and down 15 per cent QoQ).
Cement operating cost per tonne stood at Rs 3,122 (down 2.4 per cent YoY and down 3.8 per cent QoQ) mainly due to reduction in freight cost per tonne (down 11 per cent YoY and down 3 per cent QoQ) and other expenditures per tonne (down 2 per cent YoY and down 4.8 per cent QoQ).
A higher-than-expected depreciation dragged its net profit by 20 per cent YoY (up 11 per cent QoQ) to Rs 320 crore. 


Outlook and valuation:

""We believe SRCM has been moving in the right direction in its pursuit to dominate the markets by adding capacity at regular intervals,"" the brokerage said.

The brokerage expects the company to grow market share with strong profitability without much stress on balance sheet. 

""Its premium multiple is expected to sustain, which can be supported by thin liquidity and meagre non-institutional holdings. However, as current valuations look to be stretched despite upgrading our estimates, we downgrade our recommendation on the stock to hold from buy with a revised SOTP-based target price of Rs 21,000,"" the brokerage added."
4,2019-05-21,Shree Cement,"Phillip Capital (India) has given a buy recommendation on Shree Cements with a target price of Rs 22,500.

Shares of Shree Cements traded at Rs 20,578.10 around 2:45 pm on 21 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.

As per the brokerage, Shree has proven its ability to remain sustainable on operating numbers despite strategic shift. 

The brokerage thinks the company's better adaptability and flexibility against peers to changing business environment will be the next driver for its earnings and valuation multiples.

In the conference call post March quarter earnings, the management commentary showed the intent of improving price realisations with conscious efforts to align volume growth in order to achieve this, the brokerage said, adding, that the outlook on demand remains and cement prices remains positive.

""Focussing in a big way on supply-chain efficiencies which will be an added advantage for Shree in our view in the longer term. From our on the ground checks, we continue to see structural initiatives by Shree to improve efficiencies on this front,"" the brokerage said.

""We retain buy and revise our price target to Rs 22,500 against Rs 18,500 earlier. We value Shree at 18 times FY21 EV/Ebitda. At Rs 22,500, the stock will trade at nearly $250 per tonne. It presently trades at $210 per tonne,"" said the brokerage."

Nifty opened positive on Thursday and made a new lifetime high of 12,041 in morning session after leads and trends showed a clear majority verdict for the incumbent BJP in the general election 2019. But the market failed to hold on to the gains and drifted sharply by around 400 points from the higher level.

It formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale and closed negative by breaking below the previous two-days’ low of 11,680. It wiped out all the gains of the session and hovered near its weekly opening level. Nifty has to respect to its multiple support at 11,550 to regain strength and move towards 11,761 and then 11,888 levels, while below 11,550, weakness could be seen with every change in price setup.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 10,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,500. There was marginal Call and Put writing in the market.

India VIX fell sharply by 29.77 per cent to 19.04 level. India VIX made a new record high of 30.18 on Wednesday and fell drastically after election results. Now, it has to cool down below 16 to get short-term stability in the market.

Bank Nifty opened positive and made a new lifetime high of 31,705 but failed to hold the gains and corrected by around 1,400 points from the day’s high. It closed negative and formed a Bearish Candle, but managed to continue the formation of higher lows for the fifth consecutive session. Now it has to hold its immediate support at 30,250 to regain strength towards 31,000 level while major support exists at 30,000 and then the gap area near 29,500.

Nifty futures closed negative at 11,713 with a loss of 0.58 per cent. Long buildup was seen in Ujjivan Finance, Bank of Baroda, Shree Cement and IndusInd Bank while shorts were seen in ITC, HDFC Bank, Apollo Hospital and Allahabad Bank.

6,2019-05-28,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Technical analysts are optimistic on Dalal Street. They expect Nifty50 to touch the 12,000 mark on a closing basis sooner than later, with the positive momentum broadening to second-rung stocks.

Technical charts are signalling broader participation, and nearly 120 stocks on NSE now look set for a strong rally, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled an bullish crossover – a sign of bullish undertone – on these counters, hinting at possible upsides.

These stocks have been witnessing strong trading volumes of late, lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included shares of steelmakers like SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL and banks such as South Indian Bank, Union Bank, IDFC First Bank, Karnataka Bank and Bank of Maharashtra.

Among others, Coal India, HDFC Life, InterGlobe Aviation, Future Enterprises and Torrent Power are a few other names on the list.









The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities. 

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed seven stocks are showing bearish trends. They included Manpasand Beverages, Page Industries, L&T Infotech, Blis GVS Pharma and Bajaj Consumer Care. 



The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a 'buy' or 'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

As far as Nifty50 is concerned, daily strength indicator RSI is moving upward and above its reference line, signalling a positive bias. Besides, the formation of higher top and bottom on the daily charts indicate that Nifty supports are shifting higher.

7,2019-05-28,Shree Cement,"The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility, said Hemang Jani, Senior VP, Sharekhan, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:


The Indigo numbers are nothing short of a blow out. How much more headroom is left for Indigo? It has almost become a duopoly kind of a space now?See the market at this point of time is so polarised that wherever you see a good growth visibility and some stable margins, the money is only chasing those sort of stocks. And that is what we have seen in the last whole year, last six months or so. So we have very few stocks where one can really have a growth visibility. The Indigo management is telling us that in terms of international and domestic operations, they are extremely well placed. They are also going to get delivery of almost about 20-25 aircraft. 

The passenger growth has not been that great but even if it remains about 12-15% with only two major players. The overall environment is extremely favourable and so though the stock has run up, given the state of the market, we might see some more upside for a player like Indigo. 


I always thought that Divi's had this API model which was almost like an annuity business. Irrespective of what is happening to the pharma world, Divi's had a strong disruptive model.Yes, particularly after this US FDA related issue got resolved, the company started delivering good set of numbers and the good thing about Divi's is that unlike most of the other pharma companies which have a lot of dependence on the generic opportunity and the deal with pricing related issues, Divi's had a very different business model. 

But given the fact that the entire sector in the US and in many parts of the world is going through challenges in terms of litigation, etc, and when you are supplying to some of those pharma majors, somewhere you will also have to take a hit in terms of the slowdown whenever it happens. In case of Divi's, we have seen that but overall the business model and the margins part is playing out extremely well. So we are not too negative on Divi's. Yes the performance was weak so the stock has corrected but we are of the view that somewhere it will stabilise and will start doing pretty well.


Would you avoid any of these high PE haloed stocks -- Page, Eicher, Bosch? That is where the casualty is. Markets maybe at an all-time high but some of these stocks are at a multi-year low. How would you approach a Page, an Eicher or a Bosch or Shree Cement?Definitely because of the high valuations and the fact that we are seeing slowdown, particularly in the consumption space, the derating process may continue for a while because at the moment the entire money is chasing the set of stocks where there is a growth visibility and where you can expect quarter-on-quarter improvement in the performances.

Only a few sectors are showing signs of revival. The revival in the earnings is not visible on a broad-based basis for the next couple of quarters. I definitely think that one should avoid the stocks which have been beaten down and where you are not seeing much growth visibility. The focus should be on the banking and the financial space where there is going to be a good amount of traction a) because of the repo rate cut, liquidity infusion and because of the greater visibility because 60% of the earnings growth next year in the Nifty will come from the banking space. 


What do you make of this entire wave of buying in the PSU stocks? It reminds me of 2014 when after the NDA-1 mandate everything got re-rated.Yes, because of the underperformance and the possibility of liquidity infusion and the rate cut going ahead, the market has already started pricing that in for some of the PSU banks and yes selectively we do see State Bank of India and a couple of the large PSU banks are seeing decent amount of improvement in the operating growth, loan growth and the slippages part also has been sorted out. You might see some more upside mainly because of higher probability of rate cut but again this is not a sector where one can take one year, two year kind of a call. From a tactical opportunity perspective, there is more upside for SBI in particular.


What is going on with IndiGo? The promoter spat aside, it is a problem of restrictive choice. You only have SpiceJet and IndiGo now in the aviation space. IndiGo clearly is the leader with the largest market share. They are already guiding for a 30% increase in capacity in the next financial year.Yes absolutely. Partly because of the growth in the passenger traffic which has been pretty good in the last couple of quarters and the fact that because of the Jet saga some of these incumbent players could take a price hike so the pricing power to some extent is coming back plus operationally – a) because of the expansion on the international front and because of the expansion on the fleet per se on the neo part, there is a sense that the overall growth could be extremely good for a player like IndiGo which is extremely well placed.

They have also managed to get some more slots. The market is extremely positive there. But we have not really covered this airline sector because of the kind of volatility, news flow and sensitivity to government decision making. So yes we do appreciate the fact that IndiGo is extremely well placed but we are staying away from giving any specific recommendation for IndiGo or SpiceJet at this point of time."
8,2019-05-30,Shree Cement,"Absolutely. I am more a believer of multicap approach but SIPs are always welcome. In fact, SIPs are meant to be for lean periods like this, said Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, said in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Would cement and road makers be the first beneficiary of any uptick in the cycle?Absolutely. A large part of this is led by government spending and as I pointed out, that has slowed down and should probably be reflected in some of the numbers. But that is likely to pick up. 
The surplus balance with RBI is at a record high and that is likely to change. The spending will resume and if you see the manifesto of the NDA, they are talking of some obnoxious number on the infrastructure spending. I think you will probably see some massive privatisation and some other measures to reduce the fiscal stress as well. So that looks to be a safe play. 

Also in cement there are benefits in terms of reduced space cost since it is on a cost to delivery basis, the raw material cost will be benign. This year, about 27 million tonnes of additional capacity is coming in. There have been price hikes across geographies and overall on a 500- million tonne market, you have UltraTech at Rs 150. If you add ACC, Lafarge, Ambuja Group -- that will be another one-third. So, there is a lot of consolidation as well. You will now see both value and volume growth coming in this space. It may not be double digit but could be high single digits growth.


Now: What is your take on some of the auto majors?
The auto sector is not looking good with 10% production cuts for both M&M and Maruti. Also, inventory is still at 40-45 days. I have been speaking to a lot of dealers and some of them happened to be our clients. They have been sending a lot of SOS to the makers. It will take a little time before things really turnaround. M&M’s result was a bit of a mixed bag with auto segment revenue and margins holding up on back of two-three launches especially the Marazzo and the couple of the XUV300 and some of the others. 

The farm equipment side and the tractor side is where you saw the decline both in revenue as well as margins and the guidance also was a little muted. My sense is that one can gradually accumulate them on dips. The risk reward, even the downside looks limited to me because a lot of pain is in the price. M&M has seen an almost 30% price correction, as it is trading at reasonable valuations and there are not enough plays. So, there are already talks of government having an exclusive agriculture ministry. 

I was reading some data that 58% of the farm loan waivers are yet to be actioned and that will infuse a lot of rural liquidity. The RBI is maintaining cash surpluses. So, a lot of non-discretionary spending will pick up. Once liquidity returns, once the NBFC credit crunch fades away, the interest rate transmission happens, gradually it will pick up. But maybe that is one or two quarters away. Meanwhile, one can buy on dips. 

Immediately one can look at two-wheelers. Bajaj Auto looks attractive. It is gaining market share. More than 50% is due to export, there is a three-wheeler which comes in. So you can start with maybe two-wheelers first and then look at accumulating M&M and Marutis of the world on further declines.


You would not stretch your list of the private banks to Yes Bank, would you?
There are more skeletons there which are likely to come out. There is a lot of exposure to the ADAG Group. There is a significant unsecured and project finance book. You will see more provisioning in the coming two quarters. I agree the price points are pretty attractive but you can look at much better places like SBI. The consumer loan book is only 32% of the overall book. The CEO is already talking of 11-12% growth by acquiring some NBFCs portfolio. Even the private banks are being very cautious, especially when it comes to both SMEs and on corporate advances,

What CIBIL did to retail ending is what insolvency and IBC would do to corporate lending. I think there are better plays available at less than two books and we are not even discussing the recoveries which will come from the large accounts. They are at a very advanced stage. The credit cost is likely to come down, the provisioning is almost more than 70% up and you can target an increase in ROA and ROE. There are better plays and last one year ICICI and Axis have actually returned more than 50%.


Are you beginning to hunt within mid and smallcaps?
We have a more multi-cap approach, not to bias towards any particular market cap. We also have to take into account the liquidity which will chase some of the names. Globally we are already witnessing a bond rally with the US 10-year. If you remember last year, it went above 3%. We are already talking of 225-230 levels. The German and the Japanese 10-years have slipped into negative territory. We saw the Chinese PBOC yesterday infusing $36 billion through open market operations. 

I think RBI is likely to inject liquidity in the upcoming MPC on 5th and 6th of June. So, liquidity will come and once the liquidity eases, it is the front line names it will chase more. I will be happy even accumulating an ICICI Bank and I do not mind putting up an RBL Bank as well. So, I will be market cap agnostic but the mid and small cap space with both time and price correction, is not looking as wobbly as it used to be. 

There are few opportunities even in midcap space. There are some niche consumption plays which are looking very good. We saw for example TTK Prestige report very good set of numbers and the price it down more than 20%.

Is it the correct time to start SIP in a good active midcap fund for a period of three, four, five years?
Gurmeet Chadha: Absolutely. I am more a believer of multicap approach but SIPs are always welcome. In fact, SIPs are meant to be for lean periods like this and that is when you get more units. Lot of fund managers have been cherry picking. The net flows remain good. There has been Rs 8,000 odd crore kind of inflow in SIP. A large part of this comes in the small and midcap space because outperformance before the correction came, was largely in the small and midcap funds only. So liquidity courtesy SIP flows, also gives you a cushion to buy more on these declines and get the favourable price points.


What about ONGC? Any thoughts on the stock fundamentals?
 It’s an avoid for me, There are a couple of PSU names which have shown better earnings. If one has to go into PSUs with a tactical view, you are better off with Power Grid. Their work in hand bidding is almost at about Rs 18,000 crore worth of projects, their order book stands at about Rs 60,000 crore. So that looks good in light of heightened power demand. PFC grew their advances by 12-13% and I was surprised to see the cost of funds coming down by 10 bps. It seems there will be some synergy with the REC merger. If you want to play some of the PSU names, there is SBI. Being tactical is probably a better way to play. A retail investor could buy some of the PSU ETFs which keep coming which the government gives at a discount in terms of getting their privatisation and disinvestment targets in place. so That is a better way to play them.

Infrastructure is the other key flavour of the moment. Give some of the names you would look at there.
 Gurmeet Chadha: It is a broad sector. We are looking at some of the capital good makers like L&T. Last financial year, they not only met the guidance but in fact raised the guidance and if you break up the order book segment wise, it gives you further confidence. 

Their focus on giving up non-core business stays. The margins have improved. I am very positive on L&T. In fact, the stock has seen quite a nice upmove in the last couple of weeks. Cement looks very good. I am of the opinion that cement upcycle has begun. A pan-India play through UltraTech could be a good play. You can also look at some geography specific plays like Shree Cement and Ramco down south. 

So cement and maybe a couple of road makers as well."
0,2019-06-03,Shree Cement,"Look into cement, two-wheelers and infra and construction as well as discretionary consumption such as appliances, food services for stocks that can double or triple, said Dipen Sheth, Head, Institutional Research, HDFC Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Why are markets not reacting to sub 7% bond yields?I wish I was a macroeconomist. God knows, I am struggling as an analyst and so yes, it is a little bit of a conundrum. It reflects sluggishness in the economy and weak demand more than anything else. I guess that would more or less explain it. I do not have a great macroeconomic reason to justify this and we are probably sitting on upcoming fiscal slippage. 

If the government has to rev up the economy through fiscal boost, for example, by reducing taxes on basic consumption things like cement and boosting rural spend through reduction of GST on two- wheelers, a lot of that would add up to expanding the fiscal deficit. I do not see why bond yields should fall. One big reason why they could be falling is also having more confidence in the ability of reforms. Divestment could be the big lever here and it is not small bits of inconsequential PSUs which might come up but it could be the big whammy, the oil marketing companies, Air India etc. There could be a whole lot of government presence in sectors and industries where it should not be. Those could be up for sale for all I know.

I am not saying and these are my prescriptions for the government. I am not saying we are likely to do it but rather that there is a whole lot of possibilities.


Woes seem to be continuing for the auto sector. -- be it elections, tight liquidity. But a lot of companies are saying that the new government’s measures to revive the economy are likely to rev up the overall auto space. The numbers have been a big disappointment. Do you think that after three consecutive month of fall that now we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel?Let me give you a slightly a long complicated answer to what sounds like a simple question from you. First, we need to understand that autos is end of the day a cyclical space and we were sitting on two-three good years of numbers across the space. So some of that had to give. The second thing is that incremental auto demand is coming in mostly from upcountry markets. The metros are getting saturated. There is ride-share coming in, there is driving difficulty and a lot of millennials do not want to buy cars or even bikes anymore. They would much rather use an Uber or Ola. 

Incremental demand was coming in from upcountry areas and those were the areas which have been in economic pain for quite some time. There have been three soft monsoons and if this one is also going to be soft, then there is serious trouble coming up. Although the government has a whole lot of levers, it is very creditable that agricultural output has held up despite indifferent monsoons but that is a different story. 

Third, unless IIP and manufacturing rev up, I do not think there is a hope in hell that CVs will revive anytime soon. There is also an emission norm change coming up. We will see a little bit of pre-buying happening in Q2-Q3 but I do not think there is a structural case for arguing a bull run in CVs over the next three-four years, especially with the DFC coming up not just the Delhi Mumbai but the eastern DFC also.

I do not think CVs are going to be part of the auto revival as and when that happens, cars are of course consumer discretionary, people can postpone demand a little bit of bunching up will happen may be in a year out from now so that should be good for brand leaders like Maruti as you can see that the not so strong brands like Tata’s have suffered much more in this crack. 

On two-wheelers, I have a completely different point of view. We are probably sitting on a very sweet value zone for two-wheelers -- be it Hero or Bajaj, which are the two largest listed players in the space. 

I cannot understand why a pragmatic government would continue to have 28% GST on entry level two-wheelers. You can have a higher GST for Enfield bikes but why for a 110-cc bikes or even for that matter a 150-cc bike? If that was brought down to 18%, then I would see very good times for two-wheelers. Both these companies are very high, ROIC companies, Bajaj has actually pumped up volumes over the last year. Hero has struggled but the next two or three years look very interesting for both of these guys.


 The challenge for Bajaj could be that the three-wheeler business, not the two-wheeler business. The three-wheeler business is slowing down and that was the cash cow. For Hero MotoCorp, the challenge is that they have nothing in exports while for Bajaj, export is a fillip. There should be a longer view on three-wheelers. Remember Bajaj has got into the freight end of the three-wheeler market, not just the passenger end and it has been doing very well there. God knows, people like Greaves and Atul have been hit by what Bajaj has achieved. They obviously have a very strong distribution network. On the passenger end of the three- wheeler market, I do not think we have seen the end of it so far. It is a phenomenally high margin business for Bajaj but it is not that the other parts of the portfolio are not making money. 

Having said that, even the passenger three-wheeler market is likely to take off in case of a penetration and urbanisation-led pull for passenger three-wheelers increases in up market India. Maybe you do not have too much of scope for selling passenger three-wheelers in Mumbai or Pune or Delhi, but surely it would be there in Aurangabad. Some of that will play out increasingly as government spend and urbanisation in tier II and tier III India play out. A lot of three-wheeler demand will actually play out over the next few years.

I am not too worried about that part of their portfolio. What people have been worried about on Bajaj is whether they are discounting their way into the entry-level segment in a bit to get volumes all over again. That has played out and they have held their horses there after an initial burst to get their volumes. Bajaj now has a much more balanced portfolio mix. The big gaping hole in scooters continues to bug me.

On Hero, the relevant thing to note is the fact that they have now got into the mid premium segment where they were virtually not present for a long time and remember the up selling to the staple hero crowd in mid tier India is likely to happen with these models as well as increase in presence in the metros. I am not worried on these two companies at all. A little bit of a push from the government in the form of reduced GST -- perhaps it is aspirational but it is likely that a pragmatic and sensible government would figure out that taxing things like two-wheelers and cement at this point of time at 28% just does not make sense.


Do you think a rate cut is imperative as otherwise, the market would open up some serious downside since it seems to have factored in a 50 bps rate cut on June 6?If you are stuck with a sluggish economy and low inflation, there is very little that rbi can do on the monetary front except for pushing for a rate cut. I would agree that 25 bps is a virtual given at this point of time. They may not engage in heroics and do 50 bps for the simple reason that there is uncertainty in oil. 

But, apart from monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus and as we have said recently in our note on Modi 2.0, policy stimulus is the big hurdle that India has to go through. Since this government has now got a clean mandate for a fresh five-year term, this is the time to do big and bold things, a little bit of fiscal slippage, a little bit of monetary loosening -- much as it may sound Keynesian to lots of classical economists -- will be forgiven at this stage in Modi 2.0. 

This is something that Modi 1.0 should have done very early in the game. They did try doing much of this but it was getting a little late. Right now, monetary stimulus from the RBI, fiscal stimulus from the government and most important a fat reform agenda from Modi 2.0, big bold aggressive reforms that can completely change the character of the nation and not just three months trajectory is called for.


Give me one infra space where you are convinced things will change for better and structurally and cyclically these are stocks which can be potentially double or even 3x in this NDA-2 regime?Let us start by eliminating, the global cyclicals are certainly not going to make me that kind of money -- be it the steel stocks or the non steel metals. They are affected through global cycles which frankly are difficult to predict sitting out of India. So let us rule them out. 

Local cyclicals - cement as well as two-wheelers -- are set for policy-led revival and increasing consumption and penetration especially in upcountry India, the natural beneficiaries of a revival in cement. Cement pricing has been very strong in Q4 last year. It continues to be extremely strong in Q1 and I salivate to think what might happen to cement company profits should GST be brought down from 28%. The natural proxies there would obviously be UltraTech in the largecap space and maybe Shree Cement. Something like Dalmia has been very consistent in profitability; a Birla Corp which is probably the cheapest 15 million ton cement company available in India at this point of time, a Ramco which is also not cheap might make sense in that cycle. 

And of course, Hero and Bajaj in the two-wheeler space where I have already outlined my arguments. Another year out from now, maybe if we see a revival in discretionary spending, then maybe four-wheelers can also take off and Maruti can turn out to be a very interesting buy. But that’s about it. If you look outside these two sectors, then infra and construction, are the two sectors given the appetite of this government to spend and to drive infrastructure spend.

The old anchor L&T is running up, I do not know whether it is a doubler or tripler in three years but it is a very good proxy for playing the revival in infra spend on a broader base. You will never be as comfortable with L&T’s valuations as you might be with some of the small cap stocks but remember that all the midcaps and smallcaps in the sector added up, do not quite add up to L&T’s market cap or its Nifty weight for that matter.

L&T is going to be an anchor in any portfolio which is aligned with Modi 2.0. But other than L&T we like names like KNR Constructions and PNB Infratech, fat order books, very clean balance sheets, particularly in the case of KNR they are still sub 50 days. In terms of networking capital cycle, both are excellently managed companies. The fat order book is now going to come into play over the next few years. So, infra and construction, the local consumption themes argument might also be interesting.

I am not just talking about the 40-50 PE kind of FMCG stocks but discretionary consumption such as appliances, food service. So food service, naturally Jubilant Food Works despite high valuations continues to be one of our top picks. On the appliances space, we are seeing a scorching summer now finally playing out and you have seen the run up in stocks like Symphony despite an average quarter. Voltas is set for a good time despite what people see as a bad quarter in terms of the slippage in its core business segment margins.

These are a couple of names and of course, V-Guard which is now building a north India franchise very aggressively and much of its one-time spends on advertising and brand promotion seem to be in the base. V-Guard is also set for a couple of very good years."

2,2019-06-05,Shree Cement,"India’s cement industry, the second-biggest in the world, is set to cement its pricing power locally after a prolonged phase of capacity overhang that had prevented previous attempts at increasing realisations.

Last fiscal year was favourable for the cement industry for several reasons. First, the industry clocked double-digit volume growth for the first time in the past nine years. Second, even capacity utilisation, which reached close to 71%, improved 5% on year — the highest in the past seven years. Third, cement prices climbed about 2% in FY19. Fuel costs also declined, in lockstep with crude prices.

This year, the industry is expected to build on the achievements of FY19 and enhance realisations, by 2-5%. Infrastructure investments by the government should aid that effort. In each of the next five years, the Central government is expected to build about 6,000 km length of roads. Besides this, the low-cost housing segment is also likely to boost cement demand. Analysts point out that the government’s investments in infrastructure and its focus on the pace of execution should help sustain cement prices within a favourable range.


Sustainability of cement prices would determine the attractiveness of cement stocks. Given the present situation, companies in the northern, central, and eastern regions are likely to show better revenue growth for FY20. UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement, Ramco, JK Lakshmi Cement, and Orient Cement are expected to report higher realisations of at least 4% in FY20.

In the past four months, cement stocks are up in the range of 35-40% and trading at premium valuation to historical averages. Premium valuations are expected to be undergirded by expectations of higher volumes and realisations in FY20."

4,2019-06-10,Shree Cement,"Future of cement demand is dependent on how GDP grows and I am really confident that GDP will be growing by 7% to 7.5%. So, cement demand will be growing at almost the same range, 1% up or down, said HM Bangur, MD, Shree Cement, in an interview with ETNOW.Edited excerpts:

In the area which you represent, north and parts of central India, is demand significantly better or is still thanda?Demand is a little better, not significantly better nor thanda. Cement demand sporadically can go up or down, but overall it will go now if the GDP is up by 7%. The demand will go up by 6% to 8%. It is a very good correlation with GDP. So nothing unusual. Three-year GDP growth and three-year demand growth will be almost equal.


Do you think demand will remain firm and is there a genuine uptick both in industrial and consumption or could the monsoon have a deterrent?Monsoon comes every year. When we say demand, you have to compare August to August, September to September. Monsoon factor is not important. Monsoon will be important if you compare April-June to July-September but that is not comparable. Secondly, the future of cement demand is totally dependent on how GDP grows and I am really confident that GDP will be growing by 7% to 7.5%. So, cement demand will be growing at almost the same range, 1% up or down. 


What about pricing? There has been some indications from the regulator on that front. Given the recent spike in prices, they are not exactly happy with it. You have also said that you are going to be focussing on pricing going forward. What kind of trends do you first see and for Shree Cement what is the agenda?Year after year, the average price rise of the year will be 3% to 3.5%, much lower than the inflation. This has been the trend of price rise for last many years and now also. When yearly price rise is 3%, sometimes it is negative, sometimes it goes up 10%. But overall, year to year, it will be 3% or so. This has been the trend for the last 10 years. Only when the price rise is there, we talk about it. But when the price falls, everybody keeps quiet. But overall, the cement price in the year will not be going up more than 3% to 4% maximum compared to last year. This has been a trend for so many years and it will continue.


Typically ahead of election, cement demand always goes down. I am not surprised that in April and May, there has been contraction in some parts of India. Would demand come back and in which parts of India, is demand elasticity still the highest?At the time of election, there will always be a shortage of labour. Temporarily, the demand comes down. But it will go up and the demand will be dependant totally on GDP growth because when GDP grows, everything is needed. Company has the need along with its capacity to pay and when both matches, then only demand comes. 

Capacity and production in any commodity capacity will be much higher than production. Indian cement industry is capable of meeting the needs of the country and they have created the demand. They have created the capacity a little earlier than demand. We are at least three years ahead and our project capacity can serve demand even after two years with 15% growth or so. That can be served easily. There will not be any shortage of cement in the country.


What is the status of your new plant in south India and what kind of capacities is it running at?I have just put a new plant in south India. We are starting there with the right price and it is running at a very low capacity at present. We are making our brand there and significant capacity will be coming by the end of the year. For the first six months, we have run with very low capacity. It is continuously increasing and depending on the market scenario, it will definitely go up. Our capacity utilisation will become far better. 


What is the new innovation which is coming from Shree Cement? Also what exactly is your cement realisation right now?The focus is on providing better quality cement. The Indian market has become mature and can absorb better quality. Our focus is that between us and the highest selling brands, the difference should come down. We are working on it. For the time being, our focus is on maintaining the cost and improving the quality. Cost cutting again is now no more there. We are trying to improve the quality and that will be our focus. And when we improve the quality, naturally the brand has to go up. The marketing price has to go up. We are increasing our prices in all markets.


Are you facing any clinker shortage and how is your Middle East market gearing up? Are you seeing any revival or pickup in the middle eastern region?We do not feel any clinker shortage in north India. We should be able to meet the total demand of north whatever it comes. The second question about Middle East market is slow but fortunately our plant is just on the port and the whole world is a market for us as shipping facility is very good. We are exporting and getting our revenue in Middle East. The Middle East slowdown is hardly affecting us.


You are moving more towards branded segment. You are targeting largely small builders and home builders. Considering where real estate prices are moving and the HFC segment is under pressure, don’t you think this could be a dangerous strategy?It is a very long-term strategy. In 10 years or so, we expect the Indian market will revive and when we are moving towards that, it will take us some time, the brand building, the confidence in the market comes very slowly and we are moving in the right direction. We have introduced two new brands of premium brands and the response is good.


Could you share with us in dollar terms, the enterprise value (EV) per ton that you are looking at from that plant? Secondly going forward, could you share with us your debt cash flow (DCF)?Our is a debt-free company. So, the whole question of discounted cash flow and DCF is not very meaningful for us. Cash flow will come very gradually. You will have to keep the plant running; bear some losses for the first or second year. I has to be supported by other operations. Once the manufacturing matures, the market matures, then also a small profit starts trickling in and maybe after three years, it will mature fully.


Markets look at the enterprise value of cement companies. You do not have a debt but what is the enterprise value or EV per ton you would ascribe to a new capacity like Shree Cement if it has to get created? In the next 12 to18 months, what will be your total installed capacity and the capacity utilisation there?First part, I am the least entitled to say about it. It is for analysts to say. They have to think what capacity and what value and what other things, there are many complex metrics. We know manufacturing and we do the right thing. Markets value us, we do not value ourselves. In two years time, we will be around 50 million tons.


What will be your total installed capacity and on an aggregate basis, where do you see your utilisation rate settling for the entire capacity?Our total capacity is around 45 million tons now and in two years time, it will be 50 million tons and we will be running at 70% or so.


Where do you think the biggest challenge lies for the cement sector and for Shree Cement?The cement sector is totally dependent on major economic growth which I am very confident about. There would not be much problem as far as the cement is concerned. Secondly, the public have money. There is enough need of cement in India. Now with the growth in per capita income, the need is being converted into demand as money is available. 

I do not think any major problem is there and Indian cement prices are low compared to world prices. In most of the places, the prices are high and the turnover to capital ratio is very low. Our turnover will be around 30% of the capital cost. All the money has to come from that 30% turnover to service the capital.


In the last 10 years, the stock is up nearly 9x. That must be making you happy? As a promoter I am sure it is a satisfactory moment?Of course, it is and I am very happy that the market and shareholders’ value and have faith in the company. We are performing and we will be performing as we were performing before, nothing special has to be done. Some fiscal discipline and a lot of innovation has to be done on a daily basis."
5,2019-06-11,Shree Cement,"Earnings growth being restricted to only few sectors has restricted the scope for new investment ideas across market capitalisations. The difficulties are compounded by the not-so-encouraging improvement in private capital expenditure in recent years. In such a situation, it makes sense to focus on large-sized companies, which offer stability to the portfolio. 

Dominant market share, high return ratios, steady cash flows, consistent dividend paying record and relatively better balance sheets ensure consistency in earnings. For conservative investors, these factors are important as they ensure that share prices of large-sized companies is not as volatile as mid and small-sized companies. 

Among large-cap schemes, investors can consider SBI Bluechip with an investment horizon of at least five years. A key characteristic of the scheme is that it stays away from momentum stocks and focuses on themes which do well only in the long-term. 

Besides its low expense ratio, the scheme’s fund manager Sohini Andani has been focusing on companies that have certain distinct advantage even among large-sized companies. For instance, Andani has invested in Shree Cement due to its cost efficiency even if it is not the largest cement manufacturer. 

In the past five-year and ten-year periods, the scheme has given 13% and 12% returns, respectively while peers in the same category have given average returns of 10% and 11% returns, respectively.

Expert Take

Harshvardhan Roongta,CFP, Roongta Securities
The scheme follows a combination of value and growth style of investing. Its conservative investment decisions has led to its under performance during sustained bull runs when compared to its peers and benchmarks in the recent past. However, it has been an outperformer over longer periods of time when markets complete two to three cycles."
6,2019-06-12,Shree Cement,"In the Indian context, it is a win-win situation and despite pessimism, I do not rule out 12,200 coming before the budget, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:

Could Reliance signing this term sheet with Brookfield as reported by The Economic Times be a material and sizable positive considering the valuation at $15 billion? We are talking about almost halving the debt on their books?Finally, the sun is shining for Reliance. First, came the Saudi Aramco deal for selling part of their energy assets and now they are trying to monetise the Jio towers. It is a very big positive in the sense that Reliance is now going to try and become a lean mean fighting machine in the sense they realise that they are slowly transitioning into a technology company and there is going to be a huge capex involved there. Slowly but surely, they are trying to get the financialisations on the right path and I see no let up in this. 

Reliance is truly on its way to becoming a Rs 10-lakh-crore market cap company in the next one year. All declines should be used to buy. We have a one-year target of Rs 1,500. Its underperformance in the recent months may start to see an uptick again in Reliance, given that both the monetisation on the spectrum side and on the energy side is on the cards in the next six months.


What is happening in crude on the back of the OMCs cooling off yesterday? ONGC was showing a lot of strength. Overall, it is going to be positive for India but on the back of the trend that we are currently seeing, if crude were to continue to cool off, would you be taking a closer look at some of the names impacted by that?We have had a contrarian view on most of the OMC. They have smartly rewarded in the last four months. I still think HP, BP, IOC are wonderful businesses and if crude is going to be a tailwind, now with prices slowly but surely drifting below $60, it is a win-win situation. 

Also along with that, look at the strength in the rupee. We think that free pricing has been extremely positive for them. There will be regular bouts of profit booking but we still think there is a 20% upside even after such a sharp run-up in some of the OMCs. We are also very positive on select gas utilities and IGL, MGL on decline remain our top pick. 

We think the selloff in GAIL may be overdone. Even with a 4% rise in PNGRB pricing, they can still give a 10% CAGR over the next two years cum bonus. At Rs 300, GAIL also becomes an attractive buy. So, OMCs, gas utilities all are in a very very sweet spot right now.


Would you look deeper into IT, perhaps into some of the midcap names?The rupee which was a tailwind, is now a headwind and globally the environment for IT and BFSI space is not all that alluring. We want to play the India story given the budget and the underperformance of PSUs. We think alpha will really be created by cement, construction, infrastructure. In the short run, the volatility and protection of capital will be seen by IT given it has been a bellwether. 

If I can take two names, it would be TCS and HCL Tech. HCL Tech has moved up very sharply from those Rs 950 levels to Rs 1,120 but we still think that it is the best executor on the BFSI space. TCS itself has become a prima donna. It has become the largest market cap. If you want to be in these stocks, these two merit ownership. However, any pullback now in the rally at above 12,000, it will be the broader market which will lead and IT may tend to become a market performer to slight underperformer going ahead. 


What is your perspective on DHFL? They have managed to avert the defaulter tag after making that due payment of Rs 960 odd crore to NCDs. Does that make them worthy of investment? You know where the problem is. We have still not filled the void created by IL&FS. The short term commercial borrowing is still in a limbo and the competitors have gained because of some of these errant promoters. Over-leverage is not a bad word but if you had a very good run in the last five years, adequate checks and balances should have been on the cards for the likes of Indiabulls or DHFL or Zee. 

ADAG came and clarified. Words will not materially change it. You got to show the money on the table. We think there are enough other plays which are going to make up for that and already corporate banks are in the best of shape as they take on the loan portfolios of most of these debt saddled players. So ICICI, Axis, SBI would be the key over there. 

Among housing finance companies, it will continue to be Bajaj Finance. LIC Housing Finance can be further rerated, given its pedigree performance and now the book size is increasing with NIMs also expanding. The other two would be Cholamandalam and HDFC if you want to stick with the top names. As a trading bounce, DHFL definitely could see some rearguard actions. You could see the stock maybe trading towards Rs 120 in the next three to four months. 


The next big trigger would only come from the budget. How big an event could it turn out to be from an equity market standpoint?Before the budget, you have Trump and Xi meeting at the G-20. If anything, the Dow has seen the best rally in the last one year in June. The Dow is up 1,600 points in the last 10 days on the back of Mexico sanctions getting averted. We will have to keep our fingers crossed that Trump does not wake up on the wrong side on the 29th and if you have a deal, then that will actually set the cat amongst the pigeons. In the last fortnight, global markets have been rallying sharply, given that the dollar is at a three-month low; the carry trade is up and running; also the Fed is going to cut rates. 

In the Indian context, you have one of the best budgets on the anvil given the strong mandate and given the macros have been very positive for the government. They can instil a lot of confidence through liquidity and sort out some of the imbroglio on consumption. It is a win-win situation and despite the pessimism we are closer to 12,000. I do not rule out 12,200 coming before the budget.


You were so bullish with regards to the domestic story, the capital goods story, infra. Let us talk about some of the names that you are looking at in that basket. Would you also go in for higher risk names?We think cement, construction, capex, corporate banks are going to lead from the front. In banks we like ICICI, Axis, SBI; in the smaller banks we are very bullish on DCB, Federal Bank, IDFC First. In cement it is UltraTech, ACC and Shree Cement as they have been able to expand margins during a lean season. Once you are through with monsoons, cement will be an outperforming sector in the next one year. 

Construction picks would be again NBCC, Nagarjuna where a lot of weakness has crept in because of some change of government. It is just temporary. Sadbhav Engineering over is another top pick. In capex, it is L&T, Siemens, ABB, pedigree names which are going to get a huge order flow which show that books are swelling and execution is the name of the game. 

We know that the government capex has been in the front running and now private capex is going to be the next game changer. For the next 12 to 18 months, the stocks should be India centric and they can generate a lot of wealth going forward."

8,2019-06-13,Shree Cement,"OMCs are value stocks one should consider buying, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert, in an interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts:


Are the internals looking alright or do you think liquidity is still the biggest concern that is going to continue to plague us? Liquidity at the margin is improving because the RBI stance has also altered. It is also a question of the demand for liquidity. For businesses to take more credit, they have to be confident about the kind of sales or revenues that will happen in the near future. They would probably look at doing a capex or taking on further loans or debt only when they see some amount of buoyancy. 

In the near term, monsoon and Budget could be the big drivers. The budget in terms of the policy statement and the monsoon in terms of the sentiment. 


Do you see another rate cut by the central bank as something the market will start to factor in as a positive or is it still waiting for some other cues?In terms of a rate cut, the central bank has always been mentioning that they are bothered about the transmission aspect. Now there is actually a headwind there because today the combined fiscal deficit of both the state governments and the centre is close to 6-6.5%. That is a ceiling which gives you very little room for a 50 or 70 or 100 bps rate cut. Unless it gets transmitted, you will not see the cost of funding for an average business going down. We clearly have a challenge there.


Do you still have conviction that perhaps things will improve for some of the higher beta names going forward?One has to dissect it in two ways. The way it works is there is one section of the market where growth is probably more than adequately priced in. One needs to drill down in these sectors where perhaps the room for disappointment is less because you are not actually paying for it. So utilities, oil marketing company, or capital goods are the sectors where perhaps the expectations are low. Therefore, there is a probability of some positive earnings and that could then give you a room for valuations to trend up.

We have seen for the last three years that you start with expected earnings growth at 25-24% and then as the year goes by, you keep scaling it down. What has actually led to is perhaps only multiple expansion and now we need to really see the earnings kick in because if you remove the corporate banks apart, there is very little in terms of the profit pool for us to start valuing.


But how soon do you see the profit pool expanding to utilities to capital goods etc.Nobody is good at timing the market. But the way the Prime Minister has outlined his priority, probably the market participants need to figure out what is that he needs to be looking at when he talks about ease of living. That has a lot of connotations for may be urban infra, the whole sanitation aspect and probably these are places where up till now private sector could invest only in a limited way. So chances are that in case there are some real policy making initiatives in the budget, the private sector would be allowed entry into the sectors that could probably unleash the animal spirits.


D-Mart, Page, Bosch, Shree Cement used to be the go-to stocks for every fund manager. With the valuation and the return on equity some of these companies give, those who bought these stocks made money. Are these stocks after a 15-20% correction giving a good entry point?No company is in a perpetual growth mode. You have companies which are in growth phases. The first leg of the above trend growth is already captured, delivered and priced. Unless and until visibility improves on the next growth leg which may not be a 20% CAGR over the next three years, but even a 15% growth should do.


Let me propose a template -- buy a company which has a little bit of moat around it and has got good promise in terms of return ratios. It may not be the cheapest stock in the town but it can still be a 15% to 20% earnings compounder. What would you buy?One should look at oil marketing companies.


So you will buy OMCs for next three years and you buy them today?Absolutely.


You buy them today?Absolutely.


Will you buy them after the show, have you already bought them?Well of course I mean these are the value stocks that one should look at today.


In last seven days, first it was Deloitte, then it was PwC. I hear other auditors are also under the scanner right now. Is it like saying that auditors have closed their eyes to the reality of some of the corporate balance sheets and that is terrible news?
A good way to look at it is that now things are changing because if one understands, this is what was happening for the last five years. Today they are waking up and then asking questions. At least now we are coming close to the turn.


But the change will come with pain!Absolutely.


And the pain is going to be felt before the change happens.No doubt.


Are markets prepared for this pain?Frankly. in certain pockets I do not think so at all because though pricing growth expectation of 25% book growth has now come down to 10-15%, one would really need to wonder what exactly is the composition of the book.


Should one pay greater importance to the global poor macros, fear of a slowdown, contraction in bond yields or the local macros where there is oil currency and bond yields all on the same side?
India has a problem on the global macros because for 14 years, our percentage exports to GDP has remained flat which for a country of our size is honestly a matter of concern. If you drill it down further, the large employment generating sectors -- be it leather, textiles, agri -- all of them have just not taken off. So, quite honestly these are things that we need to fix. In India, product markets have seen quite a lot of reforms but it is the factor market that now needs to be put in place. Then people to come and take a bet on investment.


The Indiabulls management is clarifying that you cannot take a complaint from a shareholder who has got four shares! Seriously, the stock is down about 10% in two days?But the fact is that it has retraced also if you look at the two weeks prior to that, it also retraced quite a bit. These kind of volatile moves one probably needs to look at it over a longish period of time.


A move in Indiabulls risk or volatility? But is the current price action in Indiabulls telling you a risk is coming or is this a volatility which an investor should use to buy?I think volatility comes only when risk is around the corner.


So are you saying the move is risky?Absolutely.


You will not buy the stock?Definitely not.


What will you buy then where there is perceived volatility but you do not think that is a risk?
There is enough value in say the lenders who today are looking at assets that are available to pick and choose. The NBFCs had flooded the market over the last half a decade. Today you are saying the PSU banks are coming back. The assets are available. They are locking in good yields and the challenge for them is that today the L/D ratio is almost tallying off and they also need some amount of good credit borrowers for them to start going in for long growth. 

Today you are not pricing in the delta in most of the PSU banks. But for those PSU banks, for example SBI, the results were very encouraging. It is the largest lender in the country. One needs to see where you are not pricing in the expected change where the rate of change has already been priced. The room for disappointment can be huge and that is why volatility happens."

13,2019-06-19,Shree Cement,"MUMBAI: In line with its strategy to invest in Indian real estate, American private equity major Blackstone has struck agreed to buy nearly 0.7 million sqft of office space in One BKC from the city-based developer Radius, for a reported Rs 2,500 crore, making it the largest deal in the country's office space.

With around USD 10.4 billion investments in the country since 2005, Blackstone is the largest global investor in the domestic realty market with an exposure of over USD 5.4 billion and the One BKC deal is the largest in the office space segment to date.

While Radius has confirmed the deal with Blackstone, it refused to divulge details including valuation.

Blackstone has been pumping money across sector and of the total investment, USD 6.6 billion were pumped in the past four years alone.

Its real estate division has so far committed nearly USD 5.4 billion across 33 investments in the country, of which it has committed USD 4 billion towards acquiring Grade A commercial office buildings and invested the rest in retail, hotel and residential assets.

In April, Blackstone announced its plans to acquire a majority stake in packaging company Essel Propack for Rs 3,211 crore, and in February it bought 97.7 percent stake in Aadhar Housing Finance by buying out Wadhawan Global Capital and DHFL for Rs 3,000 crore.

And in May, Blackstone along with its partner Embassy has also launched the country's first real estate investment trust 'Embassy Office Parks REIT', which raised Rs 3000 crore.

Besides the Embassy Group, Blackstone has also partnered with developers like Salarpuria Sattva Group, Indiabulls Real Estate, Panchshil Realty, and K Raheja Corp, among others.

Under the present deal with Radius, Blackstone has agreed to buy nearly 7 lakh sqft of space at One BKC, the most sought after central business district in the megapolis. The property has around 1.5 million sqft and Blackstone is snapping up nearly half of the built-up space, making it the largest office space deal in the country to date.

Spread across 2.5 acres, One BKC houses many leading names such as Bank of America, Trafigura, Cisco, Facebook, Amazon, ICBC, Shree Cement, Motherson Sumi, Hitachi and ICICI Prudential, among others.

As per reports, Radius will use the proceeds from the deal to repay Rs 1,600 crore it has taken from Indiabulls Housing Finance for the project."
12,2019-06-19,Shree Cement,"Brokerages remain cautious on the cement sector as price increases that began in April have failed to sustain.

Sluggish demand and the onset of monsoons suggest price moderation should continue and margins could peak near term in the June quarter.

Cement prices in June 2019 have corrected by 2 per cent or Rs 7 per kg, reversing the increase in May.

While Ambuja Cement and ACC declined 5 per cent each in the past month, UltraTech gained just a percent. The other two cement majors such as Shree Cement and Grasim gained 5 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.

“We see June quarter cement prices and margins at near-term peak and expect price moderation to continue,” said Sumangal Nevatia, analyst, Kotak Securities. “We believe large capacity addition will keep industry utilisations low over the next two years and will restrict sustainable improvement in margins.”

Companies such as ACC, Ambuja Cement and Grasim are currently trading 12 times their FY20 estimated EV/EBITDA. Shree Cement and UltraTech Cement are trading at 16 times. “We maintain a cautious stance on the cement sector on expensive valuations of large-cap cement names at 12-16 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA,” said Nevatia.

Analysts believe that steep increases in cement prices are not sustainable and there could be a decline once the demand from non-trade segment improves.



“Although cement prices have not seen much of a correction in North, demand has taken a knock and this remains a cause for concern,” said Sanjeev Kumar Singh, analyst, Emkay. “Most (dealers) expect some decline in cement prices going forward and some of them believe average price increase in FY20 should be limited to 3-4 per cent year-on-year”.

Sales volumes for the industry has seen a steep decline after March 2019.

In April the decline was 3.2 per cent yearon-year and 14.9 in May. Volumes for June are expected to fall by14-17 per cent year-on-year. This seems to be driven by higher spending during the pre-election period, unavailability of labour and surging temperatures. Industry experts, however, believe that the liquidity crunch has had a greater impact in causing demand to soften."

Nifty50 on Thursday managed to respect its previous day’s low and gradually extended its gains towards 11,850 level by surpassing the crucial hurdle at 11,761.

The index formed a Bullish Engulfing Candle on the daily scale, as strong buying interest emerged at lower levels near to its 50-day EMA after the consolidation of last four sessions.

As long Nifty holds above 11,761 level, it could extend the gains towards 11,888 and then 11,965 levels, while on the downside support is seen at 11,761 and then 11,720 levels.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest was at 11,700 followed by 11,500 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,200 levels. There was Call writing at 12,200 followed by 12,100 levels, while Put writing was seen at 11,800 followed by 11,700 levels. Options data suggested a shift in trading range higher to 11,650-12,000 zone.

India VIX fell 4.96 per cent to 14 mark. Stability in volatility could again take the market towards the upper band of the trading range.

Bank Nifty managed to hold its crucial support in the 30,200- 30,250 zone and witnessed strong buying interest towards 30,830 level. It formed a bullish candle on the daily scale and finally surpassed the crucial hurdle at 30,600 level.

As long as the index holds above 30,600, it could extend gains towards 31,000 and then 31,313 levels, while on the downside, supports are seen at 30,500 and then 30,250 levels.

Nifty futures closed positive at 11,856 with a decent gain of 1.26 per cent. There was long buildup in Just Dial, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Hexaware and Shree Cement while shorts were seen in Ujjivan Finance, Chola Finance, RBL Bank and UPL.

16,2019-06-26,Shree Cement,"Motherson Sumi, Apollo Tyres and Exide among midcaps and BHEL among largecaps are the stocks where 5-7% of portfolio can be allocated now, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from his interview with ETNOW.


There is no large fear visible both locally and globally. Yet, gold prices are up 10% in last one month. Is the bullion market telling you something which we cannot see today because markets are forward looking and tend to capture the events well ahead of its occurrence?Donald Trump’s tweets on the Federal Reserve are playing out and we think that yields are going to head below 2%. It also means a 50 bps and may be more rate cut coming in the US. This means the dollar is at a three-month low and can get weaker. Not buying the euro because of the weakness of prolonged quantitative easing and so gold becomes a good destination. Also, it shows you that the risk-on trade globally is there with the emerging markets outperforming to hit a new high. 

In the Indian context it cannot be more bullish because there are no buyers, there are only people lining up for selling.This time gold is not going to be for fancy buying. It should be a sellers’ market. In fact people will liquidate gold and get back into SIPs which is the new gold for the longer term. People’s fancy for gold is now abating and I can only see sellers who are going to encash that and may be plough back part of it into SIPs. I remain extremely bullish on Indian equities and globally the easy liquidity is going to see much more of a risk-on trade for the next part of the year.


What is your go-to stock right now from the midcap space where a 20-30% move is coming in the next 12 months and where you are ready to allocate 5-7% of your portfolio?There are two sectors. OEMs have bottomed out before the auto sector. Three stocks which were taken to the cleaners, are now seeing a lot of revival. These are Motherson Sumi, Apollo Tyres and Exide. They can be huge wealth creators given that the festive season in the next three months and some initiative from the government will be a key game changer. 

The other one would be definitely be dark horse BHEL, where capex is reviving. If electric vehicles is the theme, the BHEL network has the best transmission going across the country. From Rs 65-67, the stock has inched up to Rs 74. I do not rule out Rs 100, given the risk-on trade coming in 2020. Last year, when everyone was very bearish on PFC and REC, we stuck our neck out. Those stocks are up 50% and more given the dividend yields and are still looking strong. 

We suggest some of the PSU basket stocks, the CPSE ETF or alternatively Engineers India, NBCC, BEL, IGL and GAIL. GAIL cum bonus at these prices is giving you a very good opportunity. Either you buy that or buy the CPSE ETF, which can deliver stellar returns in the next two years. 


Why are markets not getting excited about what is happening around us?It is the lull before the storm. The budget can be a game changer. Already, we are talking of interest waivers and some sort of increments on the housing sector. You are talking of an MSME distressed fund which is the need of the hour. The transmission of money to the end user after the IL&FS fiasco. That is where there will be keen monitoring. 

Also, consumption is raring to go. Look at the ground level, look at the numbers on both auto and capex. The stocks have bottomed out before the sector and this is just the lull before the storm. However for macros to kick in and earnings to catch up may take a quarter or so.

After October, you would see a very strong rally globally as well and in the Indian context, the underperformance of midcaps is now almost through. In next 18 months, we will see the best part of the equity market which we have seen in a long time. There will be broader outperformance of the midcaps. If you have a three-month window where you can sit and accumulate stocks. We think the budget can be a game changer in the near term.


Where are you shopping in NBFCs? Not everything is good but not everything is bad either?Correct. Bajaj Finance, HDFC and LIC Housing are the three in our pecking order and we stay with that. We are very contrarian on L&T Finance. We think most of the bad news is in the price. They have a strong parentage and the management has guided that they have provisioned well enough for most of the downside. For them, capitalisation will not be such a big issue and they have weathered the storm well. 

At a price of Rs 115, it offers a very good risk opportunity of at least a 50% upside given that the government is looking at the MSME space and seeing the mistrust goes ahead. I would also like to point out IndusInd Bank. It has corrected quite a bit because of this IndusInd Bharat Financial merger. But given that the commercial vehicle market is now looking to pick up in the next three months and the promoter is putting his money where his mouth is, they have just issued warrants at Rs 1,700. I cannot but be bullish and use this opportunity to buy IndusInd Bank as a contrarian. 

IndusInd deserves to be rerated over here and on more quarter of weakness where IL&FS provisioning is through you should start to see a very strong uptick on the credit and the NIMs. 


Would you say there is merit in buying cement stocks afresh even after the run-up that we have seen from the lows?If you have a slightly longer-term view, you cannot go wrong on cement. The monsoon and beyond that the return of pricing power will help. Already prices are fairly firm in most of the regions and going forward the whole impetus on a Rs 1 lakh-crore budget of spending, rural housing, rural income and the “housing for all” provide a huge impetus. 

Also, infrastructure growth is visible. For us, it would be UltraTech, ACC and Shree Cement in that pecking order. A dark horse on a midcap would be JK Lakshmi Cement and will standout over a period of time given that its cost of production is the lowest in the midcap stocks."

1,2019-07-01,Shree Cement,"The grass is always greener on the other side.

Some analysts prefer to say the same thing about the e-commerce businesses, the biggest buzz in the industry lately. 

Some unlisted e-commerce names such as ANI Technologies (Ola), Oravel Stays (Oyo Rooms) and One97 Communications (Paytm) have been creating quite a splash in the unlisted market, mainly on the strength of their titular value, drawing in small and retail investors.

Many such investors flocking to these counters are not even aware of the challenges of the unlisted space, especially with regard value fluctuation and limited liquidity.

Many are drawn to such propositions on the lure of attractive valuations and herd mentality.


Stock prices & financial performance
According to Abhishek Securities, a firm dealing in unlisted shares, Ola, Oyo Rooms and Paytm are currently priced at Rs 27,500, Rs 75,000 and Rs 17,000, respectively, in the unlisted space.

That, even when these companies continue to incur losses. One 97 Communications, which houses the main payments business of Paytm, reported an over four-fold rise in consolidated revenue in FY18 at Rs 3,314.8 crore but losses swelled to Rs 1,606.05 crore from Rs 903.09 crore in FY17, as per data sourced from Tofler.

Meanwhile, Paytm Mall reported a loss of Rs 1,787.55 crore on a total revenue of Rs 774.86 crore in FY18, as it looks to compete with Walmart-backed Flipkart and Amazon India, which together hold 80 per cent market share.

Combined losses of One 97 and Paytm Mall swelled 270 per cent to Rs 3,393 crore in FY18 from Rs 917 crore in FY17 while combined revenues went up by 417 per cent during the same period to Rs 4,089 crore.

For the year ended March 2018, OYO India reported a marginal widening of net loss to Rs 360 crore for India operations against Rs 355 crore loss reported for the previous financial year.

OYO India’s revenue growth has jumped over three-fold. The firm reported an operating revenue of Rs 416 crore for financial year 2018 compared with Rs 120 crore reported for financial year 2016-17. 

Flipkart India led the way with an unmatched margin. Net loss of the e-commerce giant grew over 700 per cent in FY18, though revenue growth during the period was 39 per cent. In FY18, Flipkart India reported a Rs Rs 2,060 crore loss against Rs 245 crore in the previous year.

What then justifies the sky-high valuations that these stocks are commanding in the unlisted space?

“Business models in e-commerce industry, in general, differ from traditional businesses. They do not owe or possess any tangible assets like land, plant, or warehouse. Also, they incur huge losses and do not have any other reserve as well. Despite this, their valuations keep going up to billions. Remember, Flipkart sold its controlling stake to Walmart at Rs 1.11 lakh crore,” says Sandip Ginodia of Abhishek Securities.

Dinesh Gupta, Partner at unlistedzone.com, explains the arithmetic of valuing an e-commerce entity. “E-commerce outfits are virtual shops and they are valued by their sales, at 10 to 15 times of annual sales. The multiple may be even higher in certain cases depending on growth stage of the segment,” he said.


What is the theory?
Fair value of any stock is very subjective till it gets listed. “Different sets of people can value the same thing using different methods to arrive at different numbers. Here, one sees value in something and the other does not,” says Ginodia.

Arun Mukherjee, a Kolkata-based value investor and co-founder of Sebi-registered SA Investment Advisors, says there is a ‘great fool theory’ at work behind the humungous valuations that these companies command.

“That theory says it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, and by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (a bigger or greater fool) willing to pay a higher price,” he said.

Even the largest e-commerce company of the world, Amazon, does not make any money, Ginodia points out. e-commerce is a global trend, which is why such a company will be valued higher even when they do not have any asset or profits. Since there is no structural mechanism, they are inflating valuations at will.


A trend or a business?E-commerce is the new trend currently. But once sentiment weakens, investors may rush to offload them. 

“These companies are valued only on the basis of top line and the growth they show. It is very hard to arrive at fair value,” said Ginodia.

Gupta says when a company is not listed, it does not need to focus on investors. “It does not opt for any mechanism like rights issue or bonus issue, which may downgrade their stock value. This is why any valuation is considered okay.”

Again, price alone cannot be a determinant of attractiveness of a stock. MRF currently trades around Rs 55,000, at 20 times the EPS of Rs 2,600. 

“This is does mean that the stock is not investor-friendly. Similarly, if Wipro had not given any bonus or split its share, the stock value would have been Rs 5 lakh today. They split it to ensure liquidity for investors,” Gupta said.


Key concernsE-commerce stocks do not see much volume in the unlisted space, mostly because of high valuations. “If they are to be listed in the stock market, the valuation will not be even 1/100th of what they are demanding. They are priced so high, but you would still buy it thinking that some another buyer will come later on,” says Mukherjee. 

He said investors should be very cautious while investing in the unlisted space. 

“Flipkart is making billions of losses every year. You are making sales in penny, but are valued in millions. This is crazy. There is no logic in it. At some point, these bubbles will burst for sure,” Mukherjee said.

According to him, Indian customers fall for discounts and offers and this is what the e-commerce companies are tapping to do business. But this is unlikely to continue forever. They will not make any profit anytime soon, perhaps next three to five years. 


The contrarian viewSome analysts say some promoters, like those of the e-commerce giants, want their stocks to trade at a premium among select investors. This is why companies like MRF, Page Industries or Shree Cements do not opt for a stock split or bonus issues.

Ola has slashed all discounts and will be in profit in a year or two. People will be using Ola as they have got used to it now. At a later stage, Paytm may start charging a fee for its services. It is active in many services, which will, in turn, enhance revenue. This is be the business model and most e-commerce companies follow the same, said Gupta."

4,2019-07-04,Shree Cement,"KOLKATA: Business leaders, Birla employees from schools and group companies, friends, well-wishers and relatives gathered to pay their last homage to Basant Kumar Birla at his residence 'Birla Park' on Gurusaday Road in Kolkata, on Thursday.

Harshavardhan Neotia of Ambuja Neotia Group, Hari Mohan and Prashant Bangur of Shree Cement, H P and Sanjay Budhia of Patton Group, N G Khaitan of Khaitan & Co, were among those who were present at 'Birla Park' where Basant Kumar Birla lay in state on a specially erected platform that was spread with red and white petals. Sides of the platform were lined with white flowers wreaths from friends, business houses, institutions and other dignitaries.

There was a sizable presence from academia and the consular corps who had gathered to catch a last glimpse of their beloved leader and pay a floral tribute. However, it was the common person who took centre-stage. They came singly with modest offerings of a fistful of petals as well as in groups representing associations close to Basant Kumar Birla, carrying a flower wreaths which were placed with some difficulty beside the body. The crowd waited patiently in a queue that snaked through one of the busiest thoroughfares of the city, stretching up to a kilometre. Some brought wreaths — big and small. Some came with a single rose bud, holding it close to the chest, lest it wilts.

Grandson Kumar Mangalam Birla, his family members and close relatives stood beside the body during the most part before proceeding towards Kalighat crematorium for the final lap of the Birla Group patriarch's journey slightly past 1 pm on the auspicious day of the Rath Yatra. Members of the Birla family including the patriarch's daughters Manjushree Khaitan and Jayshree Mohta, prominent Birla family members such as S K Birla and son Sidharth, and CK Birla bade an emotional adieu to the patriarch. 

The tall, silver-haired aristocratic industrialist B K Birla breathed his last at his Mumbai residence Wednesday afternoon. His cremation happened in Kolkata on Thursday in accordance with his 'express wishes'.

With his ancestors serving as powerful role models, teenage entrepreneur Basant Kumar pursued business activity with a passion that no one could quite curb, including his father Ghanshyam Das Birla who he greatly revered and regarded. However, he was drawn into a lot of simultaneous personal and co-curricular activity to fan an all round personality development that prevented him from becoming a 'business-worm'. Over the years, and with wife Sarala, he built up a formidable collection of sculptures, paintings and other art objects — many of which have been turned over to the Birla Academy of Art & Culture in Kolkata.

""Basant Kumar Birla was a distinguished industrialist who contributed to our nation’s prosperity. He also made a mark as an exceptional philanthropist. His passion for education was well-known. My thoughts are with his family and well-wishers in this hour of grief. Om Shanti,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.

Birla’s death has created a void that could not be filled, the Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said, recalling the 2013 Banga Bibhushan honour the state government conferred on him. President Ram Nath Kovind said: “Sorry to hear about the passing away of veteran industrialist Shri B K Birla. He made crucial contributions to business, education and several social causes.”"
3,2019-07-04,Shree Cement,"Net profits of Nifty 50 companies could climb 29 per cent on-year in the June quarter on expectations that some of the banks, which had shown significant asset stress a year ago, would perform better. Revenue will likely expand 7.4 per cent and log single-digit growth for the first time in nine quarters, reflecting higher base effect and slowing demand.

Banks, construction and cement companies, and capital-goods makers are likely to do better, given the higher rate of loan recoveries, increased capacity utilisation at plants, and rising prices. Automobile, consumer goods, metal and telecom companies are expected to report subdued earnings.

“The first-quarter corporate results will have the large base of Q1FY19 as an impediment. High-frequency data in India for Q1FY20 have been largely weak, although some respite was seen in steel and power generation in the first two months of the fiscal,” said Deepak Jasani, research head, HDFC Securities.

“The consumer space has also been facing a slowdown, compounded by tightness in the credit markets,” said Jasani of HDFC Securities.

Operating margin is expected to contract by 100 basis points (one percentage point) to 20.9 per cent in the June quarter. But it will still be better than the 18 per cent operating margin of the March 2019 quarter.

Growth momentum for the rest of FY20 hinges on the pace of demand recovery in various pockets of the economy — rural and urban consumption, and industry.

“The economy continues to suffer from slowdown across sectors and tight liquidity. All eyes are now on the budget and the extent to which these concerns will be addressed,” said Jasani.



SECTOR EXPECTATIONS

AUTOMOBILES
Earnings at auto companies will be under pressure for the second consecutive quarter owing to a sharp contraction in volume growth and lower capacity utilisation. Volume growth of passenger cars, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles dropped 10-22 per cent during the quarter following rising channel inventory. India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki’s volumes fell 19 per cent in the quarter, while Hero MotoCorp’s volumes dropped 12 per cent.


BANKING
The declining rate of fresh nonperforming loans at several banks is a major positive for the sector that has been battling poor asset quality for the past several quarters. State Bank of India, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank should report profit recoveries. Retail-oriented lenders, such as HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank, may report a further slowdown in credit offtake, in lockstep with slowing consumer demand.


CAPITAL GOODS
Capital expenditure by state governments and the public sector is likely to support the performance of capital goods companies. In addition, order inflows during general elections have been better than Street estimates.


CEMENT
The effect of rising cement prices was not fully visible in the previous quarter. In the June quarter, large cement companies are expected to benefit from the spillover effect of higher prices. Also, cement production in May rose 2-3 per cent on-year. Revenues of UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to rise by 10-15 per cent and net profit by 5-7 per cent.


FMCGThe June quarter results are likely to be affected by a slowdown in demand due to weak macroeconomic conditions amid water scarcity in rural India. FMCG companies are likely to post single-digit volume growth. Advertising spend may remain high as companies continue to invest in brands. The key factor to watch would be management commentaries on consumer demand in an environment of erratic rainfall and a broader economic slowdown.


IT
While the June quarter has traditionally been a good quarter for Indian IT companies, unfavourable currency movements and slower project ramp-ups in some cases may affect top line growth. TCS and Infosys are expected to report 2-2.5 per cent sequential growth in dollar-denominated revenues. Operating margins are likely to be under pressure.


METALS
Lower metal prices and slowdown in the local auto industry will likely affect earnings at metal companies, although a relatively weaker rupee may partially help offset the impact. Prices of steel, aluminium and zinc have fallen by up to 25 per cent from their peaks of last year, which should hit profitability.


PHARMA
Pharma companies are likely to continue their improved performance seen in the preceding quarter. While there are no major positives, price erosion in the US market has peaked, aiding their performance in the key market. Cost rationalisation on the R&D front is likely to continue. Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma and Cipla are expected to register improved performances.


TELECOM
A gradual decline in pressure on billing rates is the big takeaway for listed telecom companies. This may lead to a modest increase in revenue, but profitability may not improve much due to the intense competition."

In the past three years, in terms of returns, ET Cement Index (covers key cement companies) and ET Construction Index (covers prominent construction companies) have been unable to beat the benchmark index Nifty by a wide margin. A key cause for this has been valuation of these companies. But now, with the broad market fall, the valuation of select cement and construction companies seemed to be in the fair range.

To boost further sentiment in these counters is the proposed investments in the infrastructure segment by the government in the Union Budget. Let us understand investments in the housing sector. As regards, urban areas, the government has sanctioned close to Rs 4.83 lakh crore in order to construct 81 lakh houses. According to the Union Budget document, construction of 47 lakh houses have already begun. As regards rural areas, through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), between FY20 and FY22, the government proposes to construct 1.95 crore houses. In the past five years, the government has constructed close to 1.54 crore rural homes.

In the third phase of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the government plans to construct 1,25,000 km of roads in the next five years. This would entail an estimated investment of Rs 80250 crore. In all, the government plans to invest Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure sector in the next five years.

Among the construction companies, select well-placed companies which have superior execution capabilities and relatively higher number of financial closure to their projects are likely to see increased interest from the street. These companies are KNR Constructions, PNC Infratech, Dilip Buildcon and Ashoka Buildcon. Among cement companies, those companies which have enhanced capacity through acquisition or organic route, stand to benefit considerably. These companies are Ultratech Cement, Dalmia Bharat, Shree Cement, and The Ramco Cements. 

In the past three years, ET Cement index has given 22 per cent returns while Nifty has given 45.6 per cent in the same period. In the past three years, ET Construction index has given 48.9 per cent while the Nifty has given 45.6 per cent in the same period. In the next three years, the aforementioned counters are likely to generate high interest given the increase source of orders from the government's humongous investments in infrastructure sector."

A slowdown in economic growth amid the trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies has put Indian corporate earnings at risk, analysts say.

“It’s the confluence of headwinds -- weak global demand, fading impact of rupee depreciation, non-bank finance company crisis and scale-back of government spending -- which is deepening the slowdown,” Edelweiss Securities Ltd. analysts led by Prateek Parekh said in a note.

The country’s economic growth slumped to a five-year low of 5.8 per cent in January-March. The absence of any substantial fiscal stimulus for companies in the federal budget last week puts the onus back on the government to spur growth. The Reserve Bank of India has already cut interest rates three times this year and signaled more easing to come.

Edelweiss expects profits for companies in the NSE Nifty 50 Index rose 7 per cent year-on-year in the April-June period. The broker sees profit expansion concentrated in just a few sectors, namely financials, airlines, pharmaceuticals and cement.

Here’s what analysts expect from the results season that kicks off Tuesday with Asia’s top software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.


Reliance Securities (Naveen Kulkarni)



Expect “uninspiring” 1Q earnings. Nifty company profits are likely to grow by just 6 per cent, led by banks and financial services stocks.
Autos will be the major drag on earnings.
Inventory losses at oil marketing companies will hurt profits for the oil and gas sector.
Consumer sector will see growth challenges. Price growth is critical as volume growth tapers. Titan Co. Ltd., ITC Ltd., Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and Marico Ltd. top picks.
Building materials, infrastructure and capital goods will see healthy earnings. Top results picks are Ultratech, JK Cement, KEC International and Larsen & Toubro.


Dolat Capital



Agrochemicals and specialty chemicals are potential winners.
Auto companies are expected to report sharp drops in profits. Bajaj Auto Ltd. and TVS Motor Co Ltd are likely to report relatively better performance.
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd are likely to perform above par, but improvement in net interest margins is expected to remain marginal as funding costs are unlikely to taper materially.
Expect revenue growth to remain muted for consumer companies due to the liquidity crunch in the first half of the quarter.
Expect revenue momentum to continue for software exporters due to strong deal signings in 4Q. Cross-currency movement will have a negative impact of 10-50 bps on the dollar revenue of Indian IT vendors.


Edelweiss Securities (Prateek Parekh)



Auto margins are expected to be range-bound due to poor volumes. The benefits of relatively lower commodity costs are expected to be offset by company efforts to reduce inventories. Ashok Leyland, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Eicher Motors are top picks.
Tight liquidity, risk aversion and slower growth dent the earnings outlook for shadow lenders. Their overall assets under management likely grew 2.1 per cent q/q and 12.8 per cent y/y.
Among banks, those with robust deposits, pricing flexibility and ability to aggressively raise deposits have an edge. Edelweiss prefers ICICI Bank, SBI and Kotak Mahindra Bank; among NBFCs, the picks are Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Frinancial Services Ltd.
Sharp price hikes and easing fuel costs will offset impact of low demand for cement companies. Top picks are Shree Cement and JK Cement Ltd.
Consumer goods companies will post weak volume growth overall. Sees Britannia and Marico posting strongest growth, at over 6 per cent.
Positive on software exporters on basis of demand; prefer large caps due to execution capabilities, investment ability and better valuations. Buy on Infosys Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd. and HCL Technologies Ltd., Hold on Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Wipro Ltd.


Kotak Institutional Equities (Sanjeev Prasad)


The outlook is positive for corporate banks ICICI Bank and SBI given their inexpensive valuations and visibility of steady progress toward RoE “normalization.” Yes Bank will face one of its most challenging quarters. There is more focus on asset quality for IndusInd Bank Ltd. and RBL Bank Ltd.
Expect sharp improvement in profits for Indigo on higher yields and after Jet Airways stopped functioning.
Reliance Industries is likely to report a marginal q/q increase in standalone Ebitda led by higher refining margins, an increase in crude throughput and petchem volumes."

11,2019-07-15,Shree Cement,"As many as 16 Indian companies, including IT bigwigs Infosys and TCS, have expressed worries about the risks of climate change to their businesses in the next five years, according to a report. The 16 Indian companies are in various sectors like banking, cement, IT, consumer goods, automobiles, electric utility, mining, gas processing and distribution, business and financial services and textiles, the report by global forum Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) stated.

""As climate change threats are on the rise, risks to businesses are also correspondingly increasing. A group of world's biggest companies representing nearly 17 trillion US Dollars (USD) in market capitalization have valued the climate risks to their businesses at almost 1 trillion USD - with many likely to hit within the next five years,"" the report said. The CDP is a global disclosure system that enables companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts. It collects and collates self-reported environmental data in the world.

The data was collected by the CDP and compiled into a report after over 200 global companies, including 16 Indian businesses responded to its questionnaire and shared threats to their business due to water scarcity. The Indian companies are - Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services(TCS), GAIL, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services, Hindustan Zinc, Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, Shree Cement, Tata Chemicals, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Motors, Tata Power Co, Wipro and Arvind Ltd, a textile company.

Infosys and TCS expressed concern over their workforce and operations being affected due to climate change and the changes in the availability of natural resources like water in regions where they operate. ""A significant proportion of our workforce is based out of offices in coastal cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata which have high exposure to extreme weather events like precipitation, cyclones, rise in sea level, etc,"" the report said quoting TCS.

According to the report, banks and financial institutions lend money to a myriad of industries that face direct climate risks such as increased instances of natural disasters, depletion of water resources and impact on human capital. It said that Axis Bank is a lender to the agricultural sector, which has a high risk of crop failures or disruptions in production due to floods, droughts, cyclones and other natural disasters.

""The disasters affect the production capacity and ability of industries lying in their wake. The Bank is a significant lender to all such sectors, and thus these risks also impact its own portfolio,"" it said. SBI, which also has a significant agricultural portfolio, told the CDP that the negative effect of climate change and increased probability of droughts will adversely affect loans to be paid back in time, thereby leaving it susceptible to credit risk.

Gas processing and distribution company GAIL is also at the risk of being hit by climate change as its major compressor station and pipeline installation is located near the sea and is highly vulnerable to get adversely impacted due to rising sea levels. ""Rising sea levels would for certain impact our coastal facilities and can lead to even closure of operations in the worst case. Even higher probability occurrence is likely floods due to storm surges becoming more frequent,"" the report said quoting GAIL.

Hindustan Zinc, the mining company said it has three smelters and five mines located in Rajasthan, so change in the precipitation level is one of the major risk areas for it. ""Change in precipitation level further intensifies the problem as our operations in mining and smelter industry are heavily dependent on water availability. If there is less rainfall in these areas in future, it may affect our operations and productivity due to inadequate supply of water leading to a direct impact on company's revenue."""

12,2019-07-18,Shree Cement,"Reliance Securities has given a hold recommendation on Ramco Cements (TRCL) with a target price of Rs 770.

Shares of Ramco Cements traded at Rs 772 around 2:45 pm on 18 July, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.

""We maintain our hold recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 770 (valuing at 12 times of FY21 Ebitda),"" said the brokerage.


View of the brokerage: 


Cement-clinker (cc) ratio dips marginallyTRCL’s Cement-Clinker (CC) ratio for FY19 marginally declined to 1.30 times against 1.32 times in FY18 mainly due to significant reduction in blending and higher OPC demand in its key Southern markets. 

Fly-ash and slag blending in percentage per tonne of cement reduced to 24.6 per cent and 59.1 per cent, respectively in FY19. 

While there have hardly been any clinker sales, it has doubled its export during the year to Rs 110 crore. 

However, likely pick-up in Eastern sales volume post new GUs will aid to improve the ratio. Its annual clinker production grew by 20 per cent YoY to 8.62mnT.


Interest bearing debt increased significantly by Rs 600 crore
While consolidated gross debt increased by Rs 520 crore to Rs 1,640 crore (standalone debt at Rs 1,620 crore), interest-bearing loan increased by Rs 620 crore to Rs 1,490 crore in FY19, as interest free deferred sale tax loan declined from Rs 250 crore against Rs 150 crore in FY18. 

""Going forward, we expect its gross debt to increase from Rs 1,640 crore to Rs 2,000 crore in FY21E despite TRCL is likely to incur more than Rs 2,370 crore in next two years for its ongoing capex programme,"" said the brokerage.


FCF turns negative after six years on cost pressure, soft realisation & higher capex
An increase of Rs 145 per tonne in operating cost per tonne and over about 5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) decline in blended realisation led to decline in interest adjusted OCF to Rs 740 crore in FY19 against Rs 1,050 crore in FY18 despite a sharp about 19.4 per cent YoY increase in sales volume. 

Notably, higher fuel and input prices led to increase in opex. Further, TRCL reported a negative FCF of Rs 410 crore after six years led by higher capex of about Rs 1,200 crore. 

The brokerage believes stronger operating cash flow mainly due to higher realisation and benign cost environment are likely to turn its FCF positive in the current fiscal itself.


Board composition still remains static; two key executives account for 10 per cent of profit
As per the brokerage, TRCL’s board members continued to remain static despite inclusion of M.F. Farooqi in FY18 in place of P.R. Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha. 

The members of Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee also broadly remained static. 

However, Justice Chitra Venkataraman is inducted in Audit Committee during the year, while R.S. Agarwal continued to be the Chairman in Audit and Remuneration committees for several years. 

""We further note that TRCL’s top two executives drew about 10 per cent of annual profit, which is significantly higher in absolute terms than its peers and other conglomerate barring few,"" the brokerage said.


Depleting limestone reserves; a key concern 
TRCL highlights that since several state governments do not have required geological data for availability of limestone reserves, obtaining fresh mining leases by the companies will be delayed further. 

Notably, the existing limestone mines reserves of cement companies are depleting at faster rate and consequently shortened life span of the mines. 

As many as 106 mineral blocks were notified by state governments for conduct of auction, post amendment of MMDR 2015. However, only 54 blocks had been auctioned, out of which 24 blocks are limestone mines. 

TRCL states that out of the total auctioned blocks, only 4-5 blocks have reportedly come to the stage of production so far. Pan-India players like UltraTech, Ambuja and Shree Cement secured 2-3 mines each albeit at higher cost. 

""We reckon that average cost of securing limestone reserve fell to Rs 530 per tonne, which including 3 mines stood at Rs 1,000-1,300 per tonne,"" said the brokerage.


Strategic investments for two entities 
TRCL made strategic investments in two companies during the year with aggregating equity investment of Rs 16.2 crore. 

It invested Rs 4.5 crore and Rs 11.7 crore in Ramco Industrial & Technology Services (RITSL) and Lynks Logistics (LLL) , respectively. It indicated that these investments were made for the expansion of businesses. 

While RITS is a subsidiary of TRCL with 94 per cent financial interest, LLL is an associate company with 49 per cent financial interest. 

LLL is involved in goods transport services and generated revenue and net loss of Rs 40.6 crore and Rs 21.8 crore, respectively, in FY19. 

Similarly, RITSL is involved in businesses of supplying manpower and transportation of goods by road and IT services. Its revenue and net loss stood at Rs 35.9 crore and Rs 98 lakh, respectively, in FY19.


Outlook & valuation
Capacity expansion of 6.2mnT (40 per cent of existing capacity) for Rs 5,500 ($80 per tonne) without stretching its B/S with DE ratio of 0.3 time bodes well for TRCL. 

""We maintain our long-term positive view on TRCL on the back of sustained volume growth and improving operational efficiency. 

However, we marginally reduce our Ebitda estimate by 1 per cent/2.5 per cent for FY20E/FY21E mainly to factor in soft sales volume in Q1FY20,"" said the brokerage. 

At the current market price, the stock trades at 15.3 times and 13.1 times Ebitda of FY20E and FY21E, respectively, which appear to be fairly valued."

14,2019-07-25,Shree Cement,"The next two quarters you should have a hunting list and just buy good businesses whenever there is a fall in the stock., says Devang Mehta, Head, Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


The earnings season was kicked off by IT with a bang, particularly on TCS, but midway through, we see That some of the mid-tier banks for are seeing a little bit of pressure. Will pain persist for another couple of quarters? What is your takeaway from the earnings?The pain would probably last for a couple of quarters more. Why I say that is because the earnings were not as bad as people were expecting. It was more or less predicted to be a washout quarter but the numbers did not disappoint the Street though the commentaries are surely disappointing the street. 

Largecap as well as the mid-tier banks have all been talking about a demand slowdown -- right from HDFC Bank to even RBL Bank. The SME sector is slowing down, the problem of credit which has struck the economy since the last seven, eight months, all have been deterrents for the economy and market. Plus, in consumer names, Dabur numbers were excellent, A 9.7% volume growth is an aberration in this type of an environment.

But if you listen to the commentary of this management. there was not much optimism for the next couple of quarters. So yes, there can probably be pain. If you ask me whether it is a blue sky scenario, no. But is it an opportunity in adversity? The answer is yes. The next two quarters you should have a hunting list and just buy good businesses whenever there is a fall in the stock. 


We are expecting some amount of a decline in volumes this time. Even though cement has been looked at favourably lately, in terms of earnings we are expecting to see revenues as well as PAT a little lower for Ambuja. What are your expectations and what is your view on the cement names right now?Clearly we have been quite positive on cement names. A few like UltraTech or Shree Cement has been bought into the portfolios in the last six, nine months. And yes, what a run it has had during this trying times. 

Clearly the budget which laid down a little bit of impetus on infrastructure plus housing for all -- is one segment. Low-cost housing or housing for all which still keeps on growing in an overall pessimistic segment. 

Our sense is that cement demand, cement realisations as well as capacity utilisations in the last couple of quarters has been trending upwards. So, cement probably merits a place in the portfolio. It looks more a cyclical story but for the next three years, it looks to be a structural story. We would probably consider cement with the more frontline names rather than the midcap names.


What about Yes Bank? On the back of the fund raising exercise that they are currently undergoing, there are still some concerns that given the state of the bank, the valuations will completely go out of the window and it might actually be difficult. On the other hand you got news coming in that some of these PE funds are just lining up to be part of that QIP. Would you still buy into a Yes Bank in case they are able to raise those funds or would you be completely averse to the story?We have been avoiding accidents at this point of time because as I said, quality has commended some premium in the market. I would not be able to comment on individual stocks but the sense here is that when your largecaps or market leaders also start to fall, buy the market leaders. If these stocks are too expensive, buy the next big one. If you feel that Asian Paints is costly, and that there are companies like Berger Paints, go in for Asian Paints and Berger Paints. We tend to remain with a couple of more market leaders rather than going into the space where we feel there will be difficulties in terms of not only losing market share but also losing business while you get into your balance sheet issues and sort those out.


Just when the sector dynamics were beginning to look up for telecom and most of these companies were beginning to deleverage, and the Street was also turning pretty bullish in the prospects of Bharti Airtel. Now comes this dampener in the form of big fines on Airtel and Idea Vodafone.We remain very cautious on this sector. In fact, we have not bought this sector in the last two-three years. My sense is though the debt equation was getting lower and the market was divided into three companies which are ruling the roost, it is still a crowded trade. Lots of people buy it as a contra trade but we would still avoid it. As you said, there are lots of such issues which can creep up and whenever the auction comes up, debt issues will come to the fore. Avoid this sector. There is so much of fall happening in the broader markets. The best stocks have started falling in the last 8-10 days. There are better opportunities to be in this type of businesses rather than being in the telecom sector at this point. 


Canara Bank and quite a few other banks have come out with numbers. Today it is the turn of Bank of Baroda. We can’t compare the numbers to last year’s because of the overall merger, but what is it that you are expecting?The earnings growth of a lot of these banks would be fair and watched into. In the last couple of quarters, there have been a lot of recoveries. The NPA has come down for a lot of PSU and corporate banks as well and the mettle of taking the earnings growth of Nifty or Sensex of the benchmark indices has been more or less done by all these banks. 

I think there would be a recovery at least in terms of sentiment for a lot of these banks. Probably PSU banks would not be in the hunting list but there seems to be enough evidence that with interest rates heading downwards, with inflation also trending down and probably a little bit of a boost or sentiment booster from the government or from the RBI would go a long way in giving the banks that extra zig. 
I can say that the BFSI sector which has been the darling of the market before the big fall, could continue and banks again probably could lead the rise whenever it starts."

2,2019-08-05,Shree Cement,"New Delhi: The roller-coaster ride in the stock market in the first seven months of Calendar 2019 cost equity investors about Rs 6.07 lakh crore. The equity indices touched new all-time highs and then fell sharply within this period.

Yet, some of the top Indian billionaires still managed to add huge wealth to their fortunes.

According to Bloomberg's billionaire Index, 5 out of 10 Indian billionaires have become richer till July-end, out of which four have managed to add at least $1 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) to their wealth during this period.

Wipro’ Azim Premji gained the most, among Indian billionaires, with his wealth soaring by $3.06 billion on year to date basis. His net worth stood at $20.4 billion at as of August 2. Shares of Wipro advanced around 6 per cent this year.

Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani saw his wealth rise by $2.94 billion during the year. The owner of the world’s largest and most refinery complex in Jamnagar was worth $47.3 billion on July 30, 2019. The stock is up over 2 per cent year to date, but it has been on a falling spree for past 10 sessions.

Mukesh Ambani’s other listed entity Reliance Industrial Infrastructure (RIIL) has, however, lost over 33 per cent during this period. 

Uday Kotak, CMD of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has earned over $1.96 billion so far this year. His total wealth stood at $13.4 billion as of July 30. Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank are up over 19 per cent on a year-to-date basis till August 1, while Sensex has posted a positive return of 1.08 per cent.

Among others, Gautam Adani of Adani Group, Benu Gopal Bangur of Shree Cements and Shiv Nadar of HCL Technologies have seen their net worth rise by $1.11 billion, $0.88 billion and $0.84 billion to $0.61 billion, respectively.

Shares of Adani Gas have jumped 50.22 per cent. Adani Power (up 15.52 per cent) and Adani Transmission (up 3.05 per cent) also gained up to 16 per cent this year.

HCL Technologies has seen its value go up 5.93 per cent. Shares of Shree Cements are up 16.06 per cent on a year-to-date basis.

Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal ($511 million) and Bajaj Group's Rahul Bajaj ($73 million) are others who managed to add to their wealth during this period.

However, steel tycoon and ArcelorMittal’s Lakshmi Mittal has seen biggest wealth erosion among Indian billionaires. He lost $2.01 billion on year to date basis, which shrank his total net worth to $11.8 billion.

Wadia Group Chairman Nusli Wadia's wealth dropped by about $1.44 billion to $5.86 billion.

Savitri Jindal, richest Indian woman and Chairperson Emeritus of Jindal Steel & Power, has lost a little over $1.26 billion this year on a year-to-date basis. Her wealth has dropped to $6.20 billion.

Dilip Sanghvi of Sun Pharma, Radhakrishan Damani of Avenue SuperMarts, Kumar Manglam Birla of Aditya Birla Group and Cyrus Pooonawalla of Poonawalla Group are some of the other prominent names who have lost about half a billion dollars in wealth each during this selloff. 

Shares of Jindal Steel and Power, Britannia Industries, Avenue Supermarts and Sun Pharma have lost 30 per cent, 17.46 per cent, 7.02 per cent and 2.79 per cent, respectively."
3,2019-08-06,Shree Cement,"A wave of uncertainty has engulfed markets due to weak demand and earnings uncertainty. In such a situation, it makes sense to stay with bluechip companies as they provide a better shield in times of economic slowdown given their dominant market share, pricing power and low debt. 

This serves well for conservative investors looking for safer options that deliver returns greater than fixed deposits. 

Among schemes that have very high exposure to blue chips and have been consistently beating the benchmark index and peers by a fair margin is Axis Bluechip. The scheme invests close to 87% of its portfolio in bluechip companies. Of these, the top six companies make up 61% of the scheme’s portfolio.

 A large part of the portfolio (45%) is invested in financials which include private sector banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Given their better asset quality and retail focus than PSU banks, this strategy works in generating higher or providing stable returns in the longterm. 

This element of spotting companies which have high asset quality is one of the themes of the scheme’s portfolio. And it has paid off. In the past three-year and five-year periods, the scheme has given 12.6% and 11.3% returns, respectively, while its peers have given average returns of 8.4% and 8.7%, respectively, in the same periods.

8,2019-08-12,Shree Cement,"Investment interests of institutional investors play a significant role in the way stock markets move. On an aggregate basis, institutional investors held more than 25% stake in the constituent stocks of the BSE500 index in the April-June 2019 quarter. Institutional investors include FPIs, domestic mutual funds, foreign venture capital funds, banks, insurance companies and pension funds.These large and sophisticated investors employ quality workforce, which help them track developments in the domestic and global financial markets. Moreover, they are in a position to forecast critical economic variables like inflation, currency values and interest rates that influence the performance of the stock markets. Negative sentiments of large institutional investors can put stock markets into turmoil. The recent market volatility is the result of a massive sell-off by FPIs that panicked after the government mooted additional surcharge on the super rich category. FPIs hold over 13% stake in the BSE500 companies as of the June 2019 quarter on an aggregate basis.Identifying stocks that witness increase in stake by institutional investors is a common investment strategy. However, we tried to analyse stocks that were shunned by this sophisticated investor group. In the June 2018 quarter, there were over 1,150 companies in which institutional investors held over 4% stake. Out of these, institutions reduced their stake in 504 companies between June 2018 and June 2019 quarters.To identify the most unwanted stocks, we considered those with a market cap greater than Rs 500 crore and analysed their institutional stake for three quarters— June 2018, March 2019 and June 2019. Stocks that witnessed an absolute stake decline of over 5% between June 2018 and June 2019 quarters were filtered out. Additionally, stocks should also have witnessed a decline in institutional stake between March 2019 and June 2019 quarters.To examine the current and the future investment potential of the most unwanted stocks, only those that are covered by at least five Bloomberg analysts were filtered out. We found seven such unwanted stocks. Fundamental issues, high valuations and a number of domestic and global macro factors have negatively affected the performance of the Indian stock markets in the last one year. Looking at the data for the listed companies, over 84% have delivered negative returns between 2 August 2018 and 2 August 2019. However, such considerable selling and the resultant price reduction have improved valuations for most of the companies.Compared to the MSCI emerging markets index, the valuation premium of BSE Mid-cap, BSE Small-cap and BSE100 index has come down from 88%, 51% and 63% respectively in August 2018 to 42%, 17% and 43% respectively in August 2019. Such valuation premium is judged in terms of the Bloomberg’s 12-month blended forward PE multiple.Due to the improved valuations, even some of the most unwanted stocks are available at bargain valuations. Let us look at the future potential of the shortlisted companies by looking at the views of the brokerages and analysts.STOCKS TO BUY1.

Analysts believe that the bank’s credit costs and nonperforming loans will continue to remain elevated in 2019-20, posing a threat to the bank’s asset quality.

11,2019-08-15,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: An inter-ministerial committee is being formed to plan, review and execute the Jammu & Kashmir Global Investors Summit scheduled to take place from October 12 to 14, top government officials said.

The committee with officials from the ministries of power, commerce, tourism and home among others and key state officials will hold regular meetings with various stakeholders to ensure maximum investments flow into J&K, they told ET.

More than 2,000 dignitaries, including top business heads, senior ministers and officials, are expected to attend the government's first big event in J&K after the abrogation of Article 370. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, is expected to take part in the event.

Till Wednesday, nearly 45 companies have already expressed interest to invest around Rs 3,000 crore in Jammu and Kashmir, state administration sources told ET.

Availability of industrial land, stability, cost of power and skilling labour are the top concerns raised by investors, officials said, adding that this has been communicated to the Governor.



Sameer Gupta, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Northern Region that is working with the J&K administration to reach out to investors, said there was a good deal of interest from companies in pharma, power, tourism and cement sectors. “The time is short, but the daily reassurance of the government that the situation will be normal soon is working well to attract investment,” he said.

Navin K Choudhary, principal secretary of industry and commerce and tourism departments in J&K, said there would be special focus on adventure tourism. “Traditionally, J&K has only seen spiritual tourism. But there is a lot of scope for ecotourism and adventure tourism in the state that we are working to expand.”

He said most districts of J&K were peaceful with only a few “localised” incidents of unrest.

Companies that have confirmed their presence in the event include Trident Group, Shree Cement, Amul, Steelbird, Lemon Tree, Coca-Cola, Radisson, Dabur, Tata Group, Mahindra, Lupin, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Cadila Pharmaceuticals, and Berger Paints, officials said.

A top J&K official said investors have also asked for clarity on the availability of holiday homes, rental housing, and office and commercial spaces in J&K, and details about access to technology, capital, and marketing. Some of them are also hoping the government will announce special incentives for businesses, particularly new sets of industrial areas.

“Right now, they have been assured to wait and watch as the situation is likely to improve after August 15, after which we will also schedule meetings with them,” the official said."

2,2019-09-04,Shree Cement,"The risk reward on Nifty is for a 1,000-points upside by Diwali, rather than a 200-points downside, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice-President, IIFL Securities. Globally, a rebound into riskier assets like equity is just round the corner and in that emerging markets and India will definitely find their place to gain. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 



Do you believe that part of the asset allocation should be towards precious metals in times like these -- gold or silver perhaps?The best of gold has played out and in the Indian context, you will see some of the smart money actually sell gold and get into SIPs. I see no replacement for SIPs. By the way, HDFC Asset Management is hitting new highs which tells you the conversion from hard assets like gold into liquid assets like equities is here to stay. If I can stick my neck out I would say, sell your gold and your US dollars and get into a slightly more riskier asset like equity, where the risk reward just on the Nifty is for a 1000 points on the upside by Diwali, rather than 200 points on the downside. 

So, I am not canvassing owning gold. We thought gold was a good buy if you had the last six months with you, but this extreme pessimism on $18 trillion hiding in negative yield assets is bound to break in the next one month. Globally, a rebound into riskier assets like equity is just round the corner and in that emerging markets and India will definitely find their place to gain. 


Do you think that there is more pain in store for auto? It is a glass half full, half empty. We have seen most of the pain get in and we think this month onwards, you should see a lot of traction on the upside. Plus there is a GST meet and if something happens there -- we are very sure there could be some tinkering -- then that should bode well. 

But the base effect and the despondency of last three months should see the return of the consumer and we are not all that bearish on the markets now. A large part of that is being played out in the prices. If I could name three stocks where we are doing a SIP and which we recommend for the next six-eight-ten weeks, it would be Ashok Leyland, Maruti, Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto or Hero MotoCorp. These four will give you the best type of returns but they will be back-ended. There is maybe another quarter or so of weakness on the numbers but the base effect and the next three months should bode very well for auto if you are a contrarian, in fact for the whole market. If you can look at a lot of midcaps, you cannot but make money if you just sit through the next two, two-and-a-half months. 


What is the outlook on IT? A lot of investors are finding it a hiding space in a market like this. Is there merit in midcap IT names?We think the risk reward from here on industrials, banks, select commodities is extremely positive and you can generate at least a 30-40% return in the next one year. IT is no longer a hiding place. The rupee selloff is also overdone. You are not going to look at 4-5% growth rate on stocks or sectors which are anyway over-owned. If I could, it would be HCL Tech which is one of my favourites and from Rs 950 levels, the stock has been an outperformer. But we will not chase it. We think that Lupin, Sun, Dr Reddy’s or for a better potential if you want to play the rupee, we will put money on industrials which we think have bottomed out and in the next three months could start to generate huge alpha. So, L&T, Axis Bank and IndusInd, and a whole host of industrials which are India centric and where we can see a lot of visibility going into the next six months. 


 Just when you thought that the going is going to get better for pharmaceuticals, you get this news on Sun Pharma?Well the company has been through a lot and we know that corporate governance issues have been there. They have tried to allay a lot of these fears and rightly so. At least, the earnings were very, very pleasant and the earnings are where we are going to put our mouth. These are routine enquiries like FDA concerns which are overlooked. Look at Lupin, today they announced a big pact with Boehringer and where is the stock? Nothing. Lupin is a grossly undervalued stock. They are diversifying their business, they are getting an electronic mode on all their handling of FDA issues and so on. If you have a one-year-window, pharma could be the dark horse of 2020 with huge outperformance. It could actually take the place of IT as a proxy for the rupee weakness or the local businesses stabilising or for tie-ups. This is what Dr Reddy and Lupin are in the quest of or Sun for that matter. These small issues are only a small setback. The earnings are going to be huge outperformers in the next one year. 


How you are looking at the big PSU bank recapitalisation as well as mergers? It is a very positive step but you are looking at the near term, where the market is now beating everything black and blue. But in the longer term, this will definitely create wealth over a period of time. I see in the next six to nine months, a lot of business being generated and they have got recapitalisation plus the positive would be that the weaker banks will not be that proxy to lending, it will go through the one major pivotal bank and in the next one and a half years, these can be huge outperformers over a period of time. 

In the present term, State Bank and Bank of Baroda perfectly fit the bill and if you own these stocks, then stay put. But State Bank can really be a big outperformer in the next one year on the PSU side. 


What do you like in the cement space?There was too much pessimism in the last few days. We are contrarian, we think cement numbers along with paint industry were very strong and we see no let up, given that we have had a very strong monsoon. Price rises across the board will be in place and we think low-cost housing is going to be the theme for the next few years. So, cement could be an outperformer. It would be UltraTech, Ambuja and Shree Cement in that order where we are putting our money. We have recommended a SIP in this also in the last six weeks. We continue to hold it for another six weeks but these three stocks could be very sweet performers come the month of November."

4,2019-09-10,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Four power producers, including Jindal Power and JSW Energy, are set to supply 1,000 MW power collectively to three south Indian states at a tariff of Rs 4.41 per unit for short-term under a pilot scheme to bring back stressed power assets on stream.

Under Pilot Scheme-II of Ministry of Power, Jindal Power would supply 315 MW, followed by Korba West Power Company (295 MW), JSW Energy (290 MW), Essar Power M P Ltd (100 MW).

NHPC was appointed an aggregator by PFC Consultancy through e-tendering for Pilot Scheme-II.

""NHPC has got confirmation from three south Indian states for signing short-term (for 3 years) power purchase agreements (PPAs) for supply of 1,000 MW. Therefore, the letters of award have been issued to four companies -- Jindal Power, Korba West Power Company, JSW Energy and Essar Power M P Ltd -- for supply of 1,000 MW collectively,"" a source said.

The PPAs for supply of 1,000 MW to three states are expected to be signed in a month, the source said.

State-owned hydro power giant NHPC is the aggregator for tying up 2,500 MW power under the scheme.

""NHPC is in advance stages of negotiations with other states in the country for tying up for remaining 1,500 MW of power through coal-fired power plants. The PPA could be inked in a month after states' confirmation,"" the source said.

The objective of the scheme is to facilitate procurement of power for three years from coal-based power plants that are already commissioned, but do not have PPAs.

Since a PPA is a prerequisite for getting coal linkage, these plants are under stress.

Earlier this year, NHPC had discovered a tariff of Rs 4.41 per unit in a reverse auction under the scheme.

Under the auction, Jindal Power was allowed the highest supply of 315 MW, followed by Korba West Power Company (295 MW), JSW Energy (290 MW), Essar Power M P Ltd (200 MW), Jindal Power (200 MW), DB Power (165 MW) and MB Power Madhya Pradesh (125 MW).

RKM Powergen got 165 MW, followed by Sembcorp Gayatri Power (150 MW), Jindal India Thermal Power (115 MW), Jaypee Bina (100 MW), Jaypee Nigrie Super (100 MW), TRN Energy (100 MW), SKS Power Generation Chhattisgarh (100 MW), and Shree Cement (80 MW).

In October 2018, PTC India, as an aggregator, had finalised supply of 1,900 MW capacity under the first such scheme at a tariff of Rs 4.24 per unit and PPAs were signed on October 29, 2019.

RKM Powergen (550 MW), Jhabua Power Ltd (100 MW), MB Power Ltd (175 MW), SKS Power (300 MW), Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd (125 MW), IL&FS Energy (550 MW) and JP Nigrie (100 MW) were the successful bidders under Scheme-I.

The procuring discoms under Scheme-I were of Telangana and Tamil Nadu for 550 MW each, West Bengal and Bihar for 200 MW each, while Haryana had consented to sign for 400 MW."
6,2019-09-11,Shree Cement,"Outperformance in small and midcaps likely to last for a few more sessions, says Dipan Mehta, Founder & Director, Elixir Equities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

The smallcaps were on the move today. Do you expect sustained buying there?Last week and so far this week has been positive for midcap and smallcap stocks. Investors seem to be agreeable to buy at slightly higher levels as well. What we are seeing is definitely follow-through buying and stocks which have been beaten down completely in auto, banks, commodities seem to be outperforming at this point of time. All signals suggest that this kind of outperformance may last for a few more trading sessions. 

But more importantly, it seems at this point of time all the bad news has got discounted and we certainly have a bottom in place. Now, whether it is the ultimate bottom from where the market does turn, only time will tell. But at least this phase of the bear market seems to be over and depending on how the next few trading sessions are, that will determine the course of this particular phase of the bear market whether it is turning around to be a bull market or we are going to find and trade at lower and lower bottoms. We are at a critical juncture is what I see the stock markets at this point of time and we will have an earnings season over the next six weeks or so. It will be a very important earning season especially from management commentary point of view.


How you are looking at the overall metals basket? Could you pick out some of the largecaps within metals?Although traditionally we have not been very positive on commodities, these companies have seen a huge slide and right now, there is a lot of pressure because of domestic as well as global slowdown on account of trade war. 

But these are cyclicals and deep cyclicals and at some point of time, commodity prices will stabilise and start to move up. It could be 12 months, 24 months down the line. Maybe stock prices will start moving up even before that. But as and when we will turn around in these commodity prices, you can expect a fabulous rally in whole lot of commodities stocks as well. 

Over a three-year period, if they do have another upcycle from these levels, a lot of the commodity stocks can easily go up by 70% to 100% or so. These are not levels to sell off the commodity stocks like metals and maybe at corrections, if you are underweight in metals in a particular portfolio, you could look at selectively buying into some of the largecap metal companies and our preference would be for steel companies like Tata Steel or JSW and maybe Hindalco in aluminium, rather than a NALCO, where there is the possibility of M&A activity which may be earnings accretive over a longer period.


What about real estate? Do you see any reason to buy in at the bottom?Yes absolutely and especially cement companies which are focussed on the economy segment. Companies like Kolte Patil, Prestige Estates and to an extent even Godrej Properties could certainly do well, going forward. These companies have reported good earnings. You could include DLF also which is not exactly into economy segment but then there are certain special situations over there. One can have an exposure to real estate sector through these three-four companies.

Right positioning in terms of price and area and focussing on sales rather than developing a land bank, clearly has paid off for these companies and their balance sheets are in great shape, which we think will outperform going forward.


What is your view on the IT space?IT had served well for investors in the bear market and whatever little allocation investors had they had some at least capital protection as far as IT is concerned. Lot of the IT companies are more like utility companies. They will give any way from 8% to 10% type of top line, bottom line growth rate and that is fine in a bear market. But as and when the bull market starts to pick up, you will find IT companies start underperforming.

Then there is this entire fear within the IT space about overall global slowdown and that may certainly impact IT companies. It has not so far and whatever commentary has come through from the software companies, managements has been positive. But we have seen in the past that whenever the US economy goes for a soft landing, IT companies get affected and within that also, major sectors like manufacturing, retail as well as banking and financial services are under more stress than some of the other segments.

 I would be a bit cautious in software at this point of time. If I am convinced that the markets in fact are turning and we are going to get into higher tops, higher bottoms and the worst is over, then I would certainly think in terms of getting underweight into IT and overweight into some of the cyclicals.


How you are looking at cement as a pocket? Is the overall dynamics improving?Yes absolutely and there is a good deal of price discipline within the cement companies and although volume growth was certainly lacking in the last quarter, but that was more than made up by the kind of increase in operating profit margins that the sector as a whole witnessed and we are quite positive on cement. It is a cyclical industry, should benefit from higher government spending, increased infrastructure spending and there is adequate capacity within the sector to grow and take advantage of any increase demand which may take place.

I would prefer companies which are the largest in the space. Something like UltraTech Cement which will also benefit from merger of Century’s cement units as they start getting integrated. Alsom Shree Cement which has been one of the most successful cement companies in terms of low capital cost of setting up new cement plants and targeting the right market. Between these two companies, one should get decent returns as far as exposure to cement sector is concerned."
5,2019-09-11,Shree Cement,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest money manager by assets, was busy buying select banks, PSU and infrastructure stocks all through August, even as BSE Sensex slid marginally by 0.40 per cent.

The fund house increased exposure to YES Bank, ITC, NHPC, Coal India and SBI; stocks that have plunged between 7 per cent and 65 per cent since January 2019. It added 1.59 crore shares of Bharat Electronics whose share price has rallied nearly 25 per cent so far this calendar. BSE benchmark Sensex is up just 2.46 per cent year to date.

“Indian equities are offering good value,” Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC Asset Management, told ETNow. “When largecaps start offering good value, you are unlikely to get it wrong, because these are big businesses with low leverage. Corporate leverage in India has come down,” he said.

Ace Mutual Fund database showed HDFC AMC held 6.02 crore shares of YES Bank as of August 31 against 2.57 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house sees value in the private sector lender.

“Most of the businesses, which were in deep pain have either been sold or are in a state where they do not really matter. They are doing reasonably well and things are okay,” he said.

The fund house bought 71.50 lakh additional shares in oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries.

Analysts have turned upbeat on the prospects of RIL stock after its telecom arm Reliance Jio this past week rolled out its broadband offering JioFiber across 1,600 cities.

“This is disruptive. The consumers targeted use data in a big way,” said Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director at KR Choksey Investment Managers. He expects the stock to double in three years.

HDFC AMC also added shares of banking majors ICICI Bank (30 lakh shares), Axis Bank (21.67 lakh) and HDFC Bank (17.51 lakh) besides doing a fair bit of buying on the counters of DCB Bank (16.61 lakh), RBL Bank (7.50 lakh) and Federal Bank (7.59 lakh).

Saravana Kumar, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund, says retail-focused private lenders with strong balance sheets should do well going forward. “These banks will also corner some market shares from NBFCs and PSUs,” he said.

Jain’s team at HDFC Mutual Fund also bought over 10 lakh shares each in Avenue Supermarts, Tata Steel, Delta Corp, BPCL, Bajaj Electricals and Indian Hotels.

Inox Fluorochemicals, Pidilite Industries, Piramal Enterprises, SRF and Sterling and Wilson were among the fund house’s fresh buys, while it completely exited Havells India and Shree Cement.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 122 companies and offloaded shares of 33 across sectors. It held 314 stocks as of August 31, 2019.

Among the stocks in which the fund house offloaded between 1 lakh to 2.50 crore shares during the month were BHEL, SAIL, Reliance Nippon Life Asset, NIIT Technologies, Tata Chemicals, Shriram Transport Finance, Just Dial, Bharti Airtel, Ambuja Cement, Elecon Engineering, Zee Entertainment, Rites, Wonderla Holidays, Solar Industries, S Chand and IndiaMART InterMESH.

It also sold more than 1 lakh shares of auto majors including Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp. India this August recorded the steepest drop in auto sales ever since the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had started collating monthly wholesale vehicle sales data in 1997-98.

Jain of HDFC Asset Management said he sold auto stocks mainly due to valuations. “The prices have come down, but multiples have not come down because earnings will also de-grow sharply. First investment has to revive, salaries have to go up and only then can we make a case for a sustained revival in consumer discretionary,” he said."
0,2019-10-01,Shree Cement,"The markets have given a thumbs-up to the recent favourable change in the corporate tax rate. But for a large number of market veterans and savvy investors a key concern still remains. Would it revive demand across sectors which can improve sentiment in markets materially? There is no clear answer to this.

Unfavourable developments — both globally and domestically — have made it difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for the slowdown in demand. After the pace of Chinese consumption slowed down, the US-China tariff war and high crude prices emerged as global worries. This together with lack of visible signs of earnings’ growth closer home complicates the whole strategy of investing in safe and profitable asset classes.

To deal with these factors, it is important to follow the conservative strategy of investing in balanced schemes — the idea of seeking out best bets in both equities and debt markets.

Among balanced schemes, SBI Equity Hybrid is the top performer thanks to its conservative approach. The scheme’s fund managers Dinesh Ahuja and R Srinivasan have constructed a large cap-focused portfolio with safe government bonds and AAA-rated instruments. In the past five-year and ten-year periods, it has given 11 per cent and 12 per cent returns while its peers have given returns of 8.4 per cent and 10.5 per cent in the same period, respectively.

1,2019-10-07,Shree Cement,"ET Intelligence Group: A lower corporate tax is likely to boost India Inc’s bottomline for the September 2019 quarter amid slower topline growth and shrinking operating margin due to sluggish demand.

According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates of the Nifty50 companies, aggregate net sales is expected to increase at a nine-quarter low rate of 5.5 per cent compared with the year-ago quarter. The operating profit is likely to fall by 4.5 per cent.

“We don’t expect any material improvement in Q2FY20 (the second quarter of FY20). Weak consumption demand will impact several sectors including automobiles and consumers. Weak global commodity prices will hurt metals and oil and gas companies,” said Gautam Duggad, institutional research head, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. He believes adjustments owing to deferred tax after the recent changes in corporate tax rates will impact profitability of large corporate banks.

The government’s recent decision to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25.17 per cent including cess and surcharge for FY20 may benefit the net profits of companies in the second quarter. But, gauging its extent is difficult since companies are likely to adjust for the taxes paid at the then prevailing rates during the first quarter of the fiscal. Assuming a flat tax rate of 25 per cent, the sample’s net profit may shoot up by 26.5 per cent year-on-year for the September quarter, which will be the highest in the past nine quarters.

Deepak Jasani, retail research head, HDFC Securities, drew attention to several macro parameters that portray a drab picture for the quarterly earnings season. “Advance and corporate tax collections have grown just 6 per cent till mid-September this fiscal; collections of GST for September were at a 19 month low; sales of automobiles fell for the eleventh consecutive month in September; index of core infrastructure industries fell at a 52-month low of 0.5 per cent in August. In this backdrop, Q2 growth numbers especially on the topline may not be exciting,” he said.

The operating margins of the Nifty50 sample is expected to contract by 170 basis points (bps) to 18 per cent, which will be the lowest since the December 2018 quarter.

“We expect sharp margin contraction year-on-year in autos, metals, technology and oil and gas companies. Cement companies should report strong margin expansion while for those in the consumers and capital goods sectors, operating margins would be flat,” said Duggad.

While demand is expected to remain sluggish in the next two quarters, industry observers believe that a turnaround cannot be ruled out during FY21. Jasani expects a better monsoon, though partly uneven, may result in a bumper Rabi harvest thereby sprucing up rural income. “The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is gradually expected to feed into the real economy and boost demand,” he added.

According to Duggad, the step to recapitalise the public sector banks, improving liquidity and tax cuts augur well for the demand trend. “We expect corporate earnings to pickup in FY21 even as FY20 earnings may remain volatile depending on the treatment of deferred taxes of corporate banks. We continue to prefer private financials, consumers, IT and select industrials,” he said.


SECTORAL TRENDS


AUTOMOBILES
The financial performance of the auto companies is likely to be under pressure owing to volume contraction over the past 12 months. During the September 2019 quarter, it fell by by16-33 per cent across categories. The discount level for passenger cars reached to a record high and accounted for 15-25 per cent of the ex-showroom prices in the quarter. This will weigh on margins.




BANKS
Banks will have to reduce their deferred tax assets in the aftermath of corporate tax cut, which will affect the net profit. The extent will depend upon whether banks mark down these assets in one go or over the remaining quarters of the fiscal. On the business front, loan growth has been lower amid slack demand. Asset quality may once again deteriorate after showing improvement in recent quarters.


CAPITAL GOODS
The continued order momentum from the state government and public sector companies is expected to keep the order books buoyant. L&T, India’s largest infrastructure company, is expected to report 20-35 per cent growth in orders for Q2. It has guided for order inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent for the current fiscal.


CEMENT
Falling demand from infrastructure sector resulted in 6 per cent drop in cement prices sequentially in the September quarter.

Due to the low base effect in the year-ago period, earnings of cement companies may show moderate growth. Large companies are expected to show revenue growth in the range of 8-12 per cent in the September 2019 quarter year-on-year.

Net profits of large-sized companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement and Dalmia Bharat are expected to grow by15-50 per cent, following benign crude oil prices and corporate tax cut.


FMCG
Revenue of the FMCG companies is expected to be affected by slow demand while net profit may show the benefit of corporate tax cut. Rural demand remains under pressure. Management commentaries on the demand outlook would be a key factor to watch out for.


IT
Top information technology (IT) companies are expected to report 1-5 per cent sequential growth in dollar denominated revenue. HCL Tech is expected to report the highest topline growth among peers helped by the additional revenue from the acquired business of select IBM products. Slower traction in the global banking and finance vertical may affect topline growth. Investors would keenly watch Infosys for a possible upward revision in FY20 guidance.


METALS
The earnings growth is likely to be muted due to listless volume growth and 6-15 per cent sequential drop in metal prices. The operating profit before depreciation (Ebitda) for steel companies may fall by ?1,000-1,500 per tonne.


PHARMA
Pharma companies are likely to maintain momentum. Sales growth from the US market is gradually picking up. Corporate tax cut may improve profitability of companies including Dr Reddy’s Labs and Cipla. Management outlook on performance of specialty drugs portfolio, volume growth in Indian pharma market and update on regulatory compliance will be key factors."

India VIX moved up 5.52 per cent to 16.81 level.

Bank Nifty opened positive, extended its gains towards 29,700 level and relatively outperformed the equity benchmark. It formed a Doji candle on the daily scale, as it closed near the opening levels.

5,2019-10-22,Shree Cement,"I would reserve my opinion on Infosys at this level, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How perturbed are you about what is going on with Infosys? Comments have come in from Nandan Nilekani just two minutes back saying that one board member has received two anonymous complains and they are being dealt with in an objective manner. He has categorically said that the complains are largely with regards to the CEO’s international travel to the US as well as Mumbai?Currently, whistleblowers have larger amount of say as far as the market movement is concerned. Leave aside that for a while, I would say that the problem in this situation is that everybody has a right to interpret the way the subject is to be interpreted. I would rather believe that the company has the prerogative to respond to such kind of complaints and should they be in a position to give proper answer to the queries raised in the letter by the whistleblower, that would be the first thing to look at. If they do find something which is objectionable, then it is a matter of concern. 

As of now we would not be able to react purely on the basis of the whistleblower’s complaint and would give a fair chance to the company to respond to that and till such a point of time, would reserve my opinion as far as the view on the Infosys at this level is concerned. 


Coming to banks, we are watching out for Kotak, Axis. What are you expecting this time around?Overall, the earning season has been favourable towards private sector corporate banks. HDFC Bank results suggest that the environment has remained pretty cool for them. Maybe these banks have taken larger amount of share from the public sector banks and that is where you are likely to see credit growth at higher level. 

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, you may see around 5%, 5.5% kind of a growth for companies like Kotak in this quarter or maybe in Axis too. You should be seeing relatively higher amount of growth of around 4% to 5% on a sequential basis. Overall, the environment remains stable for good quality banks. They fully provided for their NPAs in last quarter and so are unlikely to show major surprises in the current quarter say. It should be a stable to good quarter for many of these banks.


Is it time to revisit PSUs? If yes, which one?On one side, the PSUs have the fantastic ability to reward the investors largely because of the changes in the tax structure and the resultant amount available to companies which they could possibly distribute. No doubt, that should be seen as positive for PSUs. On the other side, the government is trying to sell off some of the PSUs and get out of the businesses. 

There will be uncertainty till the time they sell it off. How exactly it works out for the companies would be a guesswork. One can probably leave it till that point of time the transaction happens. But more importantly, the PSUs continue to remain with the government and if they are not coming off at the cutting edge, as far as the performance is concerned, they are a disappointment. 

To me the best part is that the government should probably start putting in a very stable management in PSUs, particularly in the PSBs where the lender is required is know the borrower for a longer period of time. You should keep that particular continuity in mind while placing your new management into these banks. 

Consolidating PSBs to a larger bank is a good thing but at the same time, I would expect the continuity of management and allowing them to operate with a little bit of free hand under the policy framework, will probably pay better dividend to investors. 

But continuously changing the management and restructuring the companies probably may not help investors. I would rather think that they have good potential but maybe we require a very stable management to run these businesses. 


 I do not know if you got the chance to look at how Shree Cement performed because if you look at all parameters, they have delivered and the numbers are a big beat?Yes definitely. The numbers in the cement as well as in the power division have come reasonably stable and there’s a good amount of optimism that going forward in subsequent quarters, when the construction activity starts reviving, we should be seeing relatively better numbers than what we have seen in the second quarter of the financial year. 

Certainly there is a reason to remain relatively more confident and optimistic about many of the cement companies. The better ones would include Shree Cement and the south-based Ramco Cement. One would consider investing into these companies going forward."
7,2019-10-23,Shree Cement,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Wednesday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 10.50 points higher this morning, signalling a tepid start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Reliance Securities has upgraded recommendation on the 
Shree Cement stock to buy from hold with a target price of Rs 20,900. Shree Cement has been moving in the right direction in its pursuit to dominate the markets by adding capacity at regular intervals, which will aid the company in growing its market share with strong profitability without much stress on balance sheet, according to brokerage. Hence, its premium multiple is expected to sustain, going forward which can be supported by thin liquidity and meagre non institutional holdings, it added. The stock gained 4.5 per cent to Rs 19,501 on Tuesday.

• Centrum Broking has retained its buy rating on 
Mastek with a target price of Rs 535 citing well navigated on the cost front despite the huge challenges. EPS estimates are trimmed modestly by 2.5/4per cent for FY20/FY21E. Mastek has 11.2 per cent stake in Majesco USA which it plans to monetize and hence, strong balance sheet and cheap valuations offer favourable risk return, said the brokerage.The stock rose 1.52 per cent to Rs 347 on Tuesday.


• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on 
L&T Technology Services and revised target price to Rs 1801 from Rs 1821 earlier. While outlook on revenue growth in the ER&D space remains marred by uncertainty, demand in the ER&D segment has potential to revive strongly, post which the company should be in pole position to realise its growth potential, said Edelweiss. The stock ended down 10.4per cent at Rs 1472.60 on Tuesday.

• Nomura has a neutral rating on 
AU Small Finance Bank with a target price of Rs 590. The bank's second quarter core operating profit was over 15per cent ahead of expectation with 30 basis points sequential improvement in spreads, AUM growth of 38per cent year-on-year, lower opex growth of 21per cent year-on-year and stable asset quality. Growth pressure in the vehicle book should continue, given continued weakness OEM volumes, said Nomura. The stock ended up 5.2per cent at Rs 688.40 on Tuesday.

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on 
UltraTech Cement and has raised target price to Rs 5500 from Rs 5400. Ultra-Tech’s second quarter results, while complex to analyse due to the Century Textiles (Century) merger, was ahead of estimates led by better realisations and costs, driving 29per cent Ebitda growth, said CLSA. Management targets to bring debt-to-Ebitda below 2 times by March 2020 which should happen, and it is looking to monetise non-core assets, the brokerage said. The stock ended down 1per cent at Rs 4250.30"
0,2019-11-04,Shree Cement,"Investors looking to build a mutual fund portfolio without a fund manager bias could consider index funds. Growing worries about the ability of fund managers to generate outperformance are prompting investors to increasingly consider passively-managed funds, such as index- and exchange-traded products. Such concerns are higher in large-cap funds. 

A big advantage of index funds is their lower costs. Investors can save anywhere between 0.5% and 1.5% every year in an index fund compared to an actively-managed fund. The cost savings are significant over a long period of investment. 

Index funds track broad-based indices thus reducing the impact of the decline in value of any one stock or industry or sector. Many prefer index funds over ETFs to avoid the hassles of maintaining a demat account and poor liquidity. 

Index funds replicate the indices, with marginal tracking error. Since there is no active fund management involved, costs are low and are passed on to the investor in the form of lower expense ratio. Here are some index funds that wealth advisors have been recommending to clients:


ICICI Prudential Nifty Index Fund

Expense Ratio: 0.10%Assets Under Management: Rs 436 croreTop 5 holdings: HDFC Bank, Reliance, HDFC, Infosys, ICICI Bank1 year/3 year return (%): 15.82/12.83
Many financial planners recommend a plain vanilla Nifty fund for first-time investors. The Nifty 50 is made up of the top 50 stocks in the Indian market, filtered by their free float market capitalisation, liquidity and other parameters. The Nifty has a high 39.39% exposure to financials. It works well for investors wanting market exposure at relatively cheaper cost and looking to eliminate fund manager bias. Investors with a time horizon of five years and above can use the SIP route for exposure to this fund. The fund scores by the virtue of having the lowest expense ratio in the Nifty 50 universe of funds. 

Motilal Oswal Nifty Midcap 150 Index FundExpense ratio: 0.38%Assets under management: Rs 18 croreTop 5 holdings: Federal Bank, City Union Bank, Voltas, Info Edge, RBL Bank1 year/3 year returns (%): NA
A recently launched index fund in the mid cap space, it does not have a track record of performance. Fund houses have hesitated to launch mid cap index funds due to poor liquidity. With many mid cap funds, underperforming in the last couple of years, analysts believe this could be worth a try for investors who want an exposure to mid cap funds in their portfolio but do not believe in fund manager skills for the alpha generation. 


Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 FOF

Expense ratio: 0.10
%

Assets under management: Rs 8
8 crore

Top 5 holdings: Micro Soft corp, Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet C Class

1 year/3 year returns (%): 11.37/20.07
A fund meant for high-risk takers, the portfolio primarily consists of top US-based technology giants listed on the NASDAQ. Financial planners believe an investment in such a fund makes sense as it is difficult to replicate these set of companies in India.


UTI Nifty Next 50

Expense ratio: 0.27
%

Assets under management: Rs 487
 crore

Top 5 holdings: SBI Life, HDFC Life, Godrej Consumer, Dabur, Shree Cement 

1 year/3 year returns (%): 8.4/NA 
Analysts believe the Nifty Next 50 is a well diversified portfolio of 50 companies with better sector diversification as compared to the Nifty 50. Four listed insurance companies find a place in this index. The top 10 stocks of Nifty Next 50 comprise 59.67% of the Nifty 50 portfolio. Analysts believe this is a must have in the portfolio due to higher diversification, lesser cyclical stocks compared to other large-cap indices. This increases the prospects of more consistent returns despite periods of market volatility. Without excessive weight to banks, the portfolio has more diversified holding."
1,2019-11-19,Shree Cement,"I would bet that metal -- ferrous as well as non-ferrous -- would see a better price regime hereafter, but cement as a commodity would be doing even better than metal, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


How closely are you tracking the telecom story? Are they investment worthy just yet?Definitely. The hike in could mean a little bit of a breather, coupled with the government considering some kind of moratorium for payment of AGR dues. Some kind of a lifeline would be available to the incumbent telecom companies. This is where you might see some amount of market interest getting revived in these companies. 

However, the fundamental point of view remains whether these companies would be in a position to attract new money into the books and probably expand infrastructure which is required. At the same time, they would be in a position to offload some of the infrastructure assets that they have been carrying in their books into separate companies or InvITs and probably release that bandwidth of money for reaching the last mile as far as the connectivity to the consumer is concerned. All these issues would remain interesting to watch out for. In my view point, it is not a simple proposition though I do agree that concessions on AGR dues as well as this hike would mean some amount of breathing space for these stocks and probably the market would also see a little upside in these stocks.


What is your take on Tata Steel?I can see the company has a complete control over the cost management part of the business. Wherever assets are not producing enough bottom line performance, they are unlocking those assets and getting out of the business. That is a corrective strategy which is leading to a better cost structure. Should we see a larger trade treaty between India and the US, we would have a greater stability in various commodity prices globally. I would bet that metal -- ferrous as well as non-ferrous -- would see a better price regime hereafter. 

In such situations, most of the Indian companies should also benefit because India is in the capex mode and various infrastructure projects are underway. The demand scenario is not doubted in the country. So there is demand and price stability. When commodity companies have lower input cost in form of crude oil on power related cost, it is a win-win combination for this cyclical industry. Maybe you should see relative stability into the commodity and stock prices here after.

Tata Steel has a complete control over the cost management part of the business. Wherever assets are not producing enough bottom line performance, they are unlocking those assets and getting out of the business.-Deve Choksey


We have been seeing an up move on some of the cement stocks. Buy calls are coming from those who believe the cyclical upturn will unlock a lot of opportunity in some of the cement names. Are you looking at cement stocks?We probably have a conviction that cement as a commodity would be far better than metal commodity proposition. It would have a relatively higher amount of demand scenario. The thrust is on infrastructure and at the same time, efforts are being made to revive the construction industry. From that perspective, cement would see better times going forward. 

Fortunately, the price regime is quite stable as far as the cement outlook goes and that is once again positive. The input costs are also remaining positive. We like some of the regional plays. The companies which have larger capacity operating from a good region like Ramco Cement, is where we preferred these kind of companies. 

Even the UltraTech kind of a pan India companies also remain quite a strong play going forward as also Shree Cement. Selectively we like companies with a larger capacity where they get the advantage of this kind of a better demand scenario and better price outlook. So, cement is certainly a commodity play. 


RBL Bank is a stock where the street is divided. Is the worst behind it or are a lot of skeletons still left in the cupboard?I would like to believe that the worst is behind but honestly would not be fully comfortable till the time I see some validation of these assumptions. The bank probably has the ability to come out of this particular situation but this particular situation should be seen for at least one more quarter after which if they give no negative surprises. After that, probably I would like to confirm that the worst is behind them."

3,2019-11-27,Shree Cement,"Who does not want big compounders in an equity portfolio? There are 14 multibaggers on Dalal Street that reported over 100 per cent rise in September quarter profit along with an increase in top line. And many analysts look positive on them. Good case to take a serious look at these names?

With a 37,834 per cent leap in 10 years, Avanti Feeds emerged top gainer on the list. The scrip jumped to Rs 528.60 on November 22 from just Rs 1.40 on November 23, 2009. The company, engaged in shrimp processing and manufacturing of prawn and fish feeds, reported a 155 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit in Q2FY20 on over 41 per cent rise in net sales.

But the stock trades at a price 47 per cent below its all-time high of Rs 1,000.

In Q2FY20, average shrimp prices (Mexican Shrimp-30 count) in the international markets reached $13.1 a kg (up 10% YoY), which resulted in a spike in domestic farm gate prices to Rs 430-450 a kg, benefitting the sector, Edelweiss Professional Investor Research said in a report.

“We have revised our earnings estimates for the company upward by 12 per cent for FY20E and 13.5 per cent for FY21E,” Edelweiss said about Avanti Feeds in a October note.

Fairchem Speciality (up 5,073 per cent), Alkyl Amines Chemicals (up 3005 per cent) and Deepak Nitrite (up 2,713 per cent) are other similar cases on top of the list.

Fairchem posted an 837 per cent YoY rise in September quarter net profit, while Deepak Nitrite grew its bottom line 532 per cent and Alkyl Amines 106 per cent. These companies also posted 50-150 per cent increase in net sales for the quarter.

Equentis is positive on Deepak Nitrite (DNL) with a 15-18 month price target of Rs 431-462.



“DNL is favourably positioned to capture opportunities emerging across the chemicals and specialty chemicals landscape. We expect 16 per cent CAGR revenue growth and 27 per cent CAGR PAT growth over FY19-24E. We assign a ‘Buy’ rating to the stock. Going ahead, we expect DNL to benefit strongly from the healthy outlook for the India chemicals industry, which is growing at 8-10 per cent annually,” the brokerage said.

Other players on the list came from trading, rubber and plastic products, consumer foods, breweries and distilleries, real estate, pharma, cement and agriculture sectors, among others.

Black Rose Industries, which posted 113 per cent YoY rise in net profit in Q2, rose from Rs 2.10 in 2009 to Rs 81 as of November 22, 2019. Cupid, Kingfa Science & Technologies, DFM Foods, Shervani Industrial Syndicate, Associated Alcohols, Suven Life Sciences and Venky’s India gained 1,000-2,700 per cent in last 10 years.

Kolkata-based investors Soumya Malani and Arun Mukherjee in a recent note said Kingfa is set to report highest annual sales and profits since inception this financial year.
“Anything that can do so well under such slowdown only showcases what it can do when the sentiments changes for good. We remain positive on the future prospect of the company,” they wrote.

Among the established names, shares of Indraprastha Gas jumped 1,125 per cent and those of Shree Cement 1,088 per cent since November 23, 2009.

Shares of Venky’s India, Shervani Industrial Syndicate, Cupid, Kingfa Science, Associated Alcohol are still down over 50 per cent from their respective all-time highs, while Alkyl Amines is short of its record high by 5 per cent, IGL and Suven Life Sciences by 8 per cent each.

KR Choksey Shares and Securities earlier this month gave a ‘buy’ recommendation on Indraprastha Gas (IGL) with a price target of Rs 498.

“We continue to be positive on the long-term performance of the stock, with IGL being a strong player in city gas distribution (CGD) segment. Rising environmental concerns in NCR region will likely lead to encouraging conversions of automobiles creating higher demand,” the brokerage said.

0,2019-12-16,Shree Cement,"With benchmark indices trading at all-time highs with lofty valuations, fund managers believe there are a couple of ways to pick good stocks. One is to follow the value investing principle. The other one is to buy shares of companies where there are signs of an operational recovery. These factors have played an important role in fund managers’ stock picking in November, when lump sum flows into the industry slowed while SIPs remained robust. Here are some stocks bought by leading asset managers:


Shree Cement
CMP: Rs 20,373
Market-Cap: Rs 73,507 crore
Bought by: Aditya Birla SL MF

Among the top five players by capacity, Shree Cement has consistently shown its distinctness in its operations through timely expansion and cost control. A combined impact of these two factors has helped the company record highest Earnings before Interest Depreciation Tax and Amortisation (EBITDA) on selling a tonne of cement even in the second quarter— which is seasonally not so favourable in terms of business. It recorded EBITDA per tonne of Rs 1,452. Besides, the company also recorded growth of over 10% in volumes in the September quarter when volumes of most large players fell. Also, its realisations improved by 9% on year-on-year comparison in the September quarter. Most importantly, the company announced its plans to raise Rs 2,000 crore through the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) route. The proceeds will be invested in expanding its capacity which presently stands at 38 MT.


Maruti Suzuki
CMP: Rs 7,221
Market-Cap: Rs 218,413 crore
Bought by: HDFC MF

A key investment argument which has attracted the street’s interest in the stock of India’s largest car manufacturer is: the company’s worst phase of business cycle is over. Besides this, there are signs of recovery as the company recorded a 1% growth in its sales between October and November. The company also pruned its inventory levels which again helped in saving costs. In addition to this, the company raised its production by 4% in November after a gap of nine months which has been received favourably by analysts and managers. Also, Maruti has reduced aggression in giving out discounts as seen in October this year. This augurs well for the company’s thirdquarter sales of the present fiscal. Expectations of a IT rate cut may also trigger further interest in the stock. New launches, rural exposure, steady market share, strong franchise and a shift towards petrol are a few factors why managers have enhanced exposure in the stock.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL)
CMP: Rs 2,005
Market-Cap: Rs 434,109 crore
Bought by: ICICI Prudential MF

Two aspects of HUL’s operations give confidence to analysts and money managers. One, the company has a diverse portfolio of close to fifteen categories. And in these categories, the company has dominant market shares. Second, focusing on premium products in these categories, the company has been able to expand its margins even in times of a slowdown. This has been promptly recognised by savvy fund managers. Besides this, the company’s wide distribution presence of eight million outlets and high return on equity of over 80% serve as solid arguments justifying the attractiveness of the company’s stock. Analysts have raised their earnings’ estimates for the company. Between FY19 and FY22, they foresee the company’s earnings per share (EPS) grow in the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) range of 18-21%.


Bajaj Finance
CMP: Rs 4,070
Market-Cap: Rs 244, 927 crore
Bought by: IDFC MF

A favourite of many fund managers, the company has been one of the biggest gainers in the NBFC crisis as it continues to gain market share and weaker NBFCs continue to disappear. This 31-year old company has 944 urban, 951 rural and over 97,000+ distribution outlets, an unmatched network. With more than 50 product lines spread across consumer financing, SME financing, commercial, rural and mortgage lending. Analysts expect the company to maintain its growth trajectory, with deepening geographical penetration and increasing repeat business.


Sun Pharma
CMP: Rs 439
Market-Cap: Rs 105,244 crore
Bought by: HDFC Mutual Fund

A value pick on the list of many fund managers who believe the worst is over for the company, that ranks No. 1 in India and has a 9.2% market share. The company reported a consolidated profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore for the September quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates. With product development across geographies is more or less uniform, the management continues to focus on cost saving exercise for the generic business in response to the changing industry dynamics that is likely to improve margins. It may also look at developing specific products for China and Japan in the near future. The big challenge is its investment of $1.5 billion in US specialty, for which the breakeven would take long as the company has already lined up more investments."
2,2019-12-18,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: Ever wondered which stocks on Dalal Street managed to be the equivalents of cricketing stars like Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Mr Consistent Virat Kohli in Calendar 2019? 

Reliance Industries, of course, turned out to be the biggest wealth creator, Indiabulls Ventures the fastest and IndusInd Bank the most consistent. And that, not just in 2019, but for the past five years.

These were the findings of the annual wealth creation study published by Motilal Oswal Securities. Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director, has been publishing this study every year for past two decades.

Just like run-machine Kohli’s form has made him the face of Indian cricket, Reliance Industries has become the face of a Rising India, by turning out the biggest wealth creator on Dalal Street. The oil-to-telecom behemoth added whopping Rs 5.6 lakh crore to investor wealth, the highest ever, in last five years. 

A 78 per cent surge annually over the five years has earned the Indiabulls Ventures stock the fastest wealth creator tag, something that can be the market equivalent of India’s topmost one-day cricket bowler Jasprit Bumrah.

IndusInd Bank emerged the most consistent, appearing among the top 100 Wealth Creators in each of the last 10 Motilal Oswal wealth studies. It also recorded the highest price growth CAGR of 49 per cent between 2009 to 2019, ahead of Pidilite Industries’ 40 per cent rise. 



Overall, Dalal Street’s top 100 wealth creators delivered Rs 49 lakh crore to investors between 2014 and 2019 at a pace of 22 per cent compounded annually. It was double the 12 per cent growth rate that Sensex stocks clocked during this period, the study revealed.

Among the biggest wealth creators, Reliance Industries was followed by HDFC Bank, which added Rs 4.08 lakh crore to investor wealth. TCS (Rs 3.65 lakh crore), Hindustan Unilever (Rs 2.39 lakh crore) and HDFC (Rs 1.80 lakh crore) emerged the other big wealth creators of last five years.

Bajaj Finance (78 per cent jump CAGR), Bombay Burmah (68 per cent), Aarti Industries (67 per cent), Sundaram Fasteners (55 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (55 per cent) made up the list of other fastest wealth creators. 

Meanwhile, other than IndusInd Bank and Pidilite Industries, Titan (up 40 per cent in 10 years), Shree Cement (39 per cent in 10 years), Asian Paints (34 per cent) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (34 per cent) made it to the list of consistent performers in the Motilal Top 100 list of stocks. 

Five years was the longest run as biggest wealth creator for RIL from 2007 to 2011 and for TCS from 2013 to 2017."

3,2019-12-19,Shree Cement,"The tension between the US and China is a trend that is here to stay. Also, the demographic shifts are going to be difficult for countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Korea and positive for a country like India. Over a period of time, we have to go with the demographic story; in a shorter period of time, go with the political story, says Teresa C Barger, Co-Founder, Cartica Capital. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Global commentators like Ray Dalio, Howard Marks are surprised with the strength of the US economy and the markets. Do you think the party is here to stay?I do not think it is here to stay partly because in the US, profit margins have been growing largely because of a lack of regulatory enforcement and because of pricing power from companies that are very large and maybe oligopolistic. Also, we have had the lion’s share of EPS growth coming from share buyback. This does not seem sustainable to be me. That is not to say that we are going to have a crash in the economy but from the stock market point of view, it is unsustainable to have a market that is driven by share buybacks and oligopoly profits.


Just like the trade war dominated the better part of headlines of 2019, is 2020 going to be all about the US presidential election? What is the chance of Trump getting re-elected?I certainly hope not because he is a very boring kind of tug of war to watch with very little resolution, lots of noise for a very long time. But there is no clarity until we get close to October-November. We might not even have clarity then. I hope it is not but I do think that it may be about a more benign global growth picture. It also may be about a more benign dollar from the point of view of international investors and we see the dollar either staying the same or getting weaker over 2020, which should be positive for investors in overseas markets. 

This might also be a year where we see a few things getting more steady like the oil market. That is very positive for India.


You look at investors, you look at companies with good return ratios, you buy them and you even hold them. Some of the stocks which you owned in the past like Eicher Motors, Cholamandal, Berger Paints are terribly expensive. How are you investing in this market where what you like is expensive and what is cheap, you do not like?India is in a very difficult state right now with PEs at 18.5 times --basically almost EPS growth -- and it is really hard to buy that. On the other hand, there are many companies that have been left behind and 2019 has been the year of dumb money, where you have had a pretty good run in the Sensex but only with a few stocks. The smart investors, who are the local asset managers, mutual funds, have been more or less on the sidelines. Having been marginal investors in past years, in 2020, we might see a change in some smart money coming back into India. Otherwise, it is a little hard to buy fresh companies now when you do not see EPS growth in front of you.


Are you looking at increasing or maintaining your exposure to RBL Bank or Eicher Motor or Chola or Shree for the next couple of years?We love India for the very long term. We love the big themes that India has, that no one else has -- lots of growth, millennialisation, formalisation and premiumisation -- all great things. But for 2020, we see it in a cyclical and not a structural downturn, exacerbated by the noise that has come from the reforms. So, it is a country we will probably lighten up on and certainly not go heavier on.


What do you make of the slowdown in Indian companies? Is that cyclical or structural in nature? Are we looking at reboot in Indian growth at the consumer and corporate level. What is the view on the big picture?We see it as a cyclical slowdown. We have all had urban and rural issues. It is very unusual to find food prices going up and that not translating into profits for farmers. However, it looks like the newest numbers that had come out from April to November, might have seen a rise in the profits for farmers. Maybe, we will see that turning but we do not see any positives on the urban side.

Right now, there’s not much to see at the rural side though there maybe some brightness on the horizon. But there is no such thing for the urban side. We would love to see real economic reforms take place in the second Modi administration. Obviously we are not in India. So socio-political activities like Kashmir, immigration law do not get the core of the Indian issue which is creating more jobs for the people entering the workforce in India. 

It does not give us any joy. Real economic reforms absolutely would and I am not seeing that on the horizon. I am not seeing any green shoots on capital expenditure on the horizon. 


Telecom is a very contentious sector. You like to buy big consumer businesses in India which is not in a downtrend but the overall environment is one of the downtrend. Would you be interested in looking at the telecom sector? Yes, right now, it is quite a difficult time and a time of regulatory change. I would rather invest in companies which are beneficiaries from the fall in the price of the data coming over to cheaper cellphones. This probably would go with the new economy rather than investing in the telecom companies themselves. Those who are closer to the regulatory situation might be able to make investments there.


You have bought Eicher, Chola, Shree Cement in the past. You also have a deep understanding of private banks like RBL. Given what is happening to interest rate, disclosure norms and how some of the banks have conducted themselves, is the current decline an opportunity to revisit the old favourites?It is true that the market got spooked first by IL&FS which created a liquidity crisis and then created a credit crisis, particularly for the likes of YES Bank. We had some very specific incidents that made people question what the whole book might look like for other banks. We have great faith in RBL Bank and they have been unfairly tarred with the same brush. YES Bank is an inferior bank and has always been in terms of its credit quality and the quality of its management team. There are some opportunities to buy in the financial sector. These are very sound management and there’s a lot of runway for growth. 


Globally, the sale of beauty products has come down. 18 months ago, the signals were about glamour and about selfies and looking perfect. Now the conversation is about toxicity of images and that has affected the global beauty markets.-Teresa C Barger
Once liquidity came, the credit situation also calmed down. One can find pockets here but we need the government and the RBI to take very seriously the unclogging of the transmission mechanism to get credit flowing again to Indian companies and particularly to SMEs. That is a plea from Cartica Cap to the Government of India.


Capital reversion is the biggest prism of stock market in some of the stocks which you own. Shree Cement, Chola, Berger have given you fantastic returns for the last couple of years. Do you think in the coming decade also this kind of return should be expected or anticipated?I do not think that in our era, that is ever going to be true. There is a very small subset of stocks that are true compounders. One of the ways to go astray as an investor is to call a company a compounder that is not truly a compounder. They are very rare animals, they are lovely animals when you can find them. But there is so much going on, so much upheaval in the economy and so much creative destruction, that you always have to look at what is new in the economy and how consumption patterns are changing. They can change enormously quickly.

 Actually, I would like to give you a little example of that in the last 18 months over the whole globe. The sale of beauty products has come down. and it is a global phenomena. Look at the signals among consumers. 18 months ago, the signals were about glamour and about selfies and looking perfect. Now the conversation is about toxicity of images and has completely changed and affected the global beauty markets. It is so fascinating. 

We as investors have to be very much on top of what is going on with from Gen Z, all the way to people who are in hospice care. It is a very different and it is a different market every day.


Let us talk about something that perhaps the old timers are focussed on -- the big trends. 1980s was dominated by Japan, then came the TMT boom and bust. China took over the first 10 years of this decade and the last 10 years has been all about America and the birth of behemoths like Amazon, Google and even Netflix. What could be called a multi-year theme for this decade, ?I cannot be in the business of predicting what is coming in the next decade. The only thing I can predict is change. But using a little shorter timeframe, we have to look at the tension between the US and China as being a trend that is here to stay and we are going to have to look at demographic shifts that are going to be difficult for countries like China, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Korea and more positive for a country like India. Over a period of time, we really have to go with the demographic story; in a shorter period of time, go with the political story.


There is a list of stocks which you have owned for a long time and we have talked about them. In terms of the theme, will there be a core change at all for the India portfolio?It is already changing. The new economy theme is much bigger for us. That would include the adoption of new economy techniques in existing companies as well."
5,2019-12-20,Shree Cement,"Mumbai: Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained its cautious stance on the cement sector with ‘sell’ rating on Ultra-Tech and Shree Cement, and ‘reduce’ rating on ACC and Ambuja Cements.


Here is why Kotak is wary about the sector’s prospects: 


Cement Price Decline: Kotak said cement prices continued to slide in December 2019 in the absence of demand recovery. “All India cement prices are down Rs 6/bag or 2 per cent month on month in December, notwithstanding any of the price hike attempts,” the brokerage said in a note.


Low Demand: Kotak said cement demand was down 1 per cent from January to October. “We do not see signs of demand recovery in 2HFY20E against market expectations of 5-6 per cent growth,” the brokerage said. The demand pickup in November was temporary with volume pressure returning in December, it said. “Intense winters, delays in various government projects and tight liquidity in the markets is restricting demand growth,” it said.

Pressure on Margins: The brokerage said margins of cement companies are unlikely to recover in the third quarter of FY20 as price correction will offset cost deflation. “With weak fundamentals, earnings will continue to remain volatile, driven by pricing discipline and the sector is unlikely to witness sustainable margin improvement,” said Kotak.


Expensive Share Valuations: Kotak’s cautious stance on the sector is also because of expensive valuations. The brokerage said large-cap cement companies like UltraTech and Shree Cement are trading at 12-15 times their EV/Ebitda (enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortisation) based on FY20-21 estimates. EV/Ebitda estimates the number of years in which the business will repay its acquisition cost to the buyer through its earnings."
4,2019-12-20,Shree Cement,"Mumbai: Brokerages see high probability of moderate returns for the Indian equity market in 2020 amid stretched valuations, likelihood of economic slowdown continuing and limited room for fiscal stimulus by the government. BNP Paribas has an ‘overweight’ stance on the Sensex and expects the benchmark to reach 44,500 in 2020. Maybank Kim Eng is ‘neutral’ on the Indian stock market in 2020 with a base case Nifty target of 11,600. ICICI Securities has a December 2020 target of 13,100, saying that the sharp run-up in the market since August has reduced return expectations for 2020.



BNP Paribas

The firm has an overweight stance on Sensex and expects it to reach 44,500 in 2020. BNP expects further cuts in India’s GDP growth estimates as the consensus estimates do not seem to reflect the recent deceleration fully. The room for the government to do fiscal stimulus through increased spending or further tax cuts seems limited due to stretched fiscal position, said BNP Paribas. Private investments are unlikely to pick up anytime soon and asset quality pressure on financials does not appear to be behind yet, said BNP. The brokerage is overweight on India despite macro-economic headwinds because Indian equities are one of the rare compounders in Asian markets. Ease of stock selection and availability of diverse range of sectors to invest remain bright spots, said BNP.

Investment picks: Private banks, insurance, frontline IT companies and investing in undervalued rebounders.


Maybank Kim Eng Securities

The brokerage has neutral view on India for 2020 with base case Nifty target of 11,600. While macro outlook on India is clouded, the brokerage is bullish on private banks, telecom companies, cement, power and gas utilities, software and tractors. A more broad- based participation of stocks and sector rotation is a more likely trend in 2020, said Maybank Kim Eng. The brokerage’s bull case target for Nifty is 13,400 and bear case is 9,900. The government’s bold actions in the Budget in February 2020 may bring positive catalysts such as fiscal expansion to carry out capex and cut in personal income tax/GST, said Maybank.

Investment picks: ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel, Power Grid, UltraTech, Mahanagar Gas, Dalmia Bharat, Mahindra, HCL Tech, Mphasis and Tech Mahindra. Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors are top sell recommendations.


ICICI Securities

The brokerage has a Nifty target of 13,100 by December 2020. Absolute returns for the Nifty in 2020 will be constrained by the sharp run-up in stocks during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2019 which has stretched valuations, said ICICI. Skepticism towards risk assets could continue in 2020 as global central banks’ appetite for gold continues especially in an environment of negative rates in developed economies, said ICICI Securities. The brokerage has an overweight stance on financials, consumer discretionary and industrials.

Investment Picks: Bandhan Bank, IndusInd Bank, Cholamandalam Finance, LIC Housing, HDFC Life, SBI Life, Jubilant Food-Works, Westlife, Trent, Greenply Industries, Dabur, Balkrishna Industries, TVS Motor, L&T, Engineers India, Bharti Airtel, GGL, GSPL, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Tata steel, UltraTech, and Shree Cement.


Credit Suisse

The financial services company expects India’s economic slowdown to continue in 2020. Credit Suisse expects narrow market performance to continue for now as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the ‘safe’ stocks. “Till growth uncertainty continues (we expect for another six months), we expect this “quality bubble” to stay inflated and market concentration to remain high,” said Credit Suisse. Equity flows have settled at higher-than-historical average levels and foreign flows should continue to support the market, it said.

Investment picks: SBI, ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life among financials, Bharti Airtel in telecom, Power Grid among utilities and Tata Steel among metals. The brokerage has a minor overweight on pharma and IT."
6,2019-12-21,Shree Cement,"ET Intelligence Group: Sustainable and socially responsible investment is gradually moving into the mainstream, thanks to increasing awareness among companies. The rising clout of fund managers who focus on sustainable investment based on environment, social responsibility and governance (ESG) parameters have acted as a trigger for such investments.

A case in point is a fund manager at one of the largest ESG funds in India who included Hindustan Unilever in his portfolio after learning that it had started producing detergent bars that require less water while rinsing clothes, amid reports of a water crisis in Chennai. ESG-based investing is still in its infancy in India, with just two ESG funds having cumulative assets under management worth under $ 500 million, compared with the global ESG fund size of $30.7 trillion.

The performance of certain stocks show that investors, too, are conscious of their ESG responsibilities. For instance, Coal India has underperformed the benchmark index for the last five years despite growing coal volume and consistent dividend payments.

Consumption stocks are not an exception either. “The widening valuation gap between Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC shows that the former is rewarded for efforts to reduce the carbon footprint,” said a domestic fund manager. After trading at similar valuations five years ago, HUL now commands a 40% premium over ITC.

“Investors interest in companies related to fossil fuels is bound to wane in the long term considering the risk to company valuations,” said Abhay Laijwala, an ESG fund manager at Avendus India.

The risk of funds moving towards cleaner fuels from carbon-intensive fuels may affect the performance of Indian equities, as the weight of energy stocks is over 12% in the benchmark indices.

Also, the company with the largest market capitalisation, Reliance Industries (RIL), has fossil fuel exposure. It has been consistently working on sustainability measures. It has a zero water discharge refinery and uses only desalinated sea water. RIL also has a facility to convert PET water bottles to polyester thread. In FY19, RIL recycled about 2 billion PET bottles.

Similarly, India's largest power producer NTPC has put up its first ultra-supercritical unit in Madhya Pradesh which will consume less coal, thereby lowering emissions.

Investors should, however, not shun fossil fuel and thermal power producers as they are a pivotal part of the existing ecosystem, said Chirag Mehta, the ESG fund manager of Quantum AMC. “The key thing to watch for these companies is their vision and delivery to reduce carbon footprint. If they show intent to cut it, there is no harm in holding them,” he said. Indian cement companies are more efficient than global peers. Shree Cement, for instance, uses only 72 litres of water to produce a tonne of cement, compared with the global average of 300 litres per tonne.

Companies including Mahindra & Mahindra, Havells India, Bharti Infratel, and Ashok Leyland have set up captive solar power projects to reduce carbon footprint. Given the rising awareness about sustainable growth, India Inc is well poised to meet the challenges of a cleaner environment."

8,2019-12-23,Shree Cement,"NEW DELHI: The Power Ministry has scrapped the auction to procure 2,500 MW electricity for medium term (three years) under a scheme to provide relief to thermal power plants plagued by short coal supplies, state-run NHPC said on Monday. According to sources, lack of interest from state power utilities due to a higher tariff of Rs 4.41 per unit discovered through the reverse auction process led to the cancellation of the auction. 

 The power ministry now has advised nodal agency Power Finance Corporation-arm PFC Consultancy Ltd (PFCCL) to call the bids again. 

 ""PFCCL appointed NHPC as ""Aggregator"" (in March this year) under Pilot Scheme-II for procurement of aggregated power of 2500 MW. Now, present bidding process under the scheme has been annulled by Ministry of Power (MoP), Government of India. Further, MoP advised PFCCL (Nodal Agency) to undertake re-bidding process,"" NHPC said. 

 Under the scheme, the NHPC as an aggregator was in the process to finalise supply of 2,500 megawatt (MW) through various coal-based thermal power plants for medium term at a tariff of Rs 4.41 per unit discovered in a reverse auction. 

 One of the main objectives of the scheme is to provide coal linkage to the functional power plants that are starving for fuel in the absence of coal linkages. A long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with a discom is a prerequisite for getting a coal linkage. 

 Under the auction, all the bidders were supposed to match the lowest quote, which in this case was discovered as Rs 4.41 per unit. 

 Some southern states discoms had evinced interest for procuring power at Rs 4.41 per unit the scheme. But aggregated power supply of 2,500MW under the auction could not be tied up with discoms. 

 A source in the know of the development said, ""State utilities did not come forth as the tariff of Rs 4.41 per unit was slightly on the higher side. Under the Pilot Scheme-I, the tariff discovered through reverse auction was Rs 4.24 per unit."" 

 The PFCCL had appointed the NHPC as an aggregator under Pilot Scheme-II notified by the ministry in March this year. 

 The scheme was notified by the ministry in January this year for procuring 2500 MW for three years (covered under Medium term) through the PFCCL. 

 The scheme was to involve transaction of electricity of around 18,615 MUs (million units) at 85 per cent PLF (plant load factor or capacity utilisation) of 2,500 MW and turnover of more than Rs 7,000 crores on yearly basis. 

 The NHPC had to get trading margin from discoms under the scheme for providing services as an aggregator between generator and buyer/utilities (discoms) as trader. 

 Under the auction for Pilot Scheme-II, Jindal Power has been allowed the highest supply of 315 MW, followed by Korba West Power Company (295 MW), JSW Energy (290 MW), Essar Power M P Ltd (200 MW), Jindal Power (200 MW), DB Power (165 MW) and MB Power Madhya Pradesh (125 MW). 

Jaypee Bina got 100 MW, followed by Jaypee Nigrie Super (100 MW), TRN Energy (100 MW), SKS Power Generation Chhattisgarh (100 MW), RKM Powergen (165 MW), Sembcorp Gayatri Power (150 MW), Jindal India Thermal Power (115 MW) and Shree Cement (80 MW). 

 Under Pilot Scheme-I, in October 2018, PTC India as an aggregator had finalised the supply of 1,900 MW capacity under the first such scheme at a tariff of Rs 4.24 per unit and power purchase agreements were signed on October 29, 2019. 

 Under the Scheme-I, the successful bidders were RKM Powergen (550 MW), Jhabua Power Ltd (100 MW), MB Power Ltd (175 MW), SKS Power (300 MW), Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd (125 MW), IL&FS Energy (550 MW) and JP Nigrie (100 MW). 

 The procuring discoms under Scheme-I were Telangana and Tamil Nadu for 550 MW each, West Bengal and Bihar for 200 MW each, while Haryana had consented to sign for 400 MW."

11,2019-12-30,Shree Cement,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 21.50 points lower this morning, signalling a weak start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

. Antique Stock Broking has maintained a buy rating on HDFC BANK with a target price of Rs 1,525. Driven by the recent shift
in lending (non-retail and housing) and term deposits mix, the brokerage expects NIMs to decline. Nevertheless, cost to assets should trend lower by 20 bps over FY19-22. Increase in credit cost should get offset by higher
counter-cyclical provisions built in P&L and lower tax rate, said Antique. Shares of HDFC Bank ended up 0.3 per cent at Rs 1,274.9 on Friday.

. Elara Capital has maintained buy rating on APL APOLLO TUBES with a target price of Rs 2,181. Revival in demand coupled with incremental volume from newly added capacity would continue to aid in volume growth, said Elara. Further, domestic steel prices have improved gradually after huge pressure over the past several months, which would lead to improvement in realisation and restrict inventory loss, thereby leading to gradual margin expansion, the brokerage said. Shares of APL Apollo Tubes ended up 4.3 per cent at Rs 1,781.60 on Friday.

. Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on SHREE CEMENT with a target price of Rs 15,200. The company's management highlighted that demand recovery is not yet visible in the second half of FY20 and sluggish demand remains a concern, said Kotak Institutional. Underutilised capacity would help Shree Cement outperform industry growth but margins should remain rangebound as price pressure offsets cost deflation, said Kotak Institutional. Shares of Shree Cement ended up 0.75 per cent at Rs 20,492.65 on Friday.


. ICICI Securities has maintained buy rating on HEXAWARE TECHNOLOGIES and revised target price to Rs 430 from Rs 425. The brokerage expects the worst of the company's client-specific issues to be behind by the fourth quarter
of 2019 with revenue growth likely to sustain in double digits on an organic basis in 2020. The brokerage
expects momentum to improve in the BFS vertical in 2020 as spends at the large secondary mortgage
client seeing issues should bottom out in the fourth quarter of 2019. Shares of Hexaware Technologies
ended up 2.9 per cent at Rs 331 on Friday.

. CLSA has a buy rating on ADANI PORTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE with a target price of Rs 485. Adani
Ports acquired Snowman Logistics at the bottom of the cycle to enter coldchain logistics, said CLSA.
Funding is not a problem for Adani Ports as its post-acquisition leverage will rise 1.8 per cent in FY21, said
CLSA. In terms of earnings, Snowman M&A adds Adani Port’s consolidated Ebitda by 0.7 per cent in FY21, the brokerage
said. Shares of Adani Ports ended flat at Rs 363.65 on Friday."
