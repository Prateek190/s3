17,2018-01-02,Coal India,"The Jharkhand government has stopped issuing online permits for transport of coal and iron ore to several companies in the state, including state-run miner Coal India.

Senior officials of the state's Department of Mines and Geology said it was acting on a Supreme Court order of August 2, 2017 in a matter related to mining violations in Odisha. 

The Supreme Court, setting aside views of the earlier UPA government and miners’ lobby, had interpreted a section of the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act 1957 (MMDR) dealing with illegal mining in a manner that makes environmental compliance a prerequisite to mining operations.

The Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha is chasing compensation running into tens of thousands of crores, and Jharkhand has followed suit with similar actions against iron ore, manganese and coal miners. Despite a directive from the mines ministry at the Centre for all states to comply with the August 2 judgement, it is unclear when and how other states will act. 

Miners of major minerals in Jharkhand had been issued notices totaling an estimated Rs 24,000 crore. Of this Rs 21,000 crore was due on Coal India which, through three subsidiaries, has significant operations in the state. While confirming that the department was no longer issuing ‘e-chalans’ to those that had not paid, a senior government official said production had not been stopped. “We are waiting for the government to take a call on this,” said an official who asked not to be named. Questions sent to Coal India remained unanswered till the time of going to press.

Industry sources said that so far from a total of more than Rs 3,000 crore sought from iron and manganese miners only about Rs 400 crore had been deposited. Tata Steel, Rungta Group and smaller miners had paid while Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), which has legally contested the claims, is believed to have paid a partial sum.

Last November Odisha’s mines directorate had issued show-cause notices of Rs 20,169 crore to Coal India subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields (MCL). The government has recovered Rs 8,209 crore (less than half of the Rs 17,500 crore) in compensation before the December 31, 2017 deadline. On the apex court's direction it has ordered shut seven working mines whose lessees failed to deposit their fines.

Unlike Jharkhand, however, Odisha did not apply the year-end deadline to MCL. “We took a legal view that the December 31 deadline was only applicable to iron ore and manganese mines,” said a senior government official. MCL did not share its response to the show-cause notices with ET. It is believed to have argued that it is governed by the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, and not the MMDR Act.

In an affidavit to the Supreme Court, the mines ministry had said that environment and forest violations while mining must be punished by recovering a rationalised value of the ore. It is unclear, however, whether all its ministries and public sector undertakings are in agreement and ready to pay for their past violations. In a petition in the Odisha High Court, SAIL has argued that the apex court order is “per incuriam (or characterised by lack of due regard to the law or the facts) and not the law declared under Article 141 of the Constitution.”"

16,2018-01-02,Coal India,"Coal India may miss out on meeting its production target of 600 million tonnes in 2017-18, going by the production pattern during the first nine months of the year.

Provisional figures for the April-December 2017 period showed it has produced 383.93 million tonnes of the fossil fuel, falling short of the 406.58 MT target by six per cent.

However, during the nine-month period, it clocked a 1.6 per cent growth in production from 377.77 MT produced in the same period last year.

A CIL official said the company is striving to make up the shortfall by producing in excess of 2 MT per day.

According to the data, the miner produced 54.63 MT of coal in December, missing the production target of 58.89 MT for the month by seven per cent.

With better availability of rail rakes and upstick in demand, the miner achieved a 7.6 per cent growth in off-take to 421.41 MT during the first nine months of the current fiscal, as compared to 391.78 MT during the same period last year.

Brokerage firm IIFL said in a report that there is a strong possibility that CIL would miss its annual production target.

CIL was given a production target of 600 million tonnes for FY18, an annual growth of 8.3 per cent over FY17."
10,2018-01-02,Coal India,"Mumbai: Rumours about a government move to introduce long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on stock investments, mainly to compensate for the loss in GST collections, spooked Dalal Street investors in the last hour of trade on Monday. This led to a sharp dip in stock prices in the first session of 2018. As a result, the sensex — after remaining range-bound for most of the session due to low institutional participation during the New Year holidays — lost over 200 points within an hour and closed 244 points lower at 33,813.

Since December 24, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first said in a speech that those who are making profit from the stock market were not paying enough tax, talks have been surfacing at regular intervals about the Modi government’s move to actually impose LTCG tax. Of late, even BSE chief Ashishkumar Chauhan had been professing a tax on LTCG.

Among the stocks that pulled the benchmark indices down were HDFC (which closed 1.4% lower), HDFC Bank (down 1.5%) and Reliance Industries (down 1%). The handful of winners included Wipro (which closed 1.4% up) and Coal India (1.3% up).

Of the 30 sensex stocks, 25 closed in the red. Data at the end of the session on the BSE showed that, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,300 crore, foreign funds were net buyers at Rs 326 crore.

Outside of the blue-chips, the stocks of Anil Ambanicontrolled Reliance Group were again in focus in Monday’s session, with Reliance Naval closing 32% up and Reliance Power 21%. Reliance Communications, after more than doubling in the previous four sessions, closed 2.3% lower. Since December 23, the day RCom announced it will repay a large chunk of its debt, the group’s stocks have been in the limelight.

In the bond market, the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts closed at 7.34%, nearly unchanged from its Friday close. During the day, the central bank also announced a gilt auction for Friday, in which it would borrow Rs 18,000 crore — Rs 3,000 crore more than scheduled earlier. This is part of the government’s plans to borrow an extra Rs 50,000 crore from the market, dealers said.


Rupee at 5-month highIn the forex market, the Indian currency strengthened against the dollar to a fivemonth high as, globally, the greenback showed weakness against most other major currencies.

18,2018-01-03,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal, considered a polluting fuel, is turning out to be a heavy contributor to the government coffers. It is likely to contribute around Rs 95,000 crore to the government’s coffer in the form of clean energy cess between this financial and 2020.

Going by Coal India’s production targets and assuming they are achieved by the monopoly this year, the government is likely to collect around Rs 26,400 crore in the form of cess on coal. It is expected to touch Rs 30.920 crore next year and Rs 40,000 crore in 2020.

According to data compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the centre, has already collected Rs 53,967 crore in the form of Clean Energy Cess between 2010-11 and 2016-17. In fact, total cess collected by the government since its inception in 2010-11 till 2020 is likely to touch Rs 1.51lakh crore.

Clean energy cess collected from coal at the rate of Rs 400 per tonne of coal sold totalled Rs 26,117 crore during 2016-17 contributing a shade over 15% of the total cess collected by the government.

National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) was established in 2010-11 for funding research and innovative projects in clean energy technology by levying a Clean Energy Cess on coal produced in India and imported coal.

According to data compiled by CAG cess collected by the government in 2012-13 amounted to Rs 3053 crore which increased to Rs 3082 crore in 2013-14 and Rs 5393 crore in 2014-15. During these years the cess was Rs 200 per tonne of coal sold. In 2015-16 it was increased to Rs 400 per tonne which resulted in collected from cess increase to Rs 12676 crore followed by Rs 26117 crore in 2016-17.

In fact, cess and dividend collected by the government from coal companies were the second largest components in their respective heads in 2016-17.

The government collected a shade over Rs 41,400 crore from coal during 2016-17 in the form of cess on coal, dividend from Coal India and income from divestment proceeds of coal companies.

Coal also contributed almost 12% of the total divestment proceeds into the government’s income stream. According to figures compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Coal India contributed Rs 4,289 crore from divestment proceeds.

The centre also earned Rs 11,018 crore as dividend from three coal companies including Coal India and Neyveli Lignite. Dividend paid by coal companies to the centre was around 9% of the total dividend received by the government."

55,2018-01-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has decided to shift to a pricing system under which customers would be billed on the basis of exact energy content per kilogram of coal in every consignment that is sold to them. The new system would be effective from April 1, 2018.

At present, prices of coal is fixed for a range of energy content values in coal which is typically a band based pricing system. Customers pay a certain price per tonne if the heat content lies within these predefined ranges. There are 17 grades at present.

The new system will bring down the number of bands to 10. Each band would have a definite rate in Rupees or paise for one unit of energy in coal. Billing would be on the basis of this rate multiplied by total energy content in one kilogram of coal for each consignment. 

In technical terms, coal price will be based on Rupees per kilo calorie -- that is Rupees per unit of energy.

""It is a global system of coal pricing and we would put in place systems for measuring energy content for each consignment. It will lead to financial benefit for customers who pay for what they get,"" said Coal India chairman, Gopal Singh.

""If one looks at the new price coefficients, the pricing graph will look much linear and simpler compared to the previous practice. This enables coal consumers to calculate the basic price of non-coking coal of any mine of CIL based on its energy content and that makes the pricing system much simpler and transparent,"" he said

It will also act as motivation to mine managers as they would get incentivised on the basis on definite energy content and not on a range of content for which price is fixed feels executives."

58,2018-01-10,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Coal India sprung a surprise on the Street by raising prices of coking coal by 9 per cent which comprises nearly 90 per cent of its total sales volumes, which led to a consensus upgrading of the stock that jumped 5.7 per cent on Tuesday.

With this price increase, the management of the state-run coal miner expects the company’s revenues to rise by Rs 1,960 crore for the rest of FY18, and Rs 6,420 crore for FY19. This will more than offset concerns over wage increase that was worrying its investors. Coal India was expected to take a hit of Rs 5,700 crore on its profits because of the wage rise that it implemented in October 2017.

Higher contribution from e-auction sales — including sales outside the supply agreements that fetch higher margins — could have also spurred greater earnings. For December, e-auction realisations were strong at Rs 2,300 per tonne on higher volumes against Rs 1,780 in the last December quarter.

However, the full benefit of this will be seen only in the March quarter. E-auction comprises around 13-14 per cent of the total volumes.

Apart from higher prices, analysts are expecting a volume growth of 5 per cent for each of the next two fiscals. This along with better realisations have led to consensus expectations of an earnings jump of 35-45 per cent for FY19 over FY18. This will ensure that investors stay interested in the stock.

On the valuations basis, EV by EBIDTA is the most appropriate and widely used methodology for mining companies. EV, or enterprise value, is the sum of market capitalization and net debt, while EBIDTA is earnings before interest depreciation and tax (excludes earnings from other income such as interest on cash or asset sale). Based on this, analysts are valuing the company at 7 times FY19 EV/EBIDTA, pegging its stock price at about Rs 350. The stock closed at Rs 304 on Tuesday.

Further, investors could get about Rs 35 per share as dividend over the next 18 months, making the stock more attractive. Analysts expect Rs 17 and Rs 18 for FY18 and FY19, respectively."

56,2018-01-10,Coal India,"Rising crude oil prices would expand the need for working capital and raise energy cost for Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the nation’s largest refiner and fuel retailer, chairman Sanjiv Singh said in an interview to ET’s Sanjeev Choudhary. Whether price controls come back to soften the impact of sharp rise in prices of petrol and diesel on consumers is a call that the government will have to take, Singh said. Edited excerpts:


Crude oil prices have risen more than 40% in the past six months. What does it mean for IOC?
We prefer to see lower prices because when crude prices go up, the product prices also go up. So, from the company’s point of view, it would mean higher working capital and higher energy cost. And the profitability of the company will depend upon the margins that are available in the global market at different prices range of crude.


Given the current oil price trends, do you fear domestic price controls could come back?
Let’s see. Ultimately, it’s a government call. But you see the government decided to free the prices after considering all the aspects. Earlier also, when crude prices were above $100 per barrel, diesel was controlled, and the government was providing that kind of subsidy. Now, if the government feels that the prices have to be capped at a certain level, then they will have to find out ways of providing subsidy.


Are you able to pass on the entire rise in fuel prices to consumers today, as you did when prices were lower? Some analysts are concerned that rising prices may have begun hurting IOC’s gross marketing margins.
We are changing the prices with the global prices. Otherwise, how do we do business? It’s a fairly transparent mechanism by which we are working it out. I am confident that the system is working. If crude goes to $100 per barrel, probably it willbe a different call since prices will be very high. But at least in the present range, it’s working.


What happens if prices continue to rise like this?
Let’s see. Even before we can prompt that subsidy mechanism may again come in, it may be excise duty, it may be VAT reduction, it may be GST, because ultimately we all are expecting that these products would also get included in GST.


How are you dealing with increasing private competition in fuel retailing? They have taken away a market share of about 7-8%.
We are not afraid of competition. It brings in efficiency and more value to the customer. In terms of market share, you will see it going down by a few percentage points for Indian Oil because we are the largest player.


IOC had earlier expressed its desire to acquire GAIL. How seriously are you pursuing that?
GAIL is strong in gas infrastructure. We also have pipeline infrastructure. They are in gas sourcing, we are also in gas sourcing. So, from infrastructure integration point of view, it makes sense.


Are you trying to persuade people for this?
I don’t think it requires persuasion. Indicating our interest, and submitting our logic is good enough for us to indicate our seriousness.


Have you received any concrete offer from Saudi Aramco on buying stake in the proposed mega refinery?
It’s just talks right now. They cannot even give us a concrete offer because today we haven’t even frozen the configuration.


Have you shelved some of your planned brownfield expansion due to the proposed mega refinery?
No. Brownfield expansion will help quickly add capacity; it is low-cost expansion. In fact, we are expediting it because we need capacity.


How is IOC preparing to deal with the rise of renewables?We are not going to deal with renewables, we are going to deal in renewables. We are investing in three biofuel plants. By my standards, today they do not give the desired IRR (internal rate of return). But as a strategic move we have decided to invest in these. Oil and gas, I strongly believe, is not going to go away. Tell me, if you have to buy a single car today, will you go for the petrol car or a battery car? If it is your fourth car, you may go for a battery car. For a company like Indian Oil, the bigger challenge is to meet the oil and gas requirement till it is needed. If it is needed till 2050, we have to be there. I can’t say that I have switched to battery manufacturing, so I will not make petrol.


IOC is diversifying into fertilizer business. How is that progressing?We, along with NTPC, Coal India and state fertilizer companies, are building three urea plants at Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni at a total investment of Rs 18,000 crore. All three plants will be ready by 2020. The demand for urea is going to stay strong in future. This is a good diversification for us as we know how to run process plants. Besides, these plants will become anchor customers for gas grid."
59,2018-01-10,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices on Wednesday opened on a positive note. The gains, though, were largely capped, as other Asian markets too were nervous around 2007 peaks. There were concerns that global market rally, which added $2 trillion in market value to stocks in less than two weeks, may cool down. Besides, investors were cautious of the forthcoming earnings season.

 &quot;We forecast Nifty earnings growth will recover from 9 per cent in FY18 to 13 per cent in FY19, driven largely by financials (provisioning cycle). However, earnings growth is likely to disappoint against optimistic consensus expectation of 22 per cent growth in FY19. Top-down, we expect 10 per cent cuts to consensus FY19 and FY20 estimates,&quot; UBS said in a note.

 Oil prices were ruling at their highest levels since 2014 and some usually the final lap in a rally.

 Among Sensex stocks, ONGC was trading 1.4 per cent higher at Rs 199.25 on BSE. Coal India advanced 1.09 per cent to Rs 307.35. Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma and Adani Ports added 1 per cent each.

 Tata Steel, Asian Paints and HDFC fell up to 0.78 per cent.

 Telecom stocks gained after Telecom Commission (TC) decided to relax spectrum holding caps, giving a boost to M&As and spectrum sale, as carriers try to sell assets, including airwaves, to repay debt. The commission also extended the payments tenure for auctioned airwaves from 12 years to 16 years, and lowered the interest rate on penalties on outstanding dues of telcos from 14 per cent to 12 per cent.

 Idea Cellular rose over 3 per cent. Reliance Communications was trading nearly 2 per cent higher. There were also reports that Reliance Jio Infocomm may target Reliance Communications&rsquo; remaining unsold airwaves in the 850 MHz band &mdash; considered among the most suitable for rollout of 4G services &mdash; with the government backing the sector regulator&rsquo;s call for easing spectrum cap rules, three people aware said, adding that Bharti Airtel could provide a stiff challenge."

Trump Drops H-1B Visa Plan 
In a relief for Indian techies, US authorities have said that the Trump administration is not considering any proposal that would force H-1B visa holders to leave the country. The announcement by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) came days after reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering tightening H-1B visa rules that could lead to deportation of 7,50,000 Indians.The reports had said it was mulling ending extensions for H-1B holders. 


Telecom Panel Approves Easing Spectrum Limits
The Telecom Commission (TC) has decided to relax spectrum holding caps, giving a boost to M&As and spectrum sale, as carriers try to sell assets, including airwaves, to repay debt. The commission — the highest decision-making body in the communications ministry — on Tuesday also extended the payments tenure for auctioned airwaves from 12 years to 16 years, and lowered the interest rate on penalties on outstanding dues of telcos from 14% to 12%. The commission endorsed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s proposal to do away with the 50% cap on intra-band spectrum holdings of telcos. Instead, it agreed to impose a separate 50% cap on the combined spectrum holdings in the 700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands (sub-1GHz bands).


IDFC Bank In Talks with Capital First for Merger?
IDFC Bank, which scrapped a deal to merge with Shriram City Union, is said to be exploring a similar deal with the Mumbai-based Capital First, which has more than 5 million customers in retail and small and medium enterprises, said two people familiar with the discussions. Although the matter has not been taken to board level for discussions yet, proposals from investment bankers have reached some top executives of the two companies. 


Telecom Services Cost May Rise by 10% 
Telecom body TAIPA expects 50,000 mobile tower installations in coming fiscal with considerable tax implications and in absence of concessions from the government, cost of mobile services may become dearer by 10%. The Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA) has sought extension of some tax benefits that are granted to some non-telecom infrastructure firms and amendments in Goods and Services Tax. 


Infosys Inks Pact with US IRS; Sees Lower Tax Rate 
Infosys Ltd on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), resulting in an effective tax rate of about 100 basis points lower going forward. The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA), now concluded following discussions initiated in 2015, is expected to result in reversal of tax provisions of about $225 million made in the previous periods and boost the company's consolidated basic earnings per share by about $0.10 for quarter ended December 31, the Bengaluru-based company said in a statement. 


Crude Oil Rises Above $68 
Oil rose further above $68 a barrel on Tuesday, touching its highest since May 2015, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations US crude inventories fell for an eighth week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia are keeping supply limits in place in 2018, a second year of restraint, to reduce a price-denting glut of oil held in inventories. Brent crude, was up 32 cents at $68.10 a barrel at 1311 GMT and earlier touched $68.29, its highest since May 2015. U.S. crude rose 37 cents to $62.10 and also reached its highest since May 2015. ""In view of sharply falling US crude oil stocks and record-high compliance with the production cuts by OPEC, market participants are convinced that the market is continuing to tighten. 


Coal India Changes Pricing System
Coal India has decided to shift to a pricing system under which customers would be billed on the basis of exact energy content per kilogram of coal in every consignment that is sold to them. The new system would be effective from April 1, 2018. At present, prices of coal is fixed for a range of energy content values in coal which is typically a band based pricing system. Customers pay a certain price per tonne if the heat content lies within these predefined ranges. There are 17 grades at present. The new system will bring down the number of bands to 10. Each band would have a definite rate in Rupees or paise for one unit of energy in coal.

73,2018-01-11,Coal India,"Coal India has decided to replace its pricing policy from rupees per tonne to paise per unit of energy for different grades of coal sold from April 1, 2018.

The grading system, based on total energy content per kilogram, remains but the price of each consignment will be determined by a rate fixed for each unit of energy for that particular grade and the total energy contained in 1kg of coal for the consignment.
This means that the price of each tonne of coal will be based on its total energy content. Under the present system, the price used to be same for a range of energy content which was categorised as grades.
Coal India, however, has reduced the number of grades from 17 earlier to 10 under the new system. The broad category of grades has been divided into three — high energy content, medium energy content and low energy content.
In the medium range where energy content will vary from 4901 kilo calorie per kg (read total energy content in one kilogram) to 5800 kilo calorie, for example, coal will be sold on rates that will vary from 29 paise per kilo calorie to 41 paise per kilo calories. Thus, one tonne of coal with a total energy content of 4301 kilo calorie will cost 4901 x 29 paise per tonne of coal. This will require each consignment to be tested for the exact quantum of energy content in each kilogram of coal and Coal India has decided to put in place systems and infrastructure by April 1, 2018.
According CIL Chairman Gopal Singh, the new system is based on the global system of coal pricing.
“It provides consumers with a more accurate and transparent method for arriving at coal prices. Additionally, calculating the basic price of non-coking coal of any mine of CIL based on its energy content would be simpler. In some cases, prices have been reduced even to the extent of Rs 162/tonne,” a senior Coal India executive said.
Due to the earlier band pricing system, consumers had to pay a fixed price for different energy content as long as was within one band. Now they will pay different prices for different energy content in each band.
It is expected to incentivse mine managers to maintain quality.
Managers will focus on quality since marginal improvement even by one unit of energy will fetch additional revenue to the individual mine and have an impact on the bottom-line of the unit."

67,2018-01-11,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Brokerages are upbeat on Coal India as the company raised its non-coking coal prices, with at least two brokerages upgrading the stock.

The company’s board approved upward revision of non-coking coal prices with effect from January 9 and said that it will be applicable to all subsidiaries including North Eastern Coalfields for regulated and non-regulated sectors.

The price revision will help Coal India earn incremental revenue of Rs 1,956 crore for the balance period of the current financial year.

Analysts said the price hike comes as a surprise and has improved visibility on earnings going forward.

“Coal India has taken fairly large 10-11 per cent price hikes in thermal coal prices, which come as a surprise and significantly improve its earnings growth outlook,” said CLSA, upgrading Coal India shares to ‘outperform’ and raised target price by 29 per cent.

IIFL also upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ with a revised target price of Rs 357. The brokerage upgraded EBITDA and profit after tax estimates for Coal India for the FY19-FY20 period by 12 per cent.

Coal India’s financials were under pressure for the last one-and-a-half years due to sharp wage hikes and coal quality downgrades.

In 2017, when the benchmark indices were on a record setting spree and the Sensex gained 28 per cent, Coal India’s shares underperformed and ended the year down 12 per cent.

Edelweiss said that while it is upbeat on the price hike taken by Coal India, it does not see any additional near term trigger in the stock. Edelweiss has maintained ‘hold’ rating on Coal India."

78,2018-01-13,Coal India,"Market continued its upward trajectory on the back of huge liquidity and prospects of fireworks in the upcoming Budget. Huge expectations are being built, which are driving mid-cap and small-cap companies crazy. In these euphoric times, the government is acting contra - selling shares when the market is greedy.

The government divested by selling shares of up to Rs 1,200 crore in NMDC by offering shares at Rs 153.5 when the stock price rose by 15 per cent in a month. Sell on rise seems to be the mantra of the government. Many such disinvestments are expected in the near future, which will dampen the already depleting liquidity in the market.

Coal India hiked its prices by 9 per cent as a way to compensate wage hikes. However, the market gave a thumbs-up and the stock jumped 10 per cent. But realistically, the price increase was to neutralise the wage hikes, and nothing more by euphoric markets disregards inconvenient facts. The government took advantage of this situation and increased prices of freight for coal, too. The biggest threat of all these events means increased inflation in the near future, limiting RBI’s ability to reduce interest rates, a negative for the market.


Event of the week: IDFC Bank and Capital First are rumored to be exploring merger. This is the second instance wherein earlier Bharat Financials and IndusInd Bank had agreed to merge. This highlights the fact that independently micro finance companies are finding it difficult to get low-cost funds, which otherwise banks get in the form of current account and saving account deposits (CASA). Hopefully, this merger, if it happens, would be synergistic in the long-term interest of all the stakeholders.


Technical Outlook: The market is edging higher with lesser velocity. The momentum indicator measured by MACD is showing divergence with the price action indicating that Nifty is preparing for a correction, but it is most likely to first touch the upper resistance of the trend channel at 10,800 to 10,850 in the near term. The current leg of the rally is nearing maturity and hopefully around the end of month would reach the peak on the trend channel. Traders should buy at the current price and keep a close stop loss at daily lows.





Expectations of the week: The quarterly results season has just begun. The market is not rewarding inline numbers. TCS, IndusInd Bank and Infosys had reported 3.97 per cent, 25 per cent and 38 per cent increase in quarterly profits on a YoY basis, respectively. It is expected that corporates will post slightly better numbers due to low base effect of demonetisation in the previous year. However to that extent, at an aggregate level, the corporate numbers will not seriously surprise the market as they are more or less discounted, barring a few exceptions in the commodities space. But the market will be keenly watching important policy announcements that the Budget will deliver, which will really decide the direction of the market in the near term. Investors should exercise caution, but at the same time continue SIP in only quality stocks.

Dredging Corp gets a sinking feeling Dredging Corporation of India slid over 5 per cent last week. During the week, ET reported that the government may shelve its plan to sell the state-owned company to private players. The ministry is of the view that given the massive projects that the government is undertaking to make inland waterways navigable and build and modernise ports, a state-owned company could provide it more cost-effective dredging solutions than a private player, ET reported.

82,2018-01-16,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India’s new pricing policy, which involves selling coal on the basis of total energy content in each consignment, is expected to bring down cost of power generation that would be passed on to consumers, said executives from the company.

“Under the new policy, prices of seven grades have been reduced,” CIL chairman Gopal Singh told ET. “In some cases, prices have been reduced even to the extent of Rs 162 per tonne compared with present coal price chart. It would make power generation cheaper.”

In its new coal pricing policy, which will come into effect from April, the monopoly has graded coal on the basis of total energy content. Each of these grades will have a different rate for one unit of energy within these slabs with higher prices for higher calorific value.

For every 100 unit reduction in energy content measured in kilo calorie, prices would reduce by a minimum of Rs 19 per tonne for the lowest grade and a maximum of Rs 48 per tonne for the highest grade.

“Deterioration in coal quality even by 1 unit of energy measured in kilo calorie will be addressed by the present system in contrast to the older system where the band width for a particular grade was 300 kilo calorie,” he said.

According to a Coal India executive, there are nine slabs in the new system. For example, coal with total energy content varying between 3,101 kilo calorie per kg and 4,600 kilo calorie per kg will be billed at 23 paise per unit of energy.

This means that the price of coal per tonne for this grade will vary between Rs 713 per tonne on the lowest side for the grade and Rs 1,058 per tonne on the highest side of the grade. The current price for this grade is fixed at Rs 886 per tonne as long as energy content per kg lies within the grade.

“In determining the rate of energy for each unit within each slab, we took the middle value of total energy content per kg of coal for each of these grades and arrived at a one unit of energy price in a way that it matches the latest price tariff,” he said."

96,2018-01-18,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Cairn India, now Vedanta Ltd, today told the Delhi High Court that proceedings regarding an over Rs 20,000 crore tax demand for non-payment of withholding tax on capital gains in 2006 by its former parent Cairn UK, need not continue as the authorities have taken action against the foreign entity.

Cairn India, which in April last year merged with businessman Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Group, told a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar that the Indian tax authorities have already recovered over Rs 600 crore from it towards the separate Rs 10,247 crore tax demanded from the foreign company in respect of the capital gains made in 2006.

Besides, the authorities have also attached Cairn UK's shares, worth around Rs 9,000 crore, in its former Indian arm, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Cairn India, told the bench.

Cairn India Ltd (CIL) had moved the high court in April 2015 against the Rs 20,495 crore tax demanded from it. The amount comprised Rs 10,248 crore principal tax demand and an interest of Rs 10,247 crore, the company had told the court.

""Why beat us up if the Government of India is recovering the amount from Cairn UK Holdings,"" Salve said and suggested a ""way out"" -- that the Indian company will pay the shortfall, if any, in the tax demanded from the foreign company after the recovery process got over.

The senior lawyer said the Indian company was only accused of not paying withholding tax in relation to the capital gains made by Cairn UK in 2006 when it transferred shares of Cairn India Holdings to Cairn India as part of an internal reorganisation of its Indian business.

He also said the Indian company is a prime oil producer which is selling crude at a price of USD six per barrel even when global rates were much higher.

The bench said the ""way out"" was an administrative step which has to be explored by the company outside the court with the government.

It, however, suggested to the company to raise its grievances before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) instead of the court.

Salve and the lawyer for the tax department sought time to seek instructions on the suggestion made by the court, which listed the matter for further hearing on March 13.

The tax department's lawyer also said the amount of Rs 10,247 crore demanded from Cairn UK was only the principle and there was a huge interest component on it.

Cairn UK has through a separate plea moved the high court against the tax demanded from it after the ITAT in March last year had held it liable to pay the amount.

Apart from this, the foreign company has also initiated arbitration against the Indian government under the India-UK Bilateral Investment Protection Agreement (BIPA).

Cairn UK has asked the arbitration panel to order India to withdraw its ""unlawful"" tax demand and compensate it for the harm suffered by the seizure of the Cairn India shares.

The government had earlier told the court that the total sale price of transferring Cairn Energy's (parent of Cairn UK) assets here -- around 26 companies which have production- sharing agreements with the government to extract hydrocarbons -- to CIL was Rs 26,681 crore.

It had said the cost of acquisition of these companies came to around Rs 2,178 crore based on face value of the shares.

After deducting this from the total sale price, the capital gains of the company came to around Rs 24,500 crore.

CIL had opposed the government's submission saying there was no capital gain as the transaction had taken place through 100 per cent share swap.

It had said that it had carried out an internal group reorganisation by transferring 100 per cent shares of the 26 companies to Cairn India Holdings Ltd, based in USA, whose shares in turn were transferred to CIL and its shares were transferred to Cairn UK Holdings Ltd."
97,2018-01-19,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Power producers are still evaluating Coal India’s claim that its new pricing policy will bring down fuel costs for generating electricity.The state-owned coal monopoly has announced introduction of a calorific value-based pricing policy for power sector consumers from April, and issued an indicative chart for these customers.

While one major power company said the new policy would make coal cheaper for them, Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, said the industry is still studying the situation.

“Coal India should have discussed with stakeholders before announcing a new pricing policy,” he said.

A senior Coal India executive said: “The proposed system would be value for money for power consumers since the billing accounts for each unit of energy content in the coal that is delivered. It will help power generators reduce costs.”

The new policy maintains the price differential of 20% between core-sector buyers – power, fertilizer and defence – and others.

Coal India chairman Gopal Singh said the indicative rates announced for the power sector will be the base rates applicable for power consumers with fuel supply agreements while non-core consumers will pay 20% more.

“We have been charging non-core consumers 20% more than power consumers in the recent past,” Singh said. “This will continue to be the case even under the new pricing policy. Premium grades would cost the same for both core and noncore grade.”

He said that prices of seven grades are being reduced under the new policy.

All consumers will pay the same rate for coal with total energy content upwards of 5,800 kilo calorie per kilogram of coal.

Company executives said all consumers would be paying 48 paise per kilo calorie if they buy coal with energy content above 6,100 kilo calorie per kilogram. They would pay 46 paise per kilo calorie for buying coal with energy content varying between 5,800 kilo calories per kilogram to 6,100 kilo calorie per kilogram.

For coal with energy content below 5,800 kilo calorie till 5,500 kilo calorie the present difference between prices is around 8.9% for core and non-core consumers. If Coal India maintains the same differential then non-core consumers may have to pay 44.6 paise per kilo calorie while core consumers would pay 41paise per kilo calorie.

Rest of the grades would be charged at 20% more as is the case now.

Thus, going by the new pricing policy, a non-core consumer will have to pay 27.6 paise per kilo calorie for coal with total energy content varying between 3,101 kilo calorie per kg and 4,600 kilo calorie per kg. The corresponding rate for power consumers is 23 paise per kilo calorie."

As India gears up for the presentation of Union Budget on February 1, 2018, hopes are running high that the government will dole out sops in the budget, giving a further fillip to the infrastructure sector.

The focus of the government on infrastructure spending is expected to further revive the capex cycle, as we may see higher allocations for roads, railways, and power programmes. It is also expected that urban infrastructure, housing, water and sanitation needs would see a lot of government’s attention.

Also, corporate loan growth could make a comeback from such sectors as power transmission, manufacturing, engineering and other technical segments.

India is far behind in terms of infrastructure, and as the commercial vehicles segment is directly connected with economic and commercial activities, with growing focus on it, the segment is expected to see massive growth going forward.

The commercial vehicle industry is expected to see further momentum aided by increased thrust on infrastructure and rural sectors in the upcoming Budget and on resumption of mining activities in selected states.

To note, Coal India has identified mines with production capacity of 908 million tonnes so far. It could be seen that the core sector data has also improved reasonably led by strong growth in the sectors of coal and electricity.

Undoubtedly, India is well-endowed in terms of most minerals and the country’s mining sector has great potential. The reformative Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been a harbinger of change for the transport and logistics industry and this too is going to support the commercial vehicle segment.

Additionally, the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) decision to phase out old diesel vehicles along with government's proposed vehicle modernization programme will further support the sector by boosting the replacement demand. 

As per Crisil, the overall commercial vehicle industry is expected to grow by around 10 per cent in fiscal 2019. While focus continues on penetrating in domestic market, Indian manufacturers are also looking to gain a foothold in the global market.

With the revival in the global economy, expansion in the new markets like Asia, Africa and the West Asia by the Indian conglomerates, scaling up exports from foreign CV OEMs and growing demands from existing markets like the SAARC region, the sector is expected to see good growth."
100,2018-01-21,Coal India,"The Steel Ministry is in talks with the Railways Ministry to ensure the adequate availability of rakes for industries that have been saying the problem has led to a shortage of raw materials at plants, according to Union Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh.

Railway rakes are those wagons which carry various raw materials like coal and iron ore to industrial plants.

Coal-based steel, power and aluminium plants have been complaining against railways for raw material supply-related issues due to unavailability of adequate rakes.

On being asked about the measures the Steel Ministry is adopting to sort out the railway rake shortage issue, the minister said, ""This is a problem. We are talking to the Railways Ministry [in this regard],"" Singh told PTI.

The government understands that a market is very important for business, and for a market, transportation is essential, the minister said.

Power industry body Indian Captive Power Producers Association (ICPPA), whose members include players from key sectors such as steel and aluminium, had urged the government to ensure coal availability, saying most captive power producers (CPPs) are facing severe shortage of the fuel which may lead to closure of plants.

Besides, railways is also doing ""choosy deliveries"", it said.

To meet their loading targets, the zonal railway is making deliveries to plants which are near pits and this is something which is not justified, ICPPA secretary general Rajiv Agarwal had said.

Captive power producers are already facing shortage from one body of the government, which is Coal India and now this practice of Railways makes the matter worse, he added.

Big steel players like JSPL had also complained about issues related to railway rakes.

JSPL chairman Naveen Jindal had said supply and production of steel, aluminium, cement and captive power producers have been hit due to shortage of railway rakes and this situation needs immediate correction, Jindal said.

The government should ensure that performing steel assets do not face any shortage of raw material, he added."
101,2018-01-22,Coal India,"Due to several factors, Coal India has been under pressure for the past one year and has underperformed the Sensex by a whopping 38%. Wage hikes and the resultant pressure on the Coal India’s margin was a key reason for its underperformance.


Grade slippage—disputes by customers about the grade of coal being received—was the second major factor that hurt Coal India. The company has invested heavily in quality control systems, including increased mechanisation, to reduce dispute around the quality of Coal. The huge price differentials across grades were also leading to complaints, prompting Coal India to rationalise prices. The company has cut the prices of its high and low grade coals, and increased the prices of the grades in the middle quite substantially. While the prices of G2, G16 and G17 type of coal were cut by 5%, prices of G6 and G7 were raised by 22% and 20% respectively.

This price rationalisation has resulted in coal prices going up on average. Analysts expect it will result in an average 7% increase in Coal India’s realisation across all grades, boosting revenue by Rs 6,400 crore per annum. This price rise, along with the introduction of evacuation charge of Rs 50 per tonne, would more than offset the wage increase and result in margin expansion.

Lower volume growth and decline in e-auction bids due to the reduction in coal intake by power plants—due to power plants’ internal troubles—were among Coal India’s other concerns. Due to the government’s efforts, power plants have been getting over their problems, and their coal intake has started picking up again. Stock levels are still low at power plants—nine days now against the historic average of 12 days—so restocking is expected to continue in the coming months and this should result in increased volume growth for Coal India. Increased demand from power sector companies has reduced the supply to other sectors and, due to this, e-auction prices are also expected to remain firm in the coming quarters.

With the return of growth—according to consensus estimate, Coal India’s revenue and net profit are expected to register a CAGR of 11% and 25% respectively between 2016-17 and 2018-19—analysts say that this counter is ripe for a re-rating. Coal India is also in a stable business that generates free cash flow and it must be able to maintain its high dividends in the coming years as well. More importantly, at 6.83%, its current dividend yield is more than several that of several bank deposits.

102,2018-01-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Coal India has earned a premium of 66% from sale of coal in the spot markets so far in the current year as the state-run monopoly slashed the quantity allocated to the power sector in spot auctions while increasing supplies to non-power sectors.

The premium for spot auctions went as high as 95% in the months of October and December last year, data available on the coal ministry’s website showed. Power companies paid premium up to 74% during these months for getting coal in auctions.

Power plants that do not have sale agreements with distribution companies (discoms) primarily buy coal in spot e-auctions.

Many of these plants are categorised as stressed assets.

The government is looking at ways to reduce stress in the power sector.

Coal India did not respond to queries sent by ET.

Power generation companies said high premiums make their businesses unsustainable. “Sharp drop in the quantum of coal in special forward e-auction has resulted in very high premium in spot auction for power developers, which is unsustainable looking at retail power prices,” said Ashok Khurana, director general at Association of Power Producers.

A Coal India executive told ET that though the offerings on special forward e-auction for the power sector was reduced by Coal India, the company has offered 27.18 million tonnes under transparent bidding-based mechanism ‘Shakti’ to power plants that have power purchase agreements with discoms.

Shakti — or, scheme for harnessing and allocating koyala (coal) transparently in India — is expected to result in an annual generation of over 47 billion units per annum and an estimated savings in tariff of about Rs 125 crore per annum for 25 years, the executive said.

However, coal supplies to power plants that won coal in Shakti auctions are yet to begin as discoms have to amend the power purchase agreements.

Data available with the coal ministry showed that spot market offering to power companies reduced by 28% during April-December while supply to non-power sectors was increased by 148%. Coal India offered 27.4 million tonnes of coal during the period under special forward e-auction for power plants, against 38.3 million tonnes a year earlier.

E-auction for non-power sector rose to 10.8 million tonnes during the same period from 4.35 million tonnes in the year-ago period.

In December, Coal India offered 9.1 million tonnes of coal in spot e-auctions, nearly a 100% jump over the 4.6 million tonnes offered in December 2016. The company earned a premium of 74% over the notified price, data showed.

For the nine months to December, the company sold 40.8 million tonnes at spot auctions, a slight drop from 41.4 million tonnes sold in the corresponding period of the previous year, the data said. Coal India earned 66% premium over notified price on spot auctions in the first nine months of FY18, it said."

ONGC rose 4.49 per cent to Rs 202.60. The refiner has agreed to acquire the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for about Rs 37,000 crore in an all-cash deal that would close by the month end. This would help government meet the disinvestment target for FY18.

Adani Ports rose 2.12 per cent to Rs 949.45. Reliance Industries advanced 2.16 per cent to Rs 949.45. The company's third-quarter net profit of a record Rs 9,423 crore exceeded street estimates by 12 per cent and may reinforce investor confidence in earnings growth, which is being driven by the commissioning of new plants.

107,2018-01-23,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: British oil explorer Cairn Energy plc today said the final hearing in the arbitration, which it has initiated against a Rs 10,247 crore retrospective tax demand raised by India, will begin in August.

In an operational update, Cairn said the three-member international arbitration tribunal has indicated that it will expeditiously draft the award after the hearing.

Cairn has taken the arbitration route against the Indian government, which used a new law giving it powers to impose taxes retrospectively for slapping a Rs 10,247 crore demand on a decade old internal reorganisation of the company's unit in the country.

""International arbitration proceedings are well advanced with the final hearing of Cairn's claim under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty scheduled for August 2018,"" Cairn said.

The tribunal was earlier expected to begin final hearing sometime in early 2018 after responses and counter-responses are filed by Cairn and Government of India. But the proceedings were pushed back to August.

""The Tribunal has stated that it will make appropriate arrangements to progress with the drafting of the award as expeditiously as possible after the final hearing,"" Cairn said.

Cairn's direct subsidiary, Cairn UK Holdings Ltd (CUHL) had in 2016 received an assessment order from the Indian Income Tax Department (IITD) relating to the intra--group restructuring undertaken in 2006 prior to the IPO of Cairn India Ltd (CIL) in India.

The order cited a retrospective amendment to tax law introduced in 2012. Cairn contested the tax.

The assessment order raised tax demand of Rs 10,247 crore. An interest of Rs 18,800 crore was originally charged from 2007, but this was quashed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in late 2016.

Following that, the IITD issued a revised demand including interest running from February 2016 ie 30 days after the date of the assessment order.

""Cairn is currently unable to access the value in its about 5 per cent shareholding in Vedanta Ltd, valued at around USD 1.1 billion at December 31, 2017 or accrued dividend payments due of USD 104 million,"" the company said today.

Cairn had sold a majority stake in Cairn India to Vedanta Group in 2011 but continued to hold a minority 9.8 per cent interest. Cairn India has since merged with Vedanta Ltd. Cairn Energy's holding in Vedanta post merger is little less than 5 per cent.

CUHL's original 9.8 per cent shareholding in Cairn India (now about 5 per cent in Vedanta Ltd) was attached by the Income Tax Department in January 2014 and CUHL continues to be restricted by the IITD from selling such shares, Cairn said.

Additionally, the tax department has seized dividend income due to CUHL from Vedanta Ltd resulting in an exceptional impairment of USD 104.7 million.

A tax refund of Rs 1,590 crore has also been directed to the tax department to be set against the 2006--07 liability.

Cairn commenced international arbitration proceedings against India under the UK--India Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2015.

It contends that the government's actions have breached the Treaty by expropriating Cairn's property without adequate and just compensation, denying fair and equitable treatment in respect of its investments and restricting the firm's right to freely transfer funds in connection with its investment.

Cairn has asked the arbitration panel to order India to withdraw its unlawful tax demand and compensate Cairn for the harm suffered by the seizure of the CIL shares, being not less than USD 1.1 billion (plus costs).

Or if the tax demand remains in place, compensate Cairn for the quantum of the tax assessment and the harm suffered by the seizure of the CIL shares."
108,2018-01-24,Coal India,"Coal India’s board has empowered subsidiaries to fix their own floor prices for e-auctions, which is expected to help the monopoly get higher rates.
Earlier, it had fixed a ceiling for floor prices. It was 20% for non-power consumers and 10% for power. “Subsidiaries have also been empowered to fix the periodicity of these e-auctions depending on market forces,” a senior Coal India executive told ET.

Western Coalfields, a subsidiary, has been empowered to fix its reserve price on the basis of the cost of production of coal. Many of its mines are underground and have higher costs compared to other mines.

Coal India has told its consumers that the upper cap is being removed immediately.

The executive said subsidiaries are now free to fix any floor price, which could be more than 20% for non-power consumers and 10% for power consumers. If demand for a particular source of coal is very high, Coal India subsidiaries are now free to fix prices that could fetch them additional revenue.




It may help Coal India improve realisations from eauctions because coal supplied through e-auctions is always in demand from various segment of buyers who do not have a steady supply contract with Coal India.

However, it is still cheaper than imports. Also, smaller consumers do not have the wherewithal to import coal.

At present, there is a shortage of coal availability in the international market due to rains in Indonesia and rising demand from China. This has helped the company realise better margins from spot e-auctions this year. The company is estimated to have earned a total revenue Rs 12,000 crore till December 2017from e-auctions. It earned around ₹9,721 crore in the previous corresponding period, an expected 23% rise.

It sold an estimated 70 million tonnes in April-December 2017 through e-auctions, getting an average of ₹1,600 per tonne.

In the year-ago period, it sold 64.71 million tonnes at an average of ₹1,502 per tonne. “We hope to sell close to 100 million tonnes through eauctions during 2017-18,” another Coal India executive said.

The company’s average realisations from e-auction rose in tandem with rising international rates. During the second quarter of 2017-18, average realisation was ₹1,614 per tonne against ₹1,337 per tonne in the previous corresponding period, which is a 20% rise in realisations.

Average realisation in the third quarter of the current fiscal has already crossed ₹1,650 per tonne and is expected to touch ₹1,700 per tonne by December 2017 end against ₹1,500 per tonne in the previous corresponding period, an expected 13.5% rise."

In January, they have pumped ?8,867 crore into shares in India after pulling ?5,350 crore out of the markets in December.

“So far the market rally has been largely driven by liquidity,” said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer (equities), Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. “Until now, we were seeing strong domestic liquidity and not much inflows from foreign investors. In January, we have seen decent inflows from foreign investors, which is in line with overall inflows into emerging markets.”

The VIX closed 5.4% higher at 16.2—the highest closing since mid-December. The VIX had reached as high as 18.2 in December amid outcome of the Gujarat polls which saw the BJP winning less than expected number of seats.

Eco Survey Today
All eyes will be on the Economic Survey on Monday, the first day of the crucial Budget session of Parliament. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will table the Economic Survey for 2017-18, days ahead of the fifth and final full Budget of the current term of the Narendra Modi government on Thursday. Amid speculation that the Modi government is thinking of advancing the Lok Sabha election from April-May 2019 to November-December 2018, the Economic Survey and the Budget will be gleaned for any such indication.


Brokers Told to Collect Cushion Money as Mkt Soars
The stock market’s recordbreaking run has put the capital market regulator and stock exchanges on high alert. Exchanges, at the direction of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), are asking brokers to collect higher margins from big clients including foreign institutions, rich individuals and proprietary desks having sizeable positions in futures and options. Sebi is worried about the near-record position buildup in equity derivatives that poses a potential systemic risk.


Pre-budget Cheer for Exporters
Ahead of the Budget, the government has increased the incentive on more than a hundred products including traditional exports like leather, marine, yarn and wool. The benefit in form of higher duty drawback on 102 items is expected to boost exports and also ease the liquidity crunch faced by exporters after the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax. Fish exporters will enjoy higher subsidy of 1.2% instead of 0.4% while those of automobile tyres would get 3.6% drawback compared with 2.6% earlier. Similarly, exporters of finished leather will get a higher drawback of 2.36% versus 1.2% previously. 


Government to Consolidate Large Subsidiaries of PSUs 
The government has embarked on a consolidation drive by merging the group companies of Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corp to create a single unit that would harness embedded synergies. The move, aimed at pruning the number of subsidiaries or special purpose vehicles under these entities, will result in cost optimisation, and bring the cost base at state firms on a par with those at private-sector establishments. Others such companies, including NTPC, NMDC, Container Corporation, Shipping Corporation, and Coal India, may also soon follow the path of consolidation. 


GST Collection Rises in December
Goods and services tax (GST) receipts rose in December 2017, reversing the decline seen in the previous two months. The government expects collections to improve in the coming months as measures to raise compliance have begun to show results, officials said. The total collections for December rose to Rs 86,703 crore, as on January 24, the finance ministry said in a post on microblogging site Twitter on Thursday. GST receipts had slipped to Rs 80,808 crore in November from more than Rs 83,000 crore in October and over Rs 92,000 crore in September. 


M&As & PE Deals Exceed $60.5 Bn in 2017
Corporate India's deal tally, including M&As as well as private equity, amounted to $60.5 billion driven by big ticket consolidation and the outlook for remains bullish for this year, says a report. According to assurance, tax and advisory firm Grant Thornton, there were 1,147 deals (M&A and PE) worth $60.54 billion last year. On the merger and acquisition (M&A) front, the year saw 411 deals valued at $40 billion, continuing the declining trend after peaking in 2015. The fall in the deal tally is mainly due to the absence of multi-billion-dollar deals. 


Pharma Cos Get Record 300 USFDA Generic Drug Nods
Domestic pharma companies received more than 300 approvals in 2017 to launch generic drugs in the US, which is an all-time high. The clearances came despite regulatory pressure from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and unprecedented warning letters issued to the pharma companies' facilities. The final approvals for Indian players are up by nearly 43% from 211 in 2016, and corner about 40% of all global filings in the highly lucrative around $70-billion US market. 

Tata Power CEO May Resign Soon
After occupying various top positions at different Tata Group companies for more than two decades, Tata Power chief executive officer Anil Sardana is understood to be soon putting in his papers. The Tata Group, under chairman N Chandrasekaran, has been trying to restructure the conglomerate by creating around five verticals, consolidating businesses with potential synergies. The group was planning to create a defence and infrastructure vertical by bringing in power and defence-related businesses under one roof. It would be headed by former GE executive Banmali Agrawala. Tourism, financial services and consumption are some other likely verticals.

120,2018-01-31,Coal India,"BHUBANESHWAR: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed Odisha to take “coercive action” against miners who failed to comply with the court’s orders to reimburse the state for violating environmental laws while extracting iron ore between 2000-2010. 

Leases of 44 mines, including those of Aditya Birla Group’s Essel Mining, Mideast Steel and Serajuddin now face cancellation. Senior legal experts involved in the case say leases could be revoked after a show cause notice granting them 60 days and if the dues are still not paid certificate cases can be filed against the defaulters.

Odisha, accounts for nearly half the country’s iron ore production. Last year, on 2 October, the SC held that a violation of environmental laws also amounted to illegal mining, and the state must be compensated for these excesses even if they had been condoned. Odisha expected to collect Rs 17,576 crore from 131 iron and manganese miners before the court-set deadline of 31 Decembre 2017.

These amounts reconciled with them represented a rationalised value of all ore they had mined between 2000-2010 in excess of their environment permits or without a forest permit. Seven operating mines, together amounting to 20mt of iron ore production had not been able to meet this deadline sending domestic steelmakers into panic about shortage of ore. By Tuesday the state had received around Rs 10,900 crore from 73 odd miners, including late payments from state owned Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha Limited (IDCOL) and Essel Mining.

Odisha has also been asked to collect a 12% interest on late payments. IDCOL, which operated a lease of Orissa Mining Corporation’s will now have to pay this interest but can run its mine. Essel Mining, which paid a part of its dues in the first week of January, however cannot. It had pleaded to be allowed to resume operations, but Amicus Curiae, ADN Rao pointed out that the court appointed Central Empowered Committee had recommended a cancellation of one of the firm’s three leases. The fate of Aditya Birla Group’s unlisted company will be decided after ten days when the matter is scheduled to be heard again.

Many have had to borrow to pay these sums, running into hundreds of crores, even though they are uncertain of ever recovering such amounts from their operations. One such mine owner, who asked not to be named, said he was not going to take a chance, even though his lease lapses two years from now. “We had never expected to be fined after having paid a royalty, duties and other taxes on mining that had been done under the supervision of the Indian Bureau of Mines and and state mining directorate,” he said.

This landmark judgement should have concluded a long debate on whether the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation ) Act allowed for extraction, within the leasehold area but in violation of other laws particularly environmental, to be considered illegal.

Yet, there are two views-- one says that the court’s interpretation of Section 21(5) of the Act is now the law of the land. The Mines Ministry at the Centre seems to think so and has asked all states to comply. Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh are among those that have made similar demands from miners in their states.

An opposing view is that the SC order was for ""compensation"" and not a ""fine"" and therefore applies only to the 131 leaseholder in Odisha party to this case, and not to other states or other minerals, such as bauxite and chrome. Naveen Patnaik’s government in Odisha and the BJP ruled Jharkhand have slapped notices running into thousands of crores on Coal India’s subsidiaries. State miner Coal India is contesting these claims."

2,2018-02-04,Coal India,"Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana will continue to hold his designation if the firm's new promoter, ONGC is to follow the Coal India Ltd-model for governance of subsidiaries.

ONGC last week completed acquisition of government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.

HPCL is now a subsidiary of ONGC and it has been speculated that Surana will lose the Chairman's tag and would be reduced to Managing Director who would report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.

Industry sources said this situation can be completely avoided if ONGC follows the Coal India Ltd's (CIL) governance model.

CIL, the world's largest coal producer, is the holding company whose board is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director.

It has eight subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, all of whom have a board headed by Chairman and Managing Director.

The Chairman and Managing Directors of the subsidiaries report to CIL head.

Sources said if this model is followed, Surana will continue as Chairman and Managing Director of HPCL who would report to ONGC head Shashi Shanker.

Prior to the stake sale, the government made it clear that HPCL would continue to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), retaining its separate identity and brand and will be independently run by its board.

The alternate governance model has been thrown just as a large section in ONGC feels that HPCL should be governed on lines of the company's other subsidiaries like ONGC Videsh Ltd, which have an independent board and a Managing Director or CEO as heads.

These heads of subsidiaries report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.

Last month, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker had stated that HPCL is ""a good, professionally-run company and will continue to remain so"".

Sources said ONGC is likely to revamp HPCL board in coming weeks.

Currently, HPCL board has four functional directors before the Chairman and Managing Director. It also has two government directors on board and six independent directors.

ONGC, they said, may look at nominating one or two of its directors on HPCL board.

Presently, ONGC has two major subsidiaries, ONGC Videsh Ltd and BSE-listed Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).

Both OVL and MRPL have Manging Directors and CEOs as head who report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director. On both the boards, ONGC directors have presence.

OVL Managing Director is a special invitee on ONGC Board.

Sources said following the CIL-model of governance would save Surana, who is senior to Shanker, the blushes of a designation downgrade."

4,2018-02-05,Coal India,"Aditya Birla Group’s flagship Hindalco Industries had its best financial quarter in the past nine years in the three months ended December, riding on higher LME (London Metal Exchange) prices, better realisation for every tonne of aluminium produced, and a lower leverage ratio after repaying some of its high-cost debt. “Hindalco will now be looking at growth opportunities in India while Novelis will seek to invest in China,” its managing director Satish Pai told Vatsala Gaur and Baiju Kalesh in an interview. Edited excerpts:


What is your take on the Budget, especially for the metals sector?
The overall theme of the Budget, with a big push for infrastructure investment, is very good for us. Markets for aluminium have started to pick up from November-December. January was strong. So when the projects on airports, roads and railways are implemented, it will be good for us. When (US president) Trump came to power and said that he would be spending on infrastructure, all metal prices went up. The only slight negative is when you put the extra 10% on the customs duty, some of our input costs will go up. But we should be able to manage with the price of aluminium and copper.


What can investors look forward to with better financial performance?
Realisation per tonne is going up because of the rising LME. Operating profit before tax (EBITDA margin) was 21.7% in Q3 of last year; this Q3, it was 22.3%. However, compared with Q2, EBITDA margin has been flat. Orders are coming and we witnessed sales growth. The market was up 10% and our sales were up 14%. In flat-rolled products, sequentially, sales were up 9%, wire rods sales went by 3%. January has been very good so far in Q4. LME is holding at $2,200 per tonne, so the macro is strong. Going forward, in the last quarter, input costs are going to go up another 2-3% because Coal India raised its price in January. So, if LME aluminium price is $2,200/tonne in the next quarter, we will be flat compared with Q3, but if it comes down to $2,100/tonne, the margins could go down a little.


Will you start investing now?
Now that our balance sheet has strengthened, we are starting to look at growth opportunities, but we will be extremely disciplined with our capital. We have already announced the Utkal expansion for ?1,300 crore. We did a copper rod expansion in Dahej and we will be doing some more downstream expansion in the coming months and have begun evaluating projects. The investment will be based on the merits of the project. For the next five years, I’m not too worried about the debt payment. The net debt to EBITDA ratio at Hindalco is 2.7x. Just 18 months ago, it was at 6.7x so I can take all the cash that we are generating, which is roughly around ?2,000 crore a year, over the next five years and put that amount in projects for the future. Majority of growth opportunities will be organic in India and will be brownfield, because we have enough sites all over India and adequate land in the right places. But we will still look at some places where it makes sense for greenfield as well.


What is the status of your engagement with the defence sector?
We are talking to Niti Aayog in the government as they need to work with us to put a plate capacity, which requires ?1,600-2,000 crore of capex. Just from our point of view, the volumes are too small to put that capacity. So we want them to either give us some orders or a contract for 10 years that they will buy this much from us or they co-invest with us. I think India and China are going to be the two largest producing countries for defence, if the government is successful in doing ‘Make in India’ in defence. This is why we are talking to Niti Aayog that if you are not careful your ‘Make in India’ may become ‘Assemble in India’. So, you should go one step below the plane or the tank and work with us to get the material ready. Defence in any country is a private-government partnership.


What are your plans of expansion for Novelis after you recently announced a greenfield expansion for auto lines in Kentucky in the US?
We are expanding the auto capacities at Novelis. Last quarter, we said we were looking to expand organically. We are doing the Kentucky (where Novelis would build an approximately $300-million automotive aluminium sheet manufacturing facility) first and we will do China next. We are looking at contracts, because we like to lock in some percentage of clients before we put the money."

""The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth,"" it said in its statement.

17,2018-02-07,Coal India,"In the last note it was mentioned about the high possibility of the market attempting to find a base and had expressed that market may remain bit volatile and still continue to oscillate in a range.

The benchmark Nifty50 enjoyed a relatively strong opening on Wednesday but gave up all of its gains and ended with a modest loss of 21.55 points or 0.21 per cent.

Going into trade on Thursday, there are high probabilities that the market may again enjoy a positive opening. However, sustenance of the good start, if any, and the behavior of the market vis-à-vis the levels of 10,500 will be crucial to watch for.

The levels of 10,590 and 10,630 will play out as immediate resistance area for the market. Supports come in at 10,450 and 10,410 zones.



The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 35.0248 and it has formed a fresh 14-period low, which is bearish. The daily MACD is still bearish as it trades below its signal line. On the candles, a black body emerged. In the present scenario, it does not result into any significant formation.

The pattern analysis shows that Nifty is making evident efforts to form a bottom in the present area. After occurrence of a big white body near the 100-DMA support area, the following session resulted into a higher top and bottom. However, it would be important for the markets to remain above the 10,500-mark to attempt any pullback.

The 10,480-10,500 zone represents an area wherein the Nifty struggled quite a bit in the last quarter of 2017. Therefore, while correcting from the recent highs, these levels are expected to lend support at some point of time. Therefore, the behavior of the markets against the 10,500-mark will be crucial.

For any technical pullback to occur, it would be important for the markets to remain above this mark.
A bullish divergence is observed on the daily chart over Stochastic. Though this cannot be read singularly in isolation, it certainly exhibits attempts by the market to find a base.

We reiterate continuing making select purchases with every corrective move while adopting a cautious view on the Markets.

19,2018-02-08,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal Vision 2030 has suggested that no new coal mines need to be allocated or auctioned beyond the current pipeline. 

According to the document the total capacity of mines allocated and auctioned, including Coal India, SCCL and Neyveli Lignite, as on date is about 1,500 million tonnes per annum at the current rated capacity. In view of the likely demand, there is limited requirement of starting new coal mines except the ones already auctioned or allocated.

In the scenario where actual demand is higher, focus could be laid on brownfield expansion of mines or re-rating of mines based on their parameters. Although there is limited business case for new mines in the immediate future, say 2022–25 horizon, it may be advisable to monitor the growth in coal demand and decide on new mines accordingly. 

In the short term, coal production is likely to be significantly lower than potential, although demand may be met. Majority of the mines currently auctioned or allocated (including CIL, SCCL) are scheduled to be completed by FY20. However, delayed clearances, land acquisition problems, R&R issues, evacuation constraints, etc., can delay materialisation of these plans. Based on the latest status updates, it is estimated that 33 per cent of the capacity is at risk of delay. Hence, the estimated coal production in short term, FY20–22, is 1,050MTPA, which is comparable to the demand. 

Production from captive mines is particularly at risk. More than 100 blocks have been allocated, auctioned or allotted, for captive and commercial mining till date. These blocks are estimated to have an overall capacity of 450–500 million tonnes per annum. 

Based on the current status of these blocks, it is estimated that captive or commercial coal blocks may contribute 90–170 million tonnes per annum by 2020. However, this does not exclude the possibility of coal deficit at consumers’ end driven by evacuation constraints, marketing policies and mismatch between regions of production vis-à-vis consumption. Coal mining companies need to ensure continuous monitoring and portfolio planning to avoid coal deficit."

18,2018-02-08,Coal India,"The supply of 371.8 million tonnes of coal by Coal India to the power sector in the last 10 months ending January has increased by 6.8 percent than the corresponding period last year, a senior company official said.

The state-owned miner also supplied 103.1 million tonnes of coal to the non-power sector in the April-January period of the current fiscal registering a growth of 8.8 per cent over the corresponding period last year.

This comes at a time when it has missed its own production target by 29.2 million tonnes.

The Coal India has produced 440 million tonnes of coal in the April-January period of the ongoing fiscal.

The CIL official, however, said the miner has a huge potential to increase its coal production in the peak period of the ongoing quarter and hopes to surpass the previous month's productions.

The current level of pithead coal stock is more than 34 million tonnes.

The official said various steps have been taken to increase the offtake and after sustained effort, an all time high rake loading could be achieved which was 300 rakes a day consistently in the last fortnight of January.

The average rake loading to the thermal power plant has also increased from a level of 209.8 rake per day in October, 2017 to 226 rake per day in February, 2018.

To boost supply to thermal power stations, a strategic decision was taken to ensure coal supply from pit head to power stations located within 50 kilometer by road.

The available rake from the circuit was utilised to supply coal to distant thermal power stations.

The CIL had to curtail production in two subsidiaries -- Central Coalfields, Bharat Coaking Coal -- in early FY17' due to huge lying stock."
21,2018-02-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Renewable energy will start replacing coal-fired power as solar tariffs are poised to fall below Rs 2 per unit in seven years and storage costs fall, while cheaper international supply can lead to imports of 20 million tonnes, posing a big challenge to domestic suppliers, a document issued by Coal India says.

The competitiveness of domestic supplies will be a challenge as costs such as wages rise, according to the document prepared with the help of a consultant hired by the monopoly to assess the future of coal in the era of plunging renewable energy costs and rising concerns about polluting fossil fuels such as coal.

The report, on which Coal India is seeking public comments, says that unless costly mines are retired and prices of coal corrected downwards, domestic supply may remain stagnant or even fall."

24,2018-02-11,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is likely to nominate one director on the board of recently acquired Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) while retaining all the present directors of the company.

ONGC late last month completed acquisition of the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. HPCL is now a subsidiary of ONGC.

Like its other major subsidiaries -- Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC is likely to nominate just one director on the board of HPCL, sources privy to the development said.

HPCL board currently has four functional directors besides the Chairman and Managing Director. It also has two government nominee directors and six independent directors.

Sources said the Articles of Association of HPCL provide for the board to be made up of a maximum of 20 directors, including independent ones.

ONGC can, theoretically speaking, nominate more than one director but such nomination would have to be matched by an appointment of an equal number of independent directors, they said.

So, while ONGC can nominate 3 directors, it may eventually name only one, they added.

MRPL and OVL both have just the ONGC Chairman and Managing Director on their board which has Managing Director and functional directors.

Both the firms have government nominee directors and so the two government nominee directors on HPCL board would also continue, sources said.

Since HPCL by virtue of 51 per cent shareholding of ONGC, continues to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), its board members would continue to be appointed by the government.

Sources said the only question that remains is of the status of HPCL Chairman and Managing Director.

While ONGC's present subsidiaries MRPL and OVL are headed by Managing Directors with ONGC Chairman being the company chairman, there is a thought that HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana may be allowed to hold his designation and the Coal India Ltd (CIL) model for governance of subsidiaries is followed.

CIL, the world's largest coal producer, is the holding company whose board is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director. It has eight subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, all of whom have a board headed by Chairman and Managing Director. The Chairman and Managing Directors of the subsidiaries report to CIL head.

Sources said if this model is followed, Surana will continue as Chairman and Managing Director of HPCL who would report to ONGC head Shashi Shanker.

Prior to the stake sale, the government made it clear that HPCL would continue to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), retaining its separate identity and brand and will be independently run by its board.

The alternate governance model has been thrown as a large section in ONGC feels that HPCL should be governed on lines of the company's other subsidiaries like ONGC Videsh Ltd, which have an independent board and a Managing Director or CEO as heads. These heads of subsidiaries report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.

Sources said following the CIL-model of governance would save Surana, who is senior to Shanker, the blushes of a designation downgrade."

31,2018-02-12,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Reliance Power’s Butibori power plant will be able to scale up output after the Delhi High Court directed Coal India to immediately start supply of 1.23 million tonnes per annum of coal to the unit, the Anil Ambani-led company said on Monday.

The court directed Coal India to supply the coal contracted earlier with its subsidiary South Eastern Coalfields. Reliance Power had moved court last year, seeking early allocation of coal to this power plant in Maharashtra.

“After the directions of Delhi High Court, both units of Butibori Plant would be getting assured coal supplies from CIL subsidiaries under 100% fuel supply agreement and mitigate the uncertainties in supply of 600 mw quality and reliable power to citizens of Mumbai,” the company said."
30,2018-02-12,Coal India,"In order to boost coal supplies to power plants, the government has decided on various steps including the use of dedicated rail transportation and setting up of power projects only within 500 km from coal mines, sources said.

It has also decided that all power plants within 20 km from pit-head of coal mine will construct elevated closed belt conveyors within next 2 years.

The steps were finalised at a meeting headed by Power Minister R K Singh, said a source.

The meeting was held in the last week of January and the steps were firmed up in the presence of power secretary, coal secretary, chairman of the Central Electricity Authority, CIL's chairman and managing director and CMD of NTPC.

As per the estimates on the basis of power consumption growth, the requirement of domestic coal in 2018-19 would be about 615 million tonnes, which means that 288 rakes of coal per day would be required from Coal India Ltd (CIL), said the source.

According to him, as per the steps decided, plants within 40 km from pithead are mandated to construct MGR system within 3 years. The MGR or merry-go-round is a closed-circuit dedicated rail transportation system between the production and consumption points.

Similarly power plants located beyond 40 km and up to 100 km can consider MGR if they find it viable.

It was also decided that in future new thermal power plants, with the exception of extension projects, will be implemented only within 500 km of coal mine.

Sources said the minister noted during the meeting that as against a loading plan of 274 rakes, the average supply of rake by CIL was about 259 rakes per day from January 3-22.

It was also pointed out that the thermal power plants had outstandings of around Rs 9,000 crore.

It was decided to frame a policy so that outstanding dues should not be for more than 90 days."

25,2018-02-12,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is trailing global peers in operating performance and technology adoption, while taxes and freight constitute 25% and 34%, respectively, of the cost consumers pay, undermining the monopoly’s competitiveness, the company’s Vision 2030 document said.

However, the cost structure of the Indian coal sector is still favourable: it is estimated that the average cost of production is about `1,000 per tonne, and that cost of production is a concern for only about 10% of the output.

The state-owned company said that for coal transported over a distance up to 100 km, Coal India receives only 56% of the costs paid by consumers for procuring dry fuel.

Taxes, duties and levies are about 34%, followed by freight at 10%. For transporting coal up to 500 km, Coal India receives 41% of the total payments made by consumers while taxes, duties and levies constitute 25%, followed by railways at 34%.

Beyond 1,000 km, its realisation is about 32%, taxes duties and levies take away 20%, while the rest — 48% — goes to the Indian Railways. Although Coal India feels it produces coal at competitive rates, it is critical of its own operating performance.

“There’s a significant gap in productivity norms of similar class of equipment in mines in India and those around the world. For instance, similar class of shovels in international mines is operated 40-50% more hours annually than at Coal India.”

Equipment utilisation rates at mines operated contractually have been seen to be better than those operated departmentally by the monopoly.

“For instance, in Coal India subsidiary, Eastern Coalfields, in 2016–17, the utilisation rate of hired excavators was 93%, against 73% utilisation rate for departmental excavators. This requires much greater focus on operational excellence and asset management practices in the Indian coal mining sector,” its Vision 2030 statement said.

Added to this is Coal India’s option for adopting technology which is limited. The vision document said the sector is beset with relatively small scale mining with limited mechanisation and scale of equipment."

39,2018-02-15,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Often trailing their privately owned peers for most of the year, stocks of government companies become star buys as the financial year draws to a close. The reason? Dividends.

Historically, February and March have seen companies pay higher dividends. With North Block needing to balance its books, high dividend budgets and cash in hand make profitable PSUs the best bets in the spring.

This year, Coal India and Hindustan Zinc may give higher than expected dividends in the next two months. In the first ten months of the fiscal, the government has received only 5 per cent of the budgeted dividend income for 2017-18. Coal India, ONGC, Hindustan Zinc (HZL), NMDC and NALCO together accounted for more than half of the government’s dividend income last year. However, with the recent ONGCHPCL merger and capex requirements of Nalco and NMDC, the burden will likely be on Coal India and HZL.

Although promoted by Anil Agarwal, the government still owns about 30 per cent of HZL. It has been paying heavy dividends for the last two years – dividend pay-out ratio was 150 per cent and 144 per cent in the last two fiscals. Thanks to the strong cash flow generating business, the cash and equivalents with the company in the end of September 2017 was 15 per cent of the company’s market capitalization despite such high payouts in the past. A 100 per cent pay out this year implies over 7.5 per cent yield at the current market price of Rs 308.5. Further, the outlook for the company is positive with rising demand for zinc and improving production volumes.

Coal India has seen 117 per cent dividend payout on an average for the last four years. A similar payout implies a 6.4 per cent yield at the current price of Rs 307.5. Also the cash with the company is almost 20 per cent of its current market capitalization, pointing to higher dividend payouts in case of a shortfall in the budgeted income. The outlook also appears strong for the largest coal producer with analysts expecting near 20 per cent earnings growth in FY18-FY20.

With about Rs 7,000 crore in cash, leading iron producer NMDC’s cash balance is 16 per cent of its market capitalization. In three of the last four years, NMDC has paid over 50 per cent profits as dividends and 171 per cent in FY16. The company may not be able to give such a high dividend payout, given the capex requirements for its 3 MT steel plant. But a conservative 50 per cent payout ratio implies that the stock is trading at 4.7 per cent yield at the current price of Rs 133.

Aluminium producer NALCO’s Rs 2700-crore cash is about 20 per cent of its market capitalization. It has paid dividends of up to 100 per cent of its earnings in the past. However, with its Rs 6,300-crore capex requirement to set up the alumina refinery, it may not be able to give such high dividends this year."

Decks Cleared for Mining by Private Players The private sector will soon be able to mine coal and sell it to power plants, steel mills and other users, ending the decades-old monopoly of state-run Coal India (CIL) and its affiliates, marking a long-expected reform aimed at boosting investment and output. The move could lower prices and imports while introducing better technology, apart from saving on foreign exchange and improving energy security. The coal sector was nationalised in 1973. The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) approved the methodology for auctioning coal blocks for commercial mining by the private sector. 


Stringent Law to Check Ponzi Schemes, Unregulated Deposits ProposedThe Union cabinet has approved a new law to ban unregulated deposits to prevent duping of gullible investors through Ponzi schemes and approved changes to the chit fund law. The government plans to introduce Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018 and Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill, 2018 in Parliament. The bill provides for complete prohibition of unregulated deposit taking activity and prescribes deterrent punishment for promoting or operating an unregulated deposit taking scheme. It provides for stringent punishment for fraudulent default in repayment to depositors.


First Big Arrest in PNB Fraud
Trouble is mounting for Punjab National Bank (PNB) with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) widening the probe into the Rs11,400 crore fraud at the lender to include the top brass. CBI said 10 more officials of PNB, including the bank’s executive directors, were being questioned, without giving out their names. Meanwhile, yesterday CBI arrested Vipul Ambani, the president (finance) of Nirav Modi's Fire Star Diamond along with executive assistant Kavita Mankikar and Senior Executive Arjun Patil in connection with the first FIR registered by the agency.


Delhi Admin Plunges Into a CrisisThe Delhi administration plunged into a crisis on Tuesday as the city's top bureaucrat alleged that he was assaulted by ruling AAP MLAs in front of Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia at the chief minister's residence in the national capital, a charge rubbished by the party as 'bizarre'. Matters turned worse as Delhi Police registered an FIR based on the complaint of Anshu Prakash, even as the force did not name anyone in it. 


Ind-Ra Revises Outlook on Infra to Stable for FY19 Rating agency Ind-Ra has revised the outlook on infrastructure sector to stable for the next fiscal on signs of improvement in projects. The infrastructure sector is showing signs of stability, although pockets of stress still linger, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in a statement. The outlook for telecom has been revised to negative-to-stable from negative. The outlooks for thermal power, oil and gas, power, ports and airports remain unchanged,"" it said in a statement. 


COAI Slams Trai for Biased Rules on Predatory Pricing
India’s older carriers have slammed the telecom regulator for a series of regulations over the last 12-18 months which favour only new entrant Reliance Jio at the cost of the existing ones, and said the latest tariff order on predatory pricing violated the ‘fundamental right’ of incumbents to carry out business. In a statement Tuesday, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) called on the government to urgently intervene. COAI members, except for Jio, will decide over the next few days whether to move court against Trai’s amendment to the Telecom Tariff Order (TTO).

53,2018-02-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The private sector will soon be able to mine coal and sell it to power plants, steel mills and other users, ending the decades-old monopoly of state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) and its affiliates, marking a long-expected reform aimed at boosting investment and output. The move is also seen as lowering prices and imports while introducing better technology, apart from saving on foreign exchange and improving energy security. The coal sector was nationalised in 1973.

The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) on Tuesday approved the methodology for auctioning coal blocks for commercial mining by the private sector.

Allowing the private sector to enter coal mining is expected to lift supplies and moderate prices while boosting investment. Non-state coal mining had thus far been allowed only for captive use. The Coal Mines Special Provision Act 2015 provided for opening up commercial coal mining to private and public entities. The government had in 2016 awarded coal blocks to state mining corporations for commercial mining. Coal India and its affiliates account for about 80% of total coal output.

The government will hold forward auctions to select developers for commercial coal blocks.

“The auction process will be transparent like in the case of captive coal blocks and will be based on the amount companies agree to pay as auction fees per tonne,” coal minister Piyush Goyal told reporters after the cabinet meeting. The two-stage bidding will start with the invitation of technical bids and there will be no end-use or pricing restrictions on the commercial coal blocks, he said.

He said the cabinet decision was the most-awaited reform in the coal sector and will help bring in new foreign technology and investment while raising coal output, reducing imports and saving foreign exchange.

Coal secretary Susheel Kumar echoed Goyal’s sentiments. He said the objective of the reform is to improve productivity and sustainability. The revenue earned from the auctions will go to the states where the coal blocks are located. Goyal said it will lead to energy security as 70% of India’s electricity is from thermal power plants.

The auctions will end the government monopoly in the coal sector and improve Coal India’s efficiency, he said. The government is in the process of identifying a few large and mid-sized coal blocks for auction for noncaptive purposes and is yet to fix timelines, Goyal said.

“The auction will be an ascending forward auction whereby the bid parameter will be the price offer in rupees per tonne, which will be paid to the state government on the actual production of coal,” a statement issued by government said. “There shall be no restriction on the sale and/or utilisation of coal from the coal mine.”

Industry welcomed the move and said the government should learn from earlier auctions and shift focus from earning revenue to raising output.

“The government decision to auction coal blocks is indeed historic. This will invite many Indian and global companies to participate in the auction and further invest in India. It is a great step towards further liberalization of Indian economy and will give boost to employment generation and eradication of poverty,” said Anil Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta Resources.

“Looking at the emerging coal shortages--it is a step in the right direction,” Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said. “However, the outcome would depend on the conditions governing the auction process. We hope the government will learn from the earlier auctions and make regulations conducive for competitive and sustainable price discovery. The objective of auction would need to shift from revenue maximisation to productivity and sustainability.”

Khaitan & Co. partner Vanita Bhargava said the move will ease availability of coal and stabilise prices."
58,2018-02-21,Coal India,"Recently in Davos, an exasperated GM Rao, chairman of the eponymous infrastructure conglomerate, was seen telling his old friend, Anil Agarwal of Vedanta, that after putting in $7 billion to build a sizeable power portfolio, he has learnt life’s lesson the hard way.

Most of his coal-fired plants generate meagre returns, far lower than what was originally envisaged a decade ago when private developers — both first generation entrepreneurs like GMR, GVK or Lanco and pedigree groups like Tata, Reliance and Lanco — were swayed by the India infrastructure story and chased megawatts.

Therein lies the irony. India has one of the largest reserves of coal but annual production from monopoly miner Coal India (CIL) has not been enough to feed the guzzling needs of an industry as diverse as power plants, steel mills, cement and fertiliser units.

The 43-year old stranglehold is finally coming to an end. In line with the Modi government’s stated policy of auctioning natural resources, the government opened up the sector to commercial miners.

From Gautam Adani to Agarwal, some of our biggest conglomerates have been jostling for this much-needed reform to meet their own needs and start mining for others. Key users such as Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Hindalco, Tata Steel or Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Group have been hankering for security of supplies, hamstrung by Supreme Court’s cancellation of mines and volatile commodity prices.

“This is bold reform,” said Anil Agarwal, chairman, Vedanta. “Opening up the sector will increase domestic and FDI as well help in stabilising irregularities in coal supplies and linkages. Some of the most evident benefits of this measure would be enhanced energy sufficiency for India and availability of power at lower costs for the end consumer. Also, thousands of jobs will be created in the process.”

CIL ex-chairman Partha Bhattacharyya compares these reforms with those in life insurance, where private insurers compete with behemoth LIC of India.

The multiplier effect will also be immediate. “Power generators can source commercial coal to improve margins and availability.

Further, as merchant power prices fall, utilities and manufacturing industry too benefit from lower energy costs,” argues Kameswara Rao, partner and leader, energy, utilities and mining at PwC. Stalled or stranded power projects account for nearly 50 gigawatts (GW)of electricity production capacity, or roughly 15% of India’s total of more than 300 GW. Close to 10,000 MW of coal-fired plants have been mothballed due to lack of coal supply and that made power the second largest contributor to the ballooning bad debt situation in the country. Finally, developers can hope for a revival.

“Owners of distressed assets will no longer worry about uncertain fuel supplies and can contract with commercial coal suppliers to revive projects. On a broader note, we will see industry consolidation, rise of large vertically-integrated energy companies with interests in coal mining, generation, transmission and distribution to retail supply,” Rao adds.

Non-regulated sectors such as cement and steel have a greater dependence and ability to pay and could dominate initial auctions. Captive power producers too can corner a lion’s share, especially in states with high cross-subsidies in retail tariffs. Even in the middle of the prevalent narrative of renewable and clean energy, it is estimated that fossil fuel power generation will grow at a 7% compound annual rate in 2016-20, raising overall coal demand to about 985 million metric tonnes.



DEVIL IN THE DETAILS Nonetheless, a lot will still depend on the fine print. The nature of blocks that are auctioned, their reserves and methodology of the auction process all matter.

“This will be contingent upon the nature of blocks that will be offered to merchant miners, and risks inherent in large mining projects including issues in land acquisition. Therefore, coal production from commercial mining in the next two to three years is unlikely to be significant relative to India’s current coal production levels,” says Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president and group head, corporate sector ratings, ICRA.

The government has not identified which blocks will go under the hammer; auction will be held on the basis of rupees per tonne of coal produced.

Commercial coal production was nationalised in 1975, when coal mining was taken over by the Centre and monopoly CIL was formed. It remained the Centre’s prerogative till February 20, 2018.

CIL’s mandate has been to meet the nation’s demand for coal. In fact, coal meets 55% of India’s primary commercial energy requirement. (See, Fueling The Economy). At least 70% of power generated takes coal as fuel while Coal India contributes 82% of coal produced in India. Rest is from Singareni Collieries — a relatively smaller public sector coal producing company — and captive coal mines.

But Coal India has always been accused of sloth and inefficiency. The unions, aware that they may not be able to compete when private companies move in, are predictably up in arms, fearing salary cuts or worse — job losses.

“We will go on an indefinite nation-wide strike if necessary,” thunders SQ Zama, secretary general, Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation, under INTUC, one of the central sector unions at Coal India.

“A Coal India workman receives an average salary of Rs 40,000 per month, while their counterparts in the private sector, who work under contractors, receive between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 as salary per month. Coal India pays adequate attention to the safety of workers and offers their wards free schooling and medical facilities,” says Zama.

In fact, at the open cast mines of Coal India subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields, cost of extraction by its CIL workmen is around Rs 600 per tonne while the same — when outsourced — comes to around Rs 400 per tonne. “The difference is basically labour cost,” says a senior Coal India executive, who did not wish to be identified.

Large companies that are into mining coal in India as operators or have their own captive mining include the Adani’s, Reliance and GMR — all of these companies operate at costs that are less than CIL’s cost of production. “We use large equipment and latest technologies.

Labour cost is less than 10% and comes to around Rs 50 per tonne,” points out an executive from a private mining company that operates as a contractor for CIL. His firm has been a key mining development operator (MDO), brought in to boost Coal India’s production.

An executive f rom another large private company, on condition of anonymity, broke it down further, saying their labour cost varies between 5% and 22% of total outgo, depending on thickness of the layer of topsoil needing to be removed to extract coal.

“As an MDO, we need to quote costs that our customers find attractive. This we achieve through multi-tasking. An individual who is a mining engineer can double up as a supervisor and a technical guide. Use of better technology also keeps costs low. Average cost of production for mines that need heavy overburden removal is between Rs 600 and Rs 650 per tonne — way lower than CIL,” says a senior executive from the company.

“The difference between a private operator’s cost and Coal India’s cost is basically labour cost, efficiency, higher productivity and offering lower margin for having one contractor for all activities on turnkey basis,” he adds.

Coal India’s management is aware of these legacy challenges and has been actively pursuing ways and means of bringing down costs. A majority of CIL’s 2.98 lakh workmen employed in underground mines were inherited when the company was formed. It is now planning to close down some 100 such mines that are unviable.

“We have successfully brought down cost of production by almost Rs 54 a tonne in the third quarter of the current financial. This has been despite a rise in salaries of workmen and executives in 2017, which increased outgo by Rs 400 crore a month,” says Gopal Singh, Coal India chairman.


TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE? For the end users, privatisation is expected to make coal sourcing easier. “Both prices and quality are expected to be reasonable due to competition being introduced in the sector,” says Subhasri Chaudhuri, secretary general, Coal Consumers’ Association of India.

She feels logistics may improve, resulting in lesser environmental impact and consumers would be able to procure coal suitable to their requirement.

Yet, doubts linger among some private players. “Blocks that would be on offer are likely to be the ones given away by Coal India because they had no plans of operating them. These are the ones likely to be auctioned for commercial coal mining.

Most of these blocks are difficult ones — in that they are either in densely populated areas or have difficult terrain. Some have coal seams buried deep underground. Cost of operations on these blocks is likely to be high,” cautions a senior executive from a large mining company.

Bhattacharyya echoes the view, saying that blocks’ mineable reserves need to be at least 40 million tonne for production to be assured over a number of years.

He also did not agree with the auction model. “Tender conditions for selecting the winner should be on the basis of core competence and proven expertise.

Auctioning blocks solely on the basis of price may not lead to desirable results.

We need to learn from our experiences.” The reverse auction methodology for captive mines has not been successful, with most private players outbidding each other and then relinquishing licence.

“In the absence of a strong regulator, such auctions may bring back issues faced by the industry during the pre-nationalisation era, which saw major exploitation of reserves and workmen in unethical ways,” warns Bhattacharyya.

According to Niladri Bhattacharjee, partner, strategy & operations, mining & metals, KPMG in India, private commercial miners may end up producing a maximum of 100 million tonne by 2025.

“Some 30 MTPA of capacity has been allocated to state mineral development corporations and that capacity too will come onstream in a few years. This will be approximately 8-10% of the size of coal PSUs, assuming there is no drastic change in market structure,” he says.

“What remains to be seen is whether involvement of commercial coal miners will make the bids more reasonable. Bidding parameters too may need some finetuning for mines without a mine plan,” says Bhattacharjee.

A senior executive from a Delhi-based coal mining outfit says, “For extracting 1 tonne of coal, 5 tonnes of top soil needs to be removed from a majority of these blocks. Producers may find it a tad difficult to match prices of the same quality of coal offered by Coal India from nearby mines after adding royalty and cess.”

States too will seek their pound of flesh in royalties and bid conditions for value addition in the region, much like ferrous metals. After adding these, CIL’s competitive edge may still remain.

Volumes growth and cost reduction from commercial coal development should also keep import prices in check.

However, the need is to auction out the larger and more lucrative blocks in sufficient numbers to meaningful new investment."
57,2018-02-21,Coal India,"Live and let live. That appears to be Coal India's latest mantra, which feels competition is good in the long term and the user will be the ultimate beneficiary. 

Post Cabinet decision on commercial mining, CMD Gopal Singh asserted that the competitiveness of the mining giant will not be hurt by emergence of private players a wee bit.

He does not see any threat to Coal India's 80 per cent market share and believes that the move only will take care of the yawning demand gap. Since power demand is growing by up to 7 per cent every year, there is enough opportunity for both state-owned firm and other commercial miners to raise production and supply. 

The government on Tuesday cleared the auction methodology for the private sector, thus paving the way for commercial mining. The move is seen to foster more transparency and lead to greater ease of doing business. 

Speaking to ET Now, Singh said increasing the coal capacity through commercial mining is a policy decision and a good step in the interest of the nation as there will be more players competing with each other. Right now, Coal India is the sole major player.

India, the CMD said, is targeting a very high GDP, and the first parameter naturally will be electricity availability at a reasonable cost. Coal India being the largest producer is ready with an aggressive plan to meet any rise in power and coal demand in future. 

On whether Coal India will be participating in coal auctions or not, he said the company will analyse and take a call as and when auctions are conducted."
59,2018-02-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Domestic market is likely to see a positive opening on Thursday on poor cues from global markets. Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 41.50 points, or 0.40 per cent, lower at 10,360.50, indicating a negative opening for the Nifty50 in India. Here is a list of top stocks that are likely to be in focus in today's trading session.


Titan, Grasim & Bajaj Finserv: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan will be added in the Nifty50 with effect from April 2, the IISL said. 


Ambuja Cements, Aurobindo Pharma & Bosch: The existing three Nifty50 stocks will be excluded from the benchmark Nifty 50 with effect from April 2. 


Tata Steel, Bhushal Steel: The consortium of lenders to Bhushan Power & Steel has asked Tata Steel to waive a certain condition in its offer for the company and rejected a late bid by the UK’s Liberty House, people briefed on the matter said. 


Gitanjali Gems: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has revived a nearly-forgotten investigation against Gitanjali Gems and its promoter Mehul Choksi for alleged manipulative trades in the wake of the fraud at Punjab National Bank.


IDFC Bank: IDFC Bank plans to more than triple its branches in urban areas to about 90 by Oct as it shifts its focus from rural areas for the first time. The bank, part of infrastructure finance firm IDFC, is looking at opening 80 new branches over the next six months, along with expanding the network of micro ATMs and business correspondents in a bid to increase coverage area. 


Religare Enterprises: Price Waterhouse (PW) is in the line of fire over its auditing of Religare Enterprises, after the financial services company’s new auditor said its predecessors had submitted an “unmodified” report. When an auditor files an unmodified report, it is certifying that the company’s financials were fairly and accurately presented.


Titagarh Wagons: Edelweiss has a ‘buy’ rating on Titagarh Wagons with a target price of Rs 154. Upcoming opportunities in coaches, defence and propulsion systems augur well for the company, the brokerage said. While overseas businesses may face near-term challenges, the domestic segment is primed for strong growth, it said. 


Reliance Industries, Adani Group stocks: Adani Group and Reliance Jio Infocomm led a clutch of Indian corporates who committed investments in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. The chairmen of the two groups announced investments of Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore, respectively, at the UP Investors Summit. Other corporates like Aditya Birla Group (Rs 25,000 crore), Mahindra Group, ITC and TCS too committed to invest in the state


Rollovers in focus

 As per brokerage Edelweiss Securities, stocks such as Coal India, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki and Vedanta will be in focus on the F&O expiry day. Here's what the brokerage said on the stocks:


Coal India: At 35 per cent, Coal India 
rollovers are lower than expected. Akin to the trend seen in last expiry, dividend expectations have led to futures trading at a discount to cash, the brokerage noted.

""The stock has seen reverse arbitrage positions (sell cash and buy futures) being set up. With the street expecting a hefty dividend payout, the counter is rolling at -645bps (cost to short roller). With the expectations of dividend in the next month, long future holders will opt to buy the inventory in the VWAP,"" the brokerage said. VWAP stands for volume weighted average market price. 


Vedanta: At 52 per cent rollovers on this counter too are low. A total 21.9 million shares are outstanding in the near month, which is 2.1 days' average daily volume in cash the market. With the street sensing dividend in Mar or April, Edelweiss expects long future holders to convert the positions to cash. 


ICICI Bank: At 44 per cent 
rollovers, the counter has fresh arbitrage positions (buy cash and sell futures). Roll levels in the counter are 39 basis points (profit to short rollers) which is lower. If levels don’t pick up, we expect short rollers to sell cash in the VWAP, the brokerage said. 


Maruti Suzuki: Fresh arbitrage positions (buy cash and sell futures) have been set up. Roll levels in the counter are 48 bps (profit to short rollers) which is lower. If levels don’t pick up, we expect short rollers to sell cash in the VWAP, Edelweiss Securities said. The counter has seen 52 per cent 
rollovers so far."
60,2018-02-22,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group : Although cement demand has historically been better in the March quarter, large cement manufacturers with more than 15 million tonnes of capacity may not report any material rise in operating profit margins.

This is due to their inability to increase product prices in the first two months of the quarter. In the nine months to December 2017 quarter, their margins were 15-30 per cent depending upon the reach and pricing power.

The demand strength from the real estate, individual home builders (IHB) and infrastructure segments plays crucial role in price trend. This time around, demand from the real estate and IHB segments has been weak thereby curtailing major increase in cement prices.

While demand from the infrastructure segment has been stable, it accounts for just over one-fifth of the total cement demand.

It may not significantly offset the slowdown in real estate, which forms nearly two-thirds of the total cement consumption. Within housing, rural housing accounts for 30-35 per cent of the demand, and the rest is owing to urban housing.

Besides weak demand, cement companies are facing higher input costs. In the second half of 2017, prices of petcoke, imported coal and diesel rose sharply. In January 2018, Coal India increased price of linkage coal, which would add to the cost of cement production.

Despite higher raw material costs, companies have been unable to raise prices on sequential basis, unlike in the past when there was a price increase during the March quarter.

Except in the eastern region, cement prices have been range-bound in rest of India. Low-cost housing is driving demand in the eastern region. The average all-India cement price has not moved up from the December quarter levels of Rs 285 per 50 kg bag. In the eastern region, cement price is 3-10 per cent above the all-India average.

Investors will be better off by enhancing their exposure to large pan-India companies such as UltraTech Cement, ACC, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and The Ramco Cement. These companies will be able to raise sales volumes once the demand picks up given their size and geographical reach."

62,2018-02-23,Coal India,"On the eve of the ET Global Business Summit, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Rare Enterprises, gives his views on LTCG tax, PSU banks, his investing paradigm and why he does not invest in start-ups.Edited excerpts: 

What should one do now -- invest or go for profit-booking?This stock market is like a buffet! There are so many dishes to eat. But do not do that. I would not advise anybody who is not a professional investor to try and invest himself. The best way to invest is through mutual funds. Investing is a complex procedure and requires a lot of professional help and monitoring. The best way is to use mutual funds via SIPs. It may sound very boring because India is basically on a bull run, the economy itself. If you invest all the time, you will invest at an average point. 

I think this bull market in India and Indian stocks is going to continue but I do not know for how many decades! The basic reasoning is the economy is growing at 7%-8%, at any given time. Once India’s economy grows in double digits and we have 4-5% inflation with 15% nominal growth, I cannot say the equity valuations will not ride at 15% to 18%. Somewhere., it may be more and somewhere, it may be less. You should invest for extended periods of time.


Everyone talks about the winners. No one talks about the losers, right?Some things are best kept quiet.


 On interest rates, your view is it is likely to rise and combined with that, there is this long term capital gains (LTCG) tax which has been introduced. Both are potential deflators of equity valuations?I do not agree that long term capital gains tax is a deflator because all the alternative sources of investment have a higher tax rate. . LTCG tax is capital gains plus STT. The company that has got 20% debt is fully taxed. So the person who is investing in equities, comparatively, is not at a disadvantage. Of course, I would have liked it very much if he had not imposed it. I will be a large payer of the taxes but the tax is not death, it is only trouble. It is not going to deter any serious local money. Foreigners, I do not know. It could deter them because a lot of them are used to not paying taxes. Interest rates in India are likely to hover around where they are. Internationally, I do not anticipate more than three rate rises in America which is expected and I do not think we will see much inflation.


Another concern is around the whole private investment and capital expenditure issue. It is often said that while government is investing, private sector is not investing. What is your view and how are you seeing that impact growth?The increase in private investment is a process. It is a journey, not a destination. In 2002-2003, the total private sector investment in the economy to GDP was about 27%. It went to as high as 34-35% in 2008. Today is it at 27-28%. For the next three-four years, this will improve and reach 35% and it is not going to happen in a year, it is going to happen slowly. 

We made a lot of mis-investment and over investment between 2010 and 2014. Investment is coming in steel, commercial vehicles, chemical units now.

If demand comes back, I do not think capital will be a constraint. The process of regeneration of private sector investment has already started. How fast it grows is a matter of opinion. Tata Steel has recently announced investment in expansion of 5 million tonnes, Volvo is talking about expanding its vehicle capacity. Chemical capacity in India is doubling. I do not see why it is going to be slow. You cannot keep an economy like India at 27% of GDP for long. It is 46% of GDP in China and that is continuing for 15 years. Affordable housing likely will give a big boost to investment in India and will give a boost to cement, steel and other industries. The government is really making efforts to see that the affordable houses are meant both for political gains and for actual economic ones.


""We Should Not Have More than 3 or 4 PSU Banks""
Another key issue is the banking sector. It is the development activity driver and with recent developments in this sector, what has changed?Banks are ""of the people, by the people and for the people"". But it has become more for Nirav Modi and little is left for us. I feel it was unfortunate that we had Mrs Gandhi as the prime minister. She institutionalised corruption. Till Shastriji's time, corruption was looked down upon as a taint. She institutionalised it. She nationalised our banks, insurance and the coal industry. Just just one week ago, the government has undone the nationalisation of the coal industry, not by selling Coal India but by allowing the private sector to come into this sector. 

Sooner or later, as long as we have the political will and we will get the political will after what has happened in these two scams; there is also a wave of public opinion that the public sector banks should be sold. Now nobody is going to buy them in the present state. The aviation minister just said: ""I am surprised that there is no 
bakra (patsy) to buy Air India! That is how he described it, a guy who buys Air India will be a 
bakra. That is what your aviation minister has said, not me!

So there is likely to be no buyers for those banks today. Unless you consolidate the PSU banks into just four banks, I do not know what sense it makes. You have to consolidate all the PSU banks into three or four banks and you will have to sell all of them. According to me this is going to happen, in the next five years. 

There is no dearth of capital for good projects. Tata Steel does not have a problem in borrowing money. It is good that these scams have come out and the NCLT is a very good mechanism. Earlier, these banks would charge 18% interest to Bhushan Steel; Bhushan Steel would say give me the money to pay the interest and they charge the interest. This continuous process will stop and better days will come for banks. As an Indian, I can only hope so.


Jhunjhunwala: What do I look for while investing?
What are the three things most critical to you when you decide on an investment?The most critical decision is price, value because while it is important what we buy, it is more important at what price we buy. In 1999, I bought 55% of United Spirits and United Breweries for Rs 6 crore. If I had held those shares today, the value of that investment would be Rs 2000 crore. Everybody told me, you cannot make any money with Vijay Mallya, he is a thief, his companies have never earned money! But I thought I am getting 55% of India’s liquor industry at a valuation of Rs 100 crore that means the entire liquor industry in India was being valued at Rs 200 crore. I thought it was ridiculous and I made money, I made at least 15 times my money in three years. 

So, the most important thing is not what you buy it is at what valuation you buy. What I look at first is size of the opportunity. You can grow only as much as your opportunity. Infosys could become such a large company only because of the advent of the internet and humungous application of software. When Infosys was formed, the internet was never there. So the opportunity for Infosys expanded multifold.

Colgate can grow as much as the demand for toothpaste in India. So, what is very important is the size of the opportunity. Then in any capitalist society, any company has to have a competitive advantage to be able to tap that opportunity. Mastek and Infosys were born on the same day, they had the same advantages, the availability of engineers in India. Look at where Infosys is and what Mastek is today. You have to look at the competitive ability and for every entrepreneur here, there is one very important word -- scalability. 

 A friend of mine asked me whether I should invest in the large-caps of the small-caps, I said I will invest in the small-caps, which will become the large-caps and the biggest problem in scalability is opportunity and capital, the fact that entrepreneurs do not want to give up power and the nature of the business model. 

You know what is the working capital cycle, what is the capital intensity and then the integrity of the people. And you know I do not over-analyse. I decide on an investment in one hour and if I think it is good value and there is liquidity, I invest. When I invest, I am very uncertain, there is nothing sure.

A lot of investments test your patience and you doubt whether you have made a wrong investment. I made a very large investment in Escorts over a period of two years. I made the investment at Rs 125 and everybody would ask ""
why 
Escorts? Oh, those thieves! Forget about them. That company is going downhill. I bought the shares at Rs 125 and today the price is Rs 850. But for two, two and a half agonising years, because I was the only buyer and everybody doubted my decision. It is a matter of conviction, patience and luck and that is very important.


""Entrepreneurship Is Too Popular to be Profitable""
You have seen a lot of great businesses being built. A lot of new entrepreneurs are coming up. Do you see those businesses being threatened by what is happening? Do you see that those businesses adapting?I have very negative views, so please do not mind them. I do not see those businesses being threatened. I am worried about emotional entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship is too popular and what is too popular is good to be with but not always very profitable. I get so many proposals for investments, but where is the differentiator? Second, most of these ventures start with ""father-in-law’s"" money. I start with a loss but the greater the loss, the greater the valuation! ,I do not know what kind of mathematics is this. I cannot understand anything and it is also a matter of attitude. 

When I start with the idea that I incur a loss and build a business, where are the economic efficiencies? Do I go with the idea that I must create efficiency first and remember that the world’s great businesses have never been built with investors money? I do not believe so. I have the right to be wrong. I do not believe valuation of any Uber or any stock because I do not know that economic model. When I keep incurring a loss of $15 billion or $10 billion a year, that means I am subsidising my customer. I will know my true consumer when I charge the true price. I am living in a capitalist society. So I don't believe this whole scheme of entrepreneurship with two ideas and father-in-law’s money.

An entrepreneur is someone who would do something which the world says is not possible. I am an entrepreneur. When I came to the stock market in 1985, my father said you will be back in two years and my mother said who will marry you? Societies need entrepreneurs and societies can only develop with entrepreneurship. But while you have to dream with the head held high, your feet should be on the ground. I do not invest in startups. When Flipkart was available seven years-eight years ago, I did not understand these companies. Forget what Flipkart will need to do to become profitable, the question is if he increases the prices, will the customer remain? So I do not know the business model. 

Look at D-Mart. When Mr Damani started it, it was profitable at first. Right now, the prediction is he will die and Flipkart will succeed. I do not understand but entrepreneurship is a great idea where you have to have your feet on the ground and head held high. You should yourself understand that and not do anything that is me-too. I will give you one advice. Do not invest in any B2C companies. You want to invest, invest in B2B because B2B can be scaled up. Invest in some parallel technology which is very difficult in India. Look at Cisco, there is a culture to acquire companies ther. In India, there is no such culture. 


""Do Not Carry Leverage Beyond A Point ""
You have a trading book and an investing book. With regards to the investing book, two related questions are at any point in time if you look back and average about how many holdings do you have? Also, when you choose to eventually eliminate from the investment book, usually what might be the reason that you would choose to eliminate it -- valuation or something else?The first answer is that I carry leverage but I do not carry leverage beyond a point. So, if for any reason, I need to bring down my leverage, I might sell. Second, if I have a better investment opportunity and need capital, I might sell. These are the primary two reasons why I will sell. If I feel that an investment is horribly overvalued -- and you know investments are like children you do not feel like that easily -- then only, I sell. 

At the moment I think in the unlisted book -- three investments will be 80% out of maybe 15 investments I have made. And in the listed book, may be five investments will total 60%, and total number of investments would be 20-25."

71,2018-02-25,Coal India,"The government may in the near future scrap the present system of allocating coal mines for captive use and instead only auction mines for commercial use to private as well as foreign companies with a view to boosting domestic product and cutting imports, a top official said.The move, which would not just help attract foreign investment but also bring in efficiency and promote competition, follows government's decision of opening up the coal sector to commercial mining by private entities.""We can also take a decision that in future only commercial mining will be done.... things are evolving, we will see. One experience is there of end-use auctions. This will be another experience of commercial mining auctions. So we will see and compare whatever is better for the country in the longer term,"" Coal Secretary Susheel Kumar told PTI in an interview.The Cabinet had last week approved auctioning of coal mines to any firm bidding the highest per tonne price. At present, private sector firms are only allowed to mine coal for use in cement, steel, power and aluminium plants. Coal India Ltd (CIL) is the sole commercial miner with 80 per cent market share.Terming commercial mining a ""full-fledged reform"" in the coal sector, the secretary said the government is evaluating whether it is advisable to go for end-use restrictions.""There is an idea floated by few people which we are examining whether it is advisable to go for end-use restrictions because that is a half-hearted reform. It is not a full-fledged reform. Commercial mining is a full-fledged reform so that is something which we are evaluating and whatever is in the best interest of the country will be done,"" Kumar explained.Stating that the country was slowly moving towards free market in the coal sector, the secretary said CIL ought to improve its efficiency else it ""will not be in the market.""On deadline for commercial mining auctions, the secretary said : ""Our expectation is that we will complete the process of auction by March 2019.""He however did not divulge the number of blocks to be put for bidding in the first tranche.The government had in 2014 auctioned 29 mines to private players and states for capital use in power, steel, aluminium and cement plants.

74,2018-02-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Spot power prices in India have increased almost a rupee per unit since April last year mainly because of higher e-auction price of coal, reports ET.

Prices at e-auctions rose almost 16% while spot power rates increased 18% in the first nine months of the current fiscal. Coal India sold 18% more coal at the auctions. Many independent power producers buy coal auctioned by Coal India, and their generation cost depends on the price at the e-auction. 

“As coal prices are on the rise, they are quoting higher prices for the power they intend to sell,” said Rajesh K Mediratta, director-business development at Indian Energy Exchange.

2,2018-03-01,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Power plants are facing coal shortage and developers foresee a decline in generation as some projects are operating with no or just one day’s coal stock. However, the coal ministry has sought to allay such fears by saying that the situation is being closely monitored by top officials in the ministries of power, coal and railways.

The problem has aggravated with near record imported coal prices forcing closure of some of power plants including Adani Power’s 2,000-mw Mundra project. Coal secretary Susheel Kumar has said there is adequate coal available but unavailability of rail rakes is an issue. The power ministry has said that coal supply has not kept pace with electricity generation, while the coal ministry has said that the staterun monopoly Coal India has been meeting its contracted obligations. 

“The situation is critical, with about 11 plants operating with less than seven days’ stock and 14 with less than four days’ stock,” power secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla told ET.

“Average stock in coal plants is 15 million tonnes, which is about 10 days’ requirement. In some plants, coal stocks are of one day or less. Despite efforts, growth in delivery to power plants has not kept pace regularly,” he said.

Some plants, he said, have not been able to maintain adequate stocks amid working capital issues due to delayed payments from power distribution companies.

The coal secretary said there is no coal shortage. “There is enough coal and absolutely no need to panic. This year there is tremendous increase in demand. Coal stock at pit head was 68.69 million tonnes at the beginning of this fiscal. The lowest the coal stocks have hit is 29.20 million tonnes in November last year,” Kumar said.

“Similarly the lowest coal stock availability at thermal power plants was 7.3 million tonnes in October last year, which has now increased to 15.15 million tonnes. The situation is much better now, though I would not say it is completely satisfactory.”

Kumar said the government is aiming at 21 days’ stock of 30 million tonnes at the power plants and the ideal situation would be to have additional 30 million tonnes at pit head. 

“Although dispatches have increased from Coal India compared to last financial year, the stock level which we would like at the thermal power plants is still to be reached,” he said."

10,2018-03-06,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Centre’s move to allow private sector to commercially mine coal will boost both production and mining efficiency. Substitution of imported non-coking coal with domestic production could save roughly Rs 30,000 crore of coal imports, CRISIL has estimated.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) recently approved the methodology for auction of coal mines and blocks for sale of coal in the open market. Under this, the highest bidder will be given mining rights and there are no restrictions on end-use.

At present, about 94% of the mining is being done by government-owned entities Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries Company. India still meets a fifth of its annual requirement through imports, despite recent increase in domestic coal production, which costs about Rs 1 lakh crore.

“Participation of private miners would increase much-needed competition, enhance productivity by facilitating use of latest equipment, technology and services through higher investments,” sai8d Crisil in a statement.

Considering that almost half of the domestic coal reserves of 300 billion tonne, mostly non-coking coal, still remains unallocated, commercial mining can have far-reaching impact.

Sachin Gupta, senior director at CRISIL Ratings said: “Coal imports, especially of the non-coking variety, should reduce once the proposed regulatory changes to admit private sector companies in coal mining materialises. It will help the country come closer to its vision of producing 1.5 billion tonne of coal annually by 2022.”

Power, cement and steel will gain the most being the largest consumers of non-coking coal. In 2017, India imported 150 million tonne of non-coking coal at Rs 59,000 crore. As much as 90% of this was for imported-coal-based power plants, independent private thermal power plants and captive power plants. For imported-coal-based power plants, coal imports will continue due to their specific requirements.

Nonetheless, imports by independent thermal power plants and captive power plants can be substituted, once commercial mining picks up. These accounted for nearly 50% of the non-coking coal imports which can potentially result in import bill saving by Rs 30,000 crores.

As for coking coal, the benefits are moderate because India has limited reserves of this fuel, and imported about 40 million tonnes for Rs 41,000 crore last fiscal.

Nitesh Jain, director at CRISIL Ratings said: “Commercial mining can ensure sustained coal stocks for industries, especially power. This can support the credit profiles of thermal power generators, which are currently facing risks of inadequate fuel.”

Benefits of increased private participation in coal mining, will, however, depend on faster environmental clearances, availability of adequate evacuation infrastructure. Prudence will also be required from bidders to ensure successful commercialisation of India’s largest natural resource Crisil has, however, warned."

23,2018-03-13,Coal India,"Kolkata: India’s daily average spot electricity price has nearly doubled over the last one month and is close to Rs 5 per unit, according to executives of India Energy Exchange, the country’s biggest electricity exchange.

On Monday, the average price for evening peak was Rs 7.7 per kilowatt hour—one the highest in recent times. A price of Rs 5 per unit is a six-month high. It had last crossed Rs 5 per unit in September, when power plants were facing coal shortage. “Daily average price declined gradually after September as the coal supply situation eased. Since then the price had remained subdued, at least till February, with sudden spikes though it did not touch Rs 5 per unit,” one of the executives cited earlier said.

“This time, the reason for spiralling price is a mix of rise in power demand, outages of a few large power-generating units in Gujarat and Haryana as well as inadequate coal supply to certain plants,” said Rajesh K Mediratta, director of business development at Indian Energy Exchange.

According to him, independent power producers who use imported coal, light up their units only after high prices sustain for a few days. “We expect them to light up their units and start offering power at the exchanges in a few days, following which we hope prices will soften again gradually,” Mediratta said.

According to power sector executives, Gujarat and Haryana are states that have been hit by unit outages. Some units in these states have stopped generating as their tariffs are not supporting their cost of generation.

“Some 4,000 mw of generating capacities are off grid at the moment. This has added to the power supply shortfall,” Mediratta said. Data furnished by the Central Electricity Authority shows that coal stocks at 25 power generating stations are at critical level.

These units are, however, non-pit-head plants, meaning they are far from the mining pits and require the railways to supply coal. Data shows that 14 units have coal stocks that would hardly last for four days, while another 11 have stocks that would last a week.

Apart from these 25, there are other generating stations that are facing coal shortage. However, they are not considered critical because they have either received near full quota of Coal India or had missed out on deliveries in the past."

ET takes a look at five high dividend paying companies and details their near-term outlook.


Coal IndiaCMP: Rs 297.50
YTD Change : 16.3%

Coal India, which produces 84% of India's overall coal production, is trading at attractive valuations. Motilal Oswal believes that concerns about grade slippages and wage hikes are now behind for Coal India and that the company will remain key to electricity generation growth in India. “Valuations are attractive at 5.6x FY20E (estimated) EV/EBITDA and 5-8% dividend yield,” said Motilal Oswal in a note dated February 21.


NMDC

CMP: Rs 123.65
YTD Change (%): -9.8%

Analysts say the company continues to generate cash which should ensure that dividend payouts also remain high. “Total dividend declared for FY17 was Rs 5.2 per share translating into a dividend yield of 4%. Dividend yields would remain attractive at 4% levels over FY19/FY20,” said Antique Stock Broking in its recent report. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 186 on NMDC.


ONGC
CMP: Rs 184
YTD Change : -7.4%

More analysts are positive on the stock than a year ago. Bloomberg data showed 31 or 83.8% of the analysts tracking ONGC have a ‘buy’ recommendation on the company, compared to 18 or 48.6% a year ago. “Rising crude oil prices, growth in oil & gas production, and declining opex led by cost efficiencies place ONGC on a strong footing,” said Motilal Oswal in a recent note. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock.


Rural Electrification Corporation
CMP: Rs 126.85
YTD Change : -23.8%

Most analysts are bullish on the stock, according to Bloomberg data, which showed that 9 of the 15 analysts tracking Rural Electrification Corporation, have a ‘buy’ rating on it. Edelweiss expects a dividend payout ratio of 27.7% for FY18. “Despite NIM pressure, as incremental spreads are lower with structural improvement across power value chain, it (REC) has potential to deliver 14-15% RoE, rendering favourable risk-reward,” said Edelweiss in a February report.


NTPC
CMP : Rs 170.75

31,2018-03-13,Coal India,"The flexible use of domestic coal by power plants has resulted in savings of Rs 646 crore in the April-February period of the ongoing fiscal.

""Indicative savings due to aggregation of linkages is Rs 645.77 crore (Provisional) for coal supply during current (financial) year up to Feb'18,"" an official source said.

The government had earlier relaxed norms for utilisation of domestic coal and said that the move will help bring down the cost of power generation by 40 to 50 paise per unit and eventually lead to yearly savings of up to Rs 30,000 crore in the next 4-5 years.

""After aggregation, GenCo (generation company) based coal indicative average price for calculation of incentive has been taken as Rs 1,182 per tonne,"" the official source said.

Under the flexibility of utilisation of domestic coal, power utilities have the flexibility to use their coal in any of the power plants.

In this regard, all the states and central power utilities have signed supplementary agreements with Coal India and its arms for aggregation of their long-term coal linkages.

Many state/central power utilities have also started implementing the scheme by utilising their coal in their more efficient power plants, the Central Electricity Authority had earlier said."
30,2018-03-13,Coal India,"Final hearing in Cairn Energy Plc's challenge to a Rs 10,247 crore retrospective tax demand raised by India will begin in August in The Hague, the British firm said today.

The three-member international arbitration tribunal ""has stated that it will make appropriate arrangements to progress with the drafting of the award as expeditiously as possible after the final hearing,"" the company said in its preliminary results announcement.

Cairn had initiated an international arbitration after Indian government in 2014 used a two-year old law to raise a Rs 10,247 crore demand on a decade old internal reorganisation of the company's unit in the country. The 2012 law gave the government powers to impose taxes retrospectively.

""International arbitration proceedings are well advanced with the final hearing of Cairn's claim under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty scheduled for August 2018 in The Hague,"" the company said.

Following the draft assessment order of January 2014, the tax department attached the company's residual 9.8 per cent shares in its erstwhile subsidiary, Cairn India, and confiscated USD 104.7 million dividend it was due to receive. Also, a Rs 1,590 crore income tax refund was also confiscated.

Billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group had acquired Cairn India from the British firm in 2011. The company has since merged with Vedanta Ltd, in which Cairn Energy now holds about 5 per cent shares.

""In addition to resolution of the retrospective tax dispute, Cairn's request for relief to the arbitration panel is seeking damages equal to the value of Group's residual shareholding in Cairn India Ltd in 2014 plus further assets seized since (approximately USD 1.3 billion),"" the statement said.

The company said while it is restricted from selling the shares in Vedanta Ltd, title to the shares remains with the company.

Giving a chronology of events, Cairn said its direct subsidiary, Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) in January 2014 received notification from the Indian Income Tax Department that it was restricted from selling its approximately 10 per cent shareholding in Cairn India Ltd (CIL), which at that time had a market valuation of Rs 6,000 crore (USD 1 billion).

""In that notification, the tax department claimed to have identified unassessed taxable income resulting from certain intra-Group share transfers undertaken in 2006, such transactions having been undertaken in order to facilitate the IPO of CIL in 2007,"" it said.

Following the merger in April 2017 of CIL and Vedanta Ltd, CUHL's shareholding in CIL has been replaced by approximately a 5 per cent shareholding in Vedanta Ltd, which are attached by the tax department.

At December 31, 2017, the market value of CUHL's equity and preference shares in Vedanta Ltd was together Rs 6,840 crore (approximately USD 1.1 billion).

""In addition to attaching CUHL's shares in Vedanta Ltd, the tax department has seized dividends due to CUHL from those shares totalling Rs 670 crore. It has also notified Cairn that a tax refund of Rs 1,590 crore due to CUHL as a result of overpayment of capital gains tax on a separate matter in 2011, has been applied as partial payment of the tax assessment of the 2006 transactions,"" the statement said.

The Rs 10,247 crore is the principal tax due plus there would be applicable interest and penalties.

""Interest is currently being charged on the principal at a rate of 12 per cent a year from February 2016, although this is subject to the tax department's Indian court appeal that interest should be back-dated to 2007. Penalties are currently assessed as 100 per cent of the principal tax due, although this is subject to appeal by CUHL that penalties should not be charged given the retrospective nature of the tax levied,"" the statement added.

Before the arbitration panel, Cairn is pleading that ""the assurance of fair and equitable treatment and protection against expropriation afforded by the UK-India Treaty have been breached by the actions of the tax department, which is seeking to apply retrospective taxes to historical transactions already closely scrutinised and approved by the Government of India.""

The department has attached and seized assets to try to enforce such taxation.

""Cairn's plea is therefore that the effects of the tax assessment should be nullified and Cairn should receive recompense from India for the loss of value resulting from the 2014 attachment of CUHL's shares in CIL and the withholding of the tax refund, which together total approximately USD 1.3 billion,"" it said."

34,2018-03-14,Coal India,"The government has ramped up coal supply to ramp up buffer stock at thermal power stations in anticipation of electricity demand shooting in line with the weatherman's prediction of an early and hot summer this year.

Latest coal ministry data shows 16 power stations, or 14%, of the 112 coal-fired power plants monitored by the Central Electricity Authority have received fuel supplies in excess of their 100% requirement. Data shows the level of excess supply reaching as high as 200% in one case, while remaining between 104% and 163% for the remaining 13 stations under this group.

There are 28 other power stations, or a quarter of the monitored plants, that are getting supplies well in excess of their 'trigger level' - which ranges between 75% and 90% - of the annual contracted quantity of coal tied up from state-run Coal India Ltd. 

The push for increased coal supply is aimed at avoiding a repeat of last year's situation when coal demand spiked as thermal plants raised output to bridge shortfall in generation from hydel, wind and nuclear sources.

In the August-September period of 2017, nuclear generation fell 36%, wind 14% and hydel 12%. Supplies from Bhutan also dropped. This supply gap was met by coal-fired plants, which saw generation rising by 17% as plants spun at 58% of capacity against 52% in August 2016.

This had led to coal demand rising by 20 million tonnes. Coal India raised despatch by 21% but it still proved inadequate because power demand spiked with rising humidity and a prolonged dry spell.

Since then, the coal and railways minister Piyush Goyal has initiated several steps to ensure adequate coal stocks at power stations, some of which are still operating with low fuel stocks due to various reasons. Coal India is despatching 8% more coal than it did a year ago, loading 308-310 rakes per day to wheel 1.8 million tonnes (mt) of the fuel daily. Coal India's production has also gone up to 2 million tonne a day and is set to increase further to 2.5 mt in the remaining days of March."

35,2018-03-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Rationalisation of sources of coal for power plants under public sector units has resulted in annual savings of `3,354 crore, Parliament was informed on Wednesday.

“Coal India has rationalised sources of coal supply to thermal power plants of PSUs to the tune of 30.46 million tonne on the basis of requests received from them. They have resulted in annual potential savings of `3,354 crore,” Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said in a written reply to Lok Sabha. 

In order to optimise transportation cost, an inter-ministerial task force (IMTF) was constituted by the coal ministry for a comprehensive review of existing coal sources as also feasibility for rationalisation of the sources.

The task force recommended rationalisation of existing sources on case to case basis for 19 thermal power plants of PSUs (public sector undertakings). “ This has resulted in rationalisation of sources of 24.238 MT of coal. In addition, an agreement was signed between Gujarat State Electricity Corporation (GSECL) and NTPC for swapping of 1 MT of domestic coal with imported coal,” the minister said.

Further, the government has permitted flexibility in utilisation of domestic coal by allowing central/state utilities to use the fuel in such power plants to achieve overall reduction in cost of generation. 

In addition to the above, it has been decided that all power plants located within 20 km from pit-head shall construct elevated closed belt conveyor within next two years (up to April 1, 2020), Goyal said. “It is also decided that power plants located within 40 km from pit-head shall construct MGR (merry-go-round) within three years (up to April 1, 2021),” he said."
37,2018-03-15,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal-fired power generation has registered a 4.37% growth during the April-February fiscal, compared with 5.47% in the previous corresponding period. Analysts, however, are predicting an increased capacity utilisation in the subsequent months.

“With robust industrial production numbers indicating definite signs of industrial recovery and early onset of summer in many parts of the country, electricity demand is going to shoot up in the coming weeks. This is already reflecting in hardening spot power prices. After years of under-utilization, finally thermal power plants can hope for better days ahead,” said Debasish Mishra, partner, Deloitte India.

During the same period, capacity utilisations of coal-based power plants have increased marginally to 60.06%, from 59.27% in the previous corresponding period, and higher than the target for the period which was pegged at 58.31%.

According to power sector executives, the rise in capacity utilisation has been the result of a lower capacity addition this year than last, and a marginally more than the anticipated rise in demand till now.




Between February 2017 and February 2018, total coal-based installed capacity monitored by Central Electricity Authority increased 5,280 mw to 1,87,461.5 mw. In contrast, between February 2016 and February 2017, total coal-based capacity monitored by the Central Electricity Authority increased by a large 12,660 mw and stood at 1,82,181.5 mw.

Nevertheless, during April 2017 and February 2018, private sector thermal power companies registered a 1% fall in power generation while the central sector managed a 6.16% generation growth followed by the state sector generation companies at 5.37% growth. Private sector independent power producers also managed a 2.09% growth.

While, power companies are witnessing low capacity utilisation, between April 2017 and April 2018, the nation could not meet 2% of the total reported demand for power --around 3,314 mw.

During this period, total reported peak period demand for power was 164,066 mw while total demand met was 160,752 mw. This, however, includes all power generation sources, including renewables.

According to an executive from a power generating company, fall in capacity utilisation has also been the result of coal supply logistics issues. A bunch of power generation companies did not order adequate coal when demand for power had dwindled last year. As demand for power rose later, they started to ask for more coal. However, logistics issues led to less coal being supplied as it was not possible for the railways to boost capacity overnight.

Nevertheless, a number of power plants with critical coal stocks has almost doubled from a shade over 10 last month to about 21this month as railways have started to witness increased demand from industries with the onslaught of its busy season.

Coal India executives feel the situation is likely to improve after March this year when load on railways from non-coal sector starts to reduce.

According to data released by the Central Electricity Authority, 9 plants have stocks that would not last a day, while another 6 and 11 plants have stocks to run them for one and two days, respectively. In all, there are about 52 plants with stocks varying between zero days and six days."
36,2018-03-15,Coal India,"KOLKATA: One of the largest trade unions in India has decided to approach the Supreme Court to contest the government’s decision to allow private companies in the coal sector, saying the move will lead to job losses, lower salaries and loss of market share for Coal India.

The Indian National Trade Union Congress said it won’t participate in a strike called by four other central trade unions at Coal India next month because it plans to seek political support from non-BJP parties against the government’s move. State-owned Coal India accounts for more than 80% of the country’s coal production.

The Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Hind Mazdoor Sabha and All India Trade Union Congress served notice on Tuesday for observing a day’s strike on April 16 to protest the opening up of the coal sector to commercial mining and sale without any restriction.

“A day’s strike will serve no purpose at the moment. We have already started consulting lawyers on the issue and we would definitely move the Supreme Court against the government’s decision,” said SQ Zama, secretary general of the Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation under INTUC. “The Centre had assured us that Coal India’s interests would be protected. However, allowing commercialisation effectively means turning back on its own commitment.”

INTUC members at Coal India will work on April 16, Zama said. “We are against commercialisation and opening up of the coal sector to private players and to begin with, would be observing a day’s strike on April 16,” said BK Rai, representing workers on behalf of BMS at Coal India. “It would be a token strike, while further course of action would be decided on the basis of the government’s reaction to the move.”

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the opening up of commercial coal mining for the private sector last month, calling it the most ambitious reform in the sector since it was nationalised in 1973. There will be no restriction on the sale and utilisation of coal. The decision is expected to bring efficiency into the coal sector by moving from an era of monopoly to competition. 

The unions oppose commercialisation primarily because of high wage costs at Coal India – 55% of the state-owned miner’s cost of production is on account of labour compared with 25% for private companies. Workers at Coal India get an average salary of Rs 40,000 amonth while their counterparts in the private sector receive at most Rs 20,000 a month. The unions fear Coal India will not be able to compete with private miners on a cost basis.

“Workers at Coal India receive the best salaries along with social security, medical reimbursements, retirement compensation and cashless treatment after superannuation to some extent,” Zama said. “Workers in the private sector are denied such benefits. This is why our cost of production is high. They will exploit workmen, sell coal at lower costs and would eventually kill Coal India.”

Coal India’s net sales were Rs 75,600 crore ($11.7 billion) in 2016-17, when it produced 554 million tonnes of coal, according to the company’s annual report. According to Zama, the problems faced in the pre-nationalisation era will return if private companies are allowed to mine coal and sell it in the open market."

41,2018-03-16,Coal India,"The domestic equity market in Thursday’s session headed nowhere for major part of the trade, while remaining in a capped range.

However, closing trades were more sluggish than expected, as the Nifty ended the day with a loss of 50.75 points or 0.49 per cent, while adding fresh short positions.

The market will consolidate and spend more time subdued before it prepares itself to move past the 100-DMA levels.

Nifty is likely to see quiet to mildly positive start on Friday. However, Nifty is neither expected to move past 100-DMA, nor it is likely to breach any major support area.

Friday will see the levels of 10,395 and 10,475 playing out as immediate resistance for the market. Supports will come in at 10,345 and 10,275 zones.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 44.8813, and it continues to remain neutral showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stays bullish, as it continues to trade above its signal line. No significant formations were observed on candles.

Pattern analysis reveals the credibility of the resistance area of 100-DMA as the Nifty has resisted those levels. Also it has established the support zone of the 10,275-mark followed by the 200-DMA.

At present, it continues to trade in a rectangle formation, which translates into a broad trading range. All in all, it is all likely that the Nifty continues to oscillate and consolidate a bit more before it prepares for a fresh up move.

In this process, the support of 10,275-mark will be critical area to watch for. The F&O data, which continues to show addition of shorts, reiterates the limited downsides for Nifty.

Also, taking into account the performance of the broader indices and sector indices, it is evident that the market continues to exhibit positive bias.

We reiterate avoiding shorts in the present scenario. Minor downsides cannot be ruled out, but overall, this will be nothing more than some more consolidation, which is ultimately likely to resolve itself with a directional bias on the upside.


STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh long positions were seen in stocks such as IDFC Bank, Coal India, REC Ltd, DLF, ICICI Bank, L&TFH, Arvind, Nalco, Asian Paints, Equitas, Reliance Power and Bharti Infratel.

46,2018-03-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Dues of power plants to Coal India increased to Rs 12,300 crore at the end of February from Rs 9,000 crore in May last year, prompting officials of the state-run monopoly miner to request the power ministry to intervene and help recover the amount.

At a recent meeting with power ministry officials, Coal India executives said that the miner’s priority was to more than double coal inventory levels at power plants to 30 million tonnes from the present level of 14 million tonnes but they requested that the ministry should impress upon power plants to clear the dues at the earliest. According to the minutes of the meeting, the dues had continued to rise even as it was earlier proposed that outstanding dues be cleared within 90 days.

A senior Coal India official said that the dues had been on the rise because power companies had not been receiving their dues and were in turn unable to settle the due of Coal India.

As per fuel supply agreements between Coal India and power companies, coal is supplied on cash-and-carry basis. However, supplies to states and central generating companies are not regulated due to intermittent payment constraints.

Nevertheless, it was decided at the meeting that coal supply to the state and central generating companies may be regulated corresponding to the current payment if undisputed outstanding dues are more than 90 days’ equivalent coal values, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The ministry said at the meeting that efforts should be made by coal companies and railways to improve coal supply to the power stations so that power stations have sufficient coal stock to meet their requirement and build up their stock to the levels that there is no shortage of coal during the next monsoon season, between June and September 2018. Coal India and the railways plan to jointly load 332 rakes a day till March-end. Of this, power sector would be getting 274 rakes per day – 220 rakes from Coal India sidings, 25 rakes from private washeries and 29 rakes from goodsheds.

The requirement of power companies for 2018-19 is estimated at 288 rakes per day. Of this 244 rakes would have to be from Coal India sidings, 24 rakes from washeries and 20 rakes from goodsheds.

The balance requirement of coal would be met from the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (53 million tonnes), captive mines (37 million tonnes) and from e-auction (12 million tonnes)."
47,2018-03-18,Coal India,"MUMBAI: The Association of Power Producers has accused the RBI of over-ruling the Parliamentary standing panel on power and key ministries with its February 12 circular that ended all the existing loan restructuring mechanisms and voted for insolvency code to resolve stressed assets.

The association has also sought a special dispensation from the Reserve Bank saying their defaults are caused mostly by non-payment/delayed payments by state discoms and regulatory delays coupled with poor coal supplies by Coal India.

The association claims that regulatory delays have resulted in pending payments worth Rs 7,800 crore, while pending receivables from state discoms stand at Rs 8,300 crore. Also state-run Coal India is meeting only around 60 per cent of its committed supplies.

In a March 12 letter to the RBI- exactly a month after the February 12 RBI circular extinguishing all the existing bad loan management mechanisms like the 5/25, SDR, S-4A, CDR etc forthwith- the association has requested Governor Urjit Patel to intervene and exclude the power sector from the purview of the new NPA resolution rules.

Indirectly accusing the central bank of over-ruling the House panel on energy and the views of the Union power and coal ministries, association director general Ashok Khurana says, ""The issue of stressed assets was discussed in depth with developers, bankers, regulators, and officials of power and coal ministries by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy.

""After hearing all the stakeholders, they've recommended that the revival schemes of the RBI or government should be realistic and not symbolic,"" Khurana says in the letter.

""Every effort should be made to see that the projects with huge investment do not become NPAs for want of marginal financial infusion or adjustment in the way of making working capital available for passing on the interest variable to the stressed asset,"" the letter further says quoting the House panel report.

The letter also notes that already there are over 75,000 MW assets- either under operation or under construction- severely stressed due to various reasons-- lower coal availability, lack of long-term/medium-term PPAs, divergence between policy and regulations on pass through of incontestable changes in law (pending regulatory receivables of Rs 7,800 crore), huge delays in regulatory orders, and pending receivables from discoms with pending bills at Rs 8,300 crore.

The letter lists three main factors for the stress in the private sector power sector.

""Three-four months of average delay in payment from discoms has resulted in around Rs 8,300 crore of receivables currently.

""Over two years of delay in receiving orders from regulators to pass on the increase in cost of coal due to various taxes and duties which are to be treated as 'change in law' and around Rs 7,800 crore are stuck due to this,"" the latter says and further notes that as against this, power developers pay in advance for coal, transportation and transmission.

Stating that 'a one-jacket-fits-all guidelines' of RBI will not work, the letter seeks sector-specific guidelines for different infrastructure sectors like energy, telecom, and steel as they have vastly different issues to be resolved.

""The system has to be tolerant of genuine difficulties, while coming down heavily on mismanagement and fraud,"" the letter said.

""We request you to issue special dispensation for power sector by relaxing the default clause from one-day delay in debt servicing and classify the asset as NPA only after the completion of 180-day period and submission of resolution plan should be initiated only after the 180-day period.""

That apart, resolution plan must note the regulatory/ government delays and so should be exempted from counting as defaulting period. Finally for those case already gone to IBC resolution, RBI must allow grandfathering/a 12-18 month grace period so that resolution and standstill benefit may be allowed to be continued till such period."

51,2018-03-19,Coal India,"Coal India is producing about 2.3 million tons per day whereas the offtake on best effort basis is about 1.9 million tons because of logistics, says Gopal Singh, CMD, in an interview with ET Now, Edited excerpts:


With the power sector facing a mountain of troubles and competition from private players, are you worried about slowing offtake?
When we talk about offtake of coal, there are two-three issues. One is of course the coal should be available at the mine head. Second is logistics, how much of this available coal can be transferred to the power plant and third is demand. Right now, there is demand and there is sufficient coal at mine head. 

As on date, if you look at stocks, it is 44.59 million tonne and the minimum level we had within this financial year was 29 million tonne. So, during last three-four months, we have added about 15.4 million tonne of stocks, an inventory which no company desires. But because we are not able to increase beyond say 1.9 million tonne because of the logistic issues and we have some commitment, we are continuing production though we are restricting it but at a respectable level. We are producing about 2.3 million tonne per day whereas the offtake on best effort basis is about 1.9 million tonne because of logistics.


Coal India has been unable to meet its output target for the last several months barring August and September and in February as well. So, Coal India missed the targets. Give us a reason why this is happening and when will things be back on track?
I don’t agree with the statement that Coal India is not able to meet the target. We have the coal and as I told you, offtake depends on three factors – coal availability, logistics and demand. Coal is available, demand is there but the logistics problem is always there. Coal is transported from the mines to power plants by road, belt conveyors, merry-go-round (MGR) track and rail. All the four modes have to perform right. After Mr Piyush Goyal took over, railways is doing its best. But in spite of that, we are facing evacuation constraint and we are adding to stock. So, this statement that Coal India is not able to meet the offtake target is not very correct one.


You have also decided on output as well as offtake targets. Where do they stand in FY19?
Some very good decisions have been taken by the government and that will really improve the offtake in financial year 2018-19. It was discussed and decided that all the power plants located within a distance of 100 kilometre from the mine head will take coal through roads. So this is one step which will really improve the offtake from Coal India mines and will help Coal India achieve its target. And this arrangement will continue only for next two-three years till the environment friendly measures are implemented at grassroots level. 

It has been decided that all the power plants located within a distance of 20 kilometres, will be establishing their belt conveyors and carry coal only through belt conveyors. The construction period will be about two years. Similarly, all the power plants located within a distance of 40 kilometres will be establishing their MGRs and the construction period will be three years.

Even the power plants located within a distance of 40 to 100 kilometres will be exploring the possibility of establishing the MGR and try to carry coal via MGR so that the railway capacity gets freed and railways are able to move the coal from mines to long distance power plants.

The power plants which are suffering the most are the power plants located at a far distance from the mines. This is the chemistry and because this has been duly deliberated and a conscious decision taken, financial year 18-19 will be really good.


Industry experts have also been saying that low output can also be attributed to rake unavailability. Is that true? Are you in talks with the railway minister about it?
Historically speaking, Indian Railways is doing its best. The number of rakes being loaded probably is the highest ever and because coal and rail fall under the same ministry, there is real synergy taking place. About 320-325 rakes are despatched every day. We have been in this sector for the last couple of decades. We never thought that so many rakes can be despatched but that is happening now.


What is the outlook on your pricing because the third quarter saw an almost 24% rise in the e-auction prices on a sequential basis. Prices are now only at about 20% discount to the import parity versus 30% a year ago. Do you expect the discount to narrow further?
If you compare with the imported price ex-port, it is much more than 20% because our priority is to supply the coal at the minimum price. The lesser the price of coal, lesser will be the price of electricity supplied to Indian nationals and that will really help the nation grow. We have always been trying to reduce our cost of production so that coal price can be low and in that we have succeeded. 

If you remember third quarter results of Coal India, we reduced our cost of production by Rs 53 a ton and there was a growth of 11% PBT. This was in spite of the fact that because of wage revision with effect from 1/7/16, we are paying about Rs 400 extra for the month on account of wages to workers. So, absorbing the Rs 1200 crore in the three months of third quarter, we could register a growth of 11% in PBT mainly because of reduction in cost of production by Rs 53 a ton. This effort will continue in the future and I am hoping that fourth quarter and henceforth, 2018-19 onwards, it will be much better.


Post a steep price hike in the month of January and the FSA price, what is the rise in the FSA realisations that you are expecting in Q4? We also witnessed some grade slippage in the previous quarter. Has that happened in Q4 as well?
We rationalised our prices from 9th of January. So, naturally there will be some gain to Coal India during this quarter and onward.


Come April, we understand the company will also be changing its pricing policy to one based on total energy content. How would this change things on the realisations front? It is expected that at least in the beginning, prices may actually see a drop?
We have taken that step to make the system completely transparent and simpler for everyone -- Coal India officers, employees or consumers. Whatever will be the gross calorific value (GCV) of the coal being supplied to the consumer, we will be charging on that basis. 

All the complaints that we have been getting so far regarding quality should be resolved automatically and it is a win-win for both the consumers as well as for Coal India because in this system there is a motivating factor for everyone, from colliery managers to consumers. If we improve GCV even by 10 kg cal, then there is an incentive for the mine managers and if the consumers get coal where GCV is lesser even by 10 kg cal, then there is incentive for them as well because they will have to pay less. This is a practice almost similar to the one being followed globally. 


A parliamentary panel has asked Coal India to assess its strength as well as weaknesses post the decision to open up coal mining. Could you highlight Coal India’s strengths and weaknesses?We have already started the preparation and the third quarter results are a reflection of that. We have been able to reduce our cost of production by Rs 53 a ton! If you look at the past, whenever there has been need, Coal India has always risen to the occasion. During September and October when nuclear, hydro, wind -- all sources of power failed -- and there was a challenge on meeting the electricity demand, then we supplied about 20% more coal to the power sector. We supplied 18% more coal to the power sector in October and thereafter the momentum continued."
52,2018-03-19,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Falling for a fifth straight session, the BSE benchmark Sensex hit over three-month low on Monday on heavy selling in metals and IT stocks, as market participants looked cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s meet on March 20-21.

On the other hand, NTPC, Power Grid, Maruti Suzuki, Hindustan Unilever and Larsen & Toubro gained between 0.90 per cent and 1.25 per cent.

Metal counters witnessed severe selling pressure, tracking losses in Chinese iron ore prices. The BSE Metal index cracked over 2 per cent to 13,550.30. Barring Nalco (up 1.82 per cent), other counters in the index closed in red. Share price of NMDC, SAIL, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Coal India tanked between 2.50 per cent and 6.50 per cent.

Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking said, “Weak global cues and caution ahead of the FOMC meet were weighing on the sentiment. We reiterate our immediate target of 10,000 for Nifty. We feel correction could be steep on broader front thus suggest maintaining extra caution in midcap and smallcap space.”

Chinese iron ore slipped to its lowest level since November 2017, as high inventory levels and a weak domestic steel market weighed on prices. Worries over the potential trade war between the US and China and frustration over US President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs also played spoilsports hurting investors’ risk appetite.

53,2018-03-19,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-run monopoly Coal India Ltd is considering floating a joint venture with the country’s top power producer NTPC to set up plants at mines that do not have transportation access and acquiring private stressed assets.

The two state-run companies have held talks and are in the process of finalising terms of the joint venture after which a memorandum of understanding is likely to be signed, sources close to the development said.

The proposed joint venture will look at setting up power plants close to mines that do not have coal evacuation infrastructure. “There are coal mines like Pachra and Sanghamitra in the Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) area that are read to produce but cannot be operationalised since there is no evacuation facility. The planned joint venture with NTPC will help set up power plants at mine mouth for optimum utilisation of the mines. A team from NTPC has already conducted site survey. The joint venture will also look into the possibilities of acquiring stressed private assets on the block,” a senior company official said. Coal India is sitting on a cash reserve of over Rs 40,000 crore.

An NTPC official confirmed the development. The contours of the joint venture are likely to be finalised soon, he told ET on the condition of anonymity. NTPC has in the last three months floated two tenders calling private developers and lenders to offer their stressed coal-based and hydro projects.

The company is evaluating three projects — Jaiprakash Power Ventures 1320-mw, Nigrie power project in Madhya Pradesh, Jaiprakash Power Ventures 1980-mw Bara plant and the 1,200-mw power project at Angul in Odisha promoted by Jindal India Thermal Ltd.

NTPC is also considering to be part of a proposed joint venture with Power Finance Corp and Rural Electrification Corp that proposes to bid for stressed assets that will go to bankruptcy courts.

While power plants with a combined capacity of about 20,000-mw are already at various stages of bankruptcy proceedings, the new norms of Reserve Bank of India on ‘Resolution of Stressed Assets – Revised Framework’ issued on February 12 that mandate banks to classify even one-day delay in debt servicing as default are expected to impact about 80,000-mw capacity."

“The issue lies with logistics including roadways, conveyor belts, and short distance railway lines,” said Coal India chairman Gopal Singh. “We are not being able to produce to fullest extent due to such evacuation and logistics issues,” he said. The latest available data from Central Electricity Authority indicated that 25 plants had critical stock position while average stocks for 113 plants monitored by CEA was enough for only about 10 days."

60,2018-03-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The country's coking coal import increased to 43.53 million tonne (mt) from 38.83 mt during the period April 2017 – February 2018, a jump of 12.10% over same period last year, according to mjunction, a leading e-commerce company. 

The trend highlights India’s dependence on imported coking coal that has been the concern for steel and power sectors. These sectors essentially depend on low ash content coal, which is not abundant in India. Low ash coal, which is used in blast furnaces and Basic oxygen furnaces of steel plants is thus largely imported from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa. 

However, the fluctuations in prices of imported coking coal often eats into the profit margin of steel industry players. Given the problem, the steel industry has been groping for a dependable solution to meet the growing demand for coking coal. 

To address the issue a day-long workshop was jointly organised by Steel Authority of India Limited and Indian Institute of Metals in Kolkata on Tuesday. The workshop titled - Coking Coal for Indian Steel Industry: Issues and Challenges, touched upon the issues and challenges pertaining to coking coal in steel industry for drawing attention of policy makers. 

Over 100 industry participants presented their ideas for augmenting supplies of Coking & Metallurgical Coal to the Steel Sector by improved coal washing. The workshop also focused on challenges in making quality coke to suit large capacity blast furnaces, and on the process development and blending in coal & coke making to enhance indigenous coking coal supply through beneficiation. 

N C Jha, former chairman (CIL), and Advisor (Coal)-SAIL inaugurated the workshop and delivered key note address, while Anjani Kumar, Coal Controller, and S K Basak, Executive Director (SAIL-Collieries Division) spoke on the occasion. The workshop was attended by delegates from SAIL, Coal India Ltd., TATA Steel, S&T Mining, CIMFR, IIT-Kharagpur, IIT-ISM & m-Junction Services."

58,2018-03-20,Coal India,"The metal pack is a bundle of nerves these days. Softness in Chinese ores, subdued global demand and the spectre of a full-scale trade war are giving investors the blues.

In fact, the selling in metal counters has intensified of late. So much so that it has wiped off nearly Rs 27,500 crore investor wealth in the just past four trading sessions. Market capitalisation of the BSE Metal pack narrowed to Rs 7.12 lakh crore on March 19, from Rs 7.39 lakh crore on March 13.

All components of the index, barring Nalco, lost up to 9 per cent during March 13-19. Nalco firmed up 5.65 per cent though. Tata Steel burnt its fingers the most, plunging 8.48 per cent, followed by Coal India, JSW Steel, NMDC, SAIL and Vedanta. JSPL and Hindustan Zinc declined over 3 per cent each. 

Market capitalisation of Coal India and Vedanta went down Rs 14,308 crore and Rs 4,962 crore, respectively, during the same period. JSW Steel, Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco, NMDC and Steel Authority of India witnessed an erosion of up to Rs 4,800 crore in their market capitalisation in the past four trading sessions.

A subdued demand of base metals is mainly at work. Chinese iron ore slipped to its lowest level on Monday since November 2017 as high inventory levels and a weak domestic steel market weighed on prices. Worries over the potential trade war between the US and China and frustration over US President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs too played spoilsport, hurting investor risk appetite.

During an interaction with ETNow, Deepak Jasani, Head, Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said, “The recent reversal in the metal prices has to do with the possibility of trade wars across the globe. In case, it materialises in a big way with all countries trying to put in barriers in terms of import duties or otherwise, then yes, the entire metal pack could go down. It will also result in a global recession kind of a scenario and I do not know whether the developed countries can afford to have a recession at this point of time. But till this fear is out of the way, metals could underperform for some more time and then probably take it forward from there.”

He added: “But given the fact that the economies globally have made some sort of a bottom last year and have started to see faster growth, metals could come back in favour after one or two quarters once this uncertainty is out of the way.”

DOMESTIC FACTORS
Back home, the exit of the Telugu Desam Party, a key ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party, from the National Democratic Alliance, combined with the BJP’s defeat in three by-elections, has dented market sentiment.

“With every election result, there is increased political uncertainty,” said Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. managing director Nilesh Shah.

“At a higher level, the market is pricing in a reform-oriented, stable government. At the lower level, the market is pricing in a coalition government.

The market trend will depend on the degree of uncertainty and this trend will be there all the way till the general elections in May 2019.”

Arush of initial public offers worth at least Rs 15,000 crore before the end of the financial year on March 31is also draining away some liquidity from the secondary market.

Market participants said the Nifty could test 10,000 if sentiment remains weak. Moreover, prices are still too high, some market participants said. “Valuations are better compared to when Nifty was at 11,000 but they are not attractive. Mid and smallcaps are still expensive,” said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India research at UBS.

The Nifty is trading at 16.7 times FY19 earnings, higher than the MSCI EM index, which is at 11.6 times. “On the lower side, earnings momentum will support the market,”

said Shah of Kotak Mahindra AMC. “The third quarter results offer comfort on that. On the higher side, upside in the market will be capped due to political uncertainty.”"

61,2018-03-21,Coal India,"Bhubaneswar | New Delhi: The Centre is preparing a legislative amendment to clarify the definition of illegal mining which has a direct impact on companies such as Tata Steel, Coal India Ltd and Steel Authority of India that are facing hefty penalties because of a Supreme Court order on a contentious section of the statute.

The Central government is considering retrospective changes in the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act (MMDRA), which will be put up to the cabinet this month after inter-ministerial consultation, sources familiar with the development said. The Supreme Court had ruled in August last year that violations of environment and pollution control laws in a lease were also to be considered “illegal mining”, which rattled miners because the penalty for this amounts to 100% of the output.

The verdict triggered penalties running into thousands of crores of rupees but officials say that Section 21 (5) under MMDR Act that dealt with illegal mining only provided for mining carried out outside, or in the absence of a lease.

“The interpretation of the term illegal mining has to be viewed in the right perspective. The MMDR Act is the governing law for all mining activities and Section 21 (5) describes illegal mining. But there is lack of clarity on whether the Act should deal with violations in environment norms, which are dealt by separate laws,” a senior government official said. “When mining has been carried within the permitted mining lease area, it cannot be termed illegal,” he said.

Section 21(5) of the MMDR Act reads, “Whenever any person raises, without any lawful authority, any mineral from any land, the state government may recover from such person the mineral so raised, or, where such mineral has already been disposed of, the price thereof, and may also recover from such person, rent, royalty or tax, as the case may be, for the period during which the land was occupied by such person without any lawful authority.”

Another official said the changes in the law would have to be retrospective. “Any change in a legislation is applicable from the date the law has come into force. Hence, the amendment will have retrospective impact,” the official said.

The proposed change in law is also expected to help Goan miners against a claim that Goa Foundation has already initiated. After the Supreme Court order against irregularities in mining activities in Odisha, the state issued notices to 131 mining leaseholders.

The state government has collected about Rs 12,000 crore as penalty from defaulting mining companies operating against a total of Rs 17,576 crore. The state has also decided to confiscate property of mining leaseholders who fail to pay their dues. About 50 mining leaseholders are yet to pay the penalties.

Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL), the Odisha-headquartered subsidiary of state-run monopoly Coal India Ltd (CIL), has been issued final demand notice by the state government for Rs 8,300 crore, a state government official said.

A senior CIL executive said the company has responded to the notice saying that verdict applies only to iron ore and manganese mines and spares coal mines.

In November 2010, acting on a CAG report, Odisha invoked Section 21(5) to slap recovery notices that pegged the excess in Odisha’s mines at around Rs 61,000 crore. The mines ministry appointed a commission led by former Supreme Court judge Justice MB Shah to investigate the “illegal mining scam”.

The apex court later revalued the unlawful mining to lower the penalties to over Rs 18, 000 crore.

Neighbouring Jharkhand has also sent notices to mining companies including three CIL subsidiaries imposing large levies.

Following the August 2 Supreme Court order, the mines ministry issued a directive to all states asking them to make sure they were in compliance."
62,2018-03-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Allocation of 11 mines to Coal India (CIL) arms - ECL, WCL and BCCL - will enhance its annual output by 225 million tonnes (MT), Parliament was informed today.

CIL has requested the government for allotment of additional coal mines to Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL) and Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) to make these subsidiaries 100 MT-plus as these arms do not have adequate coal reserves at present, Coal and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal told Lok Sabha in a written reply.

Considering the request of CIL, 11 coal mines have been allocated to CIL under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, and the MMDR Act, 1957, Goyal said.

""Addition of these 11 coal mines will add about 225 MT of coal in its annual production capacity,"" the minister said.

Five of these mines are in Jharkhand, of which three have been allotted to ECL and two to BCCL.

Of the remaining six mines, four are in Odisha and have been allotted to WCL, while the two in Bihar have been given to BCCL."
63,2018-03-22,Coal India,"KOLKATA: After a long delay of nearly six months, Coal India has started supplying coal to some of the 10 power plants that won long-term coal allocation at the first such auction held in September last year. Coal India would supply 27 million tonnes of coal annually to these companies.

“Respective CIL subsidiaries are in the process of signing fuel purchase agreements with all the successful bidders and we would be in a position to supply their allotted quantities to all bidders very soon,” Coal India chairman Gopal Singh said. “Supplies to some of the companies have already started.”

A senior power sector executive from one of the power companies said: “We received a letter of allotment in December and approached the Electricity Regulatory Commission in January for change in tariffs .

“ERC’s approval came within a fortnight, following which we approached Coal India again for signing the fuel-supply agreement. It has been signed recently and we hope deliveries to start soon,” he said.

The auction, christened Shakti (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyla Transparently in India), was for companies that had signed power purchase agreements with discoms, but did not have any long-term coal supply agreement with the state monopoly and bidding was on the basis of discounts on existing tariffs.

Following the auction, two Adani Power companies managed to secure a shade over one-third of the total coal auctioned by Coal India by offering discounts ranging between 1paise per unit and 3 paise per unit over their existing tariffs.

According to a senior Coal India executive, supplies to Adani has just commenced. Adani Power Maharashtra and Adani Power Rajasthan together secured supplies of 9.9 million tonnes of coal. It is to be supplied from South Eastern Coalfields’ Korba, Mand Raigarh, Korea Rewa mines, Mahanadi Coalfields’ Ib Valley, Basundhara and Talcher mines as well as from Western Coalfields and Northern Coalfields.

KSK Mahanadi Power managed to bag the second-largest volume of coal at 6.8 million tonnes from four mine sources. It offered a discount of 4 paise per unit for 4.5 million tonnes of G12 grade that would be sourced from SECL’s Korba and Mand Raigarh mines.

The third-largest allocation was made to Lalitpur Power Generation, which managed to secure 5.6 mt of coal from SECL (Korea Rewa), NCL, Central Coalfields, MCL (Talcher, Ib Valley and Basundhara mines) and ECLby offering discounts of 4 paise per unit, 3 paise per unit and 1 paise per unit for grades of coal that ranged between G4 and G13.

Others like GMR Kamlanga Energy secured 1.5 million tonnes of coal while GVK Power bagged 1.7 million tonnes.

65,2018-03-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India will adopt a new pricing system from April 1, which the company’s chairman said will be more customer friendly, transparent and aligned with global norms.

Coal India will start charging prices determined on the basis of paise per unit of energy for various grades of coal to be sold from next month.

The state-owned company has called a meeting of stakeholders in the power and non-power sectors to brief them about the new pricing system, to be notified this week, and clarify any doubts.

“We will explain the new system to consumers and take their feedback, after which prices under the new system will be notified. We will be migrating to an international pricing system,” said a senior executive of Coal India. “It will be for the benefit of consumers.”

The grading system based on total energy content per kilogram remains, but the price of each consignment will be determined by a rate fixed for each unit of energy for that particular grade and the total energy contained in 1 kg of coal for the consignment.

“This system will bring in more transparency,” said Gopal Singh, Chairman of Coal India. “It will be streamlined and consumer-friendly. The new pricing system is based on the global system of coal pricing instead of band-based pricing system.”

This means that the price of each tonne of coal will be based on its total energy content. Under the present system, the price used to be the same for a range of energy content, which was categorised as grades. Coal India, however, has reduced the number of grades from 17 earlier to 10 under the new system.

Each grade, under the new system, will now have a pricing coefficient which would be in paise per kilocalorie or paise per unit of energy. This coefficient, when multiplied with the energy content in each consignment in gross calorific value (GCV) terms, will determine the price of one tonne of coal for that consignment.

According to a Coal India executive, coal of grades between G10 and G14 –mainly used by power generators – have been grouped as one. The energy content of this grade will range between 3,101 GCV and 4,600 GCV. It would have a price coefficient of 23 paise per kilocalorie.

The price of power grade coal within this band would vary between Rs 713 per tonne on the lower side and Rs 1,058 per tonne on the higher side. Under the old system, the prices of these grades varied between Rs 748 per tonne and Rs 1,024 per tonne.

Grade G9 with calorific value ranging between 4,601 GCV and 4,900 GCV, also used by power companies, is likely to have a pricing coefficient of 24 paise per kilo calorie. Its price would vary between Rs 1,104.24 per tonne and Rs 1,176 per tonne, depending on the actual energy content in each consignment. Under the existing system, this grade was priced at Rs 1,140 per tonne.

“Coal grades between G9 and G14 constitute of 80% of Coal India sales. Consumers would now be paying on the basis of the exact quantum of energy content in each consignment. Due to the earlier band pricing system, consumers had to pay a fixed price for different energy content as long as it was within one band. It will not be the case once the new system is in place,” the executive said.

However, each consignment will need to be tested for the exact quantum of energy content in each kg of coal and Coal India has been putting in place systems and the infrastructure to support the new system."

69,2018-03-27,Coal India,"Coal India’s new pricing system may raise fuel costs because the monopoly would end up charging for moisture content in consignments, its consumers have complained. But executives of the state-run miner said the new pricing would make an insignificant difference.

Coal India called consumers for a meeting to apprise them of its new pricing policy that would be implemented from April 1. The miner has been working on the new mechanism, which it says is a transparent system where consumers would only pay for the quality they receive. Under the proposed policy, Coal India will migrate to a system where prices would be determined on the basis of paisa per unit of energy for different grades of coal sold from April 1.

Coal India chairman Gopal Singh said the new system will bring in transparency and consumers would pay for what they receive in terms of quality.

The grading system based on total energy content per kilogram remains, but the price of each consignment will be determined by a rate fixed for each unit of energy for that particular grade and the total energy contained in one kilogram of coal for the consignment.

A section of consumers, however, raised concern over Coal India not considering moisture while raising invoices at the meeting held in Kolkata on Monday. “Higher the moisture in coal, lesser is its heat content and vice-versa,” said Ashok Khurana, director general of Association of Power Producers. 



“The present system of coal analysis does not take into account such moisture content.” Khurana said moisture needs to be accounted for in the coal sample analysis process, so that the exact heat content is accounted for as is the international practice. “Under the present system of analysis, moisture content is not accounted for. This could lead to increased costs for users since they would be able to extract lesser heat for consignments with higher moisture content,” he said.

According to a senior executive of a power company, under the present system of analysis, two consignments of coal with the same energy content could have different quantums of moisture.

“Under CIL’s proposed policy, these two consignments would cost the same but the power plant would get different heat value from them leading to difference in costs. The ones with higher moisture will turn out to be costlier,” the executive said, requesting anonymity. “Internationally, prices of each grade of coal is determined among other things by its moisture and ash content.

While Coal India would be accounting for the ash content, moisture mixed with coal would not be accounted for. This will lead to rising costs of power generation.”

A CIL executive countered their apprehension. “Our experience indicates that in Indian coal mining condition, moisture in coal is minimal unlike its imported variety,” the executive said. “Hence, we have decided against accounting for it. It is not likely to make substantial difference to prices as a section of the consumers feel.”"
68,2018-03-27,Coal India,"Kolkata: One of the largest central trade unions, INTUC, has decided to join four other unions CITU, BMS, HMS and AITUC for the one-day strike on 
April 16 at Coal India, against commercialisation of coal mining.

The five central trade unions collectively represent almost the entire workforce at Coal India. A days strike could lead to production loss to the extent of 2 million tonnes at a time when the power sector is seeing increased demand for coal.

They will now protest jointly against the government’s move of opening up of the coal sector. Fearing job losses, reduction in salaries of coal workers and Coal India losing out to competition, CITU, BMS, HMS and AITUC had declared a day’s strike for coal workers at Coal India and its subsidiaries as soon as the government declared the modalities of the auction for such mine.

“INTUC remained off the strike initially as it believed a day’s strike would serve no purpose. However, after discussions with senior INTUC members the decision was reversed and they would now be joining other unions,” said S Q Zama, secretary general Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation under INTUC.

Nevertheless, INTUC has also started consulting lawyers on the issue as it also plans to move Supreme Court against the government’s decision.

“The centre had assured us that Coal India’s interest would be protected, however, allowing commercialisation effectively means turning back on its own commitment,” said Zama.

B K Rai representing coal workers on behalf of BMS at Coal India said: “We are against commercialisation and opening up of the coal sector to private players and to begin with would be observing a day’s strike on
April 16. It would be a token strike, while further course of action would be decided on the basis of the government’s reaction to the move.”

Unions are against commercialisation primarily because 55% of Coal India’s cost of production is labour cost. This for private players are as low as 25% at the most. Workers’ at Coal India get an average salary of Rs 40,000 per month while their counterpart in private sector receive at most Rs 20,000 a month. They fear Coal India will not be able to compete with private players on cost basis in the open market.

Zama said: “Coal workers at Coal India receive the best salaries along with social security, medical reimbursements, retirement compensation and cashless treatment after superannuation to some extent. Workers in the private sector are denied such benefits. This is why our cost of production is high. They will exploit workmen, sell coal at lower costs and would eventually kill Coal India.”

“We fear that problems faced in the pre-nationalisation era will return if private companies are allowed to mines coal and sell in open market. During pre-nationalisation era mining was unsafe, labourers were exploited, and mining companies scooped out the shallow seams leaving deeper seams exposed which eventually catches fire. Coal seams at Jharia in Jharkhand is a burning example of the issue. Costly coal has been burning there for years due to this,” said Zama."
70,2018-03-28,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity benchmarks Nifty50 and Sensex closed the last day of the fiscal 2017-18 on a negative note.

Investors offloaded positions across the sectors on the last day of March derivatives contracts. 

Weak global cues, in the wake of a sharp fall in Wall Street, driven by technology stocks, too dented investors' sentiments here. 

While the Sensex settled 206 points, or 0.62 per cent, down at 32,969, the Nifty50 index closed Wednesday's session 63 points, or 0.69 per cent, down at 10,114.

Broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed the day 0.53 per cent and 0.92 per cent down, respectively.

The mixed bag of losers included members from metal, telecom, pharma, bank, auto and oil & gas sectors. 

Leaders among losers Tata Steel and Bharti Airtel cracked over 3 per cent in the Sensex index.

Adani ports, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank and Bajaj Auto too figured among the top drags.

On the other hand, shares of Wipro, with a gain of over 3 per cent, remained at the top in the Sensex kitty. Coal India and Hero MotoCorp too bucked the trend, both gaining over 2 per cent.

Out of total 30 stocks in the Sensex pack, 12 closed the day in the green, while 18 in the red.

Among the sectors on BSE, telecom and metal indices tanked over 2 per cent. Only consumer durables and oil & gas indices managed to close the day with mild gains. 

The March series of derivatives did not fare on the expected lines. Both, Sensex and Nifty suffered losses of over 2 per cent in March F&O series, with Adani ports, Tata Steel, Vedanta and ICICI Bank among top losers.

The Nifty50 index opened in the negative by taking cues from weakness of global markets. After consolidating some bit, the index fell towards the 10,100 level.

It formed a bearish candle on the daily chart followed by a Doji, which indicated that there was selling pressure at higher levels. On the weekly chart, the index formed an inside bar or a Harami candle, which indicated that the bulls were not ready to get out even after a major downtrend.

Now, if it sustains below the 10,141 level, then it may start a fresh decline, which could push it towards 10,050 and then 9,950 levels, while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 10,222 and 10,276 levels.

On the options front, April series data was scattered at various strike prices at the beginning of new series. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,000 followed by 9,800 while Call writing was seen at strike prices 10,400 and 10,600.

Options data shows immediate support at 10,000. If that level is not respected, then the index could slip towards the 9,850-9,800 zone, while the upside remains capped at the 10,300 level.

India VIX moved up 1.33 per cent to 15.75.

Bank Nifty opened in the negative and traded in a comparatively narrow range for the entire session. It formed multiple Dojis on the daily chart, which meant the bears were putting pressure at higher levels whereas the bulls did not lose their grip either. Now Nifty has to hold above 24,350 to witness an upmove towards 24,500 level, while a drift below 24,100 could open its decline towards 23,750 and 23,600 levels.

Nifty March Future closed with a loss of 0.63 per cent at 10,115. Long buildup was seen in Concor, HUL, Godrej Consumers, Dabur, Wipro, Ambuja Cement, HeroMotocorp, Coal India and BPCL while shorts were seen in Shriram Transport Finance, Idea, ZEEL, Adani Ports, Grasim, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors DVR and Infosys.

72,2018-03-29,Coal India,"State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) today exuded confidence that it will remain the market leader even after the entry of private players into commercial mining of the dry fuel.

There have been talks of commercial mining for long, and it is not a threat but an opportunity for the company to show its competence, CIL Chairman and Managing Director Gopal Singh said.

He told reporters that the government had given a chance to private players earlier as well and the desire was that there should be competition, not monopoly, but they failed and CIL remained strong.

When there will be competitor/s, it will become clear as to who the leader is. ""Let me tell you CIL will emerge as the leader even then, also in terms of production and supply,"" he said.

The Union Cabinet last month approved auctioning of coal mines to the one bidding the highest per tonne price. At present, private sector firms are only allowed to mine coal for use in cement, steel, power and aluminium plants.

CIL is the sole commercial miner in the country with 80 per cent market share.

Singh said producing coal, creating inventory, and supplies -- everything has to be looked at in the business.

Besides, one cannot maintain stocks for long due to various risks to coal such as catching fire, theft and being washed out in rain, he said.

In the supply and demand cycle, the former should be the focus area, he said, adding that there should be continuity in supply and the stock can be maintained for 22 days.

He also emphasised that there is no shortage of coal in the country and that there is enough for everyone.

There is not even lack of demand, he said, adding that supply should be the focus area so that the problems related to reaching coal to plants at long distances can be overcome.

He said the modes of transporting coal are doing well, and developing them will improve supplies further.

Railways is supplying at its best, he said. ""320 rakes a day, 280 to just power sector.""

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had informed Lok Sabha yesterday that the dispatch through road during April-October increased by 12 MT over the dispatch of 81 MT in the corresponding period of 2016-17."
73,2018-03-30,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The Association of Power Producers, a lobby of Indian power companies, has raised objections to an NTPC subsidiary signing a power supply agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), arguing that the proposed cross-border sale will be in violation of government policy and detrimental to Indian consumers.

The association said it appears that NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) will use discounted coal purchased from Coal India to generate electricity for export to Bangladesh, which should have ideally been supplied to domestic consumers.

NVVN has signed a long-term agreement with BPDB for supply of 300 MW of electricity. The supplies are set to start soon.

“Fuel for cross-border supply of power should be sourced either from eauction or imports,” said Ashok Khurana, director-general at Association of Power Producers. “The power exporter should give an undertaking that they will not use coal procured from Coal India through longterm supply agreement since such coal is supplied at discount and is meant for generating power that is to be supplied to Indian consumers only.”

ET contacted several senior executives at NTPC but they refused comment for this story.

Aformer NTPC executive, however, said the Centre’s policy for exporting power stipulates that one-time approval is required for exporting electricity by discoms or public sector entities if surplus capacity is available and it is certified by a distribution licensee. He also said any coalbased Indian thermal project other than a public sector undertaking will be eligible for power exports to neighbouring countries only if surplus capacity is certified by a designated authority.



“As per the current regulations, discoms can participate against tenders issued by neighbouring country and can sell power from their pool surplus since there are set procedures and rules on the same. It is also understood that cross-border policy is also under review,” he said.

A power sector executive said almost 250 MW power is flowing to Bangladesh from West Bengal’s power pool since October 2013. “Their contract has been extended several times and there is no mention of source of coal for generation of power for export in the guidelines,” this executive said.

But in a letter to the power ministry, the Association of Power Producers has argued that the conditions of BPDB bid were such that they would require NVVN to use coal supplied through fuel supply agreements or procured from captive mines. NVVN will thus be using coal meant for generating power for consumption in India only, it said. The letter also mentioned that the bid conditions required consent from the relevant authority of the Indian government on whether the power generated from the respective power plant using domestic coal can be exported to Bangladesh throughout the contract period.

“It is likely that this requirement has not been adhered to uniformly by all bidders,” the association said in the letter, reviewed by ET. “This means that any bidder securing BPDB bid based on coal procured at notified price for power generation, or from captive mines, would lock in part domestic coal resources for external consumption for 13 years, thus hampering domestic consumers’ interest and would be in violation of policy framework.”

The association has requested the ministry to issue instructions so that coal meant for power generation and supply to Indian consumers is not utilised for BPDB long-term tenders.

It has also requested the ministry to issue necessary clarification so that cross-border power supply is done only with imported or coal procured from e-auctions.

According to recent reports, BPDB invited tender for supply of 500MW power from India under short-term (June 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019) and long-term (January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2033) contracts. The bid for this tender was submitted on January 11."
74,2018-03-30,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-run Coal India (CIL) will not let coal stocks pile up at its mines next year onwards as a strategy to compete with private players once the sector is opened up for commercial mining.

From next year, the company will shift its focus from raising coal production to coal supply and not let stocks pile up beyond the regulatory requirements, its acting chairman Gopal Singh said.

Once piled up, coal quality deteriorates each day finding lesser acceptability among buyers when competition is in place. “This hurts our bottom line too,” Singh said. Coal India will end the current financial year with a stock pile of 54 million tonnes against the norm of 22 days. The company had to scale down its production in the first few months due to lack of demand from power companies, he said.

“It is not production that matters, it is the supply that matters. Next year, our strategy will be giving adequate coal to consumers,” he said, adding the company is expected to grow by 5-6% every year despite competition and huge wage cost.

“There is enough gap for everyone. Even now, we are importing 140 million tonnes of non-coking coal, leave aside coking coal imports. In a country that has 315 billion tonnes of reserves, there is no reason we should import or should have coal shortage. Commercial mining is a good initiative for larger good, because we are able to find out where we stand. This is an opportunity for Coal India to showcase its competence. Ultimately, it will be the margins that will decide the winner. Coal India will surely emerge as the winner,” he said.

The government had last month finalised forward auctions as the methodology to select developers for commercial coal blocks and is likely to kick-start the auctions soon.

Singh said the company has been able to cut its cost of production by 53 million tonnes in the third quarter of the current financial year, resulting into a growth in profit before tax (PBT) of 10.9%. PBT for the first quarter was down year-on-year by 14.9% and by 25.5% in the second quarter.

“We took some very loud measures since October, including staggered system of rest for employees. Earlier, there was a fixed day of rest. Now, the establishment will run on all days resulting in huge benefits,” he said.

Singh said hurdles in coal transportation created shortage in some power plants. “Power plants that are closer to mines have no coal shortage, but plants that are far off have problem, meaning there are evacuation issues,” he said."
75,2018-03-30,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-run miner Coal India will reduce manpower and leverage technology to increase productivity, as part of a roadmap outlined to keep prices low and compete better with private players. “Prices offered by private operators would be the benchmark price for each category of coal on offer,” chairman Gopal Singh told reporters in Kolkata on Friday. “We will strive to offer our coal at a prices that would be less than theirs even if it is by a rupee.”

Singh said Coal India’s about 280,000-strong workforce would be reduced by about 12,000 every year on a net basis, which would help reduce labour cost which accounts for about 55% of the total cost of production.

As manpower declines, the company will begin investing on increasing its scale of operations, Singh said, adding that the company plans to spend about Rs 9,500 crore in 2018-19 for procuring higher capacity equipment. “We would be investing in automation, mechanisation and innovation. This would enhance efficiency and productivity,” said Singh.

Coal India has also decided to shut about 40 unviable underground mines which it inherited when the miner was nationalised. These mines not only account for less than 10% of Coal India’s total output but also employ the bulk of the company’s labour force. Its average cost of production is Rs 1,080 per tonne. As it closes down loss-making mines, this figure is expected to fall drastically.

A senior Coal India executive said “the company wants to shut the unviable mines and redeploy the manpower in other opencast mines”. Singh said, “During the third quarter of the current financial, we have managed to bring down cost of production by about Rs 54 per tonne. We would strive to bring down costs as much as possible and it will be our priority. Coal India has the best talent pool in the country and we are the best paymasters in the industry. This has helped us achieve increased production growth since our employees are a dedicated lot.”"

The Nifty Metal index was trading 0.86 per cent down at 3,509 around 11 am (IST) with Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (down 2.23 per cent) and Hindalco Industries (down 2.06 per cent) as the top drags.

Meanwhile, shares of MOIL (up 1.30 per cent) and Hindustan Zinc (up 0.76 per cent) were the two stocks in the Nifty Metal index trading in the green around that time.

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was down 34 points at 10,178, while the BSE Sensex was 85 points down at 33,170.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 17 were trading in the green, while 33 were in the red.

7,2018-04-04,Coal India,"State-run firms NTPC and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) are exploring recalibrating turbines to enable them to shift to domestic coal from imported coal, union coal and railway minister Piyush Goyal said at an industry event.

 “Many turbines in India cannot take beyond a certain percentage of domestic coal as they have been designed on imported coal (technology), I am glad that NTPC and BHEL are both working to recalibrate those plants,” Goyal said while addressing an Assocham interactive session on coal industry held last night.

“Even if it needs further investments we will allow it as a pass-through in power pricing but try and enable yourself to use domestic coal, it is worth the saving for the nation as a whole,” he said.

Indian Railways is looking at changing the return that is allowed to companies or investors to own railway assets, he said.

“Suppose one of you wants to set up your own railway line anywhere, we are going to liberally allow you to do it, if you want to own your own rakes or wagons to have an assured supply of coal movement, we can allow you to own it, not at the rates of return that you were allowed in the past which were very unattractive, but literally at a rate of return which would be quite attractive for performing companies,” Goyal said. 

Coal India Ltd (CIL) will invest nearly Rs 20,000 crore in the 5-7 years to own 1,500-1,700 rakes.

He said railways is working to finish work on 14 lines dedicated for coal movement which are under different stages of new lines, doubling or tripling of lines which are being personally monitored by coal secretary and chairman of the Railway Board on a monthly basis to make sure there are no slippages.

The minister said that he had sought Odisha chief minister Naveen Pattnaik’s help in increasing coal production in the state by getting land, making railway line, sorting out law and order issues and stopping harassment at coal mines by Biju Janta Dal MLAs, particularly in Talcher which has the potential to provide coal to the power plants in rest of the country.

“But I did not get the kind of support which I should have got,” added Mr Goyal."

8,2018-04-05,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Coal India(CIL) is likely to hike the salaries of executives in the next two months, a move that will result in an additional annual outgo of Rs 1,000 crore, its chief Gopal Singh said today.

""That (the salary hike of the executives) is due. It is almost at the final stage. I think that should happen within next two months,"" Singh told PTI in an interview.

The pay revision of the executives is due since January 1, 2017.

Around 23,000 executives would benefit from the move, that would have an impact of around Rs 1,000 crore per year on the company, Singh, who is the Chairman and Managing Director, said.

When asked if the company was mulling increasing the price of coal to offset the impact of the proposed salary hike, Singh said there is no such consideration.

Rather, CIL is looking at various ways like improving efficiency and productivity to contain the impact of pay hike, he said.

""There are various ways to compensate it. (You can compensate it by) improvement in productivity, efficiency and reduction in cost of production,"" Singh said.

CIL in October last signed a wage pact with workers' unions for five years which, the PSU said, would have an estimated impact of Rs 5,667 crore annually on the miner.

CIL has nearly three lakh employees and the wage agreement was due since July 2016.

According to industry experts, increase in coal prices was one of the ways to counterbalance the impact which the PSU incurred from rise in salaries of its non-executive staff last year.

The CIL board had in January approved revision of non-coking coal prices.

It had said the price revision will result in an incremental revenue of Rs 1,956 crore for the remaining period of 2017-18 while the total revenue will be Rs 6,421 crore.

Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic coal production, is eyeing one billion tonne output by 2019-20."
9,2018-04-06,Coal India,"NIFTY50 companies are expected to report a double-digit growth in net profit for the third consecutive quarter, shows the latest quarterly preview by the ET Intelligence Group. Net profit will grow by 18.4 per cent year-on-year for the March 2018 quarter.

A lower base in the previous year due to demonetisation is expected to boost performance of select companies in sectors including automobiles, banks and finance, consumer, and metals. In addition, the magnitude of profit growth for the quarter will likely be higher than the previous two quarters.

Net sales of the sample are likely to increase by 7.7 per cent for the quarter while operating profit may rise by 15.9 per cent. The sample companies were able to retain the operating margin at around 20 per cent in the two quarters to December 2017. The March quarter may not be an exception with an expected margin of 19.9 per cent.

Though the overall growth is expected to be upbeat, only a handful of sectors will continue to drive the growth. Automobiles, consumer goods, retail oriented banks and financial services companies, and metal companies are likely to shine. On the other hand, public sector banks, private sector lenders with higher exposure to corporates, information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, and telecom are likely to report weak numbers.


Sector Trend
AUTO SECTOR
The volume growth in the December quarter was 13-35 per cent across auto segments due to improving consumer sentiment and replacement demand. The revenue growth will also be strong since auto makers tend to maintain pricing power. The operating profit margin may moderate owing to firm raw material prices.


BANKING AND FINANCE
Lenders focusing on retail segments including automobiles, housing, and personal loans will continue to do better than those having a higher exposure to corporate accounts. In case of banks with corporate-heavy loan books, the rate of fresh nonperforming assets or slippages is likely to decelerate.


CAPITAL GOODS
A pickup in the execution of several projects is likely to support the earnings growth of capital goods companies. Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest infrastructure company, is likely to report better project execution along with better momentum of new orders. Power Grid Corporation is expected to maintain the ratio of commissioned projects and capital expenditure above one.


CEMENT
In the March 2018 quarter, the average all-India cement price increased marginally by 1.2 per cent to Rs 314 per 50 kg bag. In the northern region, demand was slightly weak due to lower availability of sand. Demand was higher in across Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu. Ultratech, the country’s largest cement manufacturer with pan-India presence and the only Nifty 50 member from the sector, is expected to report double digit year-on-year revenue growth.


FMCG
The low base of the previous year’s March quarter due to demonetization and share gain from unorganized players following GST implementation will enable consumer companies to report strong double digit volume growth. The margins should also expand for most companies partly aided by the GST. ITC’s cigarette volume growth will see a decline of low single digit but this will be offset by a 12 per cent average price hike.


IT
The March quarter has been historically weak for the Indian software exporters given the rejig of IT budgets by clients during the quarter. The dollar denominated revenue growth may remain under 2 per cent sequentially. The weakness in the rupee against the major currencies may support operating margins for the quarter.


METALS AND MINING
The domestic demand of steel strengthened in the March quarter. Consumption grew by 7 per cent year-on-year in January and February. This and higher steel prices will help companies post double digit revenue growth. Aluminium players, too, are likely to see better realization as prices increased by 10 per cent year-on-year.


PHARMA
It will be another subdued quarter for the pharma sector as the US business for most companies will continue to be a drag. No major drug approvals were given to Indian companies in the March quarter. This may result in a low single digit year-on-year revenue growth.


POWER
During the March quarter, power generation rose by 4.3 per cent year-on-year and that by the coal fired plants was up 5.5 per cent, despite coal shortage. The plant load factor or capacity utilization was at 63 per cent. Coal India’s overall production was up by 4 per cent and dispatch by 5 per cent. Dispatch to the power sector was up 8 per cent. Revenues and profits of Nifty 50 participants including Coal India and NTPC are expected to grow in single digits.


TELECOM
It will be still some more time before the benefits of recent consolidation in the sector would reflect in the financials of telecom operators. Their revenue and profits are expected to remain under pressure for the March quarter amid intense competition."

11,2018-04-08,Coal India,"The Cabinet may soon take a call on whether a fresh lease is required by state-owned Coal India for extracting coal bed methane (CBM) which remains untapped in want of clarity, a top official today said.

To expedite gas production from coal seams, however, the government had earlier permitted Coal India to mine CBM through a notification.

""Both the ministries (Coal Ministry and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) sat along with the others....It has been sorted out that there is no need for a separate lease and that CCEA note is still pending. So, once the CCEA decides that then we will go ahead,"" Coal Secretary Susheel Kumar told PTI in a interview.

Coal Bed Methane is a form of natural gas trapped in coal seams underground. Such gas can be extracted by drilling into the seam.

""The CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) note is about just to say that there is no need for a separate lease. You know they (Petroleum ministry) had issued some notification and we said that notification needs to be amended the way we are saying. That amendment will have to be done for which it is pending in CCEA,"" the secretary explained.

""But essentially it (the notification) says there is no need for fresh lease,"" Kumar explained.

On the question that when will the CCEA take a call on this, he said ""I think anytime. There was some clarification needed why only for the Coal India. So, our response has been because Coal India is a PSU and large amount of area under CBA acquired with it"".

The coal ministry, he said, has identified CBM as priority area.

The secretary said gas is the remit of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, so the issue came is that if Coal India wants to extract gas then it has to take a fresh lease of the same area under the relevant act from the petroleum ministry.

""We were of the view that since (with regard to) our public sector Coal India, the acquisition of land is under the CBA (Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition & Development) Act, 1957). And rather it is not acquisition. It vests. So, it is not the lease. It vests with the central government when CBA Act is applied and the the acquisition takes place.

So, it is unlike the normal land acquisition act where you acquire and state government gives you a lease. State government does not give any lease here,"" he explained.

Once acquired under the CBA Act, the land vests absolutely with Central government so there is no need for a fresh lease under any Act, Kumar said.

""So, whatever lies within-- coal and gas everything--can be mined or extracted,"" he added.

The petroleum ministry had earlier allowed Coal India to mine the hydrocarbon. However, the permission came with a rider -- that Coal India cannot involve a private third party for CBM exploitation.

It can only give out equity participation to a central or state PSU with experience in CBM exploration, while the majority stake would remain with Coal India.

The secretary further said, ""What is the harm in private sector participating because ownership is not with them...So, we have also in our comments said that permission should also given to allow private sector to be partner in extraction of methane"".

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had in a reply to Rajya Sabha had last month said that Coal India Ltd (CIL) has taken initiatives to undertake the work of extraction of CBM from its mining leasehold area.

The initial activities include assessment of CBM potentiality in subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd to delineate CBM blocks in Damodar Valley Basin.

Accordingly one block each has been delineated in Jharia coalfields and Raniganj Coalfields.

The minister had further said that ""on receipt of modified guidelines and MoP&NG (Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) considering exemption of applicability of Oilfield (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 and Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959 within coal mining leasehold areas, further action will be initiated for extraction of gas and time line will be drawn accordingly"".

The minister also said that a demonstration project was taken up in Jharia coalfields. Further for commercial exploitation, CIL is contemplating to extract CBM by engaging experienced developer through global tender."
12,2018-04-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The government has assured Coal India union leaders that the company would remain dominant even after private commercial mining begins, but workers have decided to go ahead with the April 16 strike.

“We had a round of talks with the unions and told them that Coal India will remain a dominant public sector player in the Indian coal scene and it would also offer an opportunity to employees to get absorbed in other private companies after retirement in case they want to opt for it,” Coal India chairman Gopal Singh said.

Union leaders, who held talks in Delhi last week, do not want private competition.

“Although, at the meeting, the government assured that it will not allow Coal India to be affected negatively when commercial mining starts, the assurance could not convince the union leaders who met coal secretary and the coal minister Piyush Goyal last week,” said DD Ramanandan, general secretary of All India Coal Workers Federation (AICWF), affiliated to CITU.

INTUC, which had so far kept away, has also joined the strike called by CITU, BMS, HMS and AITUC. These five represent almost the entire workforce of the company.

“We feel, allowing private commercial mining would affect the interests of coal workers who would be paid a fraction of what CIL employees receive just like in the pre-nationalisation era,” Ramanandan said."

15,2018-04-09,Coal India,"Yes, Mr Market is unstable, but it is still possible to get stable returns from stock investment, and how!

After the superbly rewarding 2017, most analysts say calendar 2018 is unlikely to deliver big returns due to many headwinds in the form of political uncertainties, soaring crude oil prices and global trade issues, among others.

Equity benchmark Sensex is down over 3,000-odd points since 
January 29 till now. Some analysts are advising their clients to stick to largecaps while others are recommending a shift to defensives to survive a gyrating market.

But market veterans say there are options that can deliver steady returns to equity investors even in an unsteady market; dividend yield stocks are known to be one.

Investors can consider high dividend yield stocks to ensure steady returns even if the broader market remains volatile, says VK Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Market Strategy, HDFC Securities.

“When you are not sure how long the stock correction will last, good dividend yield can en sure steady income and, therefore, you can afford to forget what the index or stock is quoting at. You treat the stock more like a fixed deposit, where you get fixed returns. Therefore, there is less tension,” Sharma said.

There is a set of stocks known for giving good dividend year after year. Dividend yields of stocks like Indiabulls Ventures, Coal India, Pfizer, Hindustan Zinc, Indiabulls Housing Finance and NMDC have been steady between 6.50 per cent and 17.97 per cent in last five financial years.

In terms of dividend per share (DPS), Coal India has given an average dividend of Rs 22.20 per share every year between FY13 and FY17; Pfizer and Indiabulls Housing Finance have given average dividend of Rs 88 and 29.40 per share every year during the same period.

The strategy suits conservative investors.

But there is a word of caution. “One should look at the financials of the company before picking a stock on the basis of dividend yield record alone. A healthy balance sheet can make sure the company will continue to pay dividend,” says Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking.

Dividend from stocks is tax-free in the hands of the investors to the extent of Rs 10 lakh a year. It is unlikely that a small investor would receive a dividend of over Rs 10 lakh in a year.

If someone does manage to earn more than Rs 10 lakh, the dividend income would get taxed at 10 per cent, which is much less for people in the marginal tax bracket of 20-30 per cent. It is even less than short-term capital gains tax of 15 per cent and equals long-term capital gains tax of 10 per cent.

To make it clear, if you earn Rs 15 lakh as dividend income, the first Rs 10 lakh is exempted from income-tax and one would pay Rs 50,000 as tax on the remaining, i.e. 10 per cent of Rs 5 lakh.

“In the current state of the economy, where bank fixed deposits offer interest rates to the tune of 6-7 per cent, there are stocks giving dividend yields similar to that. Further, interest on bank fixed deposits is taxable, whereas dividend income from equity is completely exempt from tax (except when the dividend income in a financial year exceeds Rs 10 lakh). In that context, post-tax dividend yields of some stocks are way higher than post-tax interest yield on bank fixed deposits. So, investors can consider some of the high dividend yield stocks to ensure regular inflows,” Centrum Broking said in a report.

In the BSE500 pack, stocks like Hindustan Zinc, SJVN, Vedanta, NLC India and Coal India were among top names in terms of dividend yield in FY17. (See table for top 20)


Analysts say PSUs have been high dividend payers, mainly with a view to helping the government make up for shortfall in tax collections and take care of its fiscal deficit.

Stocks like Coal India have been huge dividend payers over the years. Traditionally, maximum activity in terms of PSU dividend payout happens in the fourth quarter of a financial year.

The government received around Rs 8,044 crore as dividend from Coal India for FY18 as the miner’s board approved payment of interim dividend for the financial year at Rs 16.50 a share. The miner's total payout on account of this would be to the tune Rs 10,242 crore.

The company distributed total dividend of Rs 12,352 crore in FY17 and Rs 17,306 crore in FY16, according to the data available with Ace Equity.

“PSU companies in which government holds majority of stakes would pay as much dividend as is possible so that the government can manage the fiscal deficit better,” said Sharma of HDFC Securities."
19,2018-04-10,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks rose for a fourth straight session on Tuesday, buoyed by positive global cues following China's President Xi Jinping’s comments on the opening up of world's second-largest economy. 

Other than the favourable global cues, buying in metal, bank and IT stocks and hopes of better earnings boosted market sentiment.

The earnings season will be kick started by IT major Infosys this Friday.

The Nifty50 index gained 23 points, or 0.22 per cent, to close at 10,402, with 26 stocks in the green and 24 in the red.

The BSE Sensex settled 92 points, or 0.27 per cent, up at 33,880 with 17 stocks advancing, while 14 declining.

“Market remained rangebound despite a rally in global markets owing to positive signal from China on trade tariffs. Metal and realty outperformed due to ease in global trade tensions, while surge in oil price and bond yield refrained heavyweights to participate. On the macro front, domestic market is reversing from the support level in expectation of pick up in Q4 earnings and further moderation in (March) CPI inflation to 4.2 per cent against 4.44 per cent in the previous month,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices marginally underperformed benchmark Sensex, closing 0.18 per cent up and 0.02 per cent down, respectively.

The pack of Sensex gainers was led by Axis Bank, which surged over 5 per cent after the board of directors informed the RBI that CEO Shikha Sharma has requested them to reduce her fourth term up to December 2018 instead of the earlier May 2021.

ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, Tata Steel and Coal India too figured among the top gainers of the day, each gaining over 2 per cent in the Sensex index.

Metal stocks including Hindalco, NMDC, NALCO and Vedanta saw decent gains on Tuesday after the US imposed sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal, world's largest aluminium producer. As per brokerage firm Edelweiss, Hindalco may benefit from sanctions on Rusal due to integrated nature of its domestic operations. Vedanta too may benefit as it will be able to pass on higher cost of alumina in a better manner. 

Sugar stocks K M Sugar Mills, Rana Sugars, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Uttam Sugar Mills and Magadh Sugar hogged limelight on Tuesday after Reuters reported, citing sources that the government was planning to provide financial support to cane farmers for their yield sold to sugar mills. 

Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp and HDFC Bank declined up to 1.37 per cent in the Sensex index, remaining as the top losers of the day.

16,2018-04-10,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Pay scales of Coal India's 17,000-odd executives — from junior levels right up to chairman's post — are proposed to be more than doubled, although the increase would be smaller after accounting for the dearness allowance already being paid on top of the basic salary.

The timing of the raise is critical as the government is set to auction coal blocks for commercial production to private companies and Coal India management is worried about poaching since it employs the best talents in the field in the country.

“Coal India will spend an additional Rs 1,000 crore on account of revised salaries for officers. It is expected to be implemented soon,” Coal India chairman Gopal Singh said.

The company has been making a provision of around Rs 400 crore every quarter since last year in anticipation of the pay hike for executives. According to a senior Coal India executive, the proposal for revised salaries is expected to be presented at the Coal India board meeting scheduled on April 14. “The proposal was discussed at the ministry recently. However, as it had not been passed by the board then, the ministry asked the company to receive board’s approval as soon as possible,” he said.

Salaries of Coal India executives are revised every 10 years and the current revision fell due more than a year ago in January 2017. “Since salaries are revised every 10 years pay scales of other maharatna companies are now more than that of Coal India’s executives for a number of grades. We have been asking the management to correct the anomaly and make it at par with other large PSUs,” said a senior Coal India executive, who is also part of the Coal Mines Officer’s Association of India.

“While officers’ salaries are revised every 10 years, workmen salaries get revised every five years. In certain cases, on-roll workmen have been earning more than executive in the junior grades from E1to E4. Junior executives are making various representation to correct this anomaly among executives. They want it to be set at par with other profit making maharatna companies,” he said.

Nevertheless, another senior executive from Coal India said that while scales may double, the overall hike in terms of percentage is likely to be around 20% on the higher said since with every revision of pay scales, dearness allowances is set to zero."

21,2018-04-11,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved simplifying exploration of coal bed methane from coal blocks allotted to Coal India Ltd.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs granted relaxation to Coal India and its subsidiaries from applying for grant of license under the PNG Rules, 1959 for extraction of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) under their coal bearing areas.

CCEA gave its approval for amending an earlier notification issued by the oil ministry.

“The decision is in line with the government’s initiatives of ‘ease of doing business’. It will expedite the exploration and exploitation of CBM, enhance the availability of natural gas and reduce the gap in demand and supply of natural gas. The increased development activities for exploration and exploitation of CBM gas reserves in-and-around the block will generate economic activities which in turn has potential to create employment opportunities in CBM operations and in the industries,” an official statement said.

The cabinet approved amendment of clause 3(xiii) of a notification dated November 3, 2015 issued by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas under Section 12 of the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (ORD Act, 1948).

The notification granted rights to CIL and its subsidiaries for exploration and exploitation of CBM from all coal bearing areas for which they possess mining lease for coal. Clause 3(vi) of the notification provides that the ""lessee shall submit application under the P&NG Rules 1959 for grant of mining lease for CBM to the oil ministry along with detailed recommendations of Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited."
22,2018-04-11,Coal India,"Fearing Reserve Bank of India’s revised guidelines for stressed assets may force some 75,000 mw of coal-fired power projects into bankruptcy, the Association of Power Producers has requested the government to relax timelines of the new rules for the sector.

A recent RBI circular stipulates that a one-day default in debt servicing would require reporting it to the central bank and implementation of a resolution plan.

All accounts with exposure of Rs 2,000 crore and above, on or after March 1, 2018, and in default have to formulate a resolution plan. In case of any failure to formulate and implement resolution plan within six months, the case has to be mandatorily referred to national Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code proceedings.

The new guidelines also require 100% lenders to pass board-approved policies for resolution of stressed assets. Even if one lender disagrees, it would take the company to NCLT. Power executives find this too stringent a clause and believe it would push companies to bankruptcy. Earlier, it was 75% of the lenders by voting share and 50% by number.

Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, said: “No provisioning is required in case the resolution plan involves change in control. The guidelines majorly dis-incentivise any loan restructuring and push for sale or change of control for any stressed entity raising risks for developers and equity investors.”

At present, some 75,000 mw of coal-fired power generation assets under-operation or under-construction — are severely stressed due to various reasons including lower availability of coal and lack of power purchase agreements.

Anjan Ghosh, chief rating officer at ICRA, said: “For coal-fired power plants that do not have steady access to fuel or power purchase agreements, coming up with a resolution plan within six months is too less a period. We fear almost all of these companies may end up at the NCLT under RBI’s new rules for bankruptcy.”

“The revised framework is also likely to lead to a debt haircut of about 35% (varying between 20% to 70% across the entities) for such affected thermal capacity based on ICRA estimates, given the issues arising out of cost over-run, unviable tariffs & lack of PPAs,” Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head & senior vice president at ICRA Ratings, said.

Khurana said, “Factors that has been affecting the sector include delay of three-four months in bill payment for power sold to distribution companies. Total outstanding at present is around Rs 8,300 crore. There is always a delay of at least two years in receiving orders from Electricity Regulatory Commissions on passing on increased costs in a large number of cases.

Approximately Rs 7,800 crore are stuck as regulatory receivables. This amount is increasing progressively.” Coal India supplies only 60% of coal required to supply power under a long term PPA while additional procurement of coal under eauction is not compensated by distribution companies on an ongoing basis. These needs approval which is at times delayed."
23,2018-04-12,Coal India,"In September 2017, Rahul Johri met Vinaya Varma, chief executive of e-marketplace services company mJunction, inviting it to design what would be Indian sport’s first e-auction.

Johri, chief executive of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) since April 2016, wanted a fair bidding system that would be simple to use online for competing broadcast networks and internet companies. The prize — media rights to show BCCI matches during 2018-23. The price — to be determined by the market in a bidding battle that would go on for as long as it must, in real time.


GAME THEORY
Varma, 49, joked that he knows nothing about cricket, being fonder of tennis, swimming and shooting. But he wasn’t going to be turning this down. After all, mJunction, set up in 2001 as a joint venture between the Steel Authority of India and Tata Steel, has evolved into an ecommerce company that conducted Rs 2 lakh crore worth transactions on its platform across sectors in 2017-18.

Its most famous case study has been with Coal India in 2005, when mJunction’s auction platform demonstrated ability to extract a price more than 50% of the reserve price. For that, mJunction made virtual lots of different sizes for each coal grade and source combination, after which it did away with ‘fixed lot sizes’. The new e-auction design enabled anybody to bid for a single lot by specifying quantity and price, and buyers were required to quote required quantities. “This methodology effectively broke cartels,” Varma recalls.

The BCCI e-auction wasn’t going to be about the cricket. It was about scenariobuilding and finding the right methodology. “Auction methodologies have their roots in game theory,” he says. “We engage with various educational institutes, which specialise in this field of study— professors and academicians. We observe e-auctions happening across the world.” It’s another matter that the BCCI eauction was possibly a first in the world.

“There were no case studies for perspective,” Varma says. “Because it is cricket, the slightest issue will attract a lot of bad press.” But the game was on. mJunction had few months to get the solution ready.


HIT REFRESH 
For long, the media rights process for BCCI typically began with an invitation to tender (ITT). Interested bidders were given a few days to come up with queries, which BCCI addressed. This was followed by a date when participating parties submitted two documents in sealed envelopes – technical and financial bids. Once technical bids were checked, BCCI announced eligible participants and considered only their financial bids. As there was only one bid, the players put in their best number.

This is what Johri wanted to change. “In a closed auction, participants were essentially putting one number down, after which they would work backwards and plan profits by basing assumptions on that one number or one price,” says Jehil Thakkar, partner and leader (media & entertainment) at advisor Deloitte India.

Johri had told ET in a September interaction, “Our (Indian Premier League) tender ensures not just an absolutely transparent process, but also generates maximum revenue for BCCI and all our stakeholders.”

But BCCI realised after Star India won IPL rights that the difference between the largest bid and sum of all bids was under 4%. That’s when it decided on e-auctions.


SECOND INNINGS
 As per the ITT for BCCI rights e-auction, the board called participants to submit their technical bids by 10 am on April 3. Only Sony Pictures Networks, Star India and Reliance Jio Infocomm did so and were found eligible.

The big change was that the right price would be a moving target, which meant uncertainty around the final number. Thakkar says, “Bidding companies had to plan for multiple scenarios — if the price moves beyond this point, what is your walkaway price? How much are you willing to stretch? There is a lot of planning and scenario analysis that goes into deciding how you actually walk in.” Companies decide if the object of the bidding is to grow market share, or a risk-averse strategy to grow profits. “A lot of prep is in advance at different price points,” Thakkar adds.

One thing was for sure — in India, cricket rights are the way to drive subscriber access to over-the-top (OTT) video or broadcasting network services. “It is exclusive and event-driven content, which is what sports is. A game loses its relevance after the result is out. Immediacy is the key.”

But the players were not the only ones planning. “We have more than two dozen methodologies for e-auctions,” says Varma. “Depending on the prevailing scenario in an industry, we pick up the right methodology.”


THE RUNUP
 mJunction appointed a team of five business analysts, headed by an experienced hand who had managed key projects in government, such as the telecom spectrum auction. The team met BCCI regularly to determine objectives and debate. Bearing in mind that BCCI would sell rights in three categories — global television rights plus rest of world digital rights package; Indian subcontinent digital rights package and global consolidated rights package —mJunction designed methodology around a range of scenarios of how potential bidders would behave.

Internally, it organised user acceptance testing (UAT). “We had people acting as bidders to see how the solution behaves in certain scenarios and spot if there are any vulnerabilities,” Varma says. ‘Bidders’ explained what they couldn’t see on the screen, font and placement of features.

The issues were fed to its technology team in Kolkata for resolution. “We have a large team that tested for all scenarios.” The e-auction platform was built in around a month, followed by discussions with participating bidders. A fortnight before the e-auction, bidders had a mockup to familiarise them with features. Later, they were issued unique ID and passwords, numbers of the mJunction helpdesk and explained the rules.

mJunction had to put a premium on bidders’ confidentiality, apart from standard requirements of internet speeds and encryption standards to protect data.

“On a typical day, we do around 500 forward and 500 reverse auctions. When we did the coal auction, there were as many as 2,000 bidders logged into our platform,” Varma says. To guard against external disruptions, there are multiple internet service providers, two sources of power and disaster recovery provisions.

Bidders could operate from their offices by logging into the e-auction, with the facility to revise price upwards. “We track bidders’ IP addresses. We have the mechanism to find out where bids are being relayed from. This becomes important only if there is suspicious activity such as cartelisation.” Once a price would be set, there would be time for other bidders to improve on it.

“It took three days to finish. We were sure the auction would carry on for at least two days,” recalls Varma. “Once we start the auction, it can go on and on.” As per the BCCI format, all participants could see the other bids being submitted online, without bidder identity.


THE TEST
 On April 3, the auction began at 2 pm for the three categories BCCI had mandated. Star, Sony and Reliance bid for the global consolidated rights. The base price was Rs 43 crore per match for first year and Rs 40 crore each for the next four years. The total number of matches under the Future Tours Programme was 102.

Bidding started at the base price of `4,134 crore. After five rounds, it was stopped at 6 pm at Rs 4,422 crore with all three bidding. On Day 2, auction resumed at 11 am and saw aggressive bidding. By 1 pm, the consolidated bid was at Rs 4,517.25 crore, which went up to Rs 4,565.20 crore by 2 pm and Rs 5,488.30 crore by 4 pm. By end of day, it crossed Rs 6,000-crore mark and the last bid came at Rs 6,032.5 crore.

On Day 3, auction resumed with accelerated bidding. Instead of 60 minutes, participants were given 20 minutes to put in their numbers. Finally, Star India won the media rights for Rs 6,138.1 crore — Rs 60.1 crore per match. BCCI is scheduled to host 18 matches in year I, 26 in the next year, 14 in year III and 22 each in years IV and V.

“It was like a movie that wasn’t coming to an end,” Uday Shankar, chief executive, Star, would later tell a cricket website. At mJunction, though, it was just another day of curating the pitch for an online auction."
24,2018-04-12,Coal India,"BHUBANESWAR: Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik today asked the Centre to re-examine its decision to allot four coal mines to Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL), instead of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd, which already operates several mines in the state.

""It has been brought to my notice that the Ministry of Coal has decided to allot four coal mines of Odisha namely, Rampia, Dip side of Rampia, Ghogarpalli and Dip extension of Ghogarpalli to WCL instead of MCL, which is already operating several coal mines in the region, Patnaik said in a letter to Union Coal Minister Piyush Goyal.

Operationalisation of coal mines requires close coordination with the local administration for land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement of project affected families, he said.

The WCL, which is headquartered at Nagpur in Maharashtra, may not be in a position to effectively tackle the issues, which are critical to the smooth operationalisation of coal mines, the chief minister said.

The MCL has achieved a record production of over 143 million tonnes of coal during 2017-18 and with a more focussed approach towards rehabilitation and resettlement of the affected families, it can grow further in partnership with the lcoal communities, he said.

""It is, therefore, requested that the matter may be re-examined and the aforementioned coal mines of Odisha may be allotted to the MCL instead of another Coal India Limited subsidiary (WCL) located away from the State,"" said Patnaik.

In case MCL is unable to handle more coal mines in view of its existing commitments, Coal India Ltd may consider to set up another subsidiary for Talcher Coalfield and the MCL may further scale up its operations in the Ib valley region, the Chief Minister said."
25,2018-04-14,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The one-day strike called by the four central trade unions of Coal India Ltd on April 16 against the government move of allowing commercial coal mining, has been withdrawn due to lack of cohesion among themselves, a union leader today said.

Coal India officials too confirmed that the strike has been called off.

The four central trade unions of CITU, BMS, HMS and AITUC had served the strike notice on March 14.

""Based on yesterday's meeting with Coal Secretary Susheel Kumar for setting up a committee under a joint secretary to listen to the issues, BMS and HMS signed withdrawal minutes. But, CITU and AITUC though had not signed the minutes, had to withdraw from the strike against our will, keeping unity if the trade unions in mind,"" CITU-backed coal union leader D D Ramanandan told.

In a major reform in the coal sector since its nationalisation in 1973, the government in February this year allowed private companies to mine the fossil fuel for commercial use, ending the monopoly of state-run Coal India.

INTUC said althiugh it was not keen on withdrawal, it had to do so after two unions had walked out."
27,2018-04-17,Coal India,"The Finance Ministry may come out with a Rs 10,000-crore follow-on fund offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) as it looks to dilute stake in Coal India to meet the minimum public holding norm.

Besides, the ministry is keen to take the ETF route to sell off government shares held through SUUTI in private companies -- ITC, Axis Bank and L&T, an official told PTI.

The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T.

The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs 32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs 14,500 crore.

An official said the ETF route is a safer mode of disinvestment as it shields investors against stock market volatility.

""Based on the current composition of the Bharat-22 ETF, the leg room for a follow-on fund offer would be around Rs 10,000 crore,"" the official added.

The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

The official said by using the ETF route, the government may dilute about 3.55 per cent stake held in Coal India to comply with the minimum 25 per cent public float requirement as mandated by market regulator Sebi.

The government plans to raise Rs 80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs 1 lakh crore raised last year.

Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 bluechip PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs 11,500 crore in three tranches, with Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."
26,2018-04-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) will undertake commercial extraction of methane from all new mines holding substantial volume of the gas, reports Debjoy Sengupta. Methane would be sold commercially before the company takes up coal extraction from these mines boosting bottomline considerably.

“It will be possible because the government has recently waived off licensing requirement for extracting methane from coal seams that fall under Coal India’s lease hold area,” a senior Coal India executive told ET. “It has two advantages: Coal India will earn additional revenue from the methane it sells in the market. Following methane extraction, which will bring down gaseous deposit to near zero, mining seams would be safer and larger quantities of coal can be mined from them. It would be a two-way revenue gain.”

Methane released by coal deposits remain trapped in seams, which escapes into the atmosphere when coal is mined. Methane trapped in mines can kill miners if present in high concentration. In order to avoid fatalities at deposits with high concentration of such gas, the practice has been to puncture these seams and inject air into it forcing out methane into atmosphere or even flare it."
28,2018-04-19,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Rising Indonesian coal production and lower Chinese demand have pulled down Indonesian coal prices by 22% over the last 45 days, a trend that augurs well for plants that import fuel.

China has restricted coal imports at many ports and plans to phase out a large number of thermal plants, hurting demand. Indian power generators are likely to increase imports because they face a supply crunch. It would also ease pressure on Coal India although it would increase dependence on foreign fuel.

Experts said prices are expected to fall further, keeping potential buyers away from the market as they are waiting for lower rates. Public sector power companies would continue to follow centre’s directive of not importing fresh consignments. A senior power company executive said: “As Indonesian prices fall, power plants within a radius of 150 km from ports will find it remunerative to import. Ash content in Indonesian coal is, at most, 10% while Indian coal contains ash of 30-40%.

Importing Indonesian coal makes sense for coastal plants even when it is costlier than Indian. However, for pit head plants, it is still a costlier option and will continue to be so unless prices fall drastically.” Deepak Kannan of S&P Global Platts in Singapore said price of freight on board Kalimantan 4200 GCV as received coal — a popular grade bought by both India and China in significant quantities — has dipped to $40 per tonne on Tuesday, from $51 late February. 

According to a coal importer, the 4,200 kilo calorie gross as received (GAR) variety from Indonesia can be roughly compared to G11grade sold by Coal India. “Base price of G11 at pit head is Rs 1,145 per tonne. A consumer pays Rs 2,200-2,300 per tonne after paying handling charges, GST, Royalty and other levies. This coal when offered through e-auction fetches higher prices that could be as higher by 30-40% over the base price. In contrast the landed price of the Indonesian variety comes to around $50.19 (Rs 3,287) at ports,” the importer said.

However, price of 3,800 kilo calorie GAR is $42.63 per tonne (Rs 2,792), whereas basic price of G12 is Rs 1,063 and its ex-mine comes to Rs 1,800-1,900 per tonne."
29,2018-04-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Acting chairman of Coal India, Gopal Singh, may be replaced by Suresh Kumar, an IAS officer, currently holding the post of additional secretary at the ministry of coal. Kumar is likely to take over as the new acting chairman of the world’s largest coal producer.

According to a document available with ET, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has issued the directive on Thursday although Coal India is yet to receive an official communication from the government.

In June last year the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) which was entrusted with the task of finding a candidate for the chairman’s post at Coal India after interviewing half a dozen candidates could not find any one suitable for the post.

Following retirement of full time chairman Sutirtha Bhattacharya, the fulltime chairman of Coal India in August, the ministry of coal appointed Gopal Singh – the chairman and managing director of CIL subsidiary, Central Coalfields, as Coal India’s acting chairman for three months. His tenure as acting chairman got extended twice and was to end in May this year.

Coal India is without a fulltime chairman for the last eight months."
30,2018-04-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has drawn up a special forward e-auction calendar for 2018-19 under which it would be offering 45 million tonnes of coal for power companies that do not have regular coal supply contracts with the coal company.

According to power executives 45 million tonnes is good enough to run 11,250 mw of thermal power generation capacity at 85% capacity utilisation for a full year.

This is part of the company’s effort to help stressed power companies plan their fuel procurement plan so that the can plan ahead. It would also help them systematically lift coal for power generation in an effort to increase capacity utilisation and increase generation.

“This special forward e-auction is aimed at offering a transparent way of helping stressed power plants without regular supply contracts. This would allow them to jack up generation,” said a Coal India executive.

“All the coal producing subsidiary companies of Coal India have uploaded their month wise source-wise quantity of coal they would be putting under hammer for the special forward auction right up to March 2019,” he said.

“Power producers, particularly Independent Power Producers, can now plan much in advance their coal requirement source wise, grade wise, size wise, quantity wise and mode wise as the company has indicated the availability right in the beginning of the fiscal” he said."

37,2018-04-23,Coal India,"Coal supply position for thermal power plants is expected to remain tight for about two years, after which new railway links will help ease the situation.

“Demand for coal is expected to outpace domestic supplies beyond 2020 keeping supply position tight,” said Niladri Bhattacharjee, partner, strategy & operations for mining and metals at KPMG in India. “A few critical railways projects under construction are expected to be operational after 2020, which would help ease the tight supply position.”

The government’s push for rural electrification is also expected to add to power demand that will exert supply pressure on coal.

A senior Coal India (CIL) executive said logistics was the key issue. “We can supply as much coal as the industry requires, provided logistics permits. While we have allowed consumers to pick up coal through roadways, new railway tracks that are expected to be operational in the next few years will help liquidate large quantity of coal as and when they come up.”

Jayanta Roy, senior V-P, group head, corporate sector ratings at ICRA, said: “Coal requirement propelled by rising demand for power is expected to be better since certain sectors are on a recovery path. If that happens, demand for coal would rise and supplies are expected to be tight.” He said CIL production target for FY18 was set at 630 mt, later reset to 600 mt and the company ended up producing 567 mt."

33,2018-04-23,Coal India,"India’s biggest domestic institutional investor Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) was on a major shopping spree on Dalal Street this March quarter, even as the broader market weakened thanks to a series on domestic as well as global headwinds.

Data available with corporate database Ace Equity till April 20 showed LIC increased stakes in more than 35 companies from the BSE500 index. The insurer had exposure to nearly 200 companies on the index.

The insurance behemoth booked a record equity profit of Rs 25,000 crore last financial year, compared with Rs 19,000 crore it had earned in financial year 2016-17.

The domestic equity market witnessed a lot of volatility in the second half of March quarter owing to a Budget proposal to tax long-term equity gains, fears of a trade war following some protectionist measures by the Trump administration, geopolitical crises and signals from the US Fed to hike interest rates more rapidly than expected. This also triggered strong FII outflows from the domestic market.

But the domestic institutional investor increased stake in a couple of companies from across sectors, including rating agencies, IT, pharma, downstream oil and gas players, housing finance, select private banks, FMCG and power companies.

Among the large caps, Coal India saw LIC stake go up to 10.30 per cent at the end of March from 9.66 per cent as of December 31, 2017. LIC also raised its holding in oil marketing company HPCL (from 2.08 per cent to 2.17 per cent), L&T (17.94 per cent to 17.96 per cent), Tech Mahindra (3.60 per cent to 3.77 per cent), UltraTech Cement (2.33 per cent to 2.41 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (3.84 per cent to 4.89 per cent).

Oil marketing companies have since come under pressure amid soaring of crude oil prices, which are currently hovering around their three-year high levels.

Infrastructure major L&T has been seeing a lot of interest from institutional investors in recent times.

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recently named it as one of its preferred picks.


The public sector insurer also showed confidence in rating agencies during the quarter gone by, hiking stake in ICRA to 8.98 per cent from 7.45 per cent in December quarter. It held 5.88 per cent in Crisil as of March 31, 2018 against 5.45 per cent at the end of December quarter. ICRA shares are down 8 per cent in last one year, having slipped to Rs 3,812.50 as of April 20, 2018 from Rs 4,152 on the same day last year. Crisil is down around 0.77 per cent at Rs 1940.85 from Rs 1,955.90 that it had quoted a year ago.

LIC also showed confidence and raised stake in Castrol India, Adani Transmission, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Hindalco, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health, Swan Energy, Power Grid, Oracle Financial Services, ONGC, NHPC, Mindtree, ICICI Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Indraprastha Gas, Granules India and YES Bank.

Shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance are up 38 per cent in last one year. The company on Friday posted a 22.6 per cent rise in net profit for March quarter to Rs 1,030 crore from Rs 841 crore reported for the same period of last year.

Hindalco has been among top buy recommendations of analysts on Dalal Street following a major spike in aluminium prices. The stock is up 40 per cent in last one year.

Brokerage Edelweiss says Alcoa’s Q1CY18 numbers and guidance reinforce the belief that LME aluminium price will stay robust in the near term as unprecedented constraints in the global supply chain post sanctions on Rusal and cut in Alunorte’s production, smelter restarts/new capacity are expected to be slower or lower in China and ensure steady growth in global aluminium demand at 4.25-5.25 per cent. Alcoa is world’s sixth largest aluminium producer.

Taking cognizance of the improved outlook, Alcoa has revised its CY18 Ebitda guidance higher by 30 per cent. 

All domestic aluminium companies — Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco — will benefit in the near term, Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

Meanwhile, LIC holdings came down in companies such as Dena Bank, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank, UCO Bank, Tata Steel, Indian Hotels and Cipla."

42,2018-04-28,Coal India,"A record created at the beginning of last week might set the stage for a phase of new growth highs for India Inc.

On April 23, the market capitalisation of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) crossed the $100 billion milestone. It hit a high of $103 billion (Rs 6.8 lakh crore). The shares hit a high of Rs 3,557.00 on the BSE. Though the market capitalisation (m-cap) has slid from the day’s high, it has hovered around that level this week. TCS’ shares ended at Rs 3,454.80 on April 27, giving it a market capitalisation of $99.27 bn (Rs 6.61 lakh crore, at an exchange rate of Rs 66.62 to a dollar), according to the BSE.

This feat has thrown up the question, who is next? The spotlight is on Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank. Reliance Industries had hit a record high on April 27, registering a market cap at Rs 6.3 lakh crore. Next in line are ITC, Maruti Suzuki India and Hindustan Unilever. These companies make up the pack of possible $100 billion entities in India in a few years. TCS is now ranked 104 and Reliance 119 on the global list of companies by market capitalisation. HUL and Maruti are much lower in that order but the companies have been able to grow their market capitalisation at a faster clip over the past few years.


Market watchers are now asking if this is the beginning of a new phase of growth for Indian companies, where a bunch of them find mention in the global top 100 companies by m-cap.

But experts say crystal-gazing is pointless. The goalposts shift constantly in this game. After all, Reliance did break into the $100 billion club once, on October 18, 2007. That afternoon, 10.57 lakh shares of the company were traded, pushing the stock up by more than Rs 114, to its lifetime high of Rs 2,805. The m-cap hit Rs 4.07 lakh crore. The rupee was at Rs 39.9 to a dollar. It is Rs 66-67 to a dollar today. The timing is right for Reliance to go for a second attempt.


Given that a weaker rupee augurs well for TCS, which earns most of its Rs 1,23,100 crore annual revenue through exports, it is likely that the flagship of the Tata group is here to stay in the $100 billion club, or at least in the vicinity of the mark.

S Ramadorai, former managing director and vice-chairman of TCS, says any of the top 10 Indian companies by market capitalisation that has an export-oriented business can break into the $100 billion club, provided the rupee depreciates further. Ramadorai, who led TCS between 1996 and 2009 as MD, tells ET Magazine that the key to TCS’ success is the constant focus on technology, people and customer orientation.



Optimism for India Inc
Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Enterprises and a director of Tata group parent Tata Sons, says: “We applaud TCS on this achievement, which marks a significant milestone for India Inc. Such accomplishments serve to create a ripple effect by infusing a fresh wave of optimism and aspiration among Indian corporates.”

MD and CEO of Kotak Mutual Fund Nilesh Shah points out that TCS achieved this growth without raising money from the market after its initial public offering. He identifies rapid growth, consistent and adaptable management and consistent profitability as the three key attributes that can make a company great. “TCS has all three,” he adds.

Soon, there will be at least three or four Indian companies in the $100 billion bracket, says Raamdeo Agrawal, joint managing director of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. This achievement has shown the robustness of Indian businesses, he adds.


Fund manager Kenneth Andrade also says this is inevitable, if India grows from a $2.2 trillion economy to a $6-7 trillion economy in the next decade. The Indian market has been kept afloat by capital flows for six-seven years. However, it is now entering a phase where corporate profitability will become the main driver. He sees the profitability of the Indian corporate sector doubling in four years. “It cannot happen without a bunch of Indian companies in the top bracket.”

Shah of Kotak, however, disagrees with this theory and says only HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries seem poised to enter the $100 billion club anytime soon. First, there is the issue of the moving goalpost, due to the rupee-dollar rate fluctuations. This keeps the $100 billion mark in rupee terms constantly on the move. Second, Shah says, the Indian economy at $2.2 trillion is still small and Indian companies will need to wait for the economy to grow.

Keeping the rupee factor aside, there will have to be a constant focus on profitability, along with turnover, to drive the market capitalisation of Indian companies towards $100 billion. Market capitalisation can be a tricky game and is never a flat race, say experts.


Take, for instance, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the biggest Indian company by turnover. It often makes the global 500 list of companies by gross sales. Last year, IOC came in at 161. But it is way behind on market cap, with its profit margins being an abysmally low 5%.

But public sector undertakings (PSUs) can play the m-cap game too. The year 2011 saw PSUs like Coal India and ONGC topping the Indian market cap league table for brief periods. HDFC Bank, currently at third position with an m-cap of Rs 4.98 lakh crore, had also raced ahead of Reliance for some time in early 2017.

Then there is the question of sustainability on companies that show fast growth in m-cap. Hindustan Unilever recorded a 59.9% growth in m-cap in a year to Rs 3.19 lakh crore, and the scrip is currently trading at a price-earnings multiple of 63. Maruti Suzuki, with Rs 3.3 lakh crore in m-cap, has seen its m-cap grow at a staggering 33% compound annual growth rate for three years. But ITC, which is ahead of both these companies at Rs 3.4 lakh crore, has actually seen no growth in m-cap in the past one year. It has registered a CAGR of 6% over the past three years.


The banking sector could throw up the next $100 billion company, especially as talks of a merger are abound in the market. Would a merger of HDFC Bank with HDFC or, say, ICICI Bank; or a merger of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank fuel a spurt in market capitalisation in the sector? Kotak’s Shah says such mergers are not necessarily m-cap accretive and can reduce valuations too.

To enter this higher echelon of the corporate world, says Shankar Sharma, the cofounder and chief strategist at First Global, Indian companies need to become global in their footprint. “Most large Indian companies do not operate in pure-tech space. This is one reason why we don’t have companies with $100 billion m-cap. Old-economy companies have clients across the world but cannot scale up like a tech company.” TCS entering the $100 billion club, says Sharma, is like a batsman hitting a triple century and should be celebrated.

Former Tata Sons director R Gopalakrishnan, who was also part of HUL’s top management before moving to the Tata group, says it makes him emotional to see two companies he has been associated with doing well. Taking the cricket analogy further, he adds: “TCS achieving $100 billion is undoubtedly fantastic, but it is like the crowning glory of one innings. Many more innings loom — to be played and to be won in the years ahead by the same batsman. But to use this triple century in one innings to predict more triple centuries by other batsmen is hope and ambition, rather than a likely outcome.”

Piramal says TCS has clearly marked out a pathway for others. “This is a brilliant example of how Indian players can create a global impact by leveraging a values-driven culture, robust corporate governance and a strong entrepreneurial spirit to ensure a constant state of transformative growth,” Piramal adds.

The biggest of Indian companies will seek their global place when seeking to grow inorganically, says Ramadorai. “I am sure they will rightfully aim for a position on the global scene. Acquisitions are an ongoing process globally, based on merits and synergies, and I am confident that Indian multinational companies will continue to play an active role.”

Shah of Kotak Mutual Fund says TCS’s success will surely rub off on brand India. “When a company reaches the $100 billion mark, it starts to create a brand name for itself. The brand value thus created rubs off on the country from which it originates. Brand India stands to gain significantly from TCS’ achievement. Beyond that, employee morale goes up, client opening become easy, growth becomes easier and as a company, you don’t ha ve to hard sell yourself to get clients once you reach that mark. You just have to keep up the quality of your delivery.”"

4,2018-05-02,Coal India,"Coal India increased supplies to power sector by 14% on the back of a 17% rise in production and a 13% growth in sales during April.

According to data released by Coal India, all its coal producing subsidiaries have recorded production and sales growth during the month.

The public sector coal major produced 44.84 million tonnes of coal during the month – a 6.40 million tonnes rise in comparison to the previous corresponding period. It sold nearly 51 million tonnes of the dry fuel, thus registering a near 6 million tonnes growth against 45.14 million tonnes in the previous period.

CIL supplied 40.30 million tonnes of coal to the power sector during the month against 35.20 million tonnes on a comparative month to month basis. It managed a 5.1 million tonnes rise.

Increased supplies to the power sector helped the sector increase its inventory from a little over 7 million tonnes six months ago, to 16 million tonnes on April 30, 2018.

“The constant synergistic efforts between Coal India and railways to improve transport logistics led to a situation where average rake loading per day increased significantly by 23 during April 2018” said a senior Coal India executive.

Rake loading per day during April 2018 grew 10.4% as the company loaded 246 rakes per day on an average compared to 223 rakes per day during April 2017.

It managed to bring down pithead stock by 6.13 million tonnes in April 2018. CIL began the fiscal 2018-19 with a pithead stock of 55.67 million tonnes which stood at 49.54 million tonnes at the closure of the month.

“The adequately stocked pit-head coal provides cushion in meeting demand from multi-sectoral consuming segments,” said the executive."

5,2018-05-02,Coal India,"In a note for Wednesday’s session, it was mentioned that volatility (India VIX) was likely to remain at one of the lowest values in recent times. Today’s trade, however, saw volatility making a comeback, as the Nifty oscillated in a 60-point before settling with a nominal loss. The Index lost 21.30 points or 0.20 per cent.

 The market consolidated for the session, but at the same time, remained quite volatile. We expect this volatility to spill over into Thursday’s trade as well.

 Though the start to the trade may be uneventful on either side, we will see the market consolidating with the levels of 10,785 acting as immediate resistance area. On Thursday, the levels of 10,760 and 10,785 will offer resistance to any upmoves, while supports will come in at 10,680 and 10,650 zones.

 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stands at 67.7129. It remains neutral against the price showing no divergence. The daily MACD stays bullish trading above its signal line. On the candles, a black candle emerged. This has occurred near the upper Bollinger band, and this typically stalls an ongoing upmove.



 Pattern analysis reveals that after breaking out from a rectangle formation, the Nifty is consolidating at higher levels. Though some retracement from current levels should not come as a surprise, it has continued to consolidate in a capped range at present.

 Overall, as we approach trade on Thursday, if we see such consolidation continuing, it should be healthy for the market. Some shorts have started to get build up once again as we are see Nifty premiums getting reduced by nearly 25 points.

 We expect the levels of 10,785 acting as resistance for the immediate short term, and expect the market to oscillate with limited downsides.

 We recommend avoiding shorts and utilising downsides, if any, to make select purchases. Volatility too is likely to remain ingrained in the market.

 Overall exposures should be kept moderate while maintaining a cautious view on the market.

10,2018-05-06,Coal India,"State-run Coal India (CIL) revved up fuel supplies to power plants by 14.4 per cent to 40.30 million tonnes in April compared to the same month last year ahead of the monsoon season, according to an official.

Coal supplies to the power sector from CIL in April 2017 were 35.20 million tonnes (MT).

""The volume increase was 5.1 MTs,"" the official said.

CIL has gradually improved coal stocks at power plants to around 16 MT as of April 30 from that of a little over 7 MT six months ago, the official added.

The government earlier had ruled out any possibility of coal shortage in the upcoming monsoon season and asserted that it had sufficient stocks to meet the demand of power plants.

""The constant synergistic efforts between CIL and railways to improve the transport logistics led to a situation where the average rake loading per day increased significantly by 23.1 rakes during April 2018,"" the official said.

Rake loading per day last month to the whole coal consuming sector grew by 10.4 per cent as CIL loaded 245.7 rakes on an average compared to 222.6 rakes per day during April 2017.

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier asked the Railways to increase coal loading to up to 500 rakes per day to meet increased power demand in summer.

The minister in March had reviewed the coal stock position at various power plants and coal loading by Indian Railways.

During the meeting, it was decided that coal loading would be stepped up to 500 rakes per day to ensure power supplies are not impacted due to fuel shortage at the plants.

Power, coal and railway ministries had taken a series of measures to improve coal supplies to plants after electricity prices crossed Rs 11 per unit at energy exchanges in September last.

In January, the government decided on various steps, including the use of dedicated rail transportation and setting up of power projects only within 500 km from coal mines, to boost supplies to power plants.


According to the latest Central Electricity Authority data, 32 power plants out of 114 plants with total generation capacity of 140,065 MW were facing fuel shortage as of May 1. Primary reasons were less allocation of coal by companies."

“Market gained momentum as yields slid after RBIs open market operation, while rupee weakened further due to higher oil prices.

12,2018-05-07,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Investors’ interest may return to the stock of Cummins India Limited (CIL), an Indian subsidiary of Cummins Inc and maker of engines and genset, because of fading concerns of margin dilution due to outsourcing to group-related companies and diminishing competitive intensity in higher horsepower (HHP) engines segment.

The stock of Cummins India has shed nearly 20 per cent since the beginning of the year mainly because of fears that increased outsourcing from the group companies, such as Cummins Technologies India Limited (CTIL) and Tata Cummins, is margin-dilutive and it could restrict revenue growth. But now clarity seems to be emerging that investors’ concern could have been exaggerated.

Although there has been a sizeable increase in outsourcing by the company, it is primarily from Tata Cummins Limited (TCL), which is a JV company with 50 per cent stake of the parent company. In Cummins India, the parent stake is at 51 per cent. Therefore, it will not change much for the profit of the parent, or move profit from one entity to other.



Nomura said: “Tata Cummins has been manufacturing engines used in the CV segment, thus moving the up-fit of these engines to TCL by CIL is a decision justified by the economics of scale.” Secondly, the share of engine revenues of CTIL has not materially changed in the past few years. The engine business contributed 15 per cent of the total revenues in FY16.

Even on the financial parameters, it does not appear that outsourcing has been margin-dilutive. The gross margin — revenues minus the cost of raw material — has been steady in the range of 35-38 per cent in the past three years and is in line with those of peers such as Greaves Cotton and Kirloskar Oil Engine. Gross margin provides the correct picture of outsourcing as it captures the impact of traded goods in the total raw-material cost. The margins, in the first nine months of FY18, are better than the previous two years, which may alleviate investors’ fear that rising outsourcing is diluting margins. In fact, EBITDA margins compression of CIL is actually a reflection of underutilisation of capacity.

The revenue growth of CIL is likely to be supported by growth from the data centre, pick-up in road construction and higher oil prices. The company has been continuously gaining market share in the domestic engine market with an overall market share of 40 per cent and 70 per cent in the HHP segment. The exit of import-dependent engine suppliers, such as Volvo and MTU, has favoured the company. In the medium term, standby power for the data centre is likely to be a key growth driver for CIL as companies such as Tata Communication, NTT, Vodafone and IBM are planning to set up new data centres. According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, Indian data centre industry could reach $7billion by 2020 from $2.2 billion in 2015.

CIL’s stock is trading at 23.3 times its FY20 projected earnings, which is at a 10 per cent discount to the sector average despite better return on equity."

19,2018-05-08,Coal India,"KOLKATA: As many as 32 power plants out of 114 in India have coal stockpiles that will last for seven days or less, a situation not seen in several months, as generating stations unexpectedly stepped up capacity utilisation following a rise in demand for electricity.

The 32 plants, with an installed capacity of 36,852 MW, account for 26% of generation capacities that get coal from state-owned Coal India and Singareni Collieries. The two entities together supply coal to plants with 140 GW of generation capacity in the country through long-term contracts.

Of the 32 stations, 22 plants have coal stocks that will last for four days or less, according to data released by the Central Electricity Authority. Ten plants have coal inventories that are enough for less than seven days. The average coal stock availability for all plants was 10 days. During the same time last year, only nine plants had critical or super critical stocks and the average stock levels were adequate for 16 days.

According to CEA’s data, the number of plants with critical stocks hovered at about 20 in February and increased gradually to 32 last week, the highest level in recent times. According to Coal India executives, several factors resulted in the current situation. Some 8,000 MW of imported coal-based generation capacity shut down late last year because their tariffs were not remunerative enough and their customers shifted to plants that run on domestic coal, the executives said.

“Operational plants are witnessing increased capacity utilisation and in turn have been consuming more coal than they were originally expected to,” an official said. “This, coupled with a moderate rise in demand, has resulted in a situation where stocks at plants have started to deplete, although Coal India has been loading at least 250 rakes a day, one of the highest in recent times.”

CEA’s data indicate that capacity utilisation at several plants has crossed 80% and in some cases, touched 90%. “Coal despatch is about 11% more than last year. 

In fact, we are supplying more than what we are producing and are eating into pithead stocks, which were at about 56 million tonnes towards the beginning of the financial year,” the official said."
20,2018-05-08,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Power ministry's meeting with Reserve Bank of India on the revised RBI norms for bad loans scheduled for today has been postponed. 

""It (the meeting) has been postponed. (The meeting will take place) some other day,"" Power Minister R K Singh told reporters on the sidelines of a function. 

The ministry had earlier approached the central bank seeking relaxation from stringent RBI norms for the power sector, a source said. 

The minister further said the government was also planning to bid out about 40,000-50,000 MW of renewable power this year. 

Reserve Bank had come out with 'Resolution of Stressed Assets-Revised Framework' on February 12, 2018. 

Post this circular, all other RBI guidelines for handling short-term and long-term issues regarding loan management (flexible structuring of loans-5/25 scheme, SDR, S-4A, CDR scheme etc.) have been withdrawn. 

According to the circular, even a one-day default in debt servicing would require reporting to RBI and implementation of Resolution Plan. 

All accounts with exposure of Rs 2,000 crore and above, on or after March 1, 2018 and in default have to formulate a resolution plan within 180 days failing which the case has to be mandatorily referred to NCLT for Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings. 

The Association of Power Producers had written to RBI and Prime Minister Narendra Modi that more than 75,000 MW assets - under operation or under construction - are severely stressed due to reasons including lower availability of coal, pending receivables from discoms, among others. 

It said there are Rs 8,300 crore of receivables currently and more than two years of delay in receiving orders from Regulatory Commissions to pass on the increase in cost of coal due to various taxes and duties which are to be treated as 'Change in Law'. 

Also, around Rs 7,800 crore is stuck as regulatory receivables due to delay in orders and dispute being raised by discoms at the higher court, and this amount is increasing progressively. 

The association also drew attention towards short supply of coal as Coal India supplies only 60 per cent of fuel required. 

It also sought to extend the implementation period of Resolution Plan from 180 days to one year as ""the current timeline to complete the resolution plan is extremely difficult."" 

The association demanded that RBI should relax ""default"" clause from one-day delay in debt servicing and classify the asset as NPA (bad loan) only after the completion of 180-day period. SID

SID ANU ANU"
21,2018-05-08,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected the government’s demand to relax the guidelines on resolution of stressed assets for power companies, pushing over 20,000 MW projects closer to liquidation. In a letter to the power ministry, RBI has expressed its inability to provide any relaxation to power plants saying it does not look into sectoral issues.

“The regulator has said it was difficult to give any special treatment to any one sector and has said such issues must be addressed by the concerned ministries,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “RBI has made it clear that the administrative ministries, lenders and the developers need to find immediate solution to the stressed assets or send them into liquidation without wasting any further time,” another official said.

A meeting between power minister RK Singh and RBI officials on Tuesday was postponed due to unavoidable circumstances, the official said. The ministry has also flagged the issue to finance minister Arun Jaitely and other ministry officials. The power ministry had written to RBI asking for extension of the 180 days resolution period for power projects to one year.

As per the revised framework, projects with interest or principal overdue starting from 1 day to 30 days will be categorised as ‘special mention accounts category-0’ (SMO-0). The most stringent change in the framework is that all the lenders have to agree upon a resolution that has to be reached in 180 days. Sector experts said while some of the power sector issues, including coal shortage and regulatory problems, could be addressed by the government, issues like lack of power purchase agreements (PPAs) required a pick-up of economic activity.

Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said: “Financial stress in power sector is outcome of systemic issues. Therefore ignoring these sectoral issues and looking for resolution to financial distress is like treating symptoms without curing the disease. This will result in significant value erosion of these assets without any corresponding gain as the new owner if there are takers will inherit same problems - a sub optimal solution.”

Electricity demand in India has grown over the past few months to over 6% but is not commensurate with the growth in addition of generation capacity.

ET had reported on May 4 that the State Bank of India proposed a scheme – Samadhan – to float a fund to takeover 14 stressed power plants aimed at preventing power generation projects from going into liquidation, receiving better valuations and speedy resolution.

SBI had also sought waiver of transmission penalties during ownership change and early regulatory approvals to favour new promoters. The first official quoted earlier told ET that the government is looking into the proposal.

The government last year auctioned contracts of Coal India under Shakti scheme salvaging about 9,000MW plants that did not have coal supply.

The power ministry has also kicked off a scheme to aggregate power demand from states and call PPAs for 2,500MW supply to relieve some of the stressed assets. There are about 19,000MW plants without PPAs, coal or both. Another 24,000-mw gas based power plants are either underutilised or stranded."

23,2018-05-10,Coal India,"Coal India has decided to transfer each of its 20,000-odd executives every five years in an effort to improve their skill sets and prevent external parties from forming a nexus with employees.

The policy would lead to 4,000 transfers every year on an average. “The new transfer policy has just been implemented and will allow executives to enhance their experience in a number of fields,” a senior Coal India executive told ET.

“Everyone would get a chance to try out new jobs within the company. It will help Coal India produce better general managers with all round experience about functioning of the company.”

He said it is also expected to break nexus that often develops between group of executives and other external parties leading to vigilance cases. 

“Departmental or areawise transfer every five years is also expected to curb such developments which requires lot of effort on the part of the management to solve,” the executive said.

The first set of transfers after fifth year will be interdepartmental for executive working at subsidiary headquarters or at Coal India headquarters in Kolkata. For example, an executive employed in the marketing and sales department may be transferred to purchases department within the same headquarters.

For executives working at mining projects, the transfer would be from one area to another within the same project.

After the 10th year, the executive would be eligible for transfer to a new project under the same subsidiary. “Employees postings can also be rotated before completion of 10 years on administrative ground if the needs arises,” another CIL India executive said.

On completion of 15th year, the executive will be eligible to be transferred to a new subsidiary or to Coal India.

“This will allow every new recruit to work for at least three units under Coal India,” said the executive quoted above."

40,2018-05-14,Coal India,"KOLKATA: About 50% of Coal India’s receivables from power companies, estimated at Rs 9,000 crore, are from four stateowned companies, its executives said.

“Total receivables from NTPC, Damodar Valley Corporation, Mahagenco and West Bengal Power Development Corporation is around Rs 4,500 crore,” a senior executive of state-run Coal India told ET. “Of this, NTPC owes us Rs 3,500 crore, which is a shade over one third of the total dues.”

A senior executive of NTPC whom ET spoke with said, “Outstanding as a result of mismatch in actual quality of coal delivered and the quality on which billing has been done is around Rs 1,400 crore. Another Rs 1,600 crore are old dues, which also relate to quality mismatch. However, since there has always been a mismatch in quality claimed to be delivered and actual quality delivered, certain amount always remains outstanding, which gets settled only when both parties agrees to the final outcome. It takes times.”

Damodar Valley Corporation, Mahagenco and West Bengal Power Development Corporation together owe Coal India about Rs 1,000 crore, a Coal India executive said. In the case of Damodar Valley Corporation, which sells bulk of its power to states like Bihar and Jharkhand, payments from these two states are irregular, leading to large dues. It affects the power company’s ability to settle the outstanding with Coal India, though the company is in regular touch with these states for settling dues.

Coal India’s dues from power companies had touched Rs 12,300 crore in February 2018, which has declined to about Rs 9,000 crore in May following regular follow up by the executives."

Overall, we have a bullish outlook on the index for the short term with a target Rs 10,910 and reversal placed at Rs 10,500, says Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 10 stock strategies that can potentially deliver gains over the next three weeks.


Jay Purohit - Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Centrum Broking

Tech Mahindra | BUY | Target Price: Rs 700–715 | Stop loss: Rs 646
TechM has given a breakout in second week of April and rallied sharply. However, it started moving in a corrective phase from last three weeks. The correction seems to be over as the stock is rebounding after retesting the ‘Breakout Trendline’, which also coincides with the ‘SuperTrend’ indicator on daily chart. Since the momentum oscillator ‘RSI’ is placed positively along with the set of moving averages on daily timeframe, we are expecting a rally towards Rs 700–715 in coming days. Thus, any decline towards Rs 655 should be used as a buying opportunity with a stop-loss of Rs 646.


GAIL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 375–385 | Stop loss: Rs 325
The ‘200 EMA’ on daily chart and ‘55 EMA’ on weekly chart acted as a strong support for the stock in the last couple of years. Recently, the stock has again taken the support around the mentioned moving averages and started rebounding. The consolidation of last ten weeks has resulted in formation of an ‘Inverse Head & Shoulder’ pattern on daily chart. 

On Monday, we witnessed a breakout from the mentioned pattern with decent volumes. Looking at these technical evidences, we are expecting a rally towards 375–385 levels in coming 2-3 weeks. Thus, long positions can be taken at the current juncture as well as on declines to Rs 335 with a stop-loss of Rs 325.


Subash Gangadharan, Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

ICICI Bank | BUY | Target Price: Rs 355 | Stop loss: Rs 290
ICICI Bank is one of the strongest stocks in the market currently. This week, the stock broke out of the Rs 274-295 trading range on the back of above average volumes. The stock also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily and weekly momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought. 


Hindustan Oil Exploration | BUY | Target Price: Rs 155 | Stop loss: Rs 121
Hind Oil Exploration has rallied smartly and broken above its recent highs of Rs 129.2 in the process. The stock also trades above the 13-day and 50-day SMA. Daily momentum readings are in rising mode and not extremely overbought.


Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher

BPCL | BUY | Target Price: Rs 450 | Stop loss: Rs 375
The stock has witnessed a decent erosion from the peak of around Rs 545 and has bottomed out at around Rs 375 levels, consolidating for some time to see a positive bias developing and producing a bullish candle pattern in daily chart. The chart looks attractive for a decent rise from here on, with the RSI indicating a trend reversal recently and also the MACD showing a positive trigger for an upmove. With rising volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock. 


Bajaj Finance | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,975 | Stop loss : Rs 1,800
The stock has gradually corrected from its peak of Rs 1,960 to give a bottoming out indication at around Rs 1,820 levels and currently a positive bullish candle pattern indicates an uptrend with a positive bias. RSI is showing a trend reversal to signal a buy. The stock has maintained above the significant 50DMA and we anticipate a rise from here on to scale till Rs 1,970 levels.


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Nestle | BUY | Target Price: Rs 10,600 | Stop loss: Rs 8,900
With new life time highs, this counter appears to be on the verge of a fresh breakout above its 3-month old ascending channel, which can throw up a target placed around Rs 10,600 levels. Hence, positional traders shall make use of this opportunity to go long at current prices and accumulate further between Rs 9,200–9,100 levels if available for a target of Rs 10,600 with a stop loss of Rs 8,900.


Firstsource Solutions | BUY | Target Price: Rs 78 | Stop loss: Rs 63
With a fresh breakout on price and volume front after recent results, this counter looks poised to head much higher levels. Hence, traders should make use of current consolidation phase to buy now and accumulate at lower levels on declines up to Rs 65 for a target of Rs 78.


NIIT | BUY | Target Price: Rs 121 | Stop loss: Rs 103
After the recent surge from the lows of Rs 84, this counter is in a multi-week corrective and consolidation phase and appears to have hit a bottom after testing its 50-day EMA in last session. Hence, positional traders can create longs with a stop below Rs 103 on closing basis for a target of Rs 121.


Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA 

Emami | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,125 | Stop loss: Rs 1,018
In the recent past, the stock has grossly underperformed not only the general markets but also the FMCG pack. After resisting near the confluence of 100-DMA and 200-DMA, the stock has attempted to find a temporary bottom near the Rs 1,030-1,050 zones. Though this may not signal the reversal of trend, a technical pullback is likely. 

RSI has just moved above 30 from an oversold situation and this is bullish. On Weekly Charts, RSI forms a higher bottom and is seen reversing. A candle with a long lower shadow resembling a not-so-classical hammer has emerged on weekly charts. It has emerged near the support area of 200-period Moving Average and therefore, holds significance. It is also confirmed by higher than average volumes. Some upward revision of price can be expected in this stock.


Coal India | BUY | Target Price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 262
For the last couple of months, the stock has not made any major headway and is trading in a broad range of Rs 262- 299 zones. The stock has tested the lower support level of this trading range and looks for a technical pullback. A buy signal over stochastic has emerged with a bullish divergence against the price. RSI has just moved above the oversold area and this is bullish. We might see stock staging a technical pullback even if it continues to remain in the present broad trading range.

I have 50,000 shares of Gammon Infra at Rs 3.21. Shall I book profit or wait? —JITEN ROHIRA
The stock was trading at less than half of its book value before its suspension from the exchange. It has invested about 80% of its total assets in the subsidiaries, SPVs, joint ventures, etc and a majority of these investee companies are facing major business constraints. Hence, I suggest exiting this stock if you get any chance to transact in the stock exchange in future.


I am holding 450 shares of Coal India at Rs 340 from January 2015. Shall I hold or switch to Cochin Shipyard? — UMAR HASAN

Yes, relatively Cochin Shipyard is better as it is a perfect thematic play on growing naval defence monitoring and growing & also expanding its repair segment (which is highly profitable business) in a big way.


I hold 32 shares of GIC Re at Rs 867 and 20 shares of Khadim India at Rs 750. Both were allotted during the IPO. Should I hold or sell? — VIRENDRA SHARMA

I suggest a hold on Khadim India with a short-term target price of around Rs 850. I firmly suggest adding more shares of GIC Re at current price to reduce your average cost – over 20% fall in its stock price from its listing price, relatively cheaper valuation, expansion plans of international business and robust growth of outlook of domestic insurance industry give me a lot of confidence in this reinsurance stock.


I hold 50 shares of Visa Steel purchased at Rs 24.50 and 100 shares of Bharat ETF 22 purchased at Rs 32.90. Should I hold or sell?—MANJUSHA
At this juncture it is quite risky to hold Visa Steel as there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the resolution for its debt issue. There is a possibility of both lenders and stakeholders sacrificing their material interests in the process of its debt resolution. If you are a long term investor, you may hold Bharat ETF as this kind of ETF can give significant returns only in the long term.


As a long term investor, I hold stocks of Alembic Pharma, Granules, Indoco Remedies, Venus Remedies, Marksans and JBChemicals. What should I hold and what are the prospectsin the next 3 months? —AK RAMDAS
On comparative basis, Alembic Pharma, Granules and JB Chemcials look much better in terms of valuation and balance sheet. Hence, you may hold only these three pharma stocks out of six held.


I hold ICICI Lombard. What should I do? —ANIKET KULSHRESHTHA
In the short term, valuation of ICICI Lombard valuation is highly stretched and therefore, you may hold it only if you are a long term investor.


Disclosure: We personally invested in JB Chemicals

41,2018-05-15,Coal India,"By Andy Mukherjee

Enron Corp. is long gone, but the scandal it left behind in India has beguiled the country’s lenders for almost two decades.

However, if the bankers who financed the U.S. energy company’s unviable power plant in Maharashtra state aren’t ruing that 2,000-megawatt debacle any more, it’s only because they’re now staring at a mess 20 times bigger.

India’s total electricity-generation ability is 344,000 megawatts, a 72 percent increase over six years. The country, notorious for its outages, still doesn’t have a power surplus. But coal-fired plants in the private sector that ran at 84 percent capacity utilization at the start of the decade are struggling to stay alive with load factors of 55 percent. As much as 40,000 megawatts of capacity — equal to 20 Enron plants — has become stressed assets for the banking system.

Lenders, on the hook for $26 billion, are yet to classify these exposures as nonperforming, let alone provide for losses out of (their increasingly nonexistent) profits. However, now that the central bank is forcing them to clean up their act, they’re trying to think of creative solutions. According to BloombergQuint, the banks will convert debt that’s unsustainable into equity and sell those shares to a jointly owned asset management company. The AMC will hawk its controlling stakes in power producers after a turnaround.

Bloomberg

A better idea may to be to fix the underlying profitability of the power business. 

Forget long-term power purchase agreements. State utilities are shy to sign such contracts anyway and prone to ditch them at the first hint of cheaper electricity in the wholesale market. Let most of the demand and supply move to exchanges with open access for all bulk buyers and sellers, says Hemant Kanoria, chairman of India Power Corp., a 99-year-old company involved in both electricity generation and distribution.

Bloomberg

The share of power trading in the country’s overall demand-supply equation has been stagnant for years at about 10 percent. This needs to change. 

The other big issue, as Kanoria rightly notes, is coal. India has no shortage of the fuel, but its dominant miner, which met 95 percent of its 600 million ton production target last year, needs to crack the whip on underperforming subsidiaries.

Power plants’ coal inventories are falling, and linking domestic availability to whether a producer has a long-term electricity purchase agreement with a state utility isn’t helping. Rather than continue with a less-than-satisfactory auction system, let Coal India Ltd. fix a price at which it would assure supply to whoever is willing to pay and take away the feedstock.

Finally, financing costs, which have ballooned to half of the total expense of putting up a power plant, need a tweak. Restructuring unserviceable loans into other instruments — such as preference shares — would give producers some breathing room, Kanoria says. 

It’s silly of lenders to expect that debt with annual interest rates of 16-percent-plus won’t eventually turn bad. Dragging borrowers to the bankruptcy tribunal won’t solve anything. Most assets would sell for scrap value; jobs would be lost. Sweeping the problem under the carpet of an asset management company may preserve employment, but the immediate financial hit to banks could upset their already weak capital position. Besides, if existing owners are booted out, who will run the plants?

It was relatively easy to leave Enron’s Indian unit in the care of a couple of state-run companies, as the government did in 2005. That can’t be a template for a problem 20 times larger."

55,2018-05-16,Coal India,"The government today said it has finalised the methodology for rationalisation of coal linkages for independent power producers (IPP).

Under the new methodology, dry fuel can be supplied to IPP plants by a coal company other than the one with which they have signed the pact.

The methodology was approved on the basis of the recommendations of a an inter-ministerial task force to optimise transportation cost, among other benefits.

""Coal linkage rationalisation shall be an exercise in which the coal linkage of a TPP (thermal power plant) of an IPP may be transferred from one Coal Company to another based on the availability during the fiscal and future coal production plan of the coal company,"" the Ministry of Coal said in a statement.

It said an Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted to undertake a comprehensive review of existing coal sources of IPPs having linkages and consider the feasibility for rationalisation of these sources with a view to optimise transportation cost, given the various technical constraints.

The statement said the exercise will be voluntary on the part of the TPPs and aims aims to reduce the distance by which coal travels, thus, easing up the railway infrastructure for utilisation for other sectors.

""The one time process of calling for the requests of the IPP for linkage rationalisation shall be undertaken jointly by CIL, SCCL and CEA in a transparent manner,"" it said.

This linkage rationalization shall be considered only for IPPs having linkages through allotment route, the statement said, adding that they will also state the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) for which the linkage rationalisation shall be requested.

It said the Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) of the rationalized source from any coal company would be signed/implemented only after the appropriate Electricity Regulatory Commission approves the supplementary agreement.

On disputes, the government said these will be resolved as per the provision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

""The proposed rationalisation of linkages is transparent, objective and creates a level playing field for IPPs in each domain. It attempts to make optimal rationalisation of the vital natural resources across the power units of IPPs,"" the statement said.

It said the reduced landed price of coal will lead to savings in the cost of power generated as well as coal transportation.

The savings will be passed on to the Discom/ consumers of power."

57,2018-05-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Damodar Valley Corporation and a state-owned distribution company in West Bengal that are receiving fuel at a discounted price from Coal India on long-term contracts must sell their electricity locally in India and should not be allowed to export that, especially at a time when the country is facing a coal supply scarcity, said a clutch of private power companies.

They have raised objection through the Association of Power Producers, which urged the coal and power ministry to stop export of power generated from coal priced at a discount and meant for consumption in India. This comes after both public sector power companies won bids to supply electricity to Bangladesh.

In a letter to both the power and coal ministries, Ashok Khurana, director-general of the association, said while Coal India is unable to meet its obligations under fuel supply agreements, usage of domestic coal for power supply to Bangladesh would be very inequitable for domestic generation companies which are unable to meet their power purchase obligations for want of adequate coal. ET has seen a copy of the letter.



“It is requested that necessary clarification may be issued so that cross-border supply of power should be from imported coal or from fuel procured at e-auction. This can be taken up with Bangladesh Power Development Board, and an undertaking from bidders may be made part of the bid, saying that they will not use domestic linkage coal for such cross-border supply of power,” Khurana said in the letter.

Bangladesh and India have created a power corridors of 1000 mw in each sides. Following this, Bangladesh now intends to buy 1000 mw of power from Indian producers and has recently invited bids in two tranches.

Damodar Valley Corporation and West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company have emerged successful bidders for the first tranche of 500 mw that was concluded sometime back. These PSUs have indicated that the source of fuel would be coal priced at a discount and procured through supply contract from Coal India.

Damodar Valley would be selling 300 mw through NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam at a levelised tariff of Rs 3.84 per unit in the short run.

While it has also won the bid for supplying 300 mw at a levelised tariff of Rs 5.28 per unit in the long run.

Source of coal for both the short and the long run would be domestic coal procured at a discount from Coal India.

Its bid was followed by West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company offer for supplying 200 mw at Rs 3.97 per unit in the short run using domestic discounted coal.

“The second tranche of bid results are expected to be announced this week where PSUs like Gridco have also participated. They may be using coal meant for domestic consumption,” said a senior power sector executive.

A power sector executive said: “Almost 250 mw power is flowing to Bangladesh from West Bengal’s power pool since October 2013. Their contract has been extended several times and there is no mention of source of coal for generation of power for export in the guidelines.”

A former NTPC official said the cross-border policy issued by the Centre for exporting power from India stipulates that one-time approval is required for exporting electricity by discoms or public sector entities, if surplus capacity is available and it is certified by a distribution licensee. He also said that any coal-based Indian thermal project other than public sector undertakings shall be eligible for power exports to neighbouring countries only if surplus capacity is certified by a designated authority.

“It is likely that this requirement has not been adhered to uniformly by all bidders. This means that any bidder securing bids based on coal procured at notified price for power generation, or from captive mines, would lock in part domestic coal resources for external consumption for several years, thus hampering domestic consumers’ interest and would be in violation of policy framework,” said Ashok Khurana."

68,2018-05-18,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is all set to get a new fulltime chairman, however, he is slated to retire in less than two years. The development comes eight months after its last fulltime chairman retired in August and two acting chairmen were appointed in the interim.

Anil Kumar Jha, chairman and managing director of subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields, is likely to take over as the chairman of its holding company, Coal India.

Jha will replace acting chairman Suresh Kumar, an IAS officer, who has been holding the post of additional secretary at the ministry of coal. Jha will remain the chairman till his retirement which falls due on January 31, 2020 – less than two years from now.

With this development Coal India will finally have a fulltime chairman after eight months. Following retirement of Sutirtha Bhattacharya, the fulltime chairman of Coal India, in August, the ministry of coal appointed Gopal Singh – the chairman and managing director of Coal India subsidiary, Central Coalfields, as Coal India’s acting chairman for three months. His tenure as acting chairman got extended twice and was prematurely terminated in May this year. He was replaced by another acting chairman Kumar.

According to a document available with ET, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has issued the directive recently although Coal India is yet to receive an official communication from the government. According to the document the ministry of coal has been apprised to the decision by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.

In June last year the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) which was entrusted with the task of finding a candidate for the chairman’s post at Coal India after interviewing half a dozen candidates could not find any one suitable for the post.

According Coal India executives Jha took over as the chairman of Mahanadi Coalfields on November 1, 2015. This subsidiary supplies almost 25% of the nation’s requirement of thermal coal and is one of the largest among all its eight coal producing subsidiaries.

Jha is an MTech in Mine Planning & Design from the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, Jharkhand. He comes with a rich work experience spanning 32 years in the field of mine planning, production, management supervision, direction and control of underground as well as open cast coal mines.

69,2018-05-20,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Coal imports by power utilities fell by 22.23 per cent to 3.73 million tonnes in April mainly due to decline in shipments by imported coal based power projects in the country. 

According to latest data compiled by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), coal imports by the power utilities came down to 3.731 million tonnes (MT) in April this year from 4.798 MT in April 2017 mainly due to lower deliveries at imported coal based plants. 

In April 2018, however, the total coal imports by power utilities for blending with domestic coal rose to 1.427 MT from 1.078 MT in April last year. 

The scope of reducing coal import is always more at power plants using domestic coal as they use high gross calorific value imported fuel for blending. 

The data shows that the coal imports came down by imported coal based power plants in April this year. These plants imported 2.304 MT of coal in April 2018 down from 3.720 MT in the same month a year ago. 

Experts think that higher international coal prices may have been affecting imports by the power plants based on imported coal. 

During April, among imported coal based plants, Tata Power's Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project received 0.509 MT compared to 0.689 MT in the same month a year ago. Similarly, Adani's 4620 MW Mundra Plant received 0.091 MT imported coal down from 1.322 MT a year ago. 

Essar's 1200 MW Salaya plant and Simhapuri Energy 600 MW plant did not get any imported coal during April this year. However, the two plants had received 0.109 MT and 0.004 MT imported coal during April last year. 

Coal imports by power utilities in January, February and March this year stood at 4.339 MT, 4.060 MT, 4.396 MT respectively, which indicates a good start in April this year. 

However, the power sector experts said that there may be increase in coal imports by not only power utilities but by other sectors as well mainly due to transportation issues. 

They say that the availability of rakes for supplying coal has been an issue for sometime and private sector power plants do not get priority in this. 

The government, however, is doing everything needed to reduce dependence on coal imports particularly by power sector in view of shortage of the dry fuel faced by those. 

As per the official estimates on the basis of power consumption growth, the requirement of domestic coal in 2018-19 would be about 615 million tonnes, which means that 288 rakes of coal per day would be required from Coal India Ltd (CIL). 

During January 3 to 22, 2018, as against a loading plan of 274 rakes, the average supply of rake by CIL was about 259 rakes per day. 

In a recent report on coal, CARE Ratings said that total coal production may stagnate during the year given no visible improvement in availability of rakes or increase in evacuation infrastructure for mined coal. 

It expects the total domestic coal production to grow in the range of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent (705 to 712) MT for financial year 2018-19. 

It stressed that there is an immediate requirement to auction private coal blocks of coking and steam coal for 50 MT per annum, in order to control import of steam and coking coal. Power plants import steam coal. 

Total import of coal including coking coal and steam coal could touch 235 to 245 MT if the government approves an order to ban use of pet coke which is a feedstock in cement industry. Additional 35 to 40 MT of imported steam coal would be required to compensate for the pet coke ban, it had said."
70,2018-05-21,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Corporate India—especially the chunk comprising over-leveraged companies—is worried about a recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular that says companies with even a day of loan-default can be set on the path of debt resolution and subsequent bankruptcy proceedings.

The circular passed on February 12 abolishes all the earlier debt rejig mechanisms such as corporate debt restructuring, and strategic debt restructuring and puts in place a stringent 180-day timeline post default, at the end of which the company is put under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) if the debt hasn’t been resolved by then.

Industry captains said the latest guidelines are “rigid and too strict”, especially for the infrastructure sector. Finance chiefs at India’s top infrastructure companies told ET that while this enforces better revenue and cash management, it’s too stringent in an environment wherein debt payment is at times closely linked to payment cycles that aren’t regularised in many sectors, such as power. 

“The government and RBI efforts in resolving mounting NPAs have started yielding good results, but rigid and too strict guidelines for initiating default proceedings that will lead to fresh NPAs should be avoided, especially for the infrastructure sector,” said Rashesh Shah, chairman, Edelweiss Group and president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a lobbying body.

“The economy is showing signs of revival and it is a must to revive sentiments in the banking sector for boosting private investment, which is a necessity for taking growth to 8%+ level,” said Shah.

He said that while the RBI is right in its resolve “to stop abuse of the NPA (non-performing assets) resolution norms and align them with IBC, the circular issued on February 12 by the central bank must be revised taking into account the concerns raised by the banks and corporates that includes the one related to even one day default being subjected to the initiation of resolution process. Flexibility to the banks in handling of the loan accounts to the extent genuine defaults and NPA resolution efforts are not hampered, is the need of the hour.”

Others were harsher in their critique.

“The latest clause is impractical and can’t be implemented unless a host of other, underlying issues are resolved first,” said the finance chief of an Indian conglomerate with interests in energy, highways and airports.

“Take the power sector. There is a three-pronged problem: distributors are strained in terms of payments and themselves ask for higher credit periods; there are a host of regulatory amendments that take years to come into action and lead to arrears; our power plants can work at up to 95% capacity but the supply from Coal India arrests it at 60%. All this has led to payment arrears worth thousands of crores. Unless these issues are resolved, the debt cycle will be a problem and this latest clause will meet the same fate as a CDR or SDR,” he added.

“There are other issues too. The clause says the debt resolution plan has to be a given an RP4 (or investment grade) rating by a credit rating agency. And the company will still be considered an NPA. There is a grave mismatch here. Our suggestion is that the resolution plan should just be vetted by a credit rating agency so as to validate the seriousness of the plan,” he added.

“There is still some ambiguity and confusion in the clause, the clarity to which we expect will emerge in the next few months. Some clarifications have come. For example, if a technical glitch has led to default, or if a company has a proven record of payments, it has 30 days to resolve the problem, failing which the 180 day cycle starts and is counted from the first day of default,” said a top executive at a rival conglomerate with similar interests.

The two conglomerates have a combined gross debt of over Rs 35,000 crore on their books.

""The new notification may result in companies utilising their available funds to meet the stringent repayment norms. They will have to stress out their smaller suppliers by delaying those payments when there is a cash flow crunch,"" said Rajesh Shah, managing director at Mukand Steel.

Past track records of companies are important and should be looked at, stressed others. 

“If it’s a one-off, there should be a window of opportunity for borrowers to be considered for it if they have otherwise been diligent with their payments,"" said the chief financial officer of a of a wire rope and specialty steel company.

Another CFO of a prominent steel company that is currently battling insolvency resolution also had similar views. 

""It will give rise to a more conservative approach among corporates and borrowings decrease as a result,"" said the CFO adding that the most vulnerable will be the ones coming up with new capacities. 

To be sure, the RBI’s new clause comes after all other schemes to address the problem of loan defaults failed, leading to a significant ballooning of bad loans: 10% of total bank loans at last count. The earlier schemes were misused by both borrowers and lenders because it helped hide the true state of stress in the system. Some companies and banks only wanted to avoid NPA classification and not to tackle stress. 

Which is why several industry experts have supported the move.

“It’s a step in the right direction. Such stringency will force corporates to act earlier to address the issue which will also lead to a healthier banking system,” said Nikhil Shah, managing director of Alvarez and Marsal , a global professional services firm specializing in restructuring and turnaround cases. It has taken up several insolvency cases in India including that of Essar Steel.

“A company generally has some visibility on its future cash flows. If it sees a deterioration, it should try every step possible—refinancing, restructuring, sale of assets and/or improving operational cash flows to prevent a default.The RBI’s February circular is also a testament that the earlier debt restructuring schemes were largely not working. Whether there is default of dues for 1 or 60 days, the stress has already set in and it is just a matter of time,"" he added."

84,2018-05-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Spot power price touched 5-year high of Rs 11.41 per unit at IEX today, which experts attributed to aggressive bidding by captive units following government's decision to ramp up coal supplies to power plants. 

The government decided last week to augment coal supplies to centre/ state power plants and independent power producers (IPPs) from May 19 to June 30 to overcome shortage of the dry fuel and check power crisis. 

The decision was taken in a joint meeting of power, coal and railways ministries on May 17, 2018. 

""The government is ramping up coal supplies to power plants at the cost of captive power producers. This is one of the main reasons for price touching a peak of Rs 11.41 per unit in day ahead market today at IEX,"" Indian Captive Power Producers Association(ICPPA) Secretary Rajiv Agarwal told . 

He further said: ""If somebody is running continuous process-based industry like aluminium, then he cannot wait for power supply. They are required to arrange power for their businesses."" 

Power sector has been witnessing coal shortage since last year, resulting in surge in spot prices to as high as Rs 10.80 per unit in September 2017. In October, the government said the issue of coal supply to power plants is being addressed in a co-coordinated manner by the ministries of power, coal and railways. 

According to an expert, Rs 11.41 per unit is a five-year high rate of power at Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) which is mainly triggered by government's decision to stop supplies to captive power producers till June 30. 

However, the average spot power price was Rs 6.28 per unit at IEX. 

The expert said spot power price went up by Re 1 to Rs 1.25 per unit last week mainly due to outage of transmission line in north India due to storm warnings, which resulted in lower import (or availability) of power from other regions. 

He further said the sudden surge in tariff at the exchange can be attributed to aggressive bidding by captive power producers in day ahead market trade. 

ICPPA wrote to the Prime Minister's Office and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal yesterday, highlighting its woes. 

It urged for resuming coal supplies to captive plants, which have been set up by various industries like steel, cement and aluminium to meet their own demands. 

The new adhoc decision without any advance notice would bring industry to a standstill, the association wrote. 

It pointed out that captive plants have signed legally binding long-term fuel supply agreements with Coal India and abrupt stoppage of supplies would bring the industry to a grinding halt and result in millions of job losses. 

ICPPA also claimed that captive producers just got 12 per cent out of total rake sanctioned to them in 2017-18. 

The association said the government should avoid such adhoc decisions and bring in a system of giving advance notice to the industry for making alternative arrangements."

78,2018-05-22,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is set to increase supplies by at least 15 million tonnes annually in the next few weeks, with three new rail projects linked to high-capacity mines almost complete, company executives said.

The additional supply will be enough to fuel almost 4,000 MW of power plants through the year, which will rise as more coal is transported, the executives said. The increased availability comes as demand for power rises with temperatures climbing in the summer.

The new rail links will benefit mines belonging to Coal India subsidiaries Central Coalfields, Mahanadi Coalfields and South Eastern Coalfields.

To begin with, the first two subsidiaries will load seven additional rakes, which will be increased to 13 over the next few months. Each rake can typically carry about 3,800 tonnes of coal and an average of 1.4 million tonnes of coal annually. According to senior Coal India executives, a 20-kilometre stretch connecting Tori and Balumath in Jharkhand is complete and rakes have started moving. Another 22-kilometre stretch connecting Balumath and Shivpur is expected to be completed this month.

“There are two railway sidings and a goods shade at Balumath while there are another two sidings at Shivpur. This stretch can start carrying five rakes of coal a day soon. It can be increased to eight within a few months,” the Coal India executive said.

This near 44-kilometre stretch of railway track in Jharkhand will facilitate transportation of coal from Central Coalfields’ Magadha and Amrapali open cast mines in Jharkhand’s Latehar and Chatra districts, respectively.

The second rail project would facilitate supplies from Mahanadi Coalfields’ Basundhara and Kulda open cast mines in Odisha’s Sundargarh district.

This 52 kilometre stretch between Jharsuguda and Sardega is complete and is already carrying two rakes a day. It can be increased to five rakes a day within a short span, said Coal India executives. There are two railway sidings at Sardega. 

This track will also facilitate in transporting coal from Mahanadi Coalfields’ Gopalpur-Manoharpur block to power stations in east and south India through lastmile connectivity via Jharsuguda station, a shorter and cost-effective route. The line can also be used to supply coal to west India via Bilaspur and to the south via Sambalpur and Titagarh.

Expansion of rail lines on the existing Gevra-Pendra Road stretch in Chhattisgarh, which is already operating at full capacity, is nearing completion. Once ready, the expanded route will allow South Eastern Coalfields to carry additional coal to its consumers.

Coal India produced 567.37 million tonnes of the fuel in the year ended March, according to provisional data on the company’s website."

88,2018-05-23,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Increased demand for thermal power and less-than-adequate coal supply have pushed spot power prices to a two-year high of Rs 6.20 per unit on Tuesday and this spike is likely to be passed on to citizens of some states.

The Rs 6 per unit mark was last breached in 2016. Prices hovered at Rs 4 per unit levels early last week before spiralling up as demand for coal-fired power inched up and prices at the largest power trading firm, Indian Energy Exchange, increased more than Rs 2 per unit in seven days.

More than average demand for thermal power from northern states along with collapse of a crucial transmission line that sends power from western India to northern states such as UP, Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab pushed up prices in these states to near Rs 8 per unit on Monday. They are now ruling at Rs 7.43 per unit levels.

Though most analysts say the high rates may not hold, industries buying power directly from exchanges will see their costs go up. Distribution firms from Gujarat, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar, Andhra and Tamil Nadu buy power from spot market to meet supply shortfall. If they are forced to buy costly power, as is the case now, the cost will be passed on to retail and industrial consumers via higher tariff.




The extent of the hike in a consumer’s electricity bill will depend on the state power regulator who decides on how much of the hike in power purchase costs is to be passed on. A state power official said the regulator allows them to pass it on to consumers in most cases. 

Rajesh K Mediratta, director, business development at Indian Energy Exchange, said increased demand for power was also aided by less-than-anticipated hydel generation, transmission snags as well as outages of power generation units in North India over the last one week. 

A power sector official said hydel generation fell short by about 1,300 mw in May from a year ago. Supplies from other generation sources like diesel power, lignitebased units and import from Bhutan were less than anticipated. The shortfall in supplies from non-thermal sources is also exerting pressure on spot power prices. 

Mediratta said that the demand from captive coal-fired power generation units have also started to inch up from states like Odisha. It is expected to rise in the near future as the Centre recently asked Coal India to regulate supplies to captive power plants. 

“Increase in demand growth, seasonality in demand coupled with the supply-side constraints caused by factors such as shortfall in coal supply to power generation stations due to logistical issues have led to a jump in average shortterm traded power tariffs on the power exchanges,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior V-P at ICRA. 

“In our view, the current high prices in the short-term market are unlikely to sustain and are likely to remain at about Rs 3.5 per unit in the medium term, given availability of surplus thermal power capacity, prevailing relatively subdued capacity utilisation & increasing share of renewable energy in the generation mix,” Majumdar said."
89,2018-05-23,Coal India,"Naveen Jindal relays his concern about perceived bias against the private sector. Talking to Supriya Shrinate of ET Now, the chairman of Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) pointedly brings up the issue of default where private firms are hauled up but their public clients go scot-free. Edited excerpts:


Jindal Steel & Power results seem to be suggesting that a turnaround story is underway and I will only begin with a positive note and talk to you about that. It is too premature to say that the worst is behind you. Steel prices are a big tailwind. Do you expect that to continue? Your QIP was initially Rs 900 crore and you have raised it due to a good response. Is the turnaround story panning out as you had envisaged?
In steel, there is a lot of demand and we feel that we have commissioned our plant especially at Angul in Odisha at the right time. We have come in at the right time when the demand is good. JSPL used to be the most efficient company, the most profitable steel company in the world for its scale of operations. We had planned all our projects based on indigenous coal. We had got the coal blocks and we had developed some of them as coal mines especially in Chhattisgarh. In Angul in Odisha, where we had been allocated a coal block, we had planned to set up a large steel project based on Swadeshi raw materials. 

It was my dream that we set up a large steel plant where we are not going to be importing any raw material. But with the cancelation of all the coal blocks, there was a big setback. Not only did our fuel source got cancelled but we had to pay Rs 3,500 crore on top of that. 

Then the steel markets turned really bad and all the steel dumping was happening. But now, three years later, we have commissioned in Angul, India’s largest and most modern blast furnace based on imported coking coal. My swadeshi dream right now has gone for a six but we are very hopeful that we are getting a lot of support from the Niti Aayog, from the Steel Ministry and they want to encourage coal gasification. Using the synthesis gas from coal gasification plant, we will make DRI and steel. We are getting encouraging response. I hope if we are able to get coal linkage for this and in the future if government comes out with coal block auctions for coal gasification, then I am sure we will be able to salvage this project. But now we are not dependent on this.


So you basically you are importing coal but on an operating level, you are back in the black after 13 quarters. That must have been a relief. A lot of people believe it happened on the back of steel prices that have rebounded. Do you expect this steel price rebound to continue and what is your outlook on prices really?
Not only us, all the steel companies are showing good results because steel demand is high and prices have improved internationally. In fact, in India, prices are lower than international prices and we expect this to continue because below this level it is not even viable for anyone to set up a steel plant. That’s why no new steel capacities are coming up. 

Basically, worldwide steel plant capacities are only like 70-75% utilised. There is a huge idling capacity because it would not be remunerative to operate them. But now even if the prices were to go down, we are ready. We are amongst the most efficient steel producers in the world. Now the technology that we have adopted in Angul or Raigarh is mostly based on blast furnaces and oxygen steel making which is the most efficient way of steel making . 60% of our products are long products, 40% flats. In long products, we are making world’s longest rails. You cannot import long rails into the country, you cannot export also.


In fact, you are the only private manufacturer of rail in India?
 That is right. JSPL is the only company in the private sector which is making rails and we are proud of the fact that we have been supplying to 60 metre long rails for the dedicated freight corridor. With these products, we are very confident going forward and also the challenges that we have faced in the last three years has taught us a lot. 


The larger question on pricing remains and you alluded to the global factors and it is only fair that I ask you this question because there seems to be this global trade war that Donald Trump has unleashed targeting China. China is responding with equal measure. Is the impact on India being under estimated?
Actually, we have not felt any impact at all.


But do you expect to going forward?
No, we do not because we were not exporting any steel to US. We have never really been exporting steel to the US and so we are not impacted in that sense. Secondly, if some other countries start to dump steel in India, in the past the Government of India has taken effective measures to stop that. The Indian steel industry is very important for the Indian economy. Millions of people are employed in this and 2% or 3% GDP is based on steel or steel related industries. It is a very important part of our economy. I am confident that the government would support it if any country tries to dump steel into India.


What about your deleveraging plan at the group level? There is a plan to deleverage Rs 4,000-5,000 crore according ti your CEO. How is this going to be done? Are you planning asset sale? Is this going to entail some promoter diluting stake? The markets want to ask is there still need to sell the Tamnar plant to JSW Energy? 
Our debt at its highest level used to be Rs 46,000 plus crore. Now it is already down by almost 10% to Rs 42,000 crore. We are very proud of that fact that we have completed our Angul project.


You believe your debt level has peaked?
It has already peaked and in the future, we are not going to be borrowing because we have learnt our lessons and as Shakespeare said, “neither a borrower nor a lender be.” We are going to really follow that, that we are going to be borrowing because borrowing comes at a huge cost because when things go wrong they go wrong from all sides. So, from our internal accruals we have been lowering our debt.

This year also, we expect very good EBITDA and we hope to pare our debt by another Rs 5,000-6,000 crore. That would be a very comfortable situation for JSPL. 

Even today we are able to service our debt very well. Going forward, we will reduce it further. As far as the power plant is considered, the sale of the 1000-MW unit to JSW Energy that is still on. We are going to ask for extension of time because there are certain conditions precedent that we were supposed to fulfil which we have not been able to do and there have not been PPS coming up and there is a severe crisis of coal. There is good demand for power but coal is not available. I hope that with the steps that Coal India is taking, they would be able to ramp up the production of coal which is really the need of the hour.


How much more time have you sought on this sale and is there a chance that you may review the decision altogether because you seem to be out of the woods right now?
Sure. We may review it and now it is not really important. We are going to be paring our debt by Rs 5,000-6,000 crore even this fiscal and that is going to come from our own internal accruals. So, if the sale happens on our terms, we will do it, if it does not happen, it is not a big deal now. JSPL and JPL are both very strong companies and they will be able to go on.


The stock rallied almost 13% on Tuesday on news of your Oman business listing. Is that on track? What is the primary reason for you to list that business? Is it also targeted at deleveraging?
Basically, it is about monetising. Oman business is doing very well. We have shown very good results. Production has increased. We produced 1.7 million tons of steel in the last fiscal and this fiscal we will cross two million tons. We are commissioning a second cast which would be commissioned by July. From August, we will have a run rate of more than two lakh tons per month in Oman. 

There is a lot of investor interest in Oman. At some point, we are looking at divesting a part of equity of the Oman business. Whether that is done through an IPO or a strategic investor -- we have to look at that. A lot of banks are also suggesting different ways of restructuring the different businesses -- maybe taking power out as a separate company, steel in a separate company, international business etc. We are looking at all the options. We will take the approvals for these things from our banks and all the stakeholders and carry on.


But is there a particular size of the fund that you have in mind that you were looking to raise from your Oman business?
Since the valuations are going to be very high, if we get the right valuation, only then we will do it. We are not in any kind of a hurry. 


Indian steel is seeing a tectonic shift of sorts. The largest steel maker in the world LN Mittal wanted to come in, Anil Agarwal via Electrasteel is bidding for Essar Steel; Tata Steel is making every effort possible to acquire that number one position and there is your brother’s Monnet Ispat also. It is a big shake up that the steel industry is witnessing. Deep pockets are coming in. How does that change things for the industry and for a company like yours?
See, with all this consolidation happening and people paying high prices, the kind of bids we are seeing for Bhushan Steel or Electrosteel or Essar was never expected before. These are all very intelligent people who see India as a huge market. Our per capita steel consumption is amongst the lowest in the world and there is a lot of infrastructure that we need to build, lot of housing that need to come up. So, in the coming years there is going to be huge demand for steel. Steel ministry has plans to increase production from around 100-million ton level to 300-million ton level by 2030. We cannot build our infrastructure on imported steel. So, steel is a basic industry and for manufacturing, you have to have your own steel industry. India has the raw material, especially iron ore for our own steel production. That is why all these international companies like Arcelor Mittal and even the Indian companies see a huge potential in India.


What is your take on how this IBC and NCLT has panned out? When it began, people thought there was going to be significant asset value erosion but that has not really happened and good high bids have come in and fewer haircuts have been taken. Other than that, there has been significant asset value preservation. What is your assessment?
Only in a few steel companies there has been less asset erosion or less value erosion. Otherwise, for most companies, nobody even talks about them. Banks are recovering 5% somewhere and somewhere they are recovering 10% or 20% . There are only a few successful cases -- whether you talk about Bhushan or Essar – where there is so much of interest. Otherwise in most companiesm there is no interest.

The kind of challenges these companies -- in Odisha they were promised that if they invested there, they would be given iron ore mines. They were not given that. All these steel companies had coal blocks allocated to them but all those coal blocks as fuel source was cancelled. They were not given any kind of compensation, It was a very challenging situation for most of these companies. At JSPL, we are lucky that by God’s grace, we have been able to make a way out of these challenging situations. We should have been a little bit more patient with them and help them get out of these because many of these companies are there not because they have done anything wrong.


Do you believe that at one level the whole IBC amendment and the way it is being carried out does not differentiate between failure and fraud?
 That is true. My personal view is it is not right to say that the promoter cannot bid for his own assets. Anybody who sets up a plant, puts their heart and soul into it. The fact that they failed to repay the banks on time, is not entirely their own fault. If this is a fraud, I have no sympathy but in a very difficult situation, when coal blocks have been cancelled, iron ore blocks have not been given, is it easy to set up plants in India? Why cannot Posco set up a plant in India? Why could not ArcelorMittal set up a plant in India? It is not easy to set up a plant in India and for people who have actually set up the plants and then are losing it all, I feel are being unfairly treated.


You are here admitting that the risk-taking appetite of the industry has been dented?
Absolutely! Earlier, before we set up the 1000 MW plant, the most successful power project of the country, which led to at least 70000-80000 MW more, I went to a banker. It was one of the biggest banks in India. I did not want to set up a 1000 MW unit. They encouraged me saying, “Mr Jindal, why don’t you set up something big?” I had just gone to a banker to ask for Rs 150-crore loan for setting up a rolling mill. I said sir, we have a 1000-MW power project, we could do that. They said, do that. I asked who would finance it, they said we would finance it. And then came that project!.


So much of the risk and…
Yes but I took this risk and the banks had the courage and this project came into Prime Minister office monitoring in sometime 2002-2003 and just we got all the clearances and then we set up this project. Today, if there is no shortage of power in India and I am proud to say that Jindal Power Ltd. has a important role to play in it. The whole thing can be seen in a positive light and it can be seen in a negative light also.


Power minister RK Singh has been trying to convince the RBI to exempt the power sector from stringent NPA norms. The RBI has rejected that and now he is trying to look at other things like asset management company for direct fund in future. Will that help?
I do not know. This NPA is because most of the power projects are selling to state utilities and most of the state utilities do not pay on time. If a state utility owes a power company and delays the payment, and here if you are not able to make your repayments or interest payments on time by a single day, you are going to be termed as an NPA. It is most unfair. It is like we are falling sick and we have fever and we do not attend office and we are declared dead! May be RBI trying to do bring in this discipline is good but it has to be done in the gradual manner.


Discipline should be brought to the state utilities as well?
If the power utilities do not pay to their suppliers why are they not declared as NPAs? Is it because they are state governments, they are strong, they are sovereign? We cannot have different yardsticks for different entities within the country.


Is it tough being a private sector…
It is really tough. It is really tough being a private sector company in the country.


Why?
Because we are discriminated against. We do not have level playing fields and there is complete discrimination, there is one set of rules for public sector units, they get all the support, their coal blocks do not get cancelled and there is a completely different yardstick for the private sector. There is no equality.


There is a big milestone that we achieved as a country which is power for all and you are right, you have been a contributor to that story as well. Should we be celebrating this or should we be actually being worried about connecting each one to the grid, connecting every household, connecting just 10% households in a village and public spaces and then declaring everybody is connected on power is not good enough. Can this happen without putting the politics out? Tariffs have to rise in accordance but that does not happen because of political interference. Can all of this be sorted out by putting the politics aside?
Yes, obviously. We have made a lot of progress in supplying electricity to most people. So many millions of households still remain to be electrified but still there is good progress. Today the tariff say is around Rs 4 in the exchange and electricity boards are buying anywhere from Rs 4 to Rs 6-7. Today the situation is that there is surplus power is available and coal is not available. Coal costs earlier used to be 50 paisa for per unit. Today it is more than Rs 2 and coal is just not available. If all the coal mines had developed and coal blocks were producing coal, then instead of selling power in the exchange for Rs 4, it would have been selling at Rs 2. And no bank loan would have become NPA.

All these power companies would have been making money and supplying cheap power. Indians all over the country would have used this power and contributed to the GDP of the country."

92,2018-05-24,Coal India,"New full-time Chairman of Coal India Ltd (CIL), the largest coal miner in the world, says his priority will be to ensure that power plants have coal supply for at least 22 days henceforth. 

“There was a recent meeting in the Ministry of Power where it was decided if we give power plants 14 lakhs tonnes of coal every day, no plant will see a critical supply situation. Since 5-7 days ago we have been sending 14 lakhs every day. Due to past issues on an average there is just ten day's coal stocks at power plants. We have to try and ensure that power plants have stocks for 22 days, so if there is a delay of one or two days it isn’t critical,” said Jha CMD at Mahanadi Coalfield Ltd (MCL) until recently.

The constraint is in logistics and not production. “I cannot open a coal mine at short notice of 2-3 months, it takes between 3-5 years to open a new mine. As of today there is 45 million tonnes of stock with CIL but due to severe logistics, where there is coal there is no rail network, so until and unless that coal is transported to the power plant having coal has got no meaning,” said Jha.

MCL, in a first of its kind, has spent Rs 1000 crore on a 53 km long rail line. “The entire expenditure was borne by the CIL subsidiary but the facility was created for the state. Now we are evacuating coal through that. If Lord Jagannath permits that line can also be used for passenger trains,"" said Jha.

CIL would continue to explore acquiring assets outside the country; funds are not a problem said Jha. ""MCL alone has Rs 20,000 crore in bank balance and we are not able to spend it.

“We would like to see where we can gainfully invest this amount. That is why we are exploring the possibilities of creating infrastructure – we are going for railway lines, we are going for power plants, we will be going for Coal- to- Liquid project also and are keen on undertaking a pilot project,” said Jha. 

Replying to a question on high fuel prices, Jha said it would have jack up the CIL cost.

The national miner is ready for competition from private players, says its 27th CMD. “Everyone says Coal India is a monopoly so let some private players also come and compete with us. Competition is always good. NTPC is competing with power producers, SAIL is competing with steel producers, so will CIL. Our workers are highly talented and will show their mettle when the opportunity comes they will prove they are second to none. If private players come into the picture through commercial mining, Coal India’s performance will only improve further,” said Jha.

During his term at the head of MCL, CIL's most profitable subsidiary, touched historic production of 143.06 million tonnes during the last fiscal ending 31 March 2018. This was achieved a time when things were not always smooth sailing between the Coal Ministry under the BJP-led government at the Centre and the Biju Janata Dal government at the state. Refusing to be drawn into the debate, Jha said “I am a business house and my purpose is to see that I follow all rules and regulations of both the state and centre to achieve my business goals.” 

He pointed out that MCL was the largest spender in Corporate Social Responsibility in the state, having spent Rs 180 crore in CSR last year. It had built a Rs 500 hospital and was building a Rs 100 crore heart research institute for western Odisha.

What he is keen on seeing happen most is a model rehabilitation project for which MCL has sought 430 acres of land from the state government. The rehabilitation towhship, MCL proposes to build with all infrastructure and civic amenities - sewage, water supply, school, cemetery – for about 5000 project affected families. A normal rehabilitation colony has been of about 50- 60 acres.

India still depends hugely on coal which also compensates for hydel’s negative production of 25 per cent, points out Jha. “The task of Coal India is mammoth, wherever you see a light burning, or a fridge running, remember a Coal India worker is toiling 700m below the earth somewhere to make that happen,” said Jha."

105,2018-05-25,Coal India,"NEW DELHI|KOLKATA: The government on Thursday directed coal companies to supply additional coal to state-owned power generating plants, leaving the private sector unhappy.

The notification issued by coal ministry asked Coal India and Singareni Collieries to make “out of turn coal allotment” to state and central electricity generation companies to help them meet increased power requirement. The order initially triggered panic among private power companies that the 'out of turn' supplies to PSUs might lead to curbing of their coal supplies.

The government on Friday clarified there was no coal shortage and that government-run power generating plants are being offered coal over and above the committed quantities to let them meet the high levels of power demand.

Coal ministry joint secretary Rajesh Kumar Sinha told ET that there was no need for private power companies to panic about coal supply availability as Coal India will meet the contractual obligations. “’Nobody will be preferred over others. Many states had approached us that their power requirements have increased and asked for more coal supply. The phrase out-of-turn coal allotment means state power generating companies can take coal above the annual contracted quantity (ACQ),” Sinha said over phone.

Private power companies, however, questioned the government's decision to give excess coal to only PSU power plants, particularly citing cases where private power plants offer electricity at lesser tariffs.

""Discrimination based on ownership of assets put into question the sanctity of commercial contracts signed by Coal India Ltd. This would lead to more stress for the bankers. This is against the PM’s stated policy of level playing field and Ease of doing business,” Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said.

“If coal ministry claims that they have more coal than contractual obligation, then excess quantity distribution should not be limited to public sector, it should be given on priority to most efficient plants. So that with same coal we can produce more power. Why discriminate on ownership basis?,” he questioned. Sinha said coal contracts signed with private companies and under the Shakti (Scheme to Harness and Allocate Koyla (Coal) Transparently in India) auction scheme will not be compromised. The state governments have been told to pick up coal from any mode--including rail-cum-road, ropeway -- that is available, he said.

Sinha also said extra coal above the trigger level is being supplied to many private power companies. Trigger level is the minimum level to be supplied by coal companies and to be taken by consumer under a contract.

The coal ministry had last week asked coal companies like Coal India and Singareni Collieries Company to accord high supply priority to state, central and independent power producers till June 30th. Following this, Coal India subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields issued a notice saying it would not load coal on railway rakes for any non-power consumers including captive power producers.

This notice has been withdrawn, Sinha said."
104,2018-05-25,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty extended rally for a second straight session on Friday, buoyed by gains in bank, energy, financial, auto, IT and teck counters.

Buying was observed across sectors, as a fresh rise in the rupee against the US dollar and receding global crude oil prices were cheered by investors.

The domestic currency strengthened and global oil prices eased after the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia indicated on Friday that they might ease oil production cuts to calm consumers' worries. 

The Sensex index closed 262 points, or 0.76 per cent, up at 34,925, while Nifty finished Friday's trade with a gain of 91 points, or 0.87 per cent, at 10,605.

Overall, 24 stocks remained up in the Sensex index, while 7 declined.

In the Nifty index, 41 stocks settled in the green and 9 in the red on Friday.

Midcaps and smallcaps outperformed Sensex, rising 1.55 per cent and 1.17 per cent, respectively.


Here are the 5 reasons that triggered the rally in market

Softening crude prices: Falling crude oil prices supported domestic equity markets on Friday. Price of brent crude oil declined over 3 per cent in the past two trading sessions, whereas Nymex crude oil slipped below $70 per barrel for the first time since May 9, 2018.


Rupee: The local currency continued to recover for the second day, advancing nearly 60 paise to 67.77 against the dollar on increased selling of the greenback by exporters and banks amid rising domestic equity market. Any appreciation in rupee strengthens earnings of firms that have high revenue exposure to the US without a natural hedge of raw material imports. 


All-round buying: Robust buying in financials, oil and gas as well as select auto counters lifted benchmark equity indices higher on Friday. Sustained inflows by domestic institutional investors further supported Indian equity markets.


GDP forecast: Care Ratings in its latest report titled ‘Indian Economy Prognosis: 2018-19’ has forecasted that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth will accelerate to 7.5 per cent in 2018-19, from 6.6 per cent in the last fiscal.


Global cues: Positive global cues also buoyed market sentiment on Friday. European markets were trading in the green, after North Korea made good on its promise to demolish the country’s nuclear test site and said it's still willing to talk with Washington, in response to Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to cancel a summit with the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un. Asian peers closed mixed on Friday. Nikkei and KLSE Composite closed 13.78 points and 21.40 points up at 22,450.79 and 1,797.40, respectively, whereas Hang Seng and Shanghai dipped 0.56 per cent and 0.42 per cent, respectively.

Meanwhile, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and ONGC remained the key drivers of the rally in Sensex.

On the contrary, ITC, Tata Consultancy Services, State Bank of India, Coal India and ICICI Bank remained the top drags on the index.

Shares of Pidilite Industries surged over 6 per cent on Friday to hit 52-week high of 1,146.50 after the company on Thursday reported a 55 per cent jump in the consolidated profit for March quarter.

GAIL (India) surged 4.17 per cent on Friday as its March quarter net profit registered a near four-fold jump.

Among the sectors on BSE, barring consumer durables, all closed with gains, with oil & gas jumping over 3 per cent. 

European stocks were trading up, but most Asian peers settled in the negative zone."
103,2018-05-25,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The coal ministry has denied coal crisis in the country and said government-run power generating plants are being offered coal over and above the committed quantities to let them meet the high levels of power demand.

102,2018-05-25,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government has ordered coal companies to prioritise state-run power projects for coal supply. In a notification issued on Wednesday, the coal ministry directed Coal India and Singareni Collieries to make “out of turn coal allotment” to state and central electricity generation companies.

Private companies said the move will take a heavy toll on the already ailing plants.

“Discrimination based on ownership of assets put into question the sanctity of commercial contracts signed by Coal India Ltd. This would lead to more stress for the bankers. This is against the PM’s stated policy of level playing field and Ease if doing business,“ Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said.

“The move comes at a time when power producers are under tremendous stress and struggling to keep the projects afloat,” another private power company executive said.

He said the out of turn allocation could have a bearing on coal allocation under the coal contracts auction scheme -- Scheme to Harness and Allocate Koyla (Coal) Transparently in India – (Shakti), as well as that done through e-auction. Under the SHAKTI scheme, fuel was to be allocated to stressed private power plants holding letters of assurance (LoAs).

The notification said the decision has been taken as power generation in April 2018 has been more than the programmed generation and may lead to a more than anticipated increase in demand of coal from power sector.

The order follows a Coal Ministry directive earlier this month that instructed companies like Mahanadi Coalfields to deploy rakes of coal only for power plants and stop supply for other users including captive power plants of private industries."

97,2018-05-25,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: In a jolt to private power producers, the government has ordered Coal India Ltd to make 'out-of-turn' allotment of scarce coal to central and state electricity generation companies.

The order follows a Coal Ministry directive earlier this month that instructed companies like Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd to deploy rakes of coal only for power plants and not other users like captive power plants of private industries.

In a May 24 letter to Coal India, the Coal Ministry said there may be an increased demand for coal due to a surge in demand during peak summer.

Power generation in April, it said, ""has been more than the programmed generation and this, in turn, may lead to a more than anticipated increase in demand of coal from the power sector.""

""In order to avoid possible shortage of coal at thermal power plants it has been decided that wherever it is operationally feasible based on various factors like coal stock availability, where suitable transport arrangements are in place etc, out of turn coal allotment may be made to state and central PSU (electricity) generation companies (Gencos) to meet the surged coal requirement for power generation,"" the ministry said in the letter, reviewed by PTI.

Industry sources said a coal shortage looms in India as demand for electricity is expected to hit record peaks during summer months. Also, Coal India Ltd has lagged in meeting surge in demand.

Out of turn allocation would have a direct bearing on coal allocation under the ambitious scheme named SHAKTI or the Scheme to Harness and Allocate Koyla (Coal) Transparently in India, as well as that done through e-auction. Under the SHAKTI scheme, fuel was to be allocated to power plants holding letters of assurance (LoAs).

Sources said coal allocation under these is under threat as Coal India has been failing to meet its production target and would not supply the scarce fuel to PSUs on priority.

The move to divert fuel from coal starved power projects would take a heavy toll on the already ailing sector, they said, adding the government continues to back PSUs at the cost of independent power producers in coal allocation.

Plant Load Factor or average capacity utilisation of state-owned NTPC plants is over 70 per cent while independent power producers (which are essentially private firms) are bleeding at 55 per cent PLF.

Coal Ministry has admitted to coal shortage even after making tall claims of rise in production, they said, adding it has now directed Coal India to supply fuel out of turn to PSUs to keep them running and prevent losses, all this at the cost of the private sector.

The move comes at a time when power producers are under tremendous stress and struggling to keep the projects afloat, they added."

106,2018-05-26,Coal India,"About 4% of cooking gas users have responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to give up the LPG subsidy, but this proportion varies widely between states. Northeastern states lead the chart with 14% of customers in Mizoram surrendering their subsidy 12% in Nagaland and 10% in Manipur. Outside this region, the only state or UT where the proportion exceeds 10% is Delhi with 12%.

In March 2015, Modi had appealed to well-to-do sections to voluntarily give up the LPG subsidy, saying this would enable the government to benefit more of the poor. Of India’s big states, only Maharashtra at 6% has a rate of surrender higher than 5%.

Among the other big states, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Punjab all saw 5% of consumers surrendering the subsidy. In Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh it was 4%, in Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu 3% while in West Bengal it was barely 2% and in Andhra Pradesh an even lower 1%. Even in the PM’s home state, Gujarat, only 4% surrendered the subsidy. 

The number of people surrendering LPG subsidy had crossed 1 cr in 2016, but since then only another 4 lakh customers have surrendered the subsidy in two years. A senior petroleum ministry official told TOI that the government expects the number of customers surrendering subsidy to go up as the customer base expands. He added that the figure of over 1 cr customers who have surrendered subsidy does not include those who have shifted to piped natural gas and hence are not using subsidized LPG cylinders. 

There are 26 crore LPG customers, of which 25.7 crore are in the domestic category, but nly 21.9 cr of these are active customers. About 44.4% of domestic customers have double bottle connections. LPG coverage estimated on the basis of active domestic connections is around 79.2% of all households.


CIL to raise supply to PSU power units in summer
In order to avoid power shortages in the summer, the coal ministry has written to the Coal India (CIL) chairman for special supply arrangements for Central and state-owned generation companies. The power and coal ministries had already started regulating coal supply to non-power sectors.

“It has been reported that power generation in the month of April 2018 has been more than the programmed generation and this, in turn, may lead to a more-than-anticipated increase in demand for coal from the power sector,” the coal ministry letter to the CIL chairman stated. It has suggested an out-of-turn coal allotment to Central and state PSU power companies to meet demand.

Independent power producers (IPPs) criticised the order, saying that prioritising PSU-run power projects created hurdles for coal-starved power projects. IPPs say the move will take a toll on an already ailing sector. Sources in CIL said the regulation of coal supply to non-power sectors and IPPs, including captive power plants, is largely due to a logistics problem and not unavailability of coal."
107,2018-05-27,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market ended with strong gains on Friday, aided by a recovery in the rupee and softening crude oil prices.

“We remain bullish on the Indian markets and see buying opportunity in selective stocks in the consumption, private banking and auto space,” said Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Going into the F&O expiry week, analysts expect the market to turn rangebound amid mixed global cues, including oil price movement and developments around the US-North Korea summit.


Here's a look at the key developments that may steer the market in the coming week - 

GDP data: The GDP data for the period of January-March, 2018 is scheduled to be released on Thursday, May 31. India’s GDP grew 7.2 per cent in the third quarter on the back of a rebound in industrial activity, especially manufacturing and construction, and an expansion in agriculture.


Earnings: In the last leg of Q4 earnings, NTPC, NMDC and Oil India are slated to release their March quarter results on Monday, May 28, 2018 while BPCL and Coal India are expected to unveil theirs on May 29, 2018.


F&O expiry: Trading could be volatile next week as traders will roll over positions in the F&O segment from the near month May 2018 series to June 2018 series. The May 2018 F&O contracts will expire on Thursday, May 31, 2018.


Rupee: The domestic unit has declined more than 6 per cent against the US dollar this year, thus becoming Asia's worst performing currency. Simmering crude prices, continued selling of Indian equities by FIIs and jitters around Fed policy tightening have broken the back of the Indian currency. ""While the Reserve Bank of India might be loath to use interest rate rises as its main currency defence mechanism, as it did during 2013, coming weeks will show how far it can go with spending precious dollar reserves to stop the rupee heading for 70 per dollar,"" Reuters said. On Friday, the currency made a terrific comeback as it clocked best single-day rise since March 14, 2017 to end at 67.78, up 56 paise.


Auto stocks: Shares of auto companies are likely to hog limelight, as the firms will start releasing their sales numbers for May from June 1. Robust domestic demand, along with a rise in exports led major automobile manufacturers to post healthy sales figures for April 2018. Maruti Suzuki India reported a 14.4 per cent rise in overall sales while Hyundai Motor India's overall sales rose six per cent to 59,744 units from 56,368 units sold in the corresponding month of 2017, IANS reported. Automobile giant Tata Motors' domestic sales grew by 86 per cent for April 2018.


Technical factors: The Nifty50 on Friday formed a solid bullish candle on the daily chart and a Dragon Fly Doji on the weekly chart. Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities said a big bullish candle on the daily chart, followed by a Dragon Fly Doji on the weekly chart, suggests buying at lower levels. He expects the index to move towards the 10,680 level in the short term. On the downside, support is seen at 10,550 level, Taparia said. Though it will be too early to conclude that a bottom is in place at the recent low, the same will be confirmed only if the Nifty50 gets past the 10,929 mark in next four sessions, which would also coincide with the current month F&O expiry, experts said.


Macro data: The government will release data for India's manufacturing sector in May 2018 on June 1, 2018. India’s factory growth accelerated in April on strong domestic demand and output.

US jobs data: US non-farm payrolls data and US unemployment rate data for May 2018 will be released on June 1, 2018. The nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 in April against 192,000 jobs expected. However, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 per cent in April, an 18-year low."
108,2018-05-27,Coal India,"The Tax Department will sell at an ""appropriate time"" the shares owned by British firm Cairn Energy plc which were attached following a Rs 10,247-crore tax demand, a senior tax official said. 

 The tax department had in January 2014 used a two-year-old retrospective tax law to raise a Rs 10,247-crore demand on alleged capital gains made by Cairn Energy on a decade-old internal reorganisation of India business. 

 This was followed by attaching the company's residual 9.8 per cent shares in its erstwhile subsidiary, Cairn India. Cairn India was subsequently merged with its new parent Vedanta Ltd, in which Cairn Energy now holds about 4.95 per cent stake. 

 These shares continued to be attached for four years but the tax department had earlier this year got them transferred to it. 

 ""We will sell the shares at an appropriate time,"" the official of the tax department said. 

 The tax department had come close to selling the shares in March but aborted the move at the last moment. 

 Cairn Energy has challenged the retrospective tax demand through an international arbitration, the final outcome of which is expected later this year. The official said the tax department will not wait for arbitration panel hearing to sell the shares. 

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had last month in response to a query stated that ""there is no legal advice against the sale of the attached shares"". 

 Besides attaching shares, the Income Tax Department has seized a total of Rs 1,106 crore of dividend income due to Cairn Energy Plc to recover a part of the Rs 10,247-crore tax demand. 

 The tax department, which had previously seized Rs 666 crore of dividends due to Cairn from its 4.95 per cent residual holding in Vedanta Ltd, in March seized another Rs 440 crore. It has also refused to pay tax refund of Rs 1,594 crore due to Cairn as a result of overpayment of capital gains tax to recover the dues. 

 The Tax department says that during the financial year 2006-07, Cairn India Ltd, now known as Vedanta Ltd, had purchased about 251 million shares of Cairn India Holdings Ltd (CIHL), a company registered in Jersey, from Cairn Energy subsidiary Cairn UK Holdings Ltd (CUHL) for Rs 26,681 crore. 

 ""Since the shares of CIHL which were acquired by CIL from CUHL derive their value solely from the assets located in India which consists of 27 companies engaged in India in oil and gas exploration, therefore in accordance with section 9(1)(i) of the Income-Tax Act, the capital gains arising in the hands of CUHL from transfer of these assets are chargeable to tax in India,"" the CBDT says. 

 It, through a final assessment order dated March 9, 2015, raised a tax demand of Rs 10,247 crore. 

 Cairn India was in 2011 acquired by Vedanta but the British firm continued to hold 9.8 per cent shareholding. Cairn India was last year merged into Vedanta Ltd. On merger, Cairn Energy's holding in Vedanta came to 4.95 per cent."

""We are the world's largest coal producer, but we wish to be the most-efficient coal miner,"" newly-appointed CIL Chairman and Managing Director Anil Kumar Jha has said.

Jha, however, acknowledged that it would be difficult, due to the socio-economic situation of India compared with some of the efficient coal players like Australia.

""Our socio-economic situation is different. When we open a mine, there is huge demand for employment. The land losers want nothing but employment. Despite this, MCL (Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd) pays compensation of Rs 16 lakh in lieu of employment, but villagers demand employment,"" he said.

Jha had served as the chairman of CIL's most profitable subsidiary, MCL.

He further said that manpower engaged with Coal India is three to four times than that of an Australian mine, owing to the large demand for employment.

Moreover, CIL also invests in infrastructure development for its neigbhourhood areas to fulfil the demand for water, health and education needs of locals around the mines, so that all stakeholders get a share of profit from the miner, Jha said.

The top CIL official said the mining major is striving to bring down the cost of production to a ""bare minimum"", but added that he would require some time to prepare a roadmap towards these goals without compromising on social factors.

Jha said he had already approved opening of price bids for ERP implementation, which was delayed for quite a few months.

He also asserted that no power plant will suffer due to shortage of coal."
115,2018-05-29,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities snapped their three-session winning streak on Tuesday owing to losses in bank, financial, FMCG, energy and consumer durables stocks amid weak global cues.

The second half of Tuesday's trade witnessed profit-booking in most sectors, barring IT and auto, as weak global cues dealt a blow. Deepening Italian crisis spooked investors as a populist coalition failed to take shape and worries of fresh election loomed.

Besides, a fresh fall in the rupee aggravated the bearish sentiment. However, crude oil prices recovered a bit, but it remains a concern, hovering around $75 a barrel.

Benchmark Sensex tanked 216 points, or 0.61 per cent, to finish at 34,949, with only 7 stocks in the green and 24 in the red.

117,2018-05-29,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) is looking at a majority stake in the proposed Rs 13,000 crore 1,600 mw super critical power venture with NTPC in Odisha. The plant is proposed to be operated by NTPC.

""We have recently received coal supply assurance for the project. Land has been allotted and environment as well as forest clearances were recently received. We hope to commission the project soon. Once the project is commissioned our total capex for the year is expected to increase from Rs 9,500 crore to Rs 11,500 crore,"" said Coal India chairman AK Jha. He was talking to reporters in Kolkata after his first day in office.

The plant is scheduled to come up at Sundergarh in Odisha where Indian railways have laid a 53 km track to transport coal. The project was taken up Mahanadi Basin Power Ltd, a fully owned MCL subsidiary. The project received nod of the High Level Clearance Authority (HLCA), the highest body to approve investments in Odisha.

“We had initial discussion with NTPC and they have verbally agreed to the proposal. Unless, we retain 51% stake there will legal issues since all clearances have been given to the Coal India subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields,” Jha said.

Jha also said that another super critical thermal power plant has been proposed at North Karanpura under Central Coalfields. Power Finance consultancy and NTPC are offering consultancy for project. The project at Sundergarh will be the first thermal power plant proposed by the world's largest coal producer.

MCL aims to use coal from Basundhara area in Sundergarh district, having reserve of 6.8 billion tonne. The annual coal extraction from this mine is set to touch 40 million tonne per annum in the coming years. Talking about coal stocks, Jha said Coal India is planning to bring down stocks at pit heads from a present level of around 44.5 million tonnes to around 30 million tonnes enough to meet supplies for 15 days. Coal India's pit head stocks has always been on the high due to evacuation issues. On coal supplies to power plants Jha said Coal India is planning to supply 525 million tonnes of coal this year which would include offering to power sector through e-auctions. Coal India's total production target is around 630 million tonnes for the year. Last year the company supplied 454 million tonnes to the sector. The company is looking at offering 90 million tonnes of coal through e-auction — a similar quantity was offered last year.

Coal India is banking on monsoon to reduce power demand and increased hydel generation as well as increased supplies to tackle the situation and wants all power plants to build up 22 days of stock."
118,2018-05-29,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The management of Coal India has decided to provide an additional 7% extra salary on basic and dearness allowance that would replenish employees’ pension fund that is facing a shortfall of Rs 25,000 crore. It is expected to cost the company an additional Rs 1000 crore annually. A gazette notification to this effect is expected soon following which it would be implemented, said an executive.

This 7% contribution would be matched by a similar 7% contribution by the employees to the fund. It is over and above the 12% of basic and dearness allowance they contribute to the pension fund which is also matched by a similar contribution from the company.

The development comes a year after salaries were raised by about a fifth followed by a coal price hike in January this year.

“At present, the outgo will be part of wages and salaries, which would be paid from normal income of the company. There are no decisions on raising prices yet,” the Coal India executive told ET.

Almost 50% of producing of a tonne of coal is the wages and salaries bill. This is expected to rise marginally once the wage hike is introduced.

It is likely to squeeze the company’s margin that is already reeling under the pressure of selling additional coal at discounted price to the power sector. That forced Coal India to reduce allocation for e-auction for which it gets the highest price realisations.

However, the decision has been taken looking at the future of retired employees of the company and the huge shortfall the fund is facing.

Joint contribution by the management and the employees is expected to help replenish part of the fund by around Rs 2000 crore annually. However, according to a Coal India executive, this would not be enough and the worker associations have been demanding a per tonne levy on coal sold.

“Even Re 1 cess on every tonne of coal sold will raise the pension fund size by at least Rs 50 crore every year. This would double to Rs 100 crore by 2020 and help adequacy,” said S Q Zama, general secretary, AITUC.

The fund supports close to 4.7 lakh former employees of the company and is facing a shortfall since the number of contributors – around 3 lakh, are less than the number of beneficiaries.

“A very high rate of retirement at around 10,000 every year has led to a situation where fewer employees support a larger number of pensioners for the last few years. This is expected worsen as more employees retire over the next five-six years,” he said.

At the present rate of superannuation, by the end of 2021-22, the fund will have to support some 5.28 pensioners by which time the fund will totally deplete if not replenished. By 2021-22, inflow is estimated at Rs 1,875 crore while out go would be Rs 5,740 crore – the year when the fund cannot support all pensioners.

“Reasons for such large deficit are large increase in salaries of employees over the years leading to increased out go from the fund because pensions are a factor of the last drawn salary. From the year 2000 onwards, salaries were revised every five years resulting in heavy burden on the fund because the contributions by employees at 5% gradually turned out to be inadequate and the deficit started widening,” said S Q Zama, general secretary, AITUC.

“Although there is a provision of evaluating the fund’s adequacy and adjusting employee contribution every three years, there has been no such revision since 1998,” said Zama.

The fund is managed by SBI-Caps. Existing employees contribute to this corpus which along with the earning of the fund from investment in financial instruments, is used to pay pensioners.

At present 25% of the last drawn salary is paid as pension to employees who have completed 30 years. For employees not completing 30 years, the percentage is reduced on a pro-rata basis."
119,2018-05-29,Coal India,"Kolkata: Change in gratuity payment ceiling and hike in workmen salaries pulled down Coal India’s profit for the quarter and the year ended March 2018 by 52% and 24% respectively.

While the world’s largest coal producer had to provision Rs 7,384 crore on account on gratuity, the outgo was partially offset by a price hike and a levy of evacuation charge both implemented in January 2018. During 2017-18 Coal India also saw workmen salaries rise by around 20% which is estimated to result in an outgo of Rs 5,500 crore annually.

Price hike is expected to raise income by Rs 6,421 crore annually. This year Coal India was expected to earn an additional Rs 1,965 crore on account of the price hike. Evacuation charges of Rs 50 per tonne of coal is expected to earn the company Rs 2,500 crore annually and fetched Rs 800 crore this year.

It managed to register a 7% growth in coal sales in quantity terms which translated into a near 4% growth in gross sales for the year at Rs 1.27 lakh crore against Rs 1.22 lakh crore in the previous year. Sales for the quarter ended March 2018 was Rs 37,494.67 crore against Rs 35,432.37 crore in the previous corresponding period.

Coal India’s net profit for fourth quarter of 2017-18 was Rs 1,295.34 crore against Rs 2,718.80 crore in the previous corresponding period. For the year 2017-18, net profit was Rs 7020.22 crore against Rs 9,281.54 crore in 2016-17.

The company paid an an interim dividend at the rate of Rs 16.50 per share amounting to Rs 10,242 crore in 2017-18. Government of India’s share was Rs 8044.86 crore and a dividend distribution tax of Rs 2082 crore was paid on dividend distribution."
127,2018-05-30,Coal India,"The penultimate day of the expiry of the current derivative series saw the Nifty50 oscillating in an 80-point range. Stocks made a modestly negative opening and got weaker in the early trade. However, a sharp recovery followed, and after a ranged oscillation, the Nifty ended 18.95 points or 0.18 per cent lower.

For Thursday, we expect the market to trade in the similar range. The supports are likely to come in near 100-DMA level, which stands at 10,544. The market may face resistance near 10,650-10,680 zones.

The amount of shorts that still exists in the system is likely to come into play, as the session is expected to remain dominated with rollover centric activities. Thursday will see the levels of 10,650 and 10,680 playing out as immediate resistance areas. Support is expected to come in at 10,540, which is at Nifty’s 100-DMA, and after that near 10,500 level.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 50.6014. RSI continues to stay neutral showing no divergence against the price. Daily MACD stays bearish while trading below its signal line. No significant formations were seen on the candles.



Pattern analysis shows that two important levels may come into the picture. First is the 100-DMA level, which may come into play as Nifty50 took support at this level in the previous session. Second, on the upper side, 10,650 level, which happens to be the multiple pattern resistance. The level may pose resistance in event of resumption of the pullback.

Overall, there are a significant number of shorts that were seen being added and they still continue to exist. We expect a quiet opening to the trade and a rangebound movements in the early part of the session. However, there are chances that the market sees sharp moves, as some short covering might happen.

The primary reason for this is the though the month of May continued to see addition of shorts, the month of June have been witnessing long rollovers. We recommend a cautious but positive view on the market for the day.

126,2018-05-30,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities extended losses for a second straight day on Wednesday on losses in banks, auto and capital goods stocks, bogged down by Moody’s slashing of India’s growth forecast and weak global cues.

Market sentiment took a hit due to a lingering political crisis in Italy and renewed trade war fears between the US and China.

125,2018-05-30,Coal India,"S Subramanian, MD & Head of Investment Banking, Axis Capital, discusses with ET Now how Pidilite and matrimony.com could be contrarian bets.Edited excerpts: 


Given where valuations stand and given the market mayhem in the midcaps and smallcaps, do you think that time is ripe to decipher value in the market now or is there some more pain in the system which will make for more compelling valuations?
That is exactly what investors want to find out and that is exactly what we are looking to show to the investors from the corporate side. 45 companies would be coming in today and tomorrow and there is a significant interest from investors to come and meet them one on one and to ask the questions that you are asking. Is there still value? Will it correct further? What is happening to growth? 

From our side, we see investors are interested across a spectrum of companies. We have companies from technology, manufacturing, financial services, consumer and healthcare sectors. 


Historically, your midcap conferences have been anchored around themes. Is there an anchoring theme for this conference?
The anchoring theme is that perhaps there are enough opportunities in the midcap space even today that gives a fantastic opportunity for people to participate in.


45 companies and what is the common thread here? Is it centred around consumption demand?
The whole thing is that we are seeing consumption demand come through and we are continuing to see earnings recovery. There is underlying demand in the finance and consumer space. A lot of companies are seeing operating leverage kick in and we are seeing earnings growth come through. Both these are the underlying themes going through these 45 companies that are present in our conference.


Would this conference also talk about contrarian ideas? You have just come out of an earnings season. There are fresh assumptions being built about FY19 and the earnings trajectory there and are there some midcaps or underdogs which can actually outperform?
Pidilite could be a contrarian bet. It is a stock which we like even at this price. We are seeing technology companies like matrimony.com where we are seeing growth come through. That also could be a contrarian theme. We are seeing some of them come through but most of the stocks and the companies which you are coming here are showcasing continued long term demand come through. They are showing operating leverage, they are showing earnings recovery come through.


What is happening to PSU stocks? You have been part of the fund raising and M&A team. You have been part of the capital market team. Do you think it would be a tough challenge for the government to raise Rs 1 lakh crore via the disinvestment route?
PSU banks has anyway not been part of the divestment target ever because PSU banks have always been raising money for themselves. But larger companies like BHEL, IOCL or Coal India could be possible divestment targets. Whether the target of Rs 1 lakh crore is going to be met or not depends on how the process is being laid out throughout the year. 

Now May is over. We have 10 months to go and given that there is continued flow of funds into the system and many of the PSU companies are at very attractive valuations, it is not impossible for the government to do that. Let us not forget that divestment does not only mean selling directly, the government has done it through ETFs and the government has also done it through the merger of HPCL-ONGC. Therefore Rs 1 lakh crore target is not an unachievable numbers. We still have 10 months to go."

132,2018-05-31,Coal India,"Kolkata: Rating agency ICRA believes current high spot power tariffs are likely to moderate as generation from wind and hydro sources rise in June. Prices are likely to stabilise around Rs 3.5 per unit the rating firm said in a recent statement.

Spot power tariffs at the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) remained on the higher side during April and May with average spot power tariff at about Rs 4 per unit in April, which further increased to Rs 4.7 per unit in May.

Rising electricity demand and supply-side constraints caused by a shortfall in coal supply to power generation stations due to logistics in several states. Decline in coal supplies to captive power producers from Coal India following diversion to power generation utilities and independent power producers resulted in additional demand for power from the exchanges.

Commenting on the likely trend, Girish Kumar Kadam, sector head & vice president at ICRA said: “Spot market tariffs are likely to moderate to some extent with the onset of generation from wind and hydro sources in June. In the near term, tariffs would remain sensitive to demand and would also depend on the extent of improvement in coal supplies to power-generating stations. However, over the medium-term, spot power tariff is likely to be sustained at around Rs 3.5 per unit, given the surplus thermal capacity, subdued capacity utilisation of thermal power plants and an increasing mix of renewable generation.”

Nevertheless, electricity demand witnessed an improvement in FY2018, with year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth of 6.1% against 2.6% in FY2017, led by increased electricity demand from large states. Improvement in energy demand growth and slowdown in fresh capacity addition in the thermal segment has improved capacity utilisation of thermal power plants to 60.7% in FY2018 from 59.9% in FY2017.

However, demand growth slowed down to 1.7% in April 2018. In line with the slowdown in demand growth, capacity utilisation of thermal plants declined to 64.9% in April 2018 from 65.6% in March 2018.

Generation from renewable energy sources witnessed an Y-o-Y growth of 24.9% in FY2018, supported by large capacity addition in the renewable energy segment over the past 18 months. In fact, the extent of improvement in capacity utilisation was moderated by the increase in share of renewable energy sources in overall generation mix to 7.8% in FY2018 from 6.6% in FY2017.

“Apart from sustainability of demand growth, utilisation of thermal power capacity would remain linked to the share of renewables in the generation mix, in view of the renewable energy-based capacity target of 175 GW by FY2022,” added Kadam."

7,2018-06-06,Coal India,"Coal India is set to hand out Rs. 6,000 crore in pay hike and arrears to some 20,000-odd employees this financial year. The salary raise—in the range of 32-37%—will make the increments of these employees significantly higher than the average in the corporate sector.

The hike will be under three separate heads and may cost the company Rs. 2,500 crore annually, besides an additional Rs. 3,500 crore for arrears during 2018-19.

The employees will get near 10% higher basic and dearness allowance for additional pension benefits, plus another 7% to make good a Rs. 24,000 crore shortage faced by the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation, which is yet to come. In addition, executives are likely to get a salary hike between 15% and 20% this year.

The first part of the hike involving the near 10% raise has already been cleared by the coal ministry. The CIL Executive Defined Contribution Pension Scheme 2007 is a new scheme and is meant for Coal India executives only. It will be implemented with retrospective effect from January 2007.

Under the scheme, the Coal India management will deposit an additional 9.84% of basic and dearness allowance to a pension fund, which would be used to create a corpus. The deposit would be subject to a ceiling of 30% on basic and dearness, including contribution to existing pension schemes and medical benefits. It would be used to pay additional pension to executives after they retire. The fund is likely to be managed by professional fund managers and is expected to cost the company around Rs. 300 annually and an additional Rs. 3,000 crore for the 10 years of arrear payment.

The second part involves an additional 7% pay out on basic and dearness by the management to employees including workmen and executives. This will go into replenishing their pension fund, which is facing at least Rs. 25,000 crore of shortfall and would be over and above the 12% that employees currently pay, which is matched by the company by an equal 12% contribution to the fund. Employees will also contribute another 7% on this account to the pension fund. It is expected to cost the company an additional Rs. 1,000 crore annually. A gazette notification to this effect is expected to follow soon, said an executive.

The third and the largest is an expected 15% to 20% hike in salaries for executives that has been recently cleared by the board of Coal India. This hike is part of the regular salary hike that happens every 10 years and fell due last year. It is now pending approval of the coal ministry. This hike is expected to cost the company Rs 1,000 crore annually and an additional Rs. 500 crore for arrear payment since the hike would be effected from January 2017. A senior executive from Coal India said the salary hike is expected to be cleared by the ministry very soon."

11,2018-06-07,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Nearly five lakh retired employees of Coal India Limited (CIL) got a rude shock at the beginning of this month when they found that their pensions had not been remitted to their accounts, owing to what turned out to be a temporary shortage of funds.

“I have not received my pension for May till today,” NC Jha, former chairman of CIL and president of the state-run monopoly producer’s retired executives’ welfare association told ET on Wednesday.

Last Friday, about 150 former employees of the world’s largest coal producer had gathered at its headquarters in Kolkata to register their concern about non-receipt of pension.

CIL’s pension and provident fund are managed by the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO), a body which takes care of social security of coal mines workers. The fund receives 1.16% of basic and dearness allowances of an employee that is contributed by the CIL management on behalf of employees.

CMPFO commissioner Animesh Bharti told ET that there was a delay in transferring funds because there was a temporary fund shortage, aggravated by two consecutive banking strikes at the end of May, which made it difficult to remit funds into banks.

“Every month inflow into the fund is around Rs 120 crore while outgo from the fund is around Rs 180 crore. Liquid money in the pension fund was around Rs 140 crore which was not enough to pay pensions of Rs 180 crore. This prompted us to request Coal India to deposit Rs 100 crore to the pension fund. Coal India accepted our request and we started disbursing pensions,” he said.

Bharti said that the total pension fund size is around Rs 2,000 crore and all of it is invested in instruments which would require several days to liquidate since it needs approval of board of trustees. This added to the problem, he said.

Moreover, he said, Rs 2,000 crore will not suffice if not replenished by additional inflows, and the fund is slated to go dry by 2023, according to an actuarial study.

“Till 2015-16 inflow into the fund was more than its outgo. From 2016-17 onwards, outgo from the fund has turned to be in excess of income thus shrinking the fund size,” said Jha. “While at present the shortfall is around Rs 60 crore per month or Rs 720 crore annually, this outgo is expected to increase exponentially from now on, as more Coal India employees retire with salaries that are higher than those of employees retiring in the past, and will exhaust in five years. At present contribution by about 2.8 lakh employees has been supporting pensions of some nearly lakh retired employees. This ratio will worsen in the near future.”

JN Ghosh, convenor at the All India Coordination Committee of Coal Pensioners and Retired Employees Association, said: “The pension fund was created in 1998 with the provision of being reviewed for adequacy every three years. It was never reviewed all these years. Only recently, actuarial studies were conducted which indicated that the fund is facing the risk of going dry.”

However, in 2017, following pressure from the workers’ unions the management agreed to contribute 7% of basic and dearness of employees into the pension fund. Employees would match it with another 7%. This is expected to increase the fund size by around Rs 1,000 crore every year. The scheme, may have been approved by the ministry but CIL cannot issue the funds as long as the government has issued a gazette notification on the same.

Bharti said CIL agreed to contribute the Rs 100 crore because it would in any case have to start paying on account of the new scheme, which is likely to be notified soon.

According to Bharti, this additional contribution is not enough to sustain the fund in the long run and either the government or CIL needs to take a long-term view.

“An actuarial study suggested that a 14% contribution by employees matched by another 14% contribution by the management would be the ideal situation for the fund to sustain,” said SQ Zama, general secretary of the coal miners arm at All India Trade Union Congress.

Unions have been demanding a levy of Rs 50 per tonne of coal sold to help replenish the fund.

Jha said, “The levy of cess is one of the most viable options. However, it is up to the management and the government to decide.”

Zama said: “In fact even Re 1cess on every tonne of coal sold will raise the pension fund size by at least Rs 50 crore every year. This would double to Rs 100 crore by 2020 and help reach adequacy.”

He said that the union had been demanding infusion of fresh money into the pension fund for several years but it was only recently that a 7% equal contribution was allowed."

14,2018-06-07,Coal India,"L&T Group firm Nabha Power Ltd (NPL) today said it has been forced to shut a 700 MW unit of Rajpura thermal power station due to shortage of coal.

NPL, which has been supplying power to Punjab from Rajpura plant since 2014, shut down unit-2 of 700 MW on June 3, 2018 due to acute shortage of coal, a company statement said.

Earlier, unit-1 of 700 MW was shut from April 4-13 this year due to shortage of the dry fuel. The plant has two units of 700 MW each.

According to the statement, the present crisis was triggered by disruption in the supply of coal rakes to the plant. Against a daily requirement of 4 rakes of domestic coal, NPL has been receiving only 1-2 rakes per day in recent times.

NPL has been facing coal crisis since last year forcing it to operate the plant at critical levels of coal stocks i.e. less than 7 days. It was forced to shut down both units alternatively for 54 days during September to November 2017.

The company said these shutdowns were caused primarily because of Coal India restricting supplies to 75 per cent of the contracted commitments and according preference to Central and State gencos.

The company said to mitigate the present crisis, immediate actions need to be taken to allocate additional coal required to run the plant, specifically by removing the 75 per cent restriction, and to allocate adequate number of rakes to ensure smooth supplies.

It said NPL, being a Case 2 Project (unlike an IPP) is created and sustained by and for the sole benefit of Punjab. It should be accorded parity in allocation of coal and despatches of rakes at par with Government powerhouses, it said."
16,2018-06-08,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Punjab may be staring at the possibility of a thermal power supply shortage but Coal India, in a statement issued on Friday, said it has already delivered almost 75% of the contracted coal supply quantity for the period and has allowed it to lift coal from other subsidiaries too. It is up to the plants supplying power to the state to lift its full quota of coal to avoid a crisis. 

The state has a total installed capacity of 6540 mw despite which it is faced with the possibility of a power generation shortfall during crucial summer and paddy sowing season. The reason being: Its plants at Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar are being forced to run on a low capacity utilisation of about 29% despite holding coal stocks for 28 days and 36 days respectively. A third plant at Bhatinda is under shut down.

According to reports, in an effort to meet its shortfall, the state has decided to draw power from independent power producers and has been buying power from L&T Group’s Nabha Power Plant at Rajpura in the state. Reports suggest that L&T has been forced to shut down one of its 700 MW unit allegedly due to coal shortage.

However, Coal India, in the statement issued, claims that Nabha Power did not gear up its coal procurement and lifting actions sufficiently in advance.

Nabha Power Plant is linked with Coal India subsidiary, South Eastern Coalfields, for its coal requirement. Despatch from SECL are around 75% of contracted quantity due to logistic problems. 

Coal India further claims that enhanced coal requirements are met from the other subsidiaries of Coal India if not available from one subsidiary.

“During the current fiscal, at the request of Nabha Power, Coal India had allocated 3.64 lakh tonnes of coal that had to be lifted from other Coal India subsidiaries like Central Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal between April and June this year. However, out of this allocation, Nabha Power has so far booked only 1.54 lakh tonnes. Due to delayed logistic arrangement by Nabha Power, the lifting is paltry 0.25 lakh tonnes,” the Coal India statement mentions.

“Nabha Power should rather gear up for lifting the allotted coal and rush it to its plant, rather than blaming coal crisis for the shutdown of the plant,” the statement mentioned.

“The root of the problem is faulty power generation plans from the power stations of the State. Power generation should have been maximised from state owned plants of Punjab where coal stocks are comfortable,” it said.

Nevertheless, Coal India and the railways have attached priority for movement of coal to power plants in Punjab, particularly to Nabha Power. 

“On 8th June, 27 rakes of coal are in transit for Nabha Power plant. Efforts are on to maintain the momentum. Nabha Power needs to lift lift allocated coal as soon as possible during the dry weather. With onset of monsoon supplies may fall due to heavy rains and flooding,” the statement mentioned."

17,2018-06-09,Coal India,"The claim of the Nabha Power to shut down its 750 mw plant at Rajapura in Punjab due to inability of the Coal India to offer coal is not true, a CIL official said today. 

The L&T group firm Nabha Power closed its Rajapura plant on June 3 stating that it was forced to take the decision due to shortage of coal supplied by the CIL. 

The CIL official said the Nabha Power should gear up lifting the allotted coal and rush it to its plant instead of blaming coal crisis for the shutdown of the plant. 

The alleged crisis at the Nabha Power is the result of its own inept handling of coal procurement plans, as booking and lifting of additional coal allocated by CIL for the peak summer/paddy season was inordinately delayed, he said. 

Nevertheless, the CIL and the Railways have attached priority for movement of coal to the power stations of Punjab, particularly to the Nabha Power. As on June 8, as many as 27 rakes of coal are in transit for the Nabha Power plant, he said. 

Coal for this plant is linked to the SECL and normally supplies are in the level of 75 per cent of contracted quantity due to logistic problems. 

But, it is a regular practice to meet coal requirement during summer and paddy seasons from other subsidiaries of the CIL, he said. 

During the current fiscal, at the request of the Nabha Power, the CIL had allocated 3.64 lakh tonnes of coal to be lifted from the CCL and the BCCL for the period Apr18 to Jun18. 

Out of this allocation, the Nabha Power has so far booked only 1.54 lakh tonnes. Due to delayed logistic arrangement of the Nabha Power, the lifting is paltry at 0.25 lakh tonnes, he said. 

The shutdown has added to the woes of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which is already short of 1,400 mw of power due to permanent closure of four units of the Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant Bathinda and two units of the Ropar thermal plant, along with a reduction in the transfer capacity from the northern grid. 

The CIL wondered how despite having a total generation capacity of 6540 mw in the state, Punjab is staring at the prospect of power shortage in the crucial summer and paddy sowing season."
18,2018-06-10,Coal India,"By Rituparna Nath
Interim Finance Minister Piyush Goyal will hold a high-level meeting with the Power Minister RK Singh in New Delhi on Monday (June 11) on rescuing as many as 11 stressed assets. Goyal has called for this meeting after the Allahabad High Court ruled in favour of the Power Ministry and barred banks from initiating proceeding against Power producers as per a RBI Circular dated Feb 12. The HC had also directed the Finance Ministry to hold meetings with the Power Ministry on this matter.

The Power Minister RK Singh has publicly stated his reservations on this particular RBI circular as it had banned debt restructuring instruments like SDR (strategic debt restructuring) and S4A. Singh believes this circular will cause more harm to the power sector that according to a Parliamentary Standing Committee is straddled with debt, with nearly 34 projects with debt of over RS 1.75 lakh Cr being in danger of becoming NPAs. 

The power ministry this time is likely to table two resolution plans to rescue 11 stressed projects. One of them is called 'Samadhan' which has been chalked out by the SBI while the other is called 'Parivartan' by the REC.

The meeting, which shall also have the top bureaucrats of Power ministry and coal ministry in attendance, will also focus on power plants facing acute shortage of coal. The Latest data as per Central Electricity Authority (31st may 2018) shows 25 plants have critical coal stocks that will be exhausted in less than a week's time, despite the government ramping up coal loading to 500 rakes per day from 464 rakes.

While there are quite a few power plants receiving supplies in excess of their trigger level, they are still reeling under coal shortage. 

The 'trigger level' ranges between 75-90% of the annual contracted quantity (ACQ) of coal tied up from state-run Coal India Ltd. While plants are on the verge of closure, state-run Coal India Ltd. has been refuting allegations of coal shortage. 

“Adequacy of coal at plant site has to be ensured by CIL and Railways, perennial blame game between these two monopolies will not help the situation,“ Director General of Association of Power Producers, Ashok Khurana, said.

The minister will also be discussing the methodology for coal linkage for auction as well as issues of commercial coal mining. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on February 20th had opened up commercial coal mining for private player, putting an end to Coal India's monopoly in selling coal."
19,2018-06-11,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India’s average realisation from e-auctions has jumped 31% during the March quarter and 20% for FY18 on higher demand and international prices.

However, its realisation from sales through fuel supply agreements rose only 2% in the quarter from a year ago, but was up 19% from the preceding three months after the company raised prices. For the full fiscal year, price realised from fuel sales agreements fell about 3% as it had to deliver more coal to power plants to meet additional demand. This fetches a lower price than e-auctions.

Niladri Bhattacharjee, metals and mining expert at KPMG India, said coal output was lower than the initial target. “Therefore the entire unmet demand fell upon e-auction coal, which pulled up premium considerably,” he said. A Coal India executive said the trend was likely to continue this fiscal also."

34,2018-06-15,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Coal India’s stock has lost 10 per cent from its peak on February 26 so far due to weak March quarter numbers.

However, factors such as rising coal production, management’s commentary on cost reduction measures such as shutting down of unviable mines, reducing employee costs and attractive valuations makes risk-return ratio favourable for the stock.

In the March quarter, production grew at a slower pace of 2.4 per cent yearon-year. However, the growth rate improved significantly to 16.6 per cent and 15.7 per cent in April and May respectively, helped by higher production in subsidiaries. The offtake was also strong at 13 per cent and 14 per cent in that order.



Focus on reducing cost is another positive factor. The company has undertaken measures such as shutting down unviable mines and reduction in overtime wages. This should help in sustaining the operating margin in case the company finds it difficult to raise coal prices.

Based on these factors, analysts expect 30-60 per cent jump in the operating profit before depreciation (EBIDTA) and net earnings for FY19. At Thursday’s closing price of Rs 283.6, the stock was trading at 11 times FY19 expected earnings, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Its forward price-book multiple is eight times and the enterprise value (EV) is 6.4 times the forward EBITDA. These figures are among the lowest since its listing in 2010 when compared with average annual valuation multiples.

But what makes the stock even more attractive is its high dividend yield of 7.2 per cent based on Bloomberg’s dividend estimate of Rs 20.3 per share for FY19.

In the end of March quarter, Coal India had cash of Rs 31,475 crore which translates into Rs 50.7 per share. The cash balance is likely to improve with higher earnings expectations."

The government today launched the follow-on fund offer (FFO) of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), comprising shares of 22 companies, to raise up to Rs 8,400 crore from the market.

The issue opened for anchor investors today, and received subscriptions from investors including mutual funds houses, foreign portfolio investors (FPI), insurance and retirement funds.

The FFO will open for subscription for retail and other institutional investors tomorrow and will remain open till June 22.

Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Atanu Chakraborty said, ""The Bharat-22 FFO is another opportunity for the investors to participate in the India growth story as represented by the industry leading stocks of the ETF.""

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund managed Bharat-22 ETF's fund offer, through which the government aims to mop up Rs 6,000 crore with a green shoe option of raising another Rs 2,400 crore.

As much as 25 per cent of total issue size, or Rs 1,500 crore, was reserved for anchor investors who put in bids worth about Rs 5,163 crore, ICICI Prudential AMC said.

""We are happy to see the continued support received from anchor investors towards the FFO... Now, we look forward to active participation from non-anchor investor category, over the next three days, whereby one has the opportunity to own some of the jewels of Corporate India at a discounted price,"" ICICI Prudential AMC MD and CEO Nimesh Shah said.

The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T.

The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs 32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs 14,500 crore.

The state-owned companies that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- feature in the Bharat-22 index.

Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs 11,500 crore in three tranches -- Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."
51,2018-06-20,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India and its eight subsidiaries are likely to have six board level-posts falling vacant in the next eight months while another nine are already vacant at a time when the company is struggling to meet the country’s demand for coal.

A senior Coal India executive said top-level vacancies would make it difficult to take key decisions on investment, manpower, finance, production and supplies. “Delay in taking decisions about supplies or production leads to issues that the consuming industry faces,” the executive said.

The posts of chairman and managing director, director finance, director technical and director personnel are already vacant at Eastern Coalfields for some times now, the executive said.

The chairman and managing director of Mahanadi Coalfields, AK Jha, has been recently appointed as chairman and managing director of Coal India. The post of chairman and managing director of Mahanadi Coalfields, thus, automatically fell vacant although he is on additional charge of the post.

Jha recently told reporters he wanted to give up the charge of chairman of Mahanadi Coalfields since it would be difficult to manage both the posts. “I have requested the ministry to depute someone else for the chairman’s post at Mahanadi Coalfields,” he told reporters.

At Northern Coalfields, the posts of director finance and director personal are already vacant, while the posts of chairman and managing director and director technical are vacant at South Eastern Coalfields.

According to the executive, the post of director finance at Coal India is slated to fall vacant soon. The posts of director technical are slated to fall vacant soon at Bharat Coking Coal, Western Coalfields and Central Coalfields.

The Public Enterprises Selection Board generally recommends the suitable candidates for top jobs in state firms. However, recently after interviewing nine candidates, it found nobody suitable for the post of director technical at South Eastern Coalfields. It decided to interview more candidates.

 Candidates interviewed included those from South Eastern Coalfields, Mahanadi Coalfields, Northern Coalfields, Bharat Coking Coal, Eastern Coalfields, Neyveli Lignite, and Sadbhav Engineering."

59,2018-06-22,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal-fired power plants with total installed capacity of around 9,000 MW are asking for extension of temporary coal supply contracts for at least six years, since they have not been able to start production from the captive blocks allotted to them more than three years ago.

Delays in land acquisition, forest clearance and issue of possession letters from states have delayed production at these mines.

These plants are likely to require between 35 million and 40 million tonnes of coal to run at 80% capacity. This coal could have been supplied to other users who do not have captive blocks if production from the allotted coal blocks had started on schedule, a senior Coal India executive said.

“These plants were offered temporary coal supply contracts for three years on the understanding that they would be able to start coal production from their captive mines within the time frame. These three-year supply contracts are scheduled to expire this year for all these plants and none of them has been able to start production from their captive blocks. Having failed to start production, they are now asking for extension of coal supply contract,” the executive said.

Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd was allotted the Saharpur-Jamarpani Coal Block of the Rajmahal Coal Mines in Jharkhand during August 2015. Following the allotment, the UP government ramped up its power generation capacity expansion plan. This block is linked to Harduaganj Extension coal-fired plant (660 MW), Jawaharpur Thermal Power Plant (2 x 660 MW), Obra C Power Plant (2 x 660 MW) and Panki Extension Thermal Power Plant (660 MW)."

This would be followed by offers for other sectors like cement, steel and captive power plants. According to a senior Coal India executive, 25 million tonnes of thermal coal would be on offer under the auction while the rest at 5 million tonnes would be coking coal for metallurgical uses.

According to a preliminary plan, South Eastern Coalfields will offer 9 million tonnes of coal; Central Coalfields, 6.11 million tonnes and Northern Coalfields 6.3 million tonnes. Mahanadi Coalfields plans to offer 5.2 million tonnes while Western Coalfields would be offering 3.5 million tonnes. Bharat Coking Coal and Eastern Coalfields would be offering 0.5 million tonnes and 0.55 million tonnes respectively.

This is part of the government’s plan to replace all existing fuel supply agreements allotted on nomination basis to the non-power sector with supply contracts decided through e-auctions. The government will not renew existing agreements although they will not be prematurely terminated.

“If a fuel supply agreement expires before announcement of long-term supply contract auction, Coal India will not renew it but will continue to supply coal till a fresh round of auction is announced. They would be eligible for bidding for the exact amount of coal they have been receiving through their recently expired fuel supply agreement. They would have to participate in the auctions meant for the non-power sector in which they belong,” a senior Coal India executive said.

This auction is likely to be followed by an auction for the power sector. This would be power companies that do not have coal supply agreement and power purchase agreement. The auction would be on the basis of highest bid like in the case of non-power sectors."

85,2018-06-27,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Sembcorp Energy, Jaiprakash Associates, IL&FS and RKM PowerGen are among eight companies that responded to the government’s pilot scheme to aggregate and auction power purchase agreements (PPAs), to help them generate electricity from idling plants and repay loans. 

Bids were received for 2,200 mw PPAs against 2,500 mw offered by the government. 

Projects of some companies, including GMR Energy, Coastal Energen and Lanco Infratech, which do not have assured coal supplies or are pending in insolvency court, could not participate in the bidding process, people close to the development said. 

“Companies that are in the insolvency court did not receive the requisite permission from NCLT,” one of the sources said. “Companies that do not have an assured supply of coal have stayed away from bidding. The no escalation clause could also have been a deterrent,” the person said. The aggregate PPA demand from states, however, has been close to 5,000-mw, he said.

Companies that submitted bids for the PPA auction include MB Power, Jindal India Thermal Power, Avantha Group’s Jhabua Power, and SKS Power. These companies either have fuel supply agreements with Coal India or have imported coal tieups, sources said.

The companies had submitted technical and price bids on Tuesday. The price bids of technically qualified companies will be opened on July 6. 

“It is a welcome step, idling capacity with coal linkage/imported coal of 2200 mw will get PPA and will be able to service loan and meet O&M costs,” said Ashok Khurana, director general at Association of Power Producers, said. “Next aggregated bid should be with coal linkage so that idling plants without coal can also bid,” he said.

The government had in April kicked off the pilot scheme for procurement of aggregate power of 2,500 mw on competitive basis for three years from commissioned projects without PPAs.

PFC Consulting Ltd has been appointed as nodal agency and PTC India is the PPA aggregator that will sign the PPAs with successful bidders and discoms.

Under the scheme, a single entity can be allotted maximum capacity of 600 mw. The scheme assures minimum offtake of 55% of contracted capacity and the tariff will be fixed for three years without any escalation. Also the fixed cost for the PPA auction has been kept at 1 paisa per unit.

The scheme looks to address the issue of stressed assets. Lack of PPAs is one of the key reasons for stress in the power sector, besides factors such as promoters’ equity crunch, no coal supply, and regulatory and contractual issues.

Electricity distribution companies have not called long-term contracts in the last few years. Long-term PPAs of some states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh did not materialise."

The government last year decided against renewing fuel supply agreements signed on nomination basis with the nonpower companies, and said these pacts would be replaced with supply contracts decided through e-auctions.

“Once a supply contract expires, consumers would be eligible for bidding for the exact amount of coal they have been receiving through their recently expired fuel supply agreement. They would have to participate in the auctions meant for the non-power sector in which they belong,” the Coal India executive said, requesting not to be named. According to the executive, the company offered 100,000 tonnes of coal from South Eastern Coalfield’s New Kushmunda mines at a base price of Rs 1,145 per tonne. It was fully booked at a premium of Rs 885 per tonne. Another 50,000 tonnes offered to the sector from Surakachhar mines of the same subsidiary at Rs 2,311 per tonne was fully booked at a premium of Rs 500 per tonne, the executive said.

Subsequently 100,000 tonnes of additional coal offered by South Eastern Coalfields on the second day at a base price of Rs 2,311 per tonne was fully booked at Rs 1,280 per tonne – a 55% premium. The coal offered was of G7 grade from the subsidiary’s Chirimiri open cast mine.

Mahanadi Coalfields offered 100,000 tonnes of G12 grade of coal at a base price of Rs 1,063 per tonne and received a premium of Rs 870 per tonne – an 81% premium.

The sponge iron sector would be offered a total of 7 million tonnes of coal and Coal India hopes to command a decent premium that is expected to average out to at least 50% on the base price, which in any case is 20% higher than the price offered to the power sector.

Offers made are part of Coal India’s recently announced fourth tranche of long-term supply contract meant for the nonpower sector. It has firmed up plans to offer a total of 30 million tonnes of coal to the nonpower sectors. According to the Coal India executive, 25 million tonnes of thermal coal would be on offer under the auction while the rest (5 million tonnes) would be coking coal for metallurgical uses.

“The entire fourth phase of the auctions would be held in phases, where each phase would be meant for a specific industry. After the first phase for sponge iron is complete, supply contracts would be offered for cement, steel, captive power plants and others,” the Coal India executive said.

According to plans, South Eastern Coalfields would be offering 9 million tonnes of coal followed by Central Coalfields at 6.11 million tonnes and Northern Coalfields at 6.3 million tonnes. Mahanadi Coalfields plans to offer 5.2 million tonnes while Western Coalfields would be offering 3.5 million tonnes. Bharat Coking Coal and Eastern Coalfields would be offering 0.5 million tonnes and 0.55 million tonnes, respectively.

This tranche of auction is likely to be followed by an auction for the power sector. This would be for power companies that do not have coal supply agreement or power purchase agreement."

""Clearly the focus is on higher coal output and increased supplies and there had been a consistent growth both in coal production and supplies to consumers during all the three months of the first quarter,"" a senior official of Coal India said.

While the offtake was spurred by higher rake loading, the overall coal offtake zoomed to 153.43 million tonne at the end of June, translating into a growth of 11.7 per cent.

Coal supplies to power stations stood at 122.84 million tonne during the quarter.

The number of power stations having critical stock has come down from 30 in April to 16 as on June-end, the company said.

""Our aim is to shore up coal stocks at thermal power plants to the normative stock of 22 days requirement and see that the coal-fired power plants do not suffer for want of coal. We have also requested the thermal power plants to perk up their coal stocks, the official said.

Power sector accounted for 80 per cent of coal supplies during the period.

Coal India has been working with the Coal and Railways ministries for enhanced rake loading of 217.04 rakes per day on an average to the power sector during the first quarter of FY'19 against 189.9 rakes in the same period last year, registering a growth of 14.9 per cent.

Mazhar Mohammad recommended keeping a stop loss at Rs 255.

""For the last couple of months, this counter appears to have carved out a trading range between Rs 295 – Rs 260 levels. As this scrip is currently trading close to the lower end of its trading range, a bounce back towards Rs 295, as happened on multiple occasions in the past, can’t be ruled out unless it breaches the lower boundary.

9,2018-07-06,Coal India,"Mumbai: A lower base in the previous year’s quarter and likely good show by select companies in sectors such as automobiles, capital goods, FMCG, IT, and metals should help the Nifty 50 companies report a double-digit growth in aggregate sales and profits for the June 2018 quarter. According to the ET Intelligence Group’s estimates, net sales is likely to increase by 12.1 per cent and net profit by 13.5 per cent year-on-year. Sales and profit will grow in double- digits for the fifth and third consecutive quarters, respectively.

The corporate performance in the June 2018 quarter will get a leg up given relatively muted performance in the year-ago quarter. This was because of lower inventories of companies in the June 2017 quarter ahead of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1, 2017. Subsequently, net profit of the sample grew marginally by 1.8 per cent during the year-ago quarter on sales growth of 10 per cent while the operating profit fell by 1.3 per cent.

Operating profit for the June 2018 quarter is likely to grow by 15 per cent, the highest growth in at least nine quarters. In addition, the operating margin is expected to improve by 180 basis points year-onyear to 20.2 per cent.

For investors, the quarter will be crucial in deciding whether an overall turnaround will be in sight amid headwinds of strong crude oil prices, a weakening rupee, rising inflation and hardening interest rates.




SECTOR TRENDS

AUTOMOBILESAuto companies are expected to report good numbers following sustained volume growth across the vehicle segments thanks to improving consumer sentiments, replacement demand and price increase. Auto volumes grew 13-60 per cent during the June quarter. A better operating leverage is likely to support operating margins of Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki and domestic operations of Tata Motors.


BANKING AND FINANCEPrivate sector banks with relatively higher focus on corporate lending, including Axis Bank and ICICI Bank, are expected to report lesser amount of new non-performing assets considering their higher slippages in the previous quarter. This combined with rising retail book may help them to post a resilient performance.


CAPITAL GOODSThe continued support from the government-funded projects is likely to support the earnings growth of capital goods companies. The trend in Larsen & Toubro’s order flow will be watched closely since the country’s largest infrastructure company has earlier guided for 12-15 per cent growth in order flow on a higher base. PowerGrid is expected to maintain the ratio of project commission-to-capital expenditure above one.


CEMENTCement prices were largely stable during the June quarter, which means companies may not be able to clock meaningful growth in realisations. Volume growth will be between 5 per cent and 18 per cent for large companies. Companies are expected to record 4-21 per cent year-on-year revenue growth.


FMCGFor FMCG, numbers may not be strictly comparable due to destocking before the GST implementation in the previous June quarter. However, the positive trend shown by FMCG companies in the previous two quarters is likely to continue. Nifty companies HUL and Asian Paints are expected to deliver highteen sales growth, albeit on a low base, while ITC may report modest numbers as the year-on-year decline in cigarette volumes continues.


IT
Select top IT companies including TCS, Infosys, and HCL Tech are likely to report 2-3 per cent growth in the dollar denominated revenue keeping the currency rates constant to the previous quarter’s levels. The impact of unfavourable cross-currency rates between the euro, the pound, and the dollar may be partially offset by 4 per cent sequential drop in the average rupee rate against the dollar. The trend in digital revenue will be critical.


METALSFerrous metal companies are likely to do better than non-ferrous counterparts unlike the previous few quarters, thanks to record high global steel spreads (excluding Europe). Non-ferrous companies will face the headwinds on the cost front, particularly coal, crude derivatives and alumina. Coal India is expected to do well with 15 per cent volume growth in the first three months of FY19.


PHARMAPharma companies are likely to report strong double-digit growth for their Indian businesses, due to low base of the previous June quarter. The US business for pharma companies is likely to remain flattish to marginally positive due to lack of any meaningful launches. However, the Indian players will benefit from the rupee depreciation and see a double- digit operating profit growth in the US business.


TELECOMTelecom companies are expected to report pressure on average revenue per user for voice and data segments. This may limit the scope for higher topline growth despite rising data usage."
10,2018-07-06,Coal India,"Is India’s power sector, dogged by supply overhang and debt for long, finally showing early signs of revivalRs The demand-supply situation is improving with tapering capacity additions and accelerated retirements of old capacities. This also reflects in the improving plant load factor (PLF), or capacity utilisation in FY18, and a rebound in merchant tariffs.

From their 2017 lows, of Rs 2.5 last July, tariffs have rebounded to Rs 3.7 per unit average price in June. Similarly, after seven years of decline, industry PLF improved by 100 basis points yearon-year to 51 per cent (excluding renewables) and by 100 basis points to 58 per cent in case of only thermal (coal and gas) power capacities.



Gross conventional capacity additions are also drying up – down to only 6 GW in FY18 from 9 GW in FY17 and 23 GW in FY16. It peaked in FY13 at 24 GW. At the same time, retirement of old capacities is accelerating – from none in FY16 to 4 GW in FY17 and 4.1 GW in FY18 against estimated retirement of 1.5 GW in each of the last two years. While the incremental supply is tapering, demand is estimated to gradually inch higher in the coming years. Industry experts expect the demand growth to be at 6.3 per cent for the next three years, compared to 5.6 per cent in the last three years.



This improving demand-supply situation would be a positive for the listed power companies such as JSW Energy, CESC, NTPC, Coal India and Power Grid. Unlike several other power utilities that are under stress due to high debt or lack of fuel availability, these companies are well placed with strong balance sheets and no fuel-related issues.



Stocks of these companies are trading at multiyear low valuations – price-to-book multiples – and can see a re-rating if the positive trend continues for the next few quarters."

12,2018-07-06,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Onus of coal quality ends at loading point, coal ministry has clarified.

In view of continuing disputes between Coal India and power consumers over loss of quality of coal during transport, the coal ministry has reiterated that once coal in loaded on rakes Coal India’s responsibility on the quality of coal ends. 

The ministry in a note reiterated: “As soon as coal is loaded in rakes the sale is complete under the Sale of Goods Act. Upon loading, the ownership gets transferred to power generators. Since the railways is the transporter engaged by coal buyers, including power generating companies, the issue of any loss during transit needs to be resolved by consumers with railways as the coal companies have no locus standi once the ownership has changed. Therefore, it would be appropriate that the coal consumers take up the issue of loss in coal incurred during transportation with the ministry of railways.” 

The ministry’s clarification says that from June 2016, tripartite agreements between power generators, coal companies and Central Institute of Mining & Fuel Rerearch (CIMFR) have been signed for independent third party sampling by CIMFR to ensure quality of coal at the dispatch point, and at the same time CIMFR has also been entrusted by the power generators for quality checks at the unloading end of the coal so dispatched."
13,2018-07-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: RKM PowerGen, Jaiprakash Associates, IL&FS and MB Power are among seven companies that have bid the lowest in an auction of three-year power supply contracts with stressed plants, quoting a price of Rs 4.24 per unit. 

According to a senior official, Jindal India Thermal Power, Avantha Group’s Jhabua Power and SKS Power were the other three that matched the lowest price in the pilot scheme for plants stressed for want of power contracts. The companies either have fuel supply agreements with state-run Coal India or have tieups for imported coal, the official said. 

The contracts will help these plants meet part of their debt obligations, persons aware of the matter said. Sembcorp Energy, which had submitted technical bids, decided against matching the winning price. The company is looking for a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), but its plant is not financially stressed because it is running with short-term contracts and spot market sales. The financial bids were opened on Friday. 


Others

“RKM PowerGen’s Chhattisgarh-based coal project emerged as L1 with Rs 4.24/unit power supply at state’s periphery,” the official said. “All bidders, except Sembcorp, matched the L1 tariff.” 

The scheme, which is likely to see tie ups for a total of 1,900 Mw, assures minimum offtake of 55% of contracted capacity. The tariff will be fixed for three years without any escalation. Also, the fixed cost for the PPA auction has been kept at 1paisa per unit. 

The official said that as per the tender, the distribution company will get additional discount of 1% in tariff on each 5% extra procurement over 55% of a project’s capacity. “Hence, if a distribution company dispatches 100% power, it would get a discount and shall pay tariff reduced up to Rs 3.86 per unit,” he said. 

Industry executives, however, said, high power supply will be possible with increased coal supply availability. According to the official, power flow should start in October, considering the required transmission access. He said eight states including Gujarat have requisitioned a total of 4,800 Mw under the scheme. 

Ashok Khurana, director-general of Association of Power Producers, said, “Lowest bid of Rs 4.24 per unit, fixed for three years in the pilot scheme is very encouraging. This is a very good mechanism for providing PPAs and improving cash flows of stressed assets. Next tender with slight adjustment of risk apportionment and coal linkage may see bids in the range of Rs 3.75 unit.” 

In April, the government had kicked off the pilot scheme for procurement of aggregate power of 2,500 Mw, with PFC Consulting Ltd as the nodal agency and PTC India is PPA aggregator. Bids were received for 2,200 Mw from eight companies. The scheme looks to address the issue of stressed assets. Lack of PPAs is one of the key reasons for stress in the power sector, besides factors such as promoters’ equity crunch, no coal supply and regulatory and contractual issues. Electricity distribution companies have not called long-term contracts in the last few years."
14,2018-07-07,Coal India,"India is facing a severe coal shortage, which has stranded many power plants, which cannot be revived without secure fuel supply. The Centre has allowed states to import coal for their thermal plants because Coal India has not been able to meet its targets, leaving power plants stranded or short-supplied. But imports don’t look viable for many power plants. The power sector will face fuel uncertainty for another two to three years.

15,2018-07-09,Coal India,"Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com, tells ET Now that from a shorter term perspective, he likes AIA Engineering, MM Forgings and NRB Bearings. One has to look across caps and see where growth is fairly comfortable, says Pandey.Edited excerpts: 


Goldman Sachs says correction provides a good buying opportunity in Voltas. and we have seen how the stock has performed in the past as well, a classic consumption theme based on consumer durables, how do you view the road ahead for Voltas?
Voltas is chasing a fairly large opportunity. Now, the entire AC market is somewhere about 50-60 lakh odd and has the potential to grow 10 times from the current level. However, from a shorter term perspective, most of the AC or cooling manufacturers did not have a good season, particularly, Voltas.
Another challenge for Voltas was that somewhere down the line, the inverter AC prices were not so high which again impacted them because they were banking more on traditional products and which is why I think this quarter was not particularly good for a lot of these companies including Voltas. If somebody looks at it from a structural perspective, then the correction is a good opportunity to buy. But if you are expecting something in a shorter term, that may not happen. So, structurally one should be positive on the stock which is what we have been but for the next three to six months we do not expect much of a price performance from the stock.


Kickstarting the earnings season, what is the expectation from the big boy TCS? Will they match up to the price performance in the stock?
Within the IT pack, TCS has been giving superlative kind of a growth and even this quarter we expect a dollar revenue growth of about 3.5% odd which will be one of the best within the tier-1 plays. 

Compared to that, what we expect is that some of the plays like Wipro and even HCL Tech in terms of organic growth may not be great in terms of numbers. My view is that with better delta of growth getting delivered by TCS, the outperformance will continue. The stock has been one of the best performing stocks in the last six months in the index. It is up about 38% odd and is trading at relatively expensive multiples compared to peers. My sense is that given the fact that the company has been winning big client deals, the growth looks far more sustainable. With currency depreciation, things are better for this company as well as the other players so it is a good tailwind for them. So, we would expect TCS to keep outperforming the rest of the peers.


What about the valuations? TCS may outperform but the scope of outperformance could be restrictive because TCS is now almost 70-80% higher in terms of valuations compared with HCL Tech and about 50% higher in comparison with Infosys?
The cheapest stock within the tier-1 is Wipro at about 12 times. For next quarter, the company has already guided for a sequential decline in revenues. The market is clearly favouring growth. A stock like Bajaj Finance has been relatively expensive compared to the peers. But it is one of the few stocks which has been growing in excess of 30% odd rate, including this particular quarter also. 

If you look at a stock like Coal India, there has hardly been any price performance despite the fact that the stock has been attractive for quite some time and offers good dividend yield. The one template which we have been looking at for quite some time has been growth. The stock is offering growth. The market is willing to pay premium for that. And that still stays with us.


Where could the disappointment come in? Could it be banks? IndusInd Bank is slated to come out with its numbers up. Would you say it is going to be as steady a performance or is there room of disappointment?
Private banks are expected to deliver good high teen kind of growth in terms of NII and a good double digit bottom line growth, including IndusInd Bank. What is playing out in a bigger way is that the entire PSU basket is ceding market share to these private players and that is why despite being slightly expensive, most of the stocks have been doing well, including HDFC Bank. 

My sense is that that structural trend will keep playing out because I do not see much of a hope for PSU banks in terms of raising capital and delivering growth on expectations of the market.


What is currently there on your buy list? Where are you advising your clients to stick to midcaps? By midcap companies, I mean those market cap of below $5 billion?
From a shorter term perspective, some of the midcaps which we have been recommending include AIA Engineering. The stock has been fairly stable in last six months. Another one is MM Forgings. Then there is NRB Bearings. 

In most of these stocks we expect a good double digit top line and bottom line growth panning out. In case of MM Forgings, we are sensing that the company has achieved FY19 numbers in FY18 itself. The growth has been fairly robust. These are the kind of stocks which we like. One has to look across caps and where the growth is fairly comfortable. These are the stocks one should be looking at.


Which are your big bets in the auto segment?
So, for example, NRB Bearing is not a direct auto ancillary but if you look at a bulk of their revenues are coming from auto side so about 33% of their revenues come from two-wheelers and another 20% from passenger vehicles and another 20% coming from CV side so it is a good indirect play on the entire auto as a space. There we have a target price of 215. A lot of these stocks, in fact the entire bearing space, has been looking very attractive to us.
We have seen that this entire space has started growing in double digits and the commentary from the spend of the railways plus the outlook for autos as a segment is fairly bright and it is improving the prospects for these companies.


Is there merit in buying Ashok Leyland because the CV cycle is turning around? But this is not 2018 news, this is a 2017 story. Is Ashok Leyland at the current juncture pricing in all the good news related to a turnaround in CV cycle?
From a cycle perspective, till 2020, the outlook for growth is fairly robust. If we get a scrappage policy, the growth outlook beyond 2020 will also improve. Within the CV space, Tata Motors seems to be discounting and has been snatching away some market share from Ashok Leyland and that is why the stock has been under pressure. 

This decline is at a fairly good level from a structural perspective. As for Tata Motors, the way the company has been spending and is about to spend and the outlook for that is really not that much clear because the EV space is still an uncharted territory for the company. From that perspective, it makes better sense to go for Ashok Leyland rather than Tata Motors."

27,2018-07-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The coal sector is poised for a round of business-friendly reforms after being opened up for private commercial mining.

An high-power committee, headed by former Central Vigilance Commission Pratyush Sinha, has recommended a complete overhaul of regulations governing mine auctions — including bidding on revenue share basis, allowing captive mines to sell part of the output in the market and easing of bank guarantees — sources familiar with the matter said. The committee has also suggested linking the value of to-be-auctioned blocks with a proposed monthly coal index, which is to be developed on the basis of the prevalent spot price and rates for captive mining, international markets and Coal India.

Experts see the recommendations as investor-friendly for a sector that has always been strictly governed by the state.

The committee, whose members include former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya and former Union Bank of India CMD Arun Tiwari, was set up in December last year to examine challenges of the current rupees per tonne bidding system and suggest changes for conducting future auctions.

In its report submitted to the coal ministry last week, the committee has sought to allow captive miners to sell 25% of their output in the open market. At present, captive miners have to sell any excess production to Coal India at a notified price. The report has also suggested flexibility in coal mining to captive bidders in line with requirements of the attached end-use plants. Currently, owners are penalised if the captive mines do not reach the production milestones as per schedule.

Queries sent to the coal ministry on Saturday were not answered. Debasish Mishra, leader (energy, resources and industrials), Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, India, said, “These would be welcome improvements to the earlier coal block auction guidelines. However, given a negative global outlook on coal and challenging overground conditions in India — land acquisition, clearances and financial stress in user industries such as power and steel — it’s unlikely that future auctions would evoke similar euphoria as in 2015.”


The formation of the expert committee last year was followed by annulment of the last two tranches of coal mine auctions — the fourth and fifth rounds to non-power firms — due to tepid response. The coal ministry seeks to auction 19 captive blocks this financial year and is in the process of identifying mines for commercial mining.

The present coal mine auction mechanism has been provided under the Coal Mines Special Provisions Act and the amended Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act. The procedure, laid down under the Coal Block Allocation Rules introduced by the NDA government, provides for reverse online auctions for power projects and forward bidding for other uses.

Through enactment of Coal Mines Special Provisions Act, the NDA government had also paved way for private commercial coal mining."

Natural Gas, ATF under GST This Week? 
The GST Council may meet on July 21 to consider bringing jet fuel (ATF) and natural gas under GST ambit but tax slab is acting as a deterrent. While considerations of revenue loss to both Centre and states are holding back bringing all of them under GST net immediately, natural gas and ATF are considered fit case to begin the process. However, fitting the two products in the 5, 12, 18 and 28% GST tax slabs is proving to be difficult. 


Rural Growth Driven by Farm Loan WaiversThe green-shoots of demand growth seen in some rural pockets is driven by farm loan waivers and not likely due to real increases in rural incomes and wages, indicative that the economy is still some time away from a full-blown rural revival, says a report by HDFC Bank. A similar phenomenon was witnessed in 2009 when the then government had waived farm loans and tractor sales grew by 30%. Rural wages, which is the most important leg of the rural demand growth, has been moderating since the middle of 2017. According to recent Nielsen data, rural growth outpaced urban demand, rising by 13.5% in the March quarter. 


Trade Deficit at 5-Year HighIndia's trade deficit widened to its highest in more than five years in June, the trade ministry said on Friday, driven largely by a surge in oil prices and a weaker rupee. Though merchandise exports rose 17.57% year-on-year in June, the trade deficit widened to $16.6 billion from $14.62 billion in May. Oil imports rose 56.61% to $12.73 billion. The oil import bill of India, the world's third biggest crude importer, rose sharply with global oil prices amid concerns that US sanctions against Iran would remove a substantial volume of crude oil from the world markets. 


Coal Sector ReformsAfter being opened up for private commercial mining, the coal sector is poised for a round of business-friendly reforms. An high-power committee, headed by former Central Vigilance Commission Pratyush Sinha, has recommended a complete overhaul of regulations governing mine auctions including bidding on revenue share basis, allowing captive mines to sell part of the output in the market and easing of bank guarantees. Linking the value of to-be-auctioned blocks with a proposed monthly coal index, to be developed on the basis of prevalent spot price and rates for captive mining, international markets and Coal India are also on cards. 


China Q2 GDP Grows As ExpectedChina’s economy grew 6.7% in the second quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, in line with expectations. The data points to a modest slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, as the government’s multi-year efforts to tackle debt risks begin to weigh on growth and a trade war with the United States threatens exports. Markets have been closely monitoring the data as the first salvos have been exchanged in a trade war with the United States. It is expected to show growth easing very marginally to 6.7%.


Oil Prices FallOil prices fell on Monday as concerns about supply disruptions eased and Libyan ports resumed export activities, while traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other oil producers. Brent crude futures were down 26 cents, or 0.4%, at $75.07 a barrel at 0057 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 27 cents, or 0.4%, at $70.74 a barrel. Supply outages in Libya and strike action in Norway and Iraq pushed oil prices higher late last week, although prices still ended down for a second straight week. Russia and other major oil producers may increase output further should supply shortages hit the global oil market.

32,2018-07-18,Coal India,"There is no shortage of coal for the power sector as coal-based power generation grew by 5.3 per cent in the April-June quarter, the government said today.

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said, ""There is no shortage of coal for the power sector.""

In the beginning of the ongoing fiscal, state-owned Coal India (CIL ) had a pithead stock of 55.55 million tonnes (MT) and the fuel stock at power house end was 16.27 MT.

In the first quarter of FY2018-19, CIL dispatched a record quantity of 122.2 MT coal to the power sector, thereby achieving a growth of 15 per cent over the dispatch in the corresponding period last year.

""The growth in dispatch of coal to power sector has helped coal-based generation to achieve positive growth of 5.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2018-19,"" the minister said.

Late last month, the AAP government had written to Union Power Minister R K Singh that Delhi was staring at a power blackout due to the fast depleting coal stockpiles at power plants in the city and had urged him to take up the issue with the Railways which transports coal to the national capital."

36,2018-07-19,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India subsidiary Northern Coalfields and the railways are jointly investing about Rs 6,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh to lay new tracks and turn the existing ones into dual gauge, a move the coal behemoth hope will help it sell an additional 15 million tonnes of the fuel.

“Although we would be producing 100 million tonnes of coal this year, our ability to send coal to upcountry consumers are limited due to congestion in existing rail network around our mines. Once the railway projects are completed, coal sale to consumers in north India is expected to rise,” Northern Coalfields chairman PK Sinha told ET.

Northern Coalfields has 11 operational mines in Moher Basin of Madhya Pradesh’s Singrauli district. The mines are surrounded by power plants of NTPC, Lanco and state-owned power companies with aggregate capacity of 14,400 MW. More than half of the coal produced at these mines is delivered to these power plants through dedicated rail tracks. The country’s upcountry consumers are expected to get about 32 million tonnes of coal this year.

A senior Northern Coalfields’ executive said the company has decided to invest about Rs 1,150 crore this year in expanding its production capabilities. “The plan is to expand production capability so that we can send more coal once the railway expansion projects are complete,” the executive said.

The plan includes doubling the production capacities of its Jayant and Dudhcihua coal blocks to 20 million tonnes per annum. Expansion projects also include jacking up Bina coal blocks’ production capacity from 7.5 million tonnes to 10.5 million tonnes.

Once the railway projects are complete, the company hopes to send about 47 million tonnes of coal to consumers outside its pithead area.

Railway projects include laying a new 11-km long track from its coal block at Amlohri to the adjacent block, Jayant, both in Madhya Pradesh. The Jayant coal block is already connected to a railway network. The project cost, to be borne by Northern Coalfields, is estimated at Rs 650 crore and is scheduled to be completed by March next year.

The second project is by Indian Railways, and it includes doubling and electrification of tracks between Shaktinagar and Kerala at an estimated investment of Rs 541 crore. The project is expected to be completed by March 2020.

“Once electrification of all tracks in the area is complete, our ability to send coal to northern India will increase by around 20%,” said a senior executive of Northern Coalfields.

The railways have also undertaken a project to double tracks between Katini and Singrauli at an investment of Rs 2,085 crore. It has also taken up a project to double tracks between Singrauli and Ramni at an investment of Rs 2,675 crore. Both projects are expected to be completed by March 2020, by which time its production capabilities would have increased to sell more coal to upcountry customers."

41,2018-07-23,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Finance Ministry is planning to transfer government shares of 10 PSUs, including MMTC, ITDC, MRPL, Hindustan Copper, to a fund to meet Sebi's minimum public shareholding norms.

As per the norms, PSUs were mandated to achieve the minimum 25 per cent public shareholding by August 21, 2017, which was later extended by a year.

With the deadline looming, the ministry is contemplating to shift government shareholding in the 10 PSUs to 'Special National Investment Fund' (SNIF) to meet the market watchdog's norms as it may not be possible to sell stake in these companies in the current market conditions.

The proposal, being prepared by the finance ministry, would be placed before the Union Cabinet for approval soon, sources told PTI.

The 10 PSUs in which government shareholding has to be brought down to 75 per cent also include Coal India, NLC (formerly Neyveli Lignite) , SJVN, State Trading Corporation (STC), Kudremukh Iron Ore Company (KIOCL) and Madras Fertilisers.

As per the note prepared by the ministry, Alternate Mechanism (AM) for disinvestment would be empowered to decide on shares of which PSUs could be transferred to SNIF. The AM will help the ministry in taking quick decisions in view of the changing market conditions.

Currently, the ministry is conducting roadshows for selling stake in Coal India and NLC. Government holds 78.32 per cent stake in CIL and 84.04 per cent in NLC.

In case the ministry is unable to offload shares in these two companies to 75 per cent, the AM would decide on transferring their shareholding to SNIF, sources said.

In August last, the Cabinet had approved setting up of an AM comprising finance minister, road transport minister and the concerned administrative minister, to decide on modalities of stake sale in PSUs.

The government had in 2013 approved setting up of SNIF with the specific objective of meeting the minimum public shareholding of 10 per cent as was then mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

The Centre had then transferred 10 per cent of its stake in six sick CPSEs - FACT, Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing, HMT, Scooters India, Andrew Yule and Company, and ITI-- to SNIF .

Now, with the August 21 deadline approaching fast, the government is considering to transfer more shares to meet the 25 per cent public float norm.

SNIF was formed to transfer the number of shares that was required to make six sick companies compliant with the minimum public shareholding norm without any consideration.

The fund was managed by independent professional fund managers and was assigned to sell the shares within a period of five years. The funds realised from the stake-sale would be used for funding social sector schemes of the government."

43,2018-07-24,Coal India,"Coal India has managed an average premium of 39% on 6.38 million tonnes of coal it auctioned to sponge iron customers, helping the state-run coal monopoly get additional annual revenue of Rs 1,248 crore for five years, a company executive said.

If these supply contracts were awarded on nomination basis, it would have earned about Rs 350 crore less, the executive said. That is because the average price realised at the auction was Rs 1,955.8 per tonne, while the average notified price of the coal on offer was Rs 1,407.6 per tonne.

The price is 59% higher than what is charged to power sector consumers.

Coal India sold 88% of the 7.27 million tonnes in contracts for a minimum period of five years in the auction that spanned 18 days from June 26, the executive said. Mahanadi Coalfields, one of the largest subsidiaries of the company, got a 50.6% premium over the notified price for 2 million tonnes of coal that was offered and fully booked. This will help it raise sales by Rs 311.31 crore a year.

South Eastern Coalfields, which offered 3 million tonnes of a higher grade coal, got a premium of 44.8% over notified price, which will help it add Rs 719.26 crore a year to its revenue. Eastern Coalfields managed a premium of 31.3% by offering half a lakh tonne of coal that would fetch the company around Rs 16 crore annually. It managed an average price of Rs 4,145 per tonne at the auction."

45,2018-07-26,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government is likely to recommend that bankruptcy proceedings for stressed power plants should kick in after 360 days of default, giving relief to banks and companies that are struggling to meet the 180-day deadline set by the Reserve Bank of India in its controversial February 12 circular.

The recommendation is expected to be presented to the Allahabad High Court which is hearing petitions against the circular and had asked the government to present its views after consulting all stakeholders.

Separate recommendations are likely to be made for power projects depending on their operational status and resolution plans drawn by the lenders.

Stressed operational projects and those under execution may be recommended for an extra 180 days over and above the 180-day deadline expiring August 27. Special dispensation has been sought for projects resolved through Coal India supplies (Shakti scheme) and those already in NCLT. A high-level committee to address cross-sectoral issues including delayed payment of private power companies is also being mulled.

A final report after consulting all stakeholders is likely to be prepared by the end of this month. The central government needs to submit its recommendations to Allahabad High Court on August 2.

The Allahabad High Court in its last hearing on July 18 had asked the finance ministry to submit the government's stand on the controversial RBI circular in two weeks.

The power ministry and private power firms have demanded that stressed power projects should not be categorised as stressed in 90 days of default, while the deadline of 180 days to resolve a bad loan, after which liquidation process is immediately triggered, be extended to 270 days.

As per revised RBI framework for stressed assets, projects with interest or principal overdue — starting from 1day to 30 days — have been categorised as ‘special mention accounts category -0’ (SMO-0).




The most stringent change is that all lenders have to agree upon a resolution that has to be reached in 180 days.

In the last hearing, Additional Solicitor General of India SP Singh, who appeared for the central government, had informed the court that a report has been sent by the finance ministry to the power ministry and the final stand of the government is under deliberation. He had asked for 15days from the court to submit the report.

The high court had on May 31temporarily stayed the RBI circular on companies other than wilful defaulters and asked the finance secretary to hold a meeting on resolutions. The court had also clubbed three separate petitions filed by the Association of Power Producers (APP), Independent Power Producers Association of India (IPPAI) and Jaypee Associates against the RBI circular.

Association of Power Producers (APP) sought modification in the RBI circular issued in February, saying it incentivises banks to consider change in ownership of a company instead of considering restructuring of loan, and will trigger liquidation of 30,000 megawatts of assets, causing huge value erosion.

Power producers say that many projects are stressed for reasons not in their control. These include delays in land acquisition, green clearances, failure of Coal India to supply fuel and reluctance of state distribution companies to sign power purchase agreements. The association demanded reinstatement of the provisions relating to upgrade of stressed assets after loan restructuring."

47,2018-07-26,Coal India,"Private power producers have alleged that Coal India is selling increased quantities of coal through e-auctions and have sought to stop e-auction sales till the company’s supply obligations to the power sector to generate low cost power are met.

Ashok Khurana, director general of Association of Power Producers alleged that generators with supply contracts are receiving less than 75% of their stipulated requirements leading to severe shortage of the dry fuel at power plants. Instead, the country’s coal supplier is offering additional quantities through e-auctions that fetch a premium over the notified price.

The Association recently apprised the coal and power ministry of the issue and urged them to take it up on a priority basis.

A senior Coal India executive said the coal producer has ample production capabilities and there is no supply shortfall at pit head plants but non-pit head plants suffer from stock shortage due to logistics and law & order issues although we are ready to supply their full contracted quantity.

Rest of the coal that cannot be sent to power plants is auctioned and it is mostly carried through roadways on trucks, the Coal India executive added.

In fact, Coal India offered the auction route for stressed power assets to help the latter survive the onslaught of financial institutions.

Under the current scenario, the situation could be managed by restricting movement of coal by rail to power stations holding more than 21-days stock and operating at poor capacity utilisation levels. This coal can be diverted to plants facing critical stocks, particularly in the Northern and western Regions of the country. 

“Indian Railways is adding new tracks and doubling existing ones while a large section of the tracks are also being electrified. It is expected to help evacuate additional coal,” the official said.

Nevertheless, data compiled by the Association indicates that in 2017-18 Coal India was to supply 528 million tonnes of coal as part of its fuel supply agreement with power companies. There was a shortfall of 104 million tonnes. In contrast, the company supplied 31 million tonnes to the sector through e-auction at an average premium of 27% earning revenue of Rs 4,371 crore.

Khurana said it is evident that Coal India has ample stocks to allocate under supply agreements but it chooses to allocate it under auction schemes. With inadequate coal supply, developers have no option but to fall back on e-auction or imported coal to meet their power supply obligations.

In a recently held auction, the premium was as high as 81%, reflecting the demand supply mismatch. Forcing generators to depend on imported or auctioned coal is leading to increased generation costs that are hovering between Rs 3.5 per unit and Rs 4.08 per unit."
48,2018-07-27,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-owned Coal India is exploring the possibility of restricting fuel supplies to power plants saddled with large stocks but operating at low capacity utilisation. The plan is to divert supplies from these plants to the ones running at higher capacity but faced with low stocks, a Coal India executive said.

“If practised, it will ensure equitable distribution of coal in the country, reduce congestion on railway tracks, and the issue of coal scarcity can be solved in a month. However, the power ministry has to take a call on the issue along with state and central generating companies,” the executive said.

At present, 117-odd power plants in the country have a supply agreement with Coal India. These plants have a cumulative stock of 15.36 million tonnes which is good enough for generating power for 10 days, and ideally no plant should be facing critical stock positions. Yet, 18 plants are running with critically low fuel stocks, and some with stocks that aren’t even enough for generating power for a full day.

In contrast, 16 power stations have stocks beyond their normal levels, varying between 16 and 58 days of usage levels. An analysis reveals that these plants, holding high levels of stocks, operated at low capacity utilization, anywhere between 32% and 75% in June this year.

Coal India executives’ are blaming the coal scarcity situation on skewed coal distribution, resulting in many power stations to face critical coal stocks while others have more than they require.

These 16 power stations are saddled with five million tonnes of extra coal than their seven days consumption requirement, whereas just less than a million tonne of coal stock is required to be built up at the 18 critical power stations to bring them out of criticality.

A power company is free to divert coal from one of its plants to another provided the total receipt of coal remains the same. Generating companies such as NTPC and state generators can avail of the facility.

“Along with diversion of coal, pit head plants operating at low utilisation levels can also be asked by the power ministry to jack up generation since transporting power is easier than transporting coal,” the executive said.

Citing an example, he said, NTPC’s thermal stations at Korba and Sipat are running at 95% capacity while power stations at Vindhyachal, Rihand and Singrauli are running at less than 90% utilisation yet they have adequate stocks. Tweaking generation plan in favour of the ones that have large stocks can also help solve the issue.

“We can supply additional coal through dedicated tracks or conveyors to pit head plants if they generate additional power while the ones far off can be asked to scale down generation. It will free up railways’ capacity too,” the Coal India executive said.

In fact, all power stations holding more than normal stocks are either central or state government entities, and the thrust to increase generation from these plants is likely to reduce pressure on plants that are facing critical stocks.

An NTPC executive, however, said we need to take into account power transmission capability of the gird at each of these stations. There are pockets of grid congestion which may act against the plan."

51,2018-07-28,Coal India,"Senior management of public-sector banks (PSBs) may now have to perform to earn more. In a first-of-its-kind move for PSBs, State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are planning to introduce performance-linked salary structure for the senior management, according to a Business Standard report.

""The bank is seriously thinking of introducing a system of performance-based incentives for officers above the general manager grade. There will be a component of fixed and variable pay. But it will evolve slowly,” PNB Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sunil Mehta told the paper. SBI and BoB may also follow a similar model and are working on a compensation framework, says the report. 

Performance-linked pay is widely used in the private sector to reward the better performers in the system. The absence of any incentives in the government along with time-bound promotions, irrespective of performance, are seen as major dampeners in the current system.

In 2015, the government approved payment of performance-related pay to executives and non-unionised supervisors of Coal India Ltd (CIL) and its subsidiaries. 

The Seventh Pay Commission (SPC) recommended performance-linked pay for all central government employees, but suggested that each department be given the flexibility to work out its own matrix. The panel suggested that the incentive could be in the form of a ""non-additive cash component"" of their current pay, paid at the end of the fiscal year and should not be linked to savings. Performance-linked pay has been proposed by previous pay panels as
well as the administrative reforms commission.

The PSBs would need approval from the government for introducing performance-linked salary structure. The pay and allowances of different levels of employees at PSBs are usually decided through settlements between the Indian Banks’ Association, the bank’s management and trade union body United Forum of Bank Unions."
52,2018-07-29,Coal India,"Coal Minister Piyush Goyal has said that the recent decision of the Union Power Ministry to allow states to import coal is temporary in nature. 

""We are constantly trying to ramp up production. Allowing states to import coal is temporary in nature,"" Goyal told when asked about the Union Power Ministry asking states to import coal in the wake of coal shortage. 

Union Power Minister R K Singh has recently red flagged coal shortage for power plants for the next 2-3 years and allowed states to import the fuel. 

Goyal said there had been constant growth in coal production and dispatches by the Coal India and explained that at times imports might be needed as a stop-gap arrangement for states to meet sudden rise in demand. 

Goyal said coal production had registered a 15.2 per cent growth during the first quarter ended June 2018 to 136.87 million tonnes and supply to power plants also jumped by 15.4 per cent to 122.84 million tonnes during the quarter. 

This resulted in lower coal imports by the power industry by nearly 15 per cent during April-May this year. 

The Coal India is trying to rationalise coal supplies to power companies based on demand and stock lying with them in order to optimise power generation in the country, a company official said. 

The company is also planning to limit supplies with low PLF and high stock with utilities generating more with low stock, he said."

53,2018-07-31,Coal India,"The stellar performance of large-sized companies in the June 2018 quarter indicates that the big boys are better placed than mid-sized ones in recording consistent growth in their revenues. This warrants enhancing investment exposure to large-sized companies due to their better balance sheet, superior return ratios and dominant market share in their respective sectors.

Among mutual fund schemes that have singular focus on large-sized companies, ICICI Pru Bluechip has distinguished itself by consistently beating its benchmark and peers by a reasonably good margin. Another factor that works in favour of the scheme is the presence of ace fund manager S Naren, who has a strong record of being at the helm of well-performing schemes. He is known to be one of the few fund managers who have been conscious of investing in companies which may be out of favour, but hold promise of visibility of earnings in the long term.

In the past three- and five-year periods, the scheme has delivered 13 per cent and 18 per cent returns, while its benchmark, Nifty50 TRI, has given 12 per cent and 16 per cent returns in the same period, respectively. This scheme has beaten both the category and benchmark in eight of the nine years since launch.

In the past six months, the scheme’s fund managers — S Naren and Rajat Chandak — have bought in companies which fall under the value theme. A few prominent companies the scheme has bought in are Bank of Baroda, NHPC, Coal India and Mahindra & Mahindra.

Expert Take: Harshvardhan Roongta, CFP, Roongta Securities
Large companies should form the core of an investor’s equity portfolio. This scheme is one of the most consistent performers in its category. It follows a benchmark hugging investment strategy. However, to generate alpha, the sector weightage varies. It is either 5 per cent more or 5 per cent less than its benchmark index. Investors looking to invest in an ‘all-weather’ and ‘trueto-its-label’ large cap portfolio can consider investing in this scheme."

He said this year contracts worth Rs 4000-5000 crore could be placed with the vendors. 

Jha said that he desired that PSUs to bid for contracts and expected that they would match international parameters. 

The Coal India has set a target of producing 630 million tonnes in 2018-19 and one billion tonne in the next three to four years. 

The CILs productivity per man each shift has been much below than international benchmark of 13 tonnes per man shift, he said adding that the Coal Ministry had asked the miner to follow the international parameters in cost of production, quality, grade, equipment performance, unit cost of production and environmental concerns. 

""We have asked CMPDIL to do the assessment. Benchmarking in coal mining is not the same like manufacturing of other goods,"" Jha said. 

He said to meet the yardstick of the best global standard was difficult due to socio-economic factors in India. 

""But, if we know our position then we can definitely improve from we are now,"" Jha said.

The notification allows Coal India to undertake such projects either in a joint venture or in collaboration with an experienced operator.

The executive cited earlier, who did not wish to be named, the first project is likely to be undertaken by Coal India subsidiary Bharat Coking Coal at Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand. This block is estimated to hold 25 billion cubic metres of methane and is expected to start production two years after the project is initiated.

The second project would be undertaken at Ranigunj in West Bengal by Eastern Coalfields. This block holds about 3 billion cubic metre of CBM that can be extracted and sold.

Coal India, was one of the earliest movers in the sector. In 2004, the company received funding from UNDP Global Environment Fund and the Centre to set up a pilot project in Jharkhand’s Moonidih coal blocks.

“Three wells were dug and methane was successfully extracted to generate power. It was a successful project,” the executive said.

Methane released by coal deposits remains trapped in seams, which escapes into the atmosphere when coal is mined. Methane trapped in mines can kill miners if present in high concentration. However, when extracted in concentrated form, methane can be transported in pipelines. It finds usage in the making of fertilisers, power generation and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) production."

All of CIL’s subsidiaries reported growth in production and coal supplies, the company said.

“We are doing the best we could to meet the demand of the power sector by supplying increased quantities of coal. So far, we have been able to sustain the double-digit growth trend in the three important parameters of production, offtake and supplies to power sector, since the beginning of the fiscal,” the statement said. “The monsoon months are challenging but we are garnering our best efforts to continue the same trend.”

Coal supplies by CIL to thermal power stations acrosss the country amounted to 161.71 million tonnes, an increase of 
21.21 mt from 140.50 mt in the year-ago period.

CIL’s coal production during April-July 2018, at 177.43 mt, saw a volume growth of 21.90 mt, as against 155.53 mt a year ago. Overall coal offtake during the first four months of 2018-19 was 201.68 mt, up nearly 20 mt in a year. 

The miner produced 40.56 mt coal in July 2018, an increase of 3.87 mt compared to 36.69 mt a year ago. Offtake, at 48.25 mt, was up 3.96 mt from 44.29 mt in the previous month.

There was 12.5% growth in average rake loading per day to power sector during April-July 2018. CIL as a whole loaded 210.6 rakes on average against 187.2 rakes in the year-ago period.

The company liquidated 24.25 mt of its pit head coal stock during April-July. The stock pile stood at 31.30 mt at the end of July 2018, while at the beginning of 2018-19 it was 55.55 mt."

8,2018-08-03,Coal India,"By: Rajesh Kumar Singh and Dhwani Pandya

India’s harbors have become clogged up with coal as imports to power an expanding economy outpace railroad capacity to transfer the fuel to consumers.

Stockpiles rose by 15 percent in seven weeks to 19.2 million metric tons, according to data from 18 ports compiled by CoalMint in a July 30 report. Inventory at Vishakhapatnam Port Trust in the eastern state of Andhra Pradesh is near the limit because a rail-car shortage is slowing distribution, Deputy Chairman P.L. Haranadh said in a phone interview.

That’s “pretty much all we can hold,” Haranadh said. His port gets about 10 of the wagon clusters known as rakes each day to send coal to consumers, against a requirement of 16. A rake comprises about 60 open-top wagons with total capacity of some 4,000 tons.

The port blockages reflect the inability of India’s infrastructure to cope with an expanding economy and consumption. Freight and passenger trains jostle for space on the same tracks, and goods carriers often have to make way for passenger traffic, prolonging the turnaround time for carriages to haul coal, the mainstay of power generation in the country.

Bottlenecks in coal supply are hurting utilities, aluminum smelters and steel mills. Some 8.7 gigawatts of generation capacity was shut as of the end of June due to coal shortages, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Central Electricity Authority data. India has 197 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity.

At Paradip Port Trust in Odisha state nearly 4 million tons of cargo -- including 3 million tons of coal -- has piled up, almost double the storage capacity, said a port official, who asked not be identified discussing a sensitive topic. The logjam has forced Paradip to divert cargoes to other ports, even though most have similar bottlenecks, the official said. The port, which needs an additional five rakes a day, is encouraging coal customers to transport coal by road. That’s more cumbersome, costly and damaging to the environment.


Bloomberg
A blockage at Gangavaram port, close to Vishakhapatnam port, has delayed transportation of 120,000 tons of coal to electricity producer Jindal Power Ltd. Nearly half is still lying at the port three months after the cargo landed, Chief Executive Officer Bharat Rohra said.

Mundra port in Gujarat state on the west coast is also struggling with a shortage of carriages, according to two officials, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. The shortage of as many as six rakes a day started in May, and primarily slowed fertilizer shipments, one of the officials said.

Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast requires another five to six rakes a day for all commodities including coal, iron ore and fertilizer, in addition to the 14 to 15 that are being loaded currently, Chief Executive Officer Anil Yendluri said by phone.

“We are also facing a challenge in getting the number of rakes, like all others,” Yendluri said. “But we are continuously working with the railways and seeing that turnaround time improves.”

Power stations designed to burn domestic coal were forced to increase imports for blending by 15 percent during the quarter ended June 30, as local output failed to keep pace with surging demand. Monopoly miner Coal India Ltd., responsible for more than 80 percent of the nation’s coal output, has missed production and shipment targets every year since at least 2013.

Last month, India’s power minister R.K. Singh warned of continuing coal shortages because of increasing demand for electricity and advised states to import the fuel if necessary.

To address the problem, state-run Indian Railways is ordering more wagons and is building new tracks with Coal India.

“We are doing everything we can to ensure availability of rakes and we have seen a significant increase in rake supplies for coal,” said Girish Pillai, who heads traffic management at Indian Railways. “But it may so happen that sometimes we fall short of demand.”"

15,2018-08-06,Coal India,"After making a buoyant start to the trade on Monday, the NSE benchmark Nifty pared gains and traded rest of the session in a rangebound manner. 

The index ended with a modest gain of 26.30 points or 0.23 per cent. The paring of gains from higher levels was a sign of a very short-term fatigue.

Investors can expect a quiet start to the trade on Tuesday. We might continue to see modest upmoves, but despite the buoyant setup, the Nifty is overbought and needs to consolidate as It continues to remain vulnerable to profit taking at higher levels.

Tuesday will see the levels of 11,430 and 11,455 posing as fresh resistance to the Nifty. Supports may come in at 11,320 and 11,270 levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 71.1663. The RSI continues to show bearish divergence on the charts. While Nifty continued to trade at 14-period high, the RSI has not done so.

The daily MACD stays bullish while trading above its signal line, but it has started to flatten its trajectory. Though a rising window has occurred on the candles, it may not translate into much strength in the present context and structure of the charts.


ETMarkets.com
Pattern analysis shows that the Nifty has now successfully achieved a breakout from the 11,170-11,175 levels, which represented a previous high and a double top formation.

Presently, Nifty is seen likely to exhaust its upmove and consolidate at higher levels.
Overall, the Nifty is evidently overstretched on the charts and for it to see further sustainable upmoves, some amount of consolidation looks overdue.

The index has started to show some signs of tiredness and fatigue. At the present juncture, we recommend avoiding any kind of major purchases at current levels.

We are likely to see some sector rotation during the expected rangebound consolidation, which will lend more strength to the market in coming days.

While very vigilantly protecting profits at higher levels, a cautious view is advised for the day.

18,2018-08-07,Coal India,"Coal India will supply 4.65 million tonnes of coal a year for the cement industry for five years through e-auctions starting Tuesday, a senior Coal India executive said.

It had recently offered 7 million tonnes to sponge iron firms, and received bids that were 39% higher than the notified price for the non-power sector.

The company hopes to garner similar premiums from cement producers as the sector faces a shortfall as coal was diverted to fuel-starved power plants.

According to the Coal India executive, of the 4.65 million tonnes on offer annually, 1.14 million tonnes can be procured each year through the railways, while the rest 3.51 mt would be supplied through roadways.

Coal India subsidiary South Eastern Coalfields will offer the highest quantity for the auction at 3.25 million tonnes per annum, of which 1 million tonnes would be through the railways and the rest 2.25 million tonnes through roadways every year for the contract period. This subsidiary is offering almost 70% of the total coal on offer in the auction by subsidiaries participating in the auction.

Western Coalfields’ plan includes offering 7.96 lakh tonnes annually, all of which would be through roadways followed by Central Coalfields and Northern Coalfields each offering 2 lakh tonnes annually through roadways only. Western Coalfields would be offering 17% of the total coal.

Mahanadi Coalfields, however, has firmed up plans to offer 90,000 tonnes annually through the railways and an additional 49,500 tonnes through roadways each year, totalling 1.39 lakh tonnes every year.

Eastern Coalfields’ plan involves offering 50,000 tonnes annually through the railways and an additional 20,000 tonnes through roadways every year, totalling 70,000 tonnes. Bharat Coking Coal and North Eastern Coalfields will not be participating in this auction since they are not offering any coal to the segment.

Auctions would be held for 11days in a row through 32 separate auctions and on offer are 11 grades of coal from G3 to G13."

28,2018-08-07,Coal India,"The number of power plants facing coal shortages has reduced in the last four months as state-owned CIL and the railways worked jointly to augment the supplies, Parliament was informed today.

It has come down to six plants with critical stocks and five with supercritical stock as on August 1, from 13 and 17 plants respectively four months ago.

""As per Daily Coal Report (DCR) published by Central Electricity Authority as on April 1, 2018, there were 13 power plants with critical coal stock and 17 power plants with super-critical coal stock, which has reduced to 6 and 7 respectively on July 2, 2018. This has further reduced to 11 (6 power plants with critical coal stock and 5 power plants with super-critical) as on August 1, 2018,"" Power Minister R K Singh said in a written reply to Rajya Sabha.

The minister replied in affirmative to a question, whether it is a fact that the Central Electricity Authority's report reflects the number of power stations facing critical coal stock coming down from 30 on April 1 to 13 on July 2 as Coal India Ltd (CIL) and the Railways jointly worked to ramp up additional supplies;

According to reply to the House, during April-July, the coal dispatch to power sector by CIL was 161.72 MT as against 140.56 MT during same period last year registering a growth of 15.1 per cent.

In a separate reply to the House, Singh said: ""During the 1st quarter of the current (financial) year 2018-19, the growth in thermal generation was 5.69 per cent and the growth in thermal generation from NTPC power plants was 7.76 per cent.""

To yet another reply, he said, ""Generation from all sources (Hydro, Nuclear, Thermal and Renewable Energy) is utilised to meet the demand of electricity. The gap between demand and supply, if any, is met by increasing the thermal power generation.""

He further said that in April and May, hydro generation was 87.29 per cent and 90.35 per cent of the target respectively. The gap was met by increasing generation from thermal power plants which generated 103 to 104 per cent of the target."

29,2018-08-08,Coal India,"Stressed power assets will fetch better value if fuel, discom and regulatory issues are resolved and the extension of deadline mentioned in the Reserve Bank of India circular is available, power secretary Ajay Bhalla told ET’s Sarita C Singh in an interview. He said banks are expected to take decisions on about 10 stressed power projects in 15 days while the recently set up high-powered committee would resolve sectoral issues. The government will soon electrify over 1.5 lakh houses daily to meet its electrification target by December 2018, he said, and has sought Rs 10,000 crore excess funds allocation for Saubhagya scheme, which was launched to provide electricity to all households. Edited excerpts:


The government has electrified 1crore of the 4 crore unelectrified households. How confident are you on meeting the December-end deadline?
When we launched Saubhagya last year, our assessment for unelectrified houses was 4 crore. But when the detailed project reports were prepared, the number came down to 3.5 crore. We have just energised 1 crore houses on Sunday (August 5). All states have started work in full swing. There were issues of monsoon in some places and floods in Odisha and Assam which stalled work for some time, but in the remaining months up to December, we expect this target to be definitely achieved. A few days back we achieved electrification of 1.12 lakh houses in a day. For what we are targeting we need to go up to 1.5 lakh houses per day and maybe at some point of time 2 lakh households per day.


Does lack of distribution infrastructure in some states pose a threat to the programme?
One difficulty which we anticipate in implementation of the scheme is that in some states, there is poor infrastructure in the villages. In states such as Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Jharkhand, a lot of work needs to be done on infrastructure side. We have sanctioned money for infrastructure but states have demanded more. We have taken steps to provide more funds and assured states that the money will be provided. Since this kind of infrastructure building takes a little time, states such as Uttar Pradesh, where almost 50% houses are unelectrified, have awarded contracts for districts to big companies on turnkey basis.


Have you sought more funds for Saubhagya?
The total allocation for Saubhagya was Rs 16,000 crore, which includes Rs 12,000 crore budgetary support, and a good part has been released. Of course, we need Rs 8,000-10000 crore more for infrastructure. Infrastructure was supposed to be built under DDUGJY (Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, aimed at electrifying rural India). But there are some gaps in what DDUGJY would achieve and we need additional funds. We have requested finance ministry for sanction of additional funds.


How many of the stressed power plants are likely to be salvaged given that August 27 deadline, as per RBI circular, is nearing?
About eight projects, with capacity of 8,000 MW, have been resolved through Shakti scheme and other measures. Fourteen projects are already in NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) or are under process for admission to NCLT. In remaining 12 coal-based assets, there are some with PPAs (power purchase agreements) and some without PPAs. I understand from the lenders that they have bid out some of these commissioned projects and they are looking at how these can be restructured. Lenders may be able to decide in the next 15 days about what can be done to these assets. Some of these assets, if they are not going to be resolved, are supposed to move to NCLT. Recently, for a case in Allahabad High court, we filed a report prepared by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) seeking six months’ time, so that some of the issues concerning power sector can be addressed. There are certain sectoral issues connected with these projects. If we can address those, then these assets either can be resolved easily or will fetch more value. RBI has informed that they do not agree with extending any timelines and that the matter should be resolved in time or as per the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code).


What is the future of the stranded gas-based power projects?
There are about 10 gas-based projects of about 6,000 MW in ‘stressed’ category. The main issue that needs to be addressed is fuel supply. For other assets, the PLF (plant load factor) is very low due to less availability of domestic gas, and if we import LNG the cost of power becomes very high. At this moment we are not able to find a solution. Of course, a high-powered committee which has been constituted would also look at this aspect.


By when will the committee submit its report?
We will hold a meeting of the committee first and make presentations on various aspects brought out in the DFS report. Largely 4-5 issues are there connected to fuel, payment by discoms and regulatory issues. Once we are able to address those, some of these assets will become much more viable.


Coal shortage seems to be a major concern…
Coal supplies have increased over last year. We are concerned that the stocks have not built up, especially in power plants located away from the pithead. We are meeting ministries of railways and coal regularly, and trying to resolve some constraints. Coal India has about 35 mt coal stock and we are identifying the sidings from where more rakes can be loaded. Coal imports by the imported coal-based plants have come down for certain contractual reasons. They have not been able to supply power. But for blending with domestic coal, certain plants are importing small quantities. Till the end of June about 5 mt of coal was imported for blending.


Are states keen to sign contracts with winners of the Centre’s pilot PPA auction?
Against 2,500 MW PPAs offered, we got bids worth 1,900 mw. Discussions are on with the states to finalise the contractual arrangements. Linkage of coal would ensure only 55% of PLF and states’ requirement may increase during a certain time frame. An exercise is being done to ensure settlement at the earliest and developers are in discussion with PTC India. We expect this to be resolved."
30,2018-08-08,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has refused the Reserve Bank of India’s plea to stay proceedings in the Allahabad High Court against the central bank’s February 12 circular that prescribed tough norms for stressed assets.

It will hear on August 28 the banking regulator’s plea seeking transfer of all petitions filed in several high courts to the Supreme Court. Significantly, August 27 is the deadline for completing resolution process for stressed assets as per the RBI circular.

Additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta appeared for the government and opposed the transfer of case from Allahabad to the Supreme Court while RBI was represented by Jayant Bhushan.

Justices RF Nariman and Indu Malhotra refused to grant stay on proceedings in the Allahabad High Court despite appeal from Bhushan, sources said.

While there are over a dozen cases filed by companies and associations in various high courts, the one in the Allahabad High Court has made substantial progress. The plea filed by Association of Power Producers, Independent Power Producers’ Association of India and Jaypee Associates has not still been admitted by the Allahabad High Court, but the case is at a crucial stage as the government has recommended extension of the deadline by another 180 days.

The high court is scheduled to hear the matter on Thursday. On August 2, the government submitted its report in the high court, which included the recommendations for deadline and informed the court about setting up of a high-level empowered committee led by cabinet secretary P K Sinha to revive the projects. The high court asked RBI to file its responses in the next hearing.

The Allahabad HC had on May 31 temporarily stayed the RBI circular on companies other than wilful defaulters and asked the finance secretary to hold a meeting on resolutions. Power companies have sought modification in the RBI circular, saying it will trigger insolvency proceedings against 30,000 MW of assets, causing huge value erosion. The companies say many projects are stressed for reasons not in their control. These include delays in land acquisition, green clearances, failure of Coal India to supply fuel and reluctance of state discoms to sign power purchase agreements."

The world's largest miner said the coal ministry was now in the process of finalising the Vision 2030 document for coal sector in which projection for likely demand of coal in the country was being assessed under different scenarios considering the views of power ministry and scenario emerged due to Paris protocol among others, the report said.

The document is likely to be finalised shortly, it said.

""In view of above, road map for coal production beyond 2018-19 along with other related issues would be relooked on the basis of that demand forecast,"" it said.

In the light of Paris Protocol and consequent upon changes in world energy sector scenario, CIL is looking forward to diversify its operations towards renewable energy like solar power and clean energy sources like CMM and CBM, the report added.

""Following to that mission, Ministry of Coal (MoC)/CIL is in the process of finalising 'Vision Document 2030' to decide on future course of operation for sustainable entity in the nation's energy sector,"" it said.

46,2018-08-12,Coal India,"Coal India Ltd, the world's biggest miner, has pushed back its ambitious 1 billion tonne production target by at least two years owing to the existing ground realities, a top official of the company has said.

""One billion tonne annual coal production target will be achieved but it is not possible by 2020 as thought initially, due to various ground realities. We are now hoping to achieve it in the next 3-4 years from now,"" the official told PTI.

The government had earlier set a target of 1 billion tonnes coal output by FY'2019-20.

Although Coal India has been investing towards establishing railway connectivity with its mines and procuring rakes in order to evacuate more coal, a sharp rise in renewable energy sources is compelling the miner of the dry fuel to review its earlier production goals, the company has said in its latest annual report.

Coal India subsidiary Northern Coalfields and the railways are jointly investing around Rs 6,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh to lay new tracks and converting the existing ones into double gauge enabling it an additional 15 million tonnes of the fuel capacity.

In its annual report, Coal India has also said that there was an urgent need to revisit its one billion tonne output programme following changes in the environmental paradigm and coal demand.

The company had produced 567 million tonnes )MT) coal in FY'18 and targets to produce 630 MT in the current fiscal.

However, these developments has not discouraged the miner in investing in mine expansion and procuring mining equipments.

Coal India has said it will spend Rs 12,000-13,000 crore over the next three years for procuring mining equipment.

In the current fiscal, out of Rs 9,500 crore total capex, orders worth Rs 5,000 crore would be placed for equipment."
53,2018-08-13,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: An end-to-end tracking of more than 13 lakh metric tons of explosives produced annually in the country would soon be possible, with the centre developing a software to digitise the industry and prevent pilferage of gelatine sticks and detonators to Naxalites and for illegal mining activities.

System for Explosive Tracking and Training Project (SETT) is being designed at a cost of Rs 62.45 crores for effective monitoring of every explosives right from the manufacturer to user on real time basis, through the supply chain. Petroleum and Explosives Safety Orgnisation (PESO), which comes under Ministry of Commerce and Industry Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, is developing the SETT with the assistance from the NIC which has roped in Microsoft to complete it, chief controller of explosives SK Shukla told ET.

Explaining how the software module would work, Shukla stated that each explosives – which comprise of gelatine sticks, detonators and wires -- would get a unique “2-D barcode”. The explosive box, inner pack and entity will be identified by the barcode which will be generated by explosive manufacturers using the IT system. It would be printed on each of them at the time of making and packaging before uploading the details on the SETT software module, he stated.

Shukla stated that the NIC is also developing mobile application for scanning of barcodes for accepting, dispatching and use of explosives by licence holders while generating the connected online returns.

The SETT will be implemented in three phases and the progress is being regularly monitored by DIPP additional secretary Shailendra Singh, Shukla stressed. The Ministry of Home Affairs reviewed the progress of the implementation of the SETT in a meeting joint secretary in-charge of Left Wing Extremism took on August 6.

The phase one for barcoding of boxes would be rolled out by December. And the next two phases -- for tagging numbers to detonators and fuse wires -- is expected to be over by 2019 end. Fifty detonators make a bunch and 20 to 25 such bunch constitute a packet. Similarly a detonator fuse wire is normally 15 metre long. The PESO is working towards barcoding each metre to prevent illegal sale of the wire by chopping its length into pieces.

Each barcode will have country code, state code, company's licence number, machinery number and series code, which would help the investigators to trace back where it was produced or sold in case of any irregularity is detected.

All the manufactures are integrating data on physical parameters of explosive, packaging patterns, factory location and every manufacturing building on the NIC-developed Standardisation Software Module.

A senior home ministry officer believes once the initiatives takes off, it would to a certain extent help check pilferage of the legally produced explosives which anti-national elements are exploiting to attack security forces.

 A report prepared by anti-naxal forces showed growing trend of use of IEDs, which indicated Red ultras have easy access to smuggled industrial explosives. Last year alone, 1,702 IEDs weighing over 5000 kgs were seized from different Left wing extremist areas, pointing out to the fact that Naxalites are relying more on it for mass destruction as opposed to engaging in gun battle with security forces. The recovery of detonators in 2017 was also at an all-time high with 20,871 of them being recovered from different Naxal dominated states. During 2014 only 523 EIDS were seized.

An expert on naxals stated on the condition of anonymity that pilferage of explosive is huge and so is scale of problem. It would be difficult to monitor if barcode is defaced. The whole challenge is to identify last mile pilferage because Naxalites are mostly getting at that level.

Of more than 13.3 lakh metric ton of class-2 ( catridge and site mixed-bulk) high explosives and 985 million number of detonators produced annually by 76 manufacturers, 45 percent is consumed by Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) Coal India Ltd and its subsidiaries. Another 25 percent of explosives are utilised by mining industry in organised sector and remaining 30 percent is consumed for infrastructure activities including for building dams, roads and oil exploration."

52,2018-08-13,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Blame it on the sharp drop in Indian rupee, triggered by a sell-off in emerging market currencies, headline indices Sensex and Nifty extended losses to a second consecutive session on Monday.

The rupee touched the record low of 69.92, as banks and importers bought the American currency in the pursuit of safe haven assets on worries over the crisis-hit Turkey.

Asian stocks crumbled in light of deepening crisis in Turkey. The country’s currency lira plummeted to a record low amid a worsening tussle with the US. 

Japan's Nikkei plunged 2 per cent as worried investors turned to buy in appreciating yen, hurting the broader market.

The global cues along with nosediving rupee dragged Sensex to 224 points, or 0.59 per cent, lower on Monday. The 30-share index settled at 37,645, with 11 stocks in the green and 20 in the red.

The NSE counterpart Nifty50 fell by 74 points, or 0.65 per cent, ending the day at 11,356, with 19 stocks advancing and 31 declining.

Broader midcap and smallcap indices fell more than the benchmarks, settling with losses of 0.70 per cent and 0.78 per cent, respectively.

Bank and financial stocks weighed most on Sensex. HDFC twins, State Bank of India, YES Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank ended in deep red.

However, IT stocks such as Infosys, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services managed to stay up, mainly due to weakness in the rupee.

Infosys hit 52-week high of Rs 1,411 after reports that the IT major is eyeing a slice of $5-billion opportunity in offering cybersecurity solutions to its 2,000-plus enterprise customers, that is expected to grow 10-12 per cent CAGR in the next five years. 

Shares of State Bank of India dropped over 3 per cent on Monday on a disappointing set of June quarter results. 

India’s largest state-owned lender on Friday reported a third straight quarterly loss for the June quarter at Rs 4,876 crore. The bank registered a profit of Rs 2,005 crore in the same period a year before. 

HDFC Bank dropped over 1 per cent today after Paresh Sukthankar's resignation as deputy managing director on Friday. 

Shares of Coal India rose nearly 1 per cent after it reported a 61 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 3,786.44 crore for June quarter. 

FMCG, healthcare and IT were among the sectors that managed to end the day with gains. 

Oil & gas, bank, telecom, finance and energy suffered the most among the sectoral indices.

The Modi government is learnt to have readied a busy divestment calendar for the remaining seven months of the financial year. The government is likely to cut its holdings in as many as six public sector undertakings through offers for sale (OFS) during the September- March period.

According to ministry sources, MMTC, BHEL, Hindustan Copper, CIL, NTPC and NMDC are on the shortlist for share sale this year.

The government may offload about 8 per cent stake each in Hindustan Copper and NMDC and 5 per cent each in BHEL and Coal India. In NTPC, where the government cut its holding in the previous years too, the stake sale this year would be around 3 per cent, while the biggest stake sale of about 15 per cent will take place in MMTC.

In the Union Budget for financial year 2018-19, the government had set a disinvestment target of Rs 80,000 crore, about 15-20 per cent higher than that of FY18, but suggested that the ultimate figure cross the Rs 1 lakh crore mark this financial year.

The Modi government has been very proactive with its disinvestment programme, having raised around Rs 2,12,000 crore through share sales in PSUs from 2014-15 to 2017-18. The total collection of these four years outstripped the total disinvestment proceeds of the previous 10 years.

In 2017-18, the ministry went for six IPOs, six offers-for sale, 13 buybacks and one new fund offer for the ETF and 13 strategic disinvestments."
54,2018-08-14,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Private power producers are complaining they pay more for coal than other sectors in some auctions, and have sought higher supplies to soften prices.

The Association of Power Producers says non-power consumers paid Rs 1,649 per tonne for G-11grade coal against the notified price of Rs 1,145 per tonne, while power producers paid Rs 80 more for the same grade although the notified price was Rs 955 per tonne.

“Thus retail power sector customers are paying more for the same grade of coal than the unregulated sector customers,” said Ashok Khurana, director general at the association.

Coal India will offer 42 million tonnes under special forward eauctions in 2018-19, same as last year but 34% lower than 2016-17. Lesser coal is offered mainly because of lower supply by South Eastern Coalfields and Mahanadi Coalfields, which contribute more than 50% of Coal India’s output.

Coal offered by South Eastern Coalfields fell from 26.62 million tonnes in 2016-17 to 8.6 million tonnes in 2017-18. For Mahanadi Coalfields, it fell from 9.76 million tonnes in 2016-17 to 2 million tonnes. The association wants Coal India to offer more coal so that tariffs are not increased."

57,2018-08-15,Coal India,"New Delhi: Finance ministry officials and top executives of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Coal India will hold an investor roadshow in the United States next week to prepare the ground for probable sale of minor stakes in the two firms by the government, people aware of the matter said.

Officials and executives plan to engage with institutional investors during the roadshow and explain to them the rising earnings prospects of the two companies with the changing global business climate, they said.

The current share prices of the two firms do not reflect the true value of their business and an engagement could help investors understand the companies better, executives said.

Shares in Coal India, valued at Rs 1.75 lakh crore, have lost nearly a fifth 
in three years, mainly due to stagnant demand for coal from power producers. ONGC, with a market cap of Rs 2.13 lakh crore, is down nearly a tenth due to an oil price collapse.

But the two stocks are on recovery path now. A rising oil price has pushed ONGC up 30% since February 2016, when oil prices had touched $28 per barrel. Coal India is up 20% in a year as coal demand has improved. The government now plans to use this opportunity to bring in new investors in these firms.

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) secretary Atanu Chakraborty said the roadshow is aimed at strengthening the confidence of investors in these companies but there is no plan as of now to sell government stake in the companies.

But the people cited earlier said that the roadshows are meant to understand investor sentiment and that if investors seem receptive the government could sell 5-10% in the two firms. The government owns 67.5% in ONGC and 78.32% in Coal India, and a sale of 5% each in the two firms could fetch about Rs 20,000 crore at current market valuation, or about a quarter of this year’s divestment target.

The government aims to garner Rs 80,000 crore in divestment proceeds in 2018-19, lower than the Rs one lakh crore it managed in the previous fiscal.

The government has also been toying with the idea of listing one central public sector unit overseas following a suggestion from the Prime Minister recently, according to people privy to the discussions.

The names of ONGC, Coal India and Indian Oil Corporation have been discussed but the government has yet to finalise which company, if any, will get listed overseas. An executive said that ONGC is unlikely to get listed since it does not need capital and will find it hard to meet strict compliance needs of overseas listings. The way the government deals with state firms and gets things done, it will be difficult to comply with overseas market regulations, he said."
59,2018-08-16,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The government has asked state-run power plants holding large fuel stocks to increase generation to allow others to run at a lower capacity and build inventories before the festive season.

At present, 117 power plants with supply agreements with Coal India have a cumulative stock of 15.2 million tonnes, enough to generate power for 10 days but 14 of them don’t have enough coal to run the plant for one day.

Coal India executives attribute the coal scarcity to problems in distribution that leads to a surplus or scarcity in different plants.

To solve the issue, the government has identified 24 centre- and staterun plants running at low capacity, yet holding stocks of 16 to 42 days. “Out of the 24 plants identified, 19 have been running at capacity utilisations lower than 75%. Generation from these plants can be easily scaled up,” a state government official told ET.

A Coal India executive said most plants with surplus stocks were pithead plants, which can easily be supplied more coal as they raise generation.

He said NTPC’s pit head plants at Rihand, Singrauli and Vindhyachal are running at 92%, 63% and 86% respectively, and hold 10 lakh, 7 lakh and 17 lakh tonnes of coal. Additional power from these plants can be sent to regions with higher demand, while those with scanty stocks can be scaled down.

Coal India will keep supplying coal to the non-pithead plants even if they scale down generation to help them build stocks to meet festive season demand.

A power company is free to divert coal from one of its plants to another provided the total receipt of coal remains the same and generating companies like NTPC, Damodar Valley Corporation and state-run generators are being roped in."

63,2018-08-17,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: A public interest litigation has been filed in Supreme Court, challenging state-run Damodar Valley Corporation's proposal to supply power to Bangladesh from power plants using concessional domestic coal.

The PIL, filed by advocate Piyush Joshi, questions DVC’s plan to use domestic coal for power at a time when the commodity is scarce for power plants in India. It also terms the move against “public interest”, arguing that Indians will suffer the consequences of emissions for generating power that they will not receive.

“..export of electricity generated from domestic coal is also against the established principles of environmental law and public interest since burning of domestic coal that has proven higher content of Sox and other polluting gases that are released into the environment in India,” the PIL said. “It cannot be permissible that the general public in India suffers the consequences of emissions of the use of domestic coal for generation of electricity and not receive the benefit of the electricity so produced.”

DVC is a statutory corporation regulated by the Damodar Valley Corporation Act of 1948. The PIL said that the Act prohibits DVC from selling electricity outside Jharkhand and West Bengal. Also, the terms of coal allotment by Coal India provide that it has to be used for allocated purposes within India, the PIL said. A DVC spokesperson told ET that the company has not yet received intimation from the court.

The power ministry’s technical arm, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), recently allowed DVC, through its power trader NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd, to enter into long- and short-term power supply contracts of 300 MW each with Bangladesh. DVC won the contract to supply 300 MW of power to Bangladesh with long-term supply starting from January 2020 to May 2033, and short-term supply starting from when the 500 MW HVDC transmission line through Baharampur in West Bengal and Bheramara in Bangladesh is completed.

The short-term power will be sold at Rs 3.84 per unit, while the long-term supply at Rs 5.84 per unit. The PIL said this price range is lower than the cost of power purchased by Delhi and Punjab in peak season. Ashok Khurana, director general of Association of Power Producers, said the CEA’s decision is against national interest and domestic power consumers. “It is an irony that we are importing coal to meet deficit of linkage coal for domestic power production and exporting power with domestic linkage coal,” he said."

62,2018-08-17,Coal India,"Centrum Broking has a buy call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 375.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 281.20.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target. 


Centrum Broking's view on Coal India:

Strong volume growth and robust realisations, e-auction share falls to make way for higher power sector supplies: FSA Volumes stood at 130.4 MT (up 22 per cent YoY and 9 per cent above estimates) with a high share of 85 per cent in total volumes. FSA Realizations stood at Rs1313/t, up 9 per cent YoY led by price hikes partially negated by inferior coal mix (higher supplies to power sector) and stood 2.8 per cent lower vs exp. Grade slippages remained minimal. E-auction volumes stood at 19.4 MT, down 29 per cent YoY and lower vs our exp. of 30MT on account of higher allocation to power sector due to strong seasonal demand. E-auction realizations moved up 51 per cent YoY and 13.6 per cent QoQ to Rs2400/t led by higher global prices.


EBITDA performance strong, miss only due to lower e-auction share: Adjusted EBITDA (ex-OB) at Rs66.2bn grew 94 per cent YoY and stood 4.5 per cent below our estimates due to lower e-auction volumes. Cost/t stood at Rs 1,207, up 6 per cent YoY driven primarily by employee expenses which had one time extra expense of Rs3bn. Most other major expenses were lower YoY on per tonne basis. Despite lower e-auction share, EBITDA/t stood at Rs431/t, up 73 per cent YoY. Employee cost guidance forthe full year remains at nearly 365bn with a quarterly run-rate of Rs90-91bn.


Earnings outlook remains bright: With CIL delivering strong volume growth in YTDFY19 led by an all-round focus on production and offtake, we revise our total volume estimates to 626MT/657MT for FY19E/20E. We lower e-auction volume estimates to 100MT/105MT in FY19E/20E even though management maintained its guidance of 110-115MT. We build FSA/E-auction realisations of Rs1325/2100 for FY19E. With concerns around cost addressed, we see CIL earnings tracking volumes & realisations and expect adj. EBITDA CAGR of 27 per cent over FY18-20E.


Valuations & Risks – Recommend Buy: CIL stock has remained an underperformer in last two years due to subdued earnings and low confidence of the market in its future outlook leading to de-rating. The stock is trading at FY19E adjusted P/E of 9.6x and EV/EBITDA of 5.5x and is poised for re-rating with strong triggers of better volume growth, improved pricing, increasing auction-linked volumes and attractive dividend yield to pave way for re-rating. Maintain buy with TP of Rs375. the key downside risk is unfavourable use of high cash & lower volumes."
64,2018-08-18,Coal India,"Having failed to attract private players in a big way to undertake skilling in India under PM Narendra Modi’s flagship Skill India Mission, government is rapidly roping in its own public sector enterprises to take on targeted skilling in the country.

The latest PSU to join the bandwagon is the NALCO, which will put in Rs 50 crore towards skill development and entrepreneurship till 2020. So far the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) has received financial commitments of Rs 163 crore for training more than one lakh beneficiaries including 40,000 aspirants with recognition of prior lending.

The other PSUs who have come forward to rescue the government include the Powergrid, Coal India Limited, NTPC, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), Hindustan Copper Limited, Mineral Exploration Corporation (MECL), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Airports Authority of India, Department of Public Enterprises, Indian Oil, Bharat Electronics Limited, NHPC, Nuclear Power (NPCIL) and Nalco Foundation among others. 

A senior government official told ET that government is committed towards skilling. ""We are trying to do our bit to provide skill training to as many as possible through our PSUs even if private players are taking time to come on board in big numbers,"" the official said. 

According to the official, active participation of PSUs in the skilling mission willl encourage industry to come on board and collectively work with the government to make it successful. 

NTPC has recently committed to train 30,000 youth in five years. Under NTPC Projects, so far trainings has already been completed for around 14,500 beneficiaries.

Among the private players SBI Card has taken the lead commiting a contribution of Rs 2.28 crores for training 1000 candidates in the Delhi-NCR region in key roles in healthcare, retail, telecom and BFSI sectors.

Other private players who have marginally contributed to this initiative as part of the corporate social responsibility include Alstom Bharat Forge Power, L&T, Posco, Powerlinks, Hitachi India Limited, Avery Dennison India, GE Grid Equipment, GE T&D India and GE India Business Services among others. 

The National Skill Development Mission was launched in 2015 with the objective to provide overall institutional framework to rapidly implement and scale up the skill development efforts across India.

The ministry of skill development & entrepreneurship, through the National Skill Development Corporation, has taken up multiple initiatives to connect with industries for partnership under the larger Skill India Mission.

NSDC has been working with diverse set of stakeholders such as corporates, foundations, government and community based organisations in structuring high impact collaborative skill development projects.

Under this NSDC allows its industry partners to contribute to the skilling mission in several ways including sponsoring physical assets, directly contribute to the NSDC, set up corporate excellence centres, set up trade specific or multi-skill centres, collaborate with sector skill councils and undertake creation of industry relevant curriculum.

Besides, NSDC, along with its sector skill councils and approved training partners, also facilitates placement opportunities to eligible aspirants, who have successfully completed the entire training module on job roles, pegged at NSQF levels."

Dollar Dips on Trade Optimism
The dollar sagged on Monday as investor demand for the safe-haven currency receded on optimism over a reduction in U.S.-China trade tensions, with the focus on discussions between the two countries due this week. Investors awaited developments on proposed Sino-U.S. trade talks, while keeping a wary eye on the Chinese yuan and Turkish lira for any new signs of strain. Market buzz is talks in Washington would take place on August 21 and 22, just before $16 billion new US tariffs on Chinese goods take effect. Dealers reported rumours the talks could set the stage for a summit between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in November.


Oil Down, Gold Flat
Oil prices dipped on Monday as concerns over slowing economic growth weighed on markets. International Brent crude oil futures were at $71.78 per barrel at 0019 GMT, down 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 4 cents, at $65.87 per barrel. In commodity markets, gold was flat at $1,184.19 an ounce having suffered its largest weekly loss since May 2017. It hit a 19-month low at $1,159.96 last week.

GDP Backed Data Experimental: Govt
The government said the gross domestic product (GDP) back series issued by a committee of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) amounted to “experimental results” meant to facilitate a decision on the approach to be followed and are not official estimates. The data that became public on Friday showed growth to be higher over 2003-04 to 2011-12 and lower before that from 1994-95. The report shows real GDP growth touching a high of 10.08% in 2006-07 in Manmohan Singh's tenure as PM.


Rajan Called to Brief Panel on NPAs

72,2018-08-20,Coal India,"The government has advised Coal India that the deadline for a minimum 25% public holding has been deferred by two years since the stock has underperformed, company executives said. 

The Centre was planning to divest 5%-10% in Coal India to comply with the norm for listed companies. The management had started conducting road shows for investors in the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong preparatory to the stake sale.

The government holds 78.32% in Coal India which is 3.32% short of the 25% mandatory public holding mark. “The norm required Coal India’s public holding to be at least 25% by August 21 this year. The Centre has deferred the deadline now by two year till August 2020. This is for the second time this deadline is being extended,” said a senior CIL executive.

The original deadline for complying with the norm was August 21, 2017. Stake sale was deferred as Coal India’s shares fell sharply.

IOC, NTPC, ONGC, Oil India will likely buy back some shares from the government.

What's more, the government may mop up over Rs 10,000 crore through sale of stake in Coal India. The stake stale will probably be via block deals, sources said. 

The government has already kicked off roadshows this week for sale of minority stake in Coal India. It's in talks with pension funds and foreign investors to pick up stake in the coal mining major, the sources added.

The government has set Rs 80,000 crore as its divestment target for 2018-19. 

Meanwhile, the government is likely to put out second EoI (expression of interest) for Air India only after elections in the next financial year. The thinking, according to the sources, is political uncertainty because of the approaching elections dampened buyers' interest in the debt-ridden airline.

An earlier report by ETNow suggested that the government was readying its divestment plan in September-March. It may offload 3 per cent stake in NTPC and 15 per cent in MMTC, ETNow had reported earlier.

The report had further said the government might sell off up to 5 per cent in BHEL and Coal India and 8 per cent in Hindustan Copper and NMDC."

76,2018-08-21,Coal India,"The Centre has asked Coal India to raise daily output and sales to 2 million tonnes from 1.4 million tonnes achieved in the last quarter to improve supply to power plants facing critically low stocks.


The coal ministry has told the company that it needs to produce and sell 1.9 million tonnes and 1.94 million tonnes respectively throughout the year. In the June quarter, it managed daily production and sales of 1.4 million tonnes and 1.61 million tonnes respectively.

This has necessitated ramping up production and sales during the second quarter to two million tonnes a day. If achieved this can help achieve production and sales targets of 652.25 million tonnes and 681.2 million tonnes respectively for the year.

According to figures published by Coal India, it managed to produce and sell 136.87 million tonnes and 153.43 million tonnes respectively during the first quarter of the current fiscal. The company achieved 91% and 90% of production and sales targets during the quarter. It achieved 15% and 12% growth in production and sales during the quarter in comparison to the previous corresponding period.

The centre has asked Coal India chairman, and heads of all subsidiaries to work out a definite action plan to ramp up supply. It has allowed the company to achieve desired sales by liquidating existing stocks at pit heads especially for plants faced with critical and super critical stock.

It has also asked Coal India to ensure that all clearances for increasing production are in place. Clearances for operationalizing recently allotted blocks should also be in place so that production targets are achieved, the letter to the Coal India chairman from the coal ministry mentioned.

The coal ministry has offered to intervene in case it faces issues relating to clearances or otherwise from any state government, or central ministries or any other agencies.

According to a senior Coal India executive, the company missed targets due to issues with land acquisition, physical possession of land, and demand for compensation beyond norms and resettlement & rehabilitation. Delay in grant of environment clearances for expansion and forest clearance played a major role in production loss. Law and order issues by local leaders and villagers in almost all subsidiaries especially Eastern Coalfields, Bharat Coking Coal, Central Coalfields and Mahanadi Coalfields affected production and sales.

“Sudden stoppage of Dhanbad-Chandrapura railway line affected production at Bharat Coking Coal while evacuation constraint at Magadh and Amrapali open cast mines due to non-completion of Tori-Shibpur railway track affected coal production at Central Coalfields,” the executive said."
77,2018-08-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The June quarter earnings season has come to an end.

The overall results of the 50 companies in the Nifty pack witnessed a gradual recovery largely on account of smaller base in the year ago quarter. 

However, some took a hit to their profitability owning to currency volatility and pressure on operational performance given higher commodity prices. Moreover, PSU banks disappointed on the back of higher provisioning along with slippages and mark-to-market losses.

Bajaj Finance stood best performer in the BFSI space in terms of both in net interest income and net profit. The biggest deterioration in profit terms among BFSI stocks was seen again in State Bank of India (on the back of lower trading income and higher mark-to-market losses). 

Among private banks, ICICI Bank reported its first quarterly loss (since its IPO) of Rs 120 crore.

In the non-BFSI segment, Grasim Industries (in net sales terms, second quarter in a row) and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (in profit terms) stood among the best performing companies.

Its life insurance and health arm reported a total gross premium of Rs 1,205 crore from Rs 937 crore."
79,2018-08-22,Coal India,"ICICI Direct has a hold call on JK Tyre & Industries with a target price of Rs 120.

The current market price of JK Tyre & Industries is Rs 128.85.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when JK Tyre & Industries price can reach the defined target.


The views of the brokerage on the company:

Strong demand momentum + stable margin = key for growth: CV tyre space is seeing a secular radialisation trend with share of radial tyres in CV segment rising from 4 per cent in FY07 to 47 per cent in FY18. JKTIL enjoys the leadership position in M&HCV truck and bus radial (TBR) segment with market share over 30 per cent. Thus, radialisation story stays intact for JKTIL. For Q1FY19, Indian operations saw healthy revenue growth of 36.4 per cent YoY mainly due to 1) strong OEM demand & 2) higher growth in replacement segment that benefitted from anti-dumping duty on Chinese tyres levied in past & Q1FY18 (last year) GST transition restricted tyre demand at the dealer’s level. Demand improvement in its Mexico operation is visible in Q1FY19 & is likely to continue, going forward. Thus, we expect JKTIL to report volume driven revenue CAGR of 14 per cent YoY in FY18-20E. On the margin front, higher prices of crude based derivatives have impacted gross margins in Q1FY19 & are likely to continue in the near term. However, apart from passing on higher input cost, we believe strong operating leverage will support margins, going forward. Mexico performance is expected to recover post completion of labour restructuring. Thus, management expects margins in the range of 13-14.5 per cent, going forward.


Re-calibration of capacity; disappoints us: JKTIL has re-cast its existing capacity, which negatively surprised us. Its overall tyre capacity as of FY17 was at 35 million units & 2,110 tonnes/day, which as of 9MFY18 declined to 31.8 million units (down 10 per cent) & 1,709 tonnes/day (down 19 per cent). The major re-work is on the acquired CIL plant where its production capacity is now lowered by 15 per cent & 39 per cent in unit & tonnage terms, respectively. JKTIL reassessed old plant/machinery & made the necessary shifting of some machinery. With lower effective capacity, it is now adding TBR capacity of 0.6 million tyres at a cost of Rs 275 crore. Thus, overall capex (maintenance & new capacity) is likely to be Rs 350 crore vs. earlier estimate of less than Rs 100 crore, further disallowing JKTIL from reducing its overall debt as expected in the past.


Debt led heavy balance sheet overweighs growth; maintain HOLD: JKTIL is well placed to benefit from the demand recovery thereby driving its revenue in coming months. Further, we await clarity on fund raising plans (via debt or equity as the former will result in higher interest outgo while the later will dilute earnings). Thus, we value JKTIL at 4.8x FY20E EV/EBITDA with a target price of Rs 120 and a HOLD recommendation."

We will approach Thursday’s trade after a trading holiday and we will have world markets to catch up with. The global environment remains stable and this may once again lead us to see a stable opening on Thursday. 

However, the analysis continues to remain on similar lines and we recommend a high degree of caution as we now deal with and chase the marginal upmoves the markets are giving while remaining overextended.

The Thursday’s trade is likely to see the levels of 11,585 and 11,620 acting as immediate resistance levels. Supports come in lower at 11,540 and 11,470 zones.



The Relative Strength Index – RSI on the Daily Charts is 70.5727 and now trades in mildly overbought territory. RSI continues to show bearish divergence against the price. Daily MACD too remains bearish as it trades below its signal line. 

On the Candles, a spinning top occurred. It also resembled a not-so-classic long lower shadow, but in any case, it may potentially halt the current upmove. However, this needs confirmation on the following bar.
This is the time when we continue to chase the momentum on the higher side, but do it now with great degree of caution. Blind chase of momentum may see traders getting caught unawares if a corrective bout is encountered at higher levels.

The Nifty, despite remaining secularly bullish, also stares at a possible minor corrective bout at higher levels. We recommend keeping positions extremely selective and moderate and guard profits vigilantly at higher levels. Though shorts may be avoided and dips, if any, may be used for making purchases, approach to the markets should be kept highly stock specific and selective. Cautious view is advised for the day.

83,2018-08-23,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Change is the only constant in stock market and index composition is no exception.

Many heavyweight stocks of yesteryears have since lost their say on the Indian benchmark indices, even as others have come to acquire clout and become titans in Dalal Street’s new power equation.

Take for instance, ONGC, a Nifty heavyweight from 2004 to 2006 with 12-13 per cent weightage. Today, its index ranking is 24 and the energy firm commands just 1 per cent weightage in the index.

HDFC Bank, which was not even among the top 10 Nifty50 stocks a decade ago, enjoys the highest weightage today at 9.5 per cent.

This broadly reflects the changing contours of the Indian economy, which financials have surpassed every other segment, growing at breakneck speed. Since 2002, when HDFC Bank had a mere 1.8 per cent weightage in Nifty50, the stock has compounded annually at 28 per cent backed by strong earnings.

A change in the methodology used to compute Nifty50 weightage to free-float basis in 2009 has also brought about a complete overhaul in the index composition, brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a report.






Baahubalis today
The more weight a stock holds in the index, the more clout it carries in swinging the index. This is best reflected in Nifty’s recent spurt to 11,500 level, which has been fuelled by only a handful of index heavyweights. That is the main reason behind the disparity in market behaviour, wherein the Nifty has risen some 9 per cent year-to-date against a 7 per cent drop in the Nifty Midcap index. 

“Nifty, in particular, has been running up because of a select few stocks. Outside of it, the market has actually seen a good beating down in the recent months,” Nitasha Shankar of Yes Securities told ETNow.

At present, HDFC Bank (9.5 per cent), Reliance Industries (9.4 per cent), HDFC (6.8 per cent) and Infosys (6 per cent) alone account for nearly one-third of Nifty50 weightage. All these stocks have outperformed the 50-pack this calendar.

Shares of RIL have risen 36 per cent this year, while Infosys has risen 33 per cent and HDFC Bank and HDFC 12 per cent each.


Baahubalis yesterday
Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which was the second biggest Nifty heavyweight in 2002, has slipped to 10th rank in clout with just 2.8 per cent weightage. This stock has delivered 16 per cent return CAGR during this period, which has been in line with Nifty50 return during the same period. Wipro was the third biggest Nifty heavyweight in 2002. It is on the 41st slot now.

Reliance Industries has remained in the top 10 club within Nifty50 for last 16 years, though even it has often witnessed swings in clout. The stock's weightage in the index has declined from 12.3 per cent in December 2002 to 12.7 per cent in 2009, 5.2 per cent in 2014 and 9.4 per cent this August.

There are 46 stocks outside Nifty with market capitalisations higher than the lowest market-cap Nifty stock. They belong to emerging sectors such as insurance. The weight of the financial sector has seen a secular rise in the benchmark indices over the years, said the Motilal Oswal study.

Private financials now hold 34.3 per cent weightage (grown 5 times in 16 years) in the Nifty50. ""It can expand even further, given that the index doesn’t have any representation of the insurance sector yet. Technology’s weightage (13.7 per cent) is reviving after slipping to a five-year-low of 11.4 per cent in 2017,” the brokerage noted.

Interestingly, 13 stocks that got listed since 2003 have since become part of the Nifty50, replacing older members. They include Maruti (listed in July 2003), TCS (August 2004),UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), Yes Bank (July 2005), TechM (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infra (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013).

TCS and Maruti Suzuki still have high weightages in the index."
82,2018-08-23,Coal India,"Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty extended their rally for the third straight session on Tuesday on account of buying in pharma and IT counters amid optimism over US-China trade talks.

The 30-share Sensex closed 7 points, or 0.02 per cent, up at 38285.75, while 50-share NSE Nifty index settled 19.15 points, or 0.17 per cent, higher at 11,570.90. Both of these indices settled at their record highs.

As many as 25 stocks in the Nifty index closed in green with UPL gaining 5 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra (up 3 per cent), Coal India (up 2.52 per cent), Lupin (up 2.29 per cent) and Grasim (up 2.27 per cent). On the other hand, Tata Steel, BPCL, Vedanta, HUL and M&M slipped between 1 per cent and 3 per cent.

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, “Market continues to remain positive we prefer stocks where valuations are not stretched and earnings growth is visible. We feel that themes such as consumption and retail will do well with both urban and rural areas fuelling future growth. However a weakening rupee and higher crude oil prices pose a threat to Indian markets in the short term. IT and pharma may continue to see some buying interest due to a weaker rupee. We like stocks such as Arvind limited in the consumption space and Shoppers Stop from the retailing space.”

Markets were closed on Wednesday on account of Bakri Id.

Well-known investor Ashish Kacholia sold 1,42,527 shares of Vadilal Industries in the previous trading session at an average price of Rs 548.35, NSE data showed.

The BSE Metal index was trading 1.79 per cent down at 12,922 around 02:15 pm. 

National Aluminium Company (Nalco)(down 3.45 per cent), Hindalco Industries (down 2.85 per cent) and Jindal Steel & Power (down 2.82 per cent) were the top losers in the metal pack. 

Steel Authority of India (SAIL) (down 2.71 per cent), Vedanta (down 2.30 per cent) and Tata Steel (down 1.80 per cent) too declined significantly. 

JSW Steel (down 1.13 per cent), Coal India (down 1.03 per cent) and NMDC (down 0.48 per cent) fell in that order .

Meanwhile, Hindustan Zinc (up 0.95 per cent) was up in the index around that time. 

Equity market was lacklustre amid mixed Asian cues. The risk appetite of investors received a blow as US-China trade war intensified after new tariffs kicked in.

Benchmark BSE Sensex was up 53 points at 38,339, while the NSE Nifty50 index was up 8 points at 11,578.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 24 were trading in the green, while 26 were in the red.

81,2018-08-23,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) will strictly implement its credit policy and levy penal interest on payment delayed beyond 15 days, and stop supply if money is not paid in a month as the company wants to bring down receivables that touched Rs 12,500 crore in April.

“Although we have a policy of levying penal interest and discontinuing coal supplies if dues extend beyond a month, it was never implemented strictly. Over the past few years, dues were hovering around Rs 10,000 crore, affecting the company’s finances adversely. Towards the end of the last fiscal, it touched Rs 12,500 crore, prompting the board of directors to direct its executives to strictly implement the policy for defaulters,” a senior Coal India executive said.

State-owned Coal India has started warning defaulters about penal interests and supply cuts, which reduced the dues to Rs 9,000 crore, the executive said. In July, almost 60% of the dues were from four public sector companies. NTPC’s due was Rs 2,600 crore, followed by steel maker SAIL, Rs 1,000 crore, and West Bengal Power Development Corporation at Rs 900 crore. Damodar Valley Corporation’s outstanding was Rs 693 crore.

Earlier, consumers used to raise issues about the quality of coal delivered and raised disputes on billed amounts making it difficult for the fuel supplier to ensure settlement of dues. As Coal India moved to a system of joint sampling and measurement of heat content in coal, dispute resolution has been streamlined making it easier for the company to raise bills or adjust them in case of disputes.

According to an NTPC executive, bulk of the outstandings were old dues raised on mismatch in quality of coal delivered and the quality on which the billing was done. Since there has always been a mismatch in quality claimed to be delivered and the actual quality delivered, certain amount always remains outstanding which gets settled only when both parties agrees to the final outcome. Nevertheless, NTPC’s dues were around Rs 3,500 crore towards the beginning of the fiscal which have declined to Rs 2,600 crore by the beginning of July this year.

Damodar Valley Corporation sells bulk of its power to states such as Bihar and Jharkhand, but payments from these two states are irregular at times leading to large dues. It affects the power company’s ability to settle outstandings with Coal India although the company is in regular touch with these states for settling dues."

93,2018-08-27,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Allahabad High Court declined to give private power companies any interim relief on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular that tightened bad loan norms on Monday, the deadline for finalising resolution plans for the stressed assets.

The court suggested the government could use a special dispensation that has never been used before to give directions to the central bank. The high court has mandated insolvency proceedings by lenders against defaulting power projects. Executives said that insolvency proceedings, which kick in as RBI’s 180-day deadline has passed, may lead to steep haircuts for lenders because of the low valuations of stressed projects.

Bankers said they have 15 days to start insolvency proceedings against defaulters, and that it takes about two months to get a case admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), giving them another window to resolve the case. The circular issued on February 12 said that defaulters have to be admitted to the NCLT within 180 days, which meant a deadline of August 27. The companies had sought a relaxation on this as had the government. The issue will come up before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. 





AT STAKE, PLANTS WORTH RS 17,000 CRORE
RBI wants the apex court to transfer to itself all cases on the matter that have been filed in the various high courts. Banks hope to salvage at least seven commissioned power plants worth Rs 17,000 crore for which new promoters have been identified. These projects have received bids that require lenders to take a 50% haircut.

Close to eight power plants have been admitted to the NCLT while another 15 will need to have the insolvency process initiated against them after the deadline, sources said. Plants of many companies including KSK Energy, Avantha Group, GMR Energy and Jaiprakash Power Ventures are being eyed by power companies and funds. Potential buyers include Adani Power, Vedanta Plc, JSW Energy, Resurgent Power and Edelweiss ARC with average bids at 50% of the project cost. Total power sector bad debt is pegged at Rs 1.2 lakh crore, owed by about 60 companies.

The high court asked the central government to decide on the matter and take action under Section 7 of the RBI Act within 15 days. This says that the central government can ask the RBI to take action it considers necessary in the public interest after consultation with the governor. The government has never used this dispensation. During court proceedings, the government had recommended an extension of 180 days to complete resolution proceedings.

RBI had sought direction from the government on stressed assets under the same section. It also said that stress in the power sector had been caused by state-run utilities being favoured at the expense of private ones.


SINHA COMMITTEE
The court has also asked the high-level empowered committee that was set up on July 29 under cabinet secretary PK Sinha to decide within two months on resolution in consultation with the RBI. The court has asked the government to include RBI representation in the high-level committee, which was set up to revive stressed thermal projects.

An executive with a public sector financial institution said that of 11 power projects identified to be resolved through bidding, deals for at least seven had been finalised and the necessary paperwork had started. “The lenders have 15 days to initiate insolvency proceedings against the defaulting projects, while admission to NCLT these days takes two months,” a senior bank executive said.

“So the lenders still have two-three months to save such projects. Even after admission, in case 90% of the lenders decide, they can withdraw a project from NCLT.” The high court has also ruled that any person or company with an urgent case can independently approach it with all material facts, sources said. The power companies had moved the Allahabad High Court seeking modification in the RBI circular saying it would trigger insolvency proceedings against 30,000 megawatts of assets, causing huge value erosion.

The companies said that many projects are stressed for reasons beyond their control. These include delays in land acquisition, green clearances, failure of Coal India to supply fuel and the reluctance of state distribution companies to sign power purchase agreements.


WHAT THE HIGH COURT SAID...
Delivering the verdict, Chief Justice Dilip B Bhosale said: “We are of the opinion that interim relief, at this stage, need not be granted. IPPA or APP are at liberty to apply for urgent interim relief if need so arises, placing the requisite factual details on record. The Central Government shall consider initiation of the consultative process contemplated under Section 7 of RBI Act, and conclude the same within 15 days from today.

“The High Level Empowered Committee shall submit its report within two months from the date of its constitution. The Ministry of Power shall invite a senior representative of the RBI, after consultation with the Governor of RBI, as a member of the High Level Empowered Committee forthwith. “This order shall not curtail the rights/powers of a financial creditor under Section 7 of the IBC or even of the RBI in issuing directions in specific case( s) under Section 35AA of BR Act to initiate corporate insolvency resolution process under Chapter II of Part II of IBC, in any given case, including the petitioners or members of the petitioners' Association.”"

97,2018-08-29,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Frontline indices Sensex and Nifty registered a positive opening on Wednesday in the backdrop of firm global cues after US stocks registered a fresh record closing and Japan's Nikkei inched up. 

However, the gains for the benchmarks proved to be short-lived and market slipped into negative territory after a fresh spell of selling emerged in select bank, IT and metal counters.

Around 9:20 am, the BSE Sensex was 10 points up at 38,906, while Nifty was trading at 11,725.60, down by 13 points.

The S&P500 and the Nasdaq closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday, but the gains were modest, offering no major trigger. Wall Street offered little in the way of direction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index ended Tuesday up a bare 0.06 per cent, while the S&P500 index gained 0.03 per cent and the Nasdaq 0.15 per cent, Reuters reported. 

While rupee's gain of Monday's session faded away, an uptick in global crude oil price on US sanctions on Iran too influenced the sentiment. 

Oil markets were stable on Wednesday, buoyed by falling supplies from Iran ahead of US sanctions but held in check by rising production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. International Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were at $75.98 per barrel at 0102 GMT, up 3 cents from their last close. 

Infosys, YES Bank, TCS, Coal India and HDFC Bank weighed on the Sensex index.

Shares of Coal India fell nearly 2 per cent, leading among the Sensex losers. Vedanta, Adani Ports and Sun Pharma were among top Sensex gainers.

98,2018-08-29,Coal India,"Smart money chases smart stocks.

Take this: Those who had shown faith on country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki in the early days must be sitting on healthy profit today. The stock, which got listed on the bourses in July 2003, has rallied over 5,400 per cent in last 15 years. One major milestone for the stock was its entry into the elite Nifty50 club in 2004.

There are 12 other stocks which all got listed after Maruti and have seen similar fortunes after entering Club Nifty. They include TCS (listed in August 2004), UltraTech (August 2004), NTPC (November 2004), YES Bank (July 2005), Tech Mahindra (August 2006), Power Grid (October 2007), Adani Ports (November 2007), Bajaj Auto (May 2008), Bajaj Finserv (May 2008), Coal India (November 2010), Bharti Infratel (December 2012) and Indiabulls Housing (July 2013). 

Data suggested that one of every four debutants of last 15 years, which made it to Club Nifty, gave handsome returns to investors.

Barring Coal India (down 17 per cent), all other stocks from Club Nifty have delivered positive return to investors since their listing. YES Bank has rallied nearly 3,200 per cent since listing, UltraTech Cement 1,551 per cent and TCS 1,528 per cent.

The Nifty topped the 11,700-mark for the first time ever this week coming from sub-1,500 level 15 years ago, logging a 750 per cent rise.

Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, Power Grid, NTPC, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Bharti Infratel have climbed 396 per cent, 96.30 per cent, 86 per cent, 110 per cent, 357 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto have soared 1,300 per cent and 805 per cent, respectively, since their listing in 2008.

JSW Steel, which on Tuesday qualified to enter the Club Elite, advanced over 3 per cent in early trade on Wednesday. NSE Indices said it will replace Lupin in the Nifty 50 index from September 28, 2018. 

“Change is the only constant and index structure is no exception. Over the years, the representation in Nifty50 has undergone a sea change in consonance with the changes in the underlying economy: new sectors have evolved, while some have lost relative importance in the New India,” brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.

Market experts are looking bullish on most of the above-mentioned stocks. Motilal Oswal has a ‘buy’ rating on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) with a target price of Rs 10,805. The automaker expects double-digit growth in FY19, driven by continued strength in rural markets. The company remains fully committed to launching fully electric vehicles in India in 2020, supported by access to technology from Toyota. In the interim, it will launch a strong hybrid vehicle. Shares of Maruti Suzuki traded at Rs 9,413 on Wednesday.

Country’s biggest IT major Tata Consultancy Services is among the preferred picks of brokerage Sharekhan. TCS recently reported higher-than-expected margin performance in Q1FY19, while Infosys and HCL Tech delivered on expected lines, according to Sharekhan.

BofAML recently upgraded Tech Mahindra to ‘buy’ from ‘underperform’ and raised the target price to Rs 800 from Rs 600 earlier. “We expect operating profit to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 per cent over FY18-21. Such growth to provide more qualitative stock rally,” the brokerage said.

Phillip Capital has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Ports with a target price of Rs 475. “The strong cargo growth story remains intact, driven by inclusion of new ports (Ennore in FY19, Vizhinjam in FY20) and growth in logistics business. We also expect strong cash flows in FY19 and beyond, with capex peaking out and operations stabilising across assets. We view the current price as an excellent opportunity to own a superior cash-generating asset portfolio,” it said.

Motilal Oswal also has ‘buy’ ratings on Bajaj Auto, Coal India, NTPC and Power Grid."

The Reserve Bank of India in its annual report for 2017-2018 cautioned on an uptick in headline inflation, warranting continuous vigil. The central bank also noted that worsening global trade environment as a result of protectionist policies may impinge on external demand.

Weakness in the domestic currency too weighed on market sentiment. Rupee in today's trade plunged to an all-time low of 70.60 against the US dollar.

“In its annual report, RBI appears sanguine about the growth with pick-up in manufacturing and turnaround in capital formation along with strong agriculture output for the third consecutive year. On the other hand, RBI has reiterated concerns related rising inflationary pressures and need to keep vigil"", Gaurav Dua, Head of Research, Sharekhan said.

Given the improving growth outlook and inflationary concerns, RBI is expected to toe the hawkish line and probability of another rate hike remain high. This is not good news for equities and accordingly the markets have reacted negatively, Dua added.

Weakness in index heavyweights Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank dragged Sensex lower. 

Coal India emerged to be the biggest loser. ONGC, SBI, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, ITC and Wipro managed to end the session in the green with gains of up to 2 per cent.

Rupee touched a fresh record lowThe rupee touched its fresh record low of 70.60 against the US dollar on strong demand for the greenback. Sustained demand for US dollars from banks and importers and higher crude oil prices aggravated rupee's woes. Trade deficit- mostly because of India's unrelenting demand for oil- is a major reason behind rupee's fall. A widening trade deficit is dragging the rupee down as more imports require India to buy more foreign currencies. 


RBI flags inflation risks, fiscal woesIn its annual report for 2017-18, RBI warned that the headline inflation might face upside risks over the rest of the year while real GDP growth for 2018-19 was to increase to 7.4 per cent from 6.7 per cent previously. Also, A worsening global trade environment as a result of protectionist policies may impinge on external demand, while elevated crude oil prices and the strengthening of domestic demand is seen to push up the import bill, the report added. 


PSBs move up as govt pushes merger planThe government has directed RBI to prepare a list of candidates for the merger among 21 government-controlled lenders, Bloomberg reported. The move is aimed at strengthening cash-strapped PSBs that are reeling under mounting NPA. Shares of Bank of Baroda (up 2.40 per cent), Punjab National Bank (1.57 per cent) and State Bank of India (1.58 per cent) clocked decent gains.

0,2018-09-02,Coal India,"Cement producers booked 92% of 4.65 million tonnes offered annually for five years by Coal India at a recent e-auction held for cement companies. The fuel supplier managed to command an average premium of 27% over its notified price.

Average premium for the coal booked was Rs 2,214.47 per tonne, which was offered at an average price of Rs 1,747.5 per tonne by the fuel supplier. Coal India is expected to get a total Rs 944.18 crore per tonne annually, around Rs 200 crore more than if it was sold at notified price.

According to a senior Coal India executive, in FY18, Coal India earned an average realisation of Rs 1,841 per tonne from various e-auctions and Rs 1,257 per tonne from coal sold at notified price. “Notified prices for the non-power sector including cement are 20% higher than the power sector. Thus, premiums fetched at the current auction, when compared to the notified prices of the power sector, average out to a premium of almost 47%,” a senior Coal India executive said.

Premiums in this round varied widely between near 2% on the lower side and 80% at the higher levels over the 11-day auction. In rupee terms, premiums varied between Rs 50 and Rs 1,000 per tonne, depending on the quality and source of the coal. Winners of each round will be supplied coal at the settled premium for five years. If Coal India decides to increase prices during this five-year term, the premium will remain the same but the notified price will be adjusted as per new rates as and when notified, the executive said.

“In all, non-power sector, including cement, steel, captive power plants and others, would be offered around 30 million tonnes of coal, including 5 million tonnes of coking coal meant for the metallurgical sector,” he said.

This is part of the government’s plan to replace all existing fuel supply agreements allotted on a nomination basis to the non-power sector with supply contracts decided through e-auctions. While, the government has decided against premature termination of existing supply contracts allotted through nomination, it won’t renew those that are expiring. These will put up for auction. Premiums decided at the auctions will be valid for five years, after which the exercise will be repeated.

According to plans, South Eastern Coalfields will be offering 9 million tonnes of coal, followed by Central Coalfields at 6.11 million tonnes and Northern Coalfields at 6.3 million tonnes. Mahanadi Coalfields plans to offer 5.2 million tonnes, while Western Coalfields will be offering 3.5 million tonnes. Bharat Coking Coal and Eastern Coalfields will be offering 0.5 million tonnes and 0.55 million tonnes, respectively."

5,2018-09-04,Coal India,"Kolkata:Power supply to North India including Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal is vulnerable to disruptions as fuel supply to 4,200 mw of generation capacity that feeds these states has fallen sharply heightening the risk of a shutdown from events like heavy rain.

Coal India’s supply has fallen because the mine supplying coal to NTPC’s large plants in the east has almost run out of pit head stock, while land acquisition problems have stymied expansion.

Coal India’s supply from Rajmahal mines in Jharkhand has fallen to 40,000 tonnes a day from about 55,000 tonnes. On a rainy day, the supply halves. At NTPC’s Farakka plant, stocks have plummeted to 4,000 tonnes from 2.5 lakh tonnes almost two months ago, said a senior NTPC official.

At the Kahalgaon plant, stocks tumbled to 45,000 tonnes from 5 lakh tonnes two months ago, forcing the company to scale down generation levels to 60% and 80% at Farakka and Kahalgaon power plants respectively from around 90% for both plants, the executive told ET.



The issue has been escalated to the central government, which is monitoring the situation, executives said.

A Coal India executive said reserves at Rajmahal mines is almost depleted but it can be replenished by acquiring land in two villages, Bansbiha and Taljhari adjacent to the existing project. But villagers were reluctant to part with land when local authorities issued notices for acquisition two years ago have now agreed, he said.

However, there are problems like 50 people claiming ownership of a single plot of land. “For certain plots the state administration has not been able to ascertain the beneficiary at all for payment of compensation,” he said.

Coal India hopes to expand slowly with the help of some land that has been recently acquired. It hopes to resolve the issue in two months, executives said.

The NTPC executive said that if it doesn’t rain at Rajmahal, the Farakka plant is expected to keep running at 60% capacity utilisation while Kahalgaon is expected to run at around 80%. “However, any fall in supplies from Coal India may force us to shut down units or scale down utilisation further,” he said.

Coal India is also arranging to supply additional five goods train full of coal from other mines.

They are supplying around 18,000 tonnes of additional coal of which 14500 tonnes is being supplied to Farakka while the rest 3,500 tonnes is going to Kahalgaon.

However, rains have also disrupted this supply in the recent past."

The 3.4 per cent YoY rise in Coal India’s (CIL) August volume looks ordinary as it’s the lowest since July 2017. However, we are upbeat on the off-take volume as: 1) the August growth comes on a huge base of 19.1 per cent YoY growth in August 2017; 2) at 45.2mt, this is the highest August off-take volume for CIL; and 3) inventory drawdown continues with total stocks at 24.5mt (a five-year low). We remain positive on the stock as: a) we estimate volume uptick in H2FY19 going by the previous trend; and b) e-auction premium sustains at >80 per cent even for special auction for the power sector. Maintain ‘BUY’ on attractive valuations of 10.2x FY20E EPS.


Larger subsidiaries drive off take spurt: We perceive the 3.4 per cent YoY (seemingly low) growth in CIL’s off-take as positive since it comes over a base of 19.1 per cent YoY growth in August 2017. At 45.2mt, August off-take volume is the highest ever. Of special mention is that major subsidiaries—SECL (up 5.6 per cent YoY, MCL (up 4.6 per cent YoY) and NCL (up 7.8 per cent YoY)—contributed 70 per cent to total off-take. YTDFY19, off take volume is up 9.5 per cent YoY at 246mt. Going ahead, we estimate off-take to pick up further as seasonal weakness ebbs. Hence, there is a good possibility of CIL meeting/exceeding our full-year estimate of 620mt. 


Inventory at five-year low, but production likely to rebound: CIL’s pithead stock at 24.5mt is at the lowest level in the past five years—down sharply from 55.5mt in March 2018 and 68.4mt in March 2017. We believe, this decline in seasonal in nature as the company has been unable to increase production (owing to monsoon) to meets its sales commitments. However, we expect production to pick up from September as monsoon recedes.


Outlook and valuations: Bright prospects; maintain ‘BUY’: We expect CIL to be beneficiary of sustained volume uptick and robust e-auction volumes. Going by past trend, H2 is expected to be even better. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with a target price of Rs 325, implying an exit multiple of 11.7x FY20E EPS."

Chaos in currency market Sliding for the seventh day in a row, the rupee slipped below the 72 mark for the first time ever as the US dollar eased a bit. The local currency is down over 12 per cent on a year-to date basis, making it one of the worst-performing currencies among emerging markets and giving jitters to the financial markets. A Reuters report said the Reserve Bank of India was not seen intervening after the rupee fell below 72. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday attributed the fall in the rupee to global factors and said there was no need for panic or knee-jerk reactions. He said RBI was doing whatever was necessary to deal with the situation. 


Trade war aggravatesEscalating the ongoing trade tussle, China on Thursday warned that it would go for tit-for-tat action if fresh tariffs are imposed on Chinese imports to the US.

Earlier, the US President had threatened to raise tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Stocks fell in Asia and Europe for the fifth day on Thursday.

Shares of the state-run defence company is likely to remain subdued in the near term as margins for ministry of defence-led projects have been reduced to 7.5per cent from 12.5per cent although some market participants believe that Wednesday’s slump in the stock was overdone, ET reported.

20,2018-09-09,Coal India,"Stressed thermal assets that are referred to the insolvency court may retain their coal and power supply and long-term transmission network access rights.

The high-level empowered committee, constituted by the Prime Minister’s Office, considered these special dispensations to the troubled projects to help their lenders recover a fair value.

Power projects referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) lose their fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with Coal India Ltd, power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state governments, and long-term transmission contracts with Power Grid Corp of India.

“The high-level empowered committee during its first meeting has decided to preserve the three contracts vital to the power projects that can save the value of the projects and fetch fair deals,” said a government official on the condition of anonymity.

“If the government asks the public sector utilities to retain the contracts and they oblige, the projects will attract more investors and higher bids,” he said.

The panel also looked into reform proposals including doing away with the requirement of power generation plants having power purchase tie-ups to get coal and setting up a payment security mechanism to timely recover dues from the distribution companies, he said.

According to the report of the 40th Standing Committee on Energy, the total coal- based power capacity in the private sector is nearly 90,000 mw, of which 75,000 mw is operational. It is estimated that 60,000-65,000 mw of this capacity may be under financial stress.

The projects are stressed due to coal supply, lack of PPAs or regulatory issues. Plants such as Avantha Power (Jhabua), Avantah Power (Korba), Lanco Amarkantak Power and Lanco Anpara have coal supplies, but no or part PPAs.

While some like GVK Goindwal Sahib and Essar Power Jharkhand have complete PPAs or near full PPAs. A few projects like Lanco Anpara and GMR Warora have full PPAs and FSAs, but are stressed due to under recoveries and cost overruns. 

Of the 34 assets listed in the report, 14 have coal issues, eight have PPAs but no coal linkage, and three neither have PPA nor coal supply. There are three plants whose coal block allocations were cancelled, the report stated, adding lenders have exposure of approximately Rs 3 lakh crore to such assets.

On Monday, lenders are expected to file cases for a dozen unresolved assets to NCLT as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India circular. This follows a verdict of the Allahabad High Court refusing extension of the RBI circular deadline to complete resolution of private power plants outside IBC.

Essar Power, GMR Energy and RattanIndia Power have again approached the Allahabad HC seeking directions to RBI for extension of deadline to refer their plants to insolvency court by 60-90 days.

Similar cases have been filed in Madras, Punjab and Delhi high courts. Madras High Court will hear the plea of IL&FS and RKMPowergen on Monday while as per the February 12 circular lenders have to refer unresolved stressed assets to NCLT by Tuesday.

Shares of Hindustan Copper (down 1.42 per cent), APL Apollo Tubes (down 1.33 per cent), Nalco (down 0.97 per cent) and Tata Steel (down 0.87 per cent) fell in that order.

However, Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (up 1.06 per cent) was bucking the trend, rising over 1 per cent. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was down 127 points at 11,462, while the BSE Sensex was 396 points down at 37,994. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 8 were trading in the green, while 42 were in the red. 

HCL Technologies, Axis Bank, Wipro, Infosys and Lupin were among the gainers in the Nifty index.

Sun Pharma, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Ultratech Cement were the top losers in the Nifty pack of stocks."
22,2018-09-10,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Snapping a two-day winning streak, the BSE benchmark Sensex clocked its biggest point-wise drop since March 16 on Monday, as a fresh record low in rupee raised fresh concerns over foreign fund outflows, which hit Rs 5,600 crore in the last five sessions.

The BSE Sensex tanked 467.65 points, or 1.22 per cent to 37,922.17 with four stocks managing to close on a positive note in the 30-share index.

Axis Bank was the top index gainer as the bank said Amitabh Chaudhry of HDFC Life will join as chief executive officer from January 1.

Sun Pharma was the biggest loser and ended 3.72 per cent lower at Rs 639.50. M&M, Vedanta, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, HDFC, ONGC, Bajaj Auto and Coal India were among other stocks that ended on a weak note and lost up to 3.50 per cent.

The NSE Nifty ended the session at 11,438.10, down 151 points or 1.30 per cent. In the 50-share index 8 stocks closed higher and the remaining 42 ended lower.

HCL Tech was the top index gainer followed by Axis Bank, Zee Entertainment, Cipla and TCS. Bajaj Finance emerged to be the worst index performer and tanked nearly 5 per cent. 

No sector managed to shut shop in the green although the Nifty IT index did manage to end on a flat note. The Nifty PSU Bank index was the worst sectoral performer with all 12 constituents closing in the red.

Pharma, auto, FMCG, realty and financials stocks too helped the Nifty PSU Bank index in dragging the NSE benchmark Nifty lower.


What caused the decline?
1. Rout in rupeeThe domestic unit tanked 94 paise in today's trade to hit a fresh record low of 72. 67 against dollar. However, the domestic unit gained some ground in afternoon trade and was trading 72.38 at the time of writing this report.


2. Spike in bond yields10-year bond yield rose to its highest since late-2014 on Monday as worries of higher crude prices and weakening rupee bolstered inflation concerns, according to a Reuters report


3. Weakness in global marketsThe anxiety over the US-China trade war kept investors on the edge globally as world shares flirted with their longest run of declines since early 2016.

Another interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve later this month also has investors worried.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March, Reuters reported.


4. Firming oil pricesOil prices rose today as US drilling stalled and as investors anticipated lower supply once new US sanctions against Iran's crude exports kick in from November. 


What experts say:
Jayant Manglink, President, Religare BrokingMarkets started the week on feeble note and lost over a percent. Weak global cues combined with widening trade deficit, due to continuous fall in rupee against the dollar, dampened the sentiment. Selling pressure was witnessed across the board and almost all the sectoral indices ended lower.

The fall was evident, citing deteriorating local cues and continuous threat of trade war escalation. We feel it's a normal correction, considering the rise that we had in Nifty in recent past. Indications are in the favour of further decline ahead and we expect Nifty to find support around 11,300. Trades have no option but to align their position accordingly and avoid naked longs.


Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesMarkets slid as fears of escalating US -China trade war dented the confidence. As a direct impact of rising crude oil price, widened current account deficit and strengthening dollar on account of a strong US job data, rupee succumbed to a new low and 10-year yield rose further. The poll forecast of a likely ease in inflation couldn’t uplift the sentiment as concerns of a weakening rupee and volatility in oil prices overshadowed."
24,2018-09-11,Coal India,"Coal India and Singareni Collieries Company are offering independent power producers the option of swapping their sources of fuel supply to cut the cost of transportation and generation.

The Central Electricity Authority will oversee the one-time offer for power generators willing to pass on the savings to customers. This would also require regulatory approval.

“The plan is to change source of coal for as many independent power producers as possible, keeping the quality of coal at almost same levels after the swap. It is expected to reduce distance over which coal is sent, reducing transport costs, cost of generation and finally electricity bills for consumers,” said a senior Coal India executive.

The scheme is being offered to power companies that receive coal from state-owned suppliers by rail. At present, coal supplies are based on allocations made over the years to power plants and they are not necessarily the shortest distance between the mines and the generation units.

A similar scheme for state-owned power units helped save almost Rs 6,000 crore three years ago. The scheme is not being offered to plants that receive coal by road as they are already near pitheads.

If several plants compete for the same pithead, the one with the largest cost savings would be offered the swap. The saving would be assessed using a CEA formula that also accounts for change in energy content if the source is changed.

Coal currently travels 477 km from a mine to a plant, with some power stations located up to 1,000 km away.

The voluntary scheme would work on the basis of availability of mines and a consumer’s willingness to accept the quality of coal from another source, the executive said. “An interministerial task force has been formed to resolve issues private companies may face while implementing it,” the executive said.

Coal India, based in Kolkata, produces about 84% of the country’s coal. Singareni Collieries operates in four districts of northern Telangana and supplies coal to most customers in the state and parts of south India and Maharashtra. The company produced 62.01 million tonnes of coal during 2017-18."

26,2018-09-11,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Extending its losses to the second consecutive session, headline indices Sensex and Nifty suffered massive losses on Tuesday on all-round selling as the rupee hit a fresh record low.

Lingering trade war worries, wobbly crude oil prices and turmoil in emerging markets weighed on sentiments. Sensex settled 509 points, or 1.34 per cent, down at 37,413 while Nifty plunged 151 points, or 1.32 per cent, to close at 11,287.

Let’s walk you through the key highlights of the session:

Who dragged the SensexTata Steel, falling 3.46 per cent, was the top loser in the 30-share index. PowerGrid, Hero MotoCorp and Tata Motors suffered losses of over 3 per cent each.

Mayhem in the currency martAfter recovering in the morning session, the rupee saw sharp a drop in afternoon deals and traded 19 paise down at 72.63 around 3.55 pm. Turmoil in emerging markets, firming US dollar and a surge in crude oil prices put pressure on the domestic currency. The relentless slide in the rupee has analysts rushing to rework their forecasts. DBS Bank is now predicting the domestic unit to slip as low as 75 to the dollar.


China stocks near 2016 lowThe Shanghai Composite slipped 0.18 per cent in Tuesday’s session to touch the low of 2016. Worries of an ever-intensifying trade war between China and the US have dealt a heavy blow to Chinese stocks.

23,2018-09-11,Coal India,"Kolkata: The coal ministry along with Coal India and Singareni Collieries have decided to bring 70,000-odd coal contract workers under the ambit of the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO).

Coal India executives said bringing contract workers under CMPFO will offer them social security and give them higher returns apart from helping the fund itself, which is facing an asset-liability mismatch.

CMPFO is an organisation meant for coal workers and its operation is similar to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Members of the fund contribute a monthly amount, which is matched by their employer.

Bulk of this fund along with interest and bonus is returned to the employees after he/she retires. A portion of this fund goes into the pension fund, which is used to provide a steady pension.

This comes close on the heels of Coal India raising wages for contract workers engaged in mining activities by 50%.

At present, the minimum wage for workers on Coal India’s payroll is around Rs 1,200 per day while contract workers would be getting around Rs 800 following the recent hike.

Currently, some coal contract workers are covered by EPFO but a large number of them have remained uncovered.

To start with, the government is planning to transfer workers covered by EPFO in the coal mining industry to CMPFO. This will be followed by bringing contract workers that are not members of any provident fund organisation under the ambit of CMPFO.

CMPFO’s total fund size is a shade over Rs 2,000 crore while it spends Rs 180 crore a month on pensions for some five lakh people. According to a recent actuarial study, the fund was expected to completely go dry by 2023. The study indicated that employees and Coal India jointly need to increase their contribution by some 14% for the fund to sustain in the long run. It was, however, increased by 7% recently, which would help the fund sustain till 2028.

Till 2015-16, inflow into the fund was more than its outgo. From 2016-17 onwards, outgo from the fund turned excess then inflow thus shrinking the fund size.

The outgo is expected to increase exponentially from now on as more Coal India employees retire with salaries that are a few times higher than former employees.

At present, contribution by some 2.8 lakh employees has been supporting pensions of some five lakh retired employees."

30,2018-09-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty staged a stellar show on Friday on across-the-board buying fuelled by healthy macroeconomic indicators. 

Domestic investors embarked on an all-round buying spree after inflation data showed the economy is in a good shape. 

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday showed inflation based on wholesale prices eased to a four-month low of 4.53 per cent in August on softening of food prices. The wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation stood at 5.09 per cent in July and 3.24 per cent in August last year.

Earlier this week, government data showed retail inflation eased to a 10-month low of 3.69 per cent in August. 

The rupee, too, was on a recovery path in anticipation that the Prime Minister may announce some steps to curb its fall at an weekend review. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee was trading 35 paise higher for the day at 71.93.

Positive global cues also influenced the sentiment. Asian shares rose on Friday as the US and China prepared for a new round of trade talks on the tariff row, while a decisive interest rate hike by Turkey’s central bank helped support global risk appetite, Reuters reported.

Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley raised the Sensex target for September 2019 to 42,000, citing that the earnings cycle was at the cusp of turning. However, it highlighted the election outcome in 2019 is a key risk for the market.

The 30-share Sensex surged 373 points, or 0.99 per cent, to settle at 38,090, with only two stocks - Coal India (down 1.42 per cent) and Infosys (down 1.01 per cent) – ending as losers. 

The Nifty50 index jumped 145 points, or 1.28 per cent, to close at 11,515, with four stocks – HCL Tech, Coal India, Infosys and GAIL – ending in the red. Reliance Industries finished flat.

31,2018-09-16,Coal India,"KOLKATA- Coal India wants a policy on coal exports before it could finalise commercial contracts for exporting the dry fuel, a senior CIL official said.

""There is need for a policy. But, we are not aggressive as we are facing high demand in the domestic market and the initial aim is to fulfil that,"" the senior Coal India official told PTI.

""We are in process of dialogue for export to Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan to create a market for long term. A very small quantity of coal is exported to neighbouring countries through bilateral agreements,"" he said.

Earlier, government was planning to export coal with high ash content or of higher grades. Coal India was scouting for export opportunity at the time when pithead coal stock was high as close to 70 million tonne in May 2017.

Pithead coal finds comparatively low interest due to evacuation and cost issues.

With sudden spiralling demand from the power sector, the pithead stock had reduced to 23 million tonne now. In the recent months the miner was failing to fulfil coal demand for power and non-power sectors like aluminium and cement sector.

Coal India had revised its internal production target to 652 million tonne against 630 million tonne fixed earlier following pressure from the ministry to increase production."

41,2018-09-19,Coal India,"KOLKATA- A panel set up by the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation has recommended that the monthly pension for retired workers be capped at ₹45,000 because the poorly managed fund is running out of money.

The minimum pension should be raised to ₹1,000, according to a copy of the panel’s recommendations available with 
ET.

The CMPFO is meant for coal workers and it operates in the same manner as the Employees Provident Fund Organisation. Members contribute a monthly amount that the employer matches. The bulk of this fund, along with interest and bonus, is returned to employees on retirement while a portion is set aside to provide a steady monthly pension.

The CMPFO’s fund size is a shade over ₹2,000 crore and it disburses ₹180 crore every month as pension for some 5 lakh former Coal India employees. According to a recent actuarial study, the fund is expected to go completely dry by 2023.

Looking at the shortfall, the board of trustees of CMPFO formed a panel to suggest changes to make the pension scheme sustainable.

The members of the committee include director personnel of Coal India, director personnel of South Eastern Coalfields and representatives of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.“We have recommended that the maximum pension be capped at ₹45,000 per month or the highest pension given to any beneficiary in the month preceding the date of notification of the recommendation,” said DD Ramanandan, general secretary of All India Coal Workers Federation, which is affiliated to CITU. “If it is notified now, the highest pension would be around ₹45,000 per month. However, if it is done after a year, the highest pension is likely to be ₹60,000 per month.” The committee said the average salary for 30 months should be used to calculate pensionable salary instead of the 10-month average being considered now."

During this period lenders would be able to resolve stressed assets.""On my radar there are 7 or 8 projects. We are working only on that. If there is 100 per cent consensus among lenders only then it (resolution of stressed power assets) would happen,"" Kumar told reporters when asked whether SBI would be able to resolve any stressed assets during the breather till November 11.About any resistance from lenders to resolve these stressed assets, he said, ""They are all at various stages of approval. So at this stage, it is not the right statement to say that there is resistance. We have to give time to boards and management committees of lenders to take a decision.""SBI has taken a decision regarding 7 to 8 such projects. We have conveyed that. Some other banks have also conveyed and some other banks are yet to get approval. That is why we need some time.""About the SBI exposure in those assets, he said, ""SBI has exposure of Rs 17,000 crore in these projects.""About the Supreme Court order, he said, ""Whatever legal options or whatever is permitted by law and regulation would be done. Right now the Supreme Court has said that maintain status quo (on Feb 12 circular)) in respect of petitions pending in high courts. So everybody is maintaining the status quo.""The RBI framework provided for a strict timeline for resolution of these bad loans where debt is Rs 2,000 crore or more. It mandates starting insolvency proceedings in case no resolution plan is provided by the lenders within 180 days of default.About the steps to check rupee depreciation, he said, ""There are some more measures which are coming. But current account deficit needs to be contained. The step taken so far would definitely help the sentiment in favour of the rupee.""On steps taken on containing rupee depreciation by bankers like NRI bonds, he said, ""Whatever you do ultimately add to the debt burden of the country. It is not what banks will decide. Ultimately these are the issues or decisions which are to be taken by RBI that how do we manage our external sector. Once those decisions are taken, the banks implement those decisions.""About unveiling of SASHAKT scheme guidelines, he said, ""That is what in progress. earlier target was September 30, you can add 10 to 15 days more to that. Banks can invest up to 10 per cent in AIF (alternative investment fund). But it has to carry in mind that 10 per cent carries 150 per cent risk weight.

49,2018-09-22,Coal India,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday laid the foundation stone for a Rs 13,000 crore-project to revive the Talcher fertiliser plant and exuded confidence that it will begin production in the stipulated 36 months.

The fertiliser plant will for the first time see coal being converted into gas for use as feedstock and for producing neem-coated urea.

""They have told me production will start in 36 months. I assure you that I will come again after 36 months here with you. I will inaugurate this project,"" Modi said at a function organised here to mark the commencement of work on the project.

Noting that the project will help cut import of natural gas and fertiliser and make India self-reliant, he said, ""Our aim is to take India to new heights of growth.""

Projects like the fertiliser plant here are central to India's growth story, the prime minister said. ""This plant will use latest technology as well.""

The beginning of work on the plant would fulfil the dreams that should have been fulfilled long ago, Modi said.

The project will produce 1.27 million tonnes of neem-coated urea -- a crop nutrient -- and would use coal-gasification technology to produce feedstock for the plant.

""Coal-gasification is being used for the first time in India to covert this 'black diamond' coal into gas. This would help reduce import of natural gas fertiliser,"" he said, adding the project would also generate employment for about 4,500 people.

The project is being executed by a consortium of PSUs, which Modi said is a shining example of how the country's 'crown jewels' can work together.

Modi was of the view that this technology of coal gasification will give new direction to development and would be replicated in other new projects for fertiliser production and other purposes.

The Talcher fertiliser project of the Fertilizer Corporation of India was shut in 2002 by the then BJP-led NDA government as frequent power restrictions as well as obsolete and mismatch of technology made the plant economically unviable.

The government in August 2011 decided to revive the plant. A new company Talcher Fertilisers Ltd was constituted with four state-run companies -- GAIL, Coal India, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers and FCIL -- as partners.

Speaking on the occasion, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said this will be India's first coal-gasification based fertiliser plant that will produce 1.27 million tonnes per annum of urea leading to greater self-reliance in crop nutrient.

It will produce 2.38 million standard cubic metres per day equivalent natural gas utilising available domestic coal in an environment-friendly manner. This would help reduce LNG import bill by Rs 1,620 crore annually.

""The Talcher fertiliser plant will usher in an uncharted path of progress and prosperity for industrial and economic growth in Odisha by providing a massive boost to fertiliser and other ancillary industries in the state. It will also create new opportunities for employment,"" he said.

Assuring all support for the project, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said 50 per cent of the production of this plant will be used in the state itself, benefitting farmers."

Premiums decided at the auctions would be valid for five years, after which fresh rounds of auction would be held again.

57,2018-09-24,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices plunged further on Monday, extending the losing streak to the fifth session in a row, on losses in bank, financial and auto stocks amid a fresh fall in the rupee against the US dollar and weak global cues.

The market reeled under pressure in the absence of positive triggers, as trade war worries hit stocks globally after new US tariffs on China came into effect. 

Back home, the rupee's fresh fall against the dollar and a surge in global crude oil prices roiled investor sentiment. The Sensex plunged 537 points, or 1.46 per cent, to close at 36,305 while the Nifty50 finished at 10,967, with a loss of 176 points or 1.58 per cent. 

Volatility index India VIX jumped over 13 per cent, indicating nervousness in the market. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices suffered more losses than the benchmark Sensex, tanking 2.40 per cent and 2.72 per cent, respectively.

Let’s walk you through the highlights of Monday's session:


Who dragged my SensexBarring five stocks -- TCS (up 4.51 per cent), Coal India (up 2.10 per cent), Infosys (up 1.56 per cent), Reliance Industries (up 1.27 per cent) and NTPC (up 0.57 per cent) -- all others failed to perform on Monday.

Rupee's fresh fallThe rupee more damage as the US dollar strengthened on buying by banks and importers. Higher oil prices also hit the domestic currency as the greenback strengthened against other overseas currencies. The US dollar rose against major currencies amid profit booking in the British pound and a decline in the euro. Rating agency Moody's said the government measures to check fiscal deficit are unlikely to reverse the rupee slide, and perhaps might even hurt the currency more. 


Oil on the boilCrude oil prices surged to hit four-year high on Monday, ahead of US sanctions on Iran, as Opec countries declined to increase production immediately. Benchmark Brent crude oil futures surged 2 per cent to over $80 a barrel as markets have tightened ahead of the start of sanctions by the United States on Iran, Reuters reported. 


MACD bearish on 106 stocksMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, on Monday showed bearish crossovers on 106 counters on NSE. Among the stocks that saw bearish crossovers were Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless, MTNL, Grasim, Bajaj Auto, Corporation Bank and Mirc Electronics.

58,2018-09-24,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-run power producer NTPC has been given the green clearance for the Rs 7,732.35 crore expansion project of the Talcher Thermal Power Station in Odisha, a senior government official said Monday.

The company's proposal is to add two additional units of 660 MW each in the existing premise of the Talcher Tehermal Power Project (TTPP) located in Angul district, Odisha.

""The Union Environment Ministry has given the environment clearance for the NTPC's proposed coal-based ultra super critical thermal power project expansion. The approval has been given with some riders,"" the official said.

The proposed project, which is expected to meet the power demand of the eastern region, is estimated to cost Rs 7,732.35 crore and is planned to be commission by 2022.

In its proposal, the NTPC said about 446 acres of land is required for expansion. The two additional plant facilities will be set up within the land available in the existing power station.

The coal requirement for the expansion project is estimated to be about 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and it will be supplied by the Coal India Ltd (CIL), mostly from Mahanadi Coalfieds.

The NTPC plants generate about one fourth of the total power generated in the country. The company has been continuously exploring and identifying projects, where expansion of existing stations apart from new greenfield projects could be set up, wherever feasible."
59,2018-09-25,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Weak global cues, rising crude oil prices and rupee's bumpy ride weighed on domestic equity benchmarks on Tuesday.

Sensex and Nifty opened in the green but failed to hold altitude in the absence of any positive trigger. 

The rupee on Tuesday slipped 32 paise to 72.95 against the US dollar in early trade after crude prices soared ahead of impending US sanctions on Iran.

Among sectoral indices on the BSE, energy and healthcare bucked the trend by trading in the green zone.

Most telecom stocks came under pressure after reports that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is set to conduct ‘special audits’ of mobile phone operators from fiscal year 2011-12 onwards to check for under-reporting of revenue that might account for a sharp downturn in licence fees and spectrum usage charges.

62,2018-09-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) has officially pushed back a target to produce 1 billion tonnes annually by six years to 2026.

The goal will be achieved by 2025-26 because of changes in the country’s carbon emission targets, sluggish industrial growth, changing energy mix, environmental challenges and difficulties in acquiring land, the state-owned company said in a report.

Another factor was the changing trend in the country’s coal demand.

The Ministry of Coal has hired a consultant to prepare a Vision 2030 document for the coal sector, taking into account the likely demand under various scenarios, views of the Ministry of Power and the impact of the Paris Agreement of December 2015 to combat climate change."

What caused the decline?

F&O expiry: The investors adopted a cautious stance in Wednesday's session and chose to remain on the sidelines ahead of Thursday's F&O expiry.


All eyes on Fed: Investors were on tenterhooks fearing a hike by US Federal Reserve. 

The Fed is expected to hike rates by 25 basis points on expected lines and emphasise that it remains on a gradual rate hiking path, said ICICI Securities. No substantial changes are expected in terms of the dot plot or projections on the economy, it said.


Oil on the boil: Oil prices eased on Wednesday but were still set for a fifth consecutive monthly quarter of gains, driven by an impending drop in Iranian exports in the last three months of the year when global demand heats up, Reuters reported.

Brent crude futures were last down 21 cents on the day at $81.66 a barrel.


What experts say:

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesWorries over liquidity issues in NBFC space demoralized investors in domestic markets. Market stays on a cautious sentiment ahead of Fed policy outcome and higher oil price as major Opec producers declined to increase the output. Volatility in global markets is likely to remain elevated in the short term given cancellation of trade talks between US & China.


Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking 

The broader markets outperformed the benchmark with BSE Midcap and Smallcap ending with marginal gains. The sector indices witnessed a mixed trend.

We maintain our cautious stance on the Indian markets as volatility is likely to remain high in the near term. On the global front, US FOMC meeting scheduled tonight, crude oil and currency movement would be actively tracked by the investors. We would advise investors and traders to remain selective in stock picking."
65,2018-09-26,Coal India,"It is notable that Coal India Ltd (CIL) has officially pushed back the target to produce 1 billion tonnes of coal annually by six years, to 2026. The way forward is to put in place national strategy for low emissions of gases and substances that cause the green-house effect, and follow through with purposeful policy action going forward.

The facts suggest that the gap between demand and supply of coal seems to have reduced of late. Besides, industrial production remains quite sluggish, with growth in output in the low single digits.

Thermal power generation is also faltering somewhat, what with capacity utilisation ratio read plant load factor reducing nationwide, over several years now. It would make perfect sense for CIL to boost benefaction of high-ash content domestic coal. And back-to-back, the main users of coal, power plants, need to shore up thermal efficiency so as to generate more power from a give quantity of fuel. Also, CIL needs to foray into the domain of renewable energy, in keeping with the nation's changing energy-mix in the medium term and beyond."
66,2018-09-26,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government is considering lifting a nearly decade-old restriction on allotment of coal to merchant power plants that supply electricity to short term markets, including the power exchanges.

This may come as a relief to power projects stressed for want of coal and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Short-term power contracts refer to contracts for less than a year. At present, domestic coal is provided only to plants having long- and medium term PPAs.

“There are aberrations in tariffs for few minutes on the power exchange a few times in the year, but the average power price remains less than Rs 4 per unit,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. “If the coal linkages can be freed up, stressed power plants can meet their debt obligations.” The proposal is based on a recent analysis that the short-term power market has been beneficial for meeting the short term needs of the consumers, suppliers and the sector as a whole, sources said. An empowered committee on stressed thermal power plants, headed by cabinet secretary P K Sinha, is studying the proposal. The committee is set to meet on September 28, sources said.


The government official quoted above said adequate safeguards, including the government’s bidding portal for power procurement, are available to prevent profiteering and cartelisation. Another government official said state-run Coal India has been asked to study the proposal. According to a Central Electricity Regulatory Commission report on short-term markets, average spot market prices are lower than those discovered through short-term bilateral contracts.

The short-term power market constituted about 11% of the total electricity generation in India in 2017-18, the report said. “The weighted average price of electricity transacted through traders and power exchanges declined from Rs 7.29/kWh and Rs 7.49/kWh respectively in 2008-09 to Rs 3.59/kWh and Rs 3.45/kWh respectively in 2017-18,” the report said.

The restriction on merchant power plants was introduced during the days of acute coal shortages. It was lifted last year for plants with medium-term power purchase agreements. Plants supplying to short-term competitive markets procure coal from e-auctions and global markets.

67,2018-09-27,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extended losses to a second session in a row on Thursday, on sustained selling in bank, financial and auto stocks, as investors’ risk appetite remained subdued amid expiry of September series futures & options contracts.

The Sensex opened in the green and traded with gains for some time before giving up the gains amid weak global cues and a fresh slide in the rupee against the US dollar. 

A rise in global crude oil price, rupee’s weakness and listless trading in peer markets in the wake of US Fed’s rate hike also hit sentiment back home. 

Most emerging market stocks and currencies fell on Thursday after US Fed hiked policy rates by 25 basis points and signalled another rate hike in December. The US central bank foresees three more rate hikes next year and one in 2020, Reuters reported.

Equity barometer Sensex suffered a loss of 218 points, or 0.60 per cent, to settle at 36,324, with 17 stocks ending in the red and 13 in the green. NSE’s Nifty50 finished 76 points, or 0.69 per cent, lower at 10,977, with 19 stocks gaining and 31 losing.


Let's walk you through the highlights of Thursday's session:

300 stocks at 52-week lows on NSEAs many as 310 stocks, including Tata Motors, Vodafone Idea, Hudco, APL Apollo Tubes, IndiGo, Jet Airways (India) and JMT Auto, Karur Vysya Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Punjab & Sind Bank hit 52-week lows on NSE. Meanwhile, Monnet Ispat & Energy, Deepak Nitrite, Gangotri Textiles, Prakash Steelage and Ruchi Infrastructure featured among the 10 stocks that touched their 52-week highs on NSE.


Sensex movers and shakersYES Bank (down 9.14 per cent), Maruti (down 3.68 per cent), Tata Motors (down 3.32 per cent), Axis Bank (down 2.79 per cent) and ONGC (down 2.49 per cent) finished the day as top losers in the Sensex pack. TCS (up 2.16 per cent), Coal India (up 1.39 per cent), Asian Paints (up 0.97 per cent), PowerGrid (up 0.93 per cent) and Infosys (up 0.88 per cent) were among the top gainers. 


Crude oil on the boilTight supply ahead of US sanctions on Iran kept the oil market boiling. A Reuters report said crude oil prices rose nearly 1 per cent on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supplies once US sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in five weeks. Opec did not indicate any plan to increase output at its meeting last Sunday, which is causing oil prices spiral up. 


Rupee sees seesaw tradeRupee swung between gains and losses. The government attempts to stem the fall in the rupee and keep current account deficit in check have not helped so far. The government on Wednesday raised import duty on a range of items including air-conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, footwear, jewellery, furniture fittings and tableware besides imposing it on aviation turbine fuel to try and boost the health of the rupee and keep CAD within the target range. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 4 paise higher at 72.57.


Midcaps, smallcaps bledBSE Midcap and Smallcap indices cracked 2.19 per cent and 1.97 per cent, respectively. Edelweiss Financial Services (down 10.35 per cent), Reliance Capital (down 7.94 per cent), PNB Housing Finance (down 7.29 per cent), IIFL Holdings (down 7.05 per cent), Max Financial Services (down 6.37 per cent) and Voltas (down 6.28 per cent) were the top losers in the Midcap index. In the BSE Smallcap index, Adlabs Entertainment (down 20 per cent), SREI Infrastructure Finance (down 17 per cent), OM Metals Infraprojects (down 10.80 per cent), Thangamayil Jewellery (down 10.68 per cent), Indiabulls Real Estate (down 10.36 per cent) and GOCL Corporation (down 9.25 per cent) led the losers.


YES Bank slipped furtherShares of YES Bank plunged 9.14 per cent to close at Rs 203.20 on BSE. The stock has been under pressure of late amid uncertainty over its next CEO after RBI has cut short Rana Kapoor's tenure to January 31, 2019. The bank’s board has requested RBI for a extension for Kapoor and formed a five-member panel to find a successor to the founder CEO. The scrip had gained 1.84 per cent on Wednesday after four consecutive sessions of drubbings.


Aviation stocks in free fallShares of Jet Airways (down 5.42 per cent), Global Vectra Helicorp (down 5 per cent), SpiceJet (down 1.80 per cent), IndiGo (down 1.27 per cent) and TAAL Enterprises (down 0.58 per cent) suffered losses after the government imposed customs duty on aviation turbine fuel (ATF). 


Tyre stocks skiddedMost tyre stocks closed the session with losses after the government raised import duty on radial car tyres. Shares of Balkrishna Industries (down 5.15 per cent), Ceat (down 4.87 per cent), Phillips Carbon (down 4.44 per cent), Apollo Tyres (down 2.87 per cent), MRF (down 2.79 per cent), Govind Rubber (down 1.77 per cent), Oriental Carbon & Chemicals (down 1.65 per cent), Krypton Industries (down 1.63 per cent) and TVS Srichakra (down 1.07 per cent) settled with losses. However, J K Tyre & Industries (up 0.79 per cent) logged marginal gains."
68,2018-09-27,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Domestic coal scarcity has prompted power companies to import 26% more coal in August compared with the same month last year, even though their total coal consumption did not rise.

71,2018-09-30,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India Ltd has set a ""difficult"" production target of 700 million tonne for fiscal 2019-20, a ""challenge"" the mining major was ready to undertake in the wake of rising power demand, its Chairman A K Jha said.

The Kolkata-headquartered company had envisaged an output of 630 million tonne for the current fiscal, but later revised it to 652 million tonne as an aspirational target.

""Our aspirational production target for the fiscal is an 85-million tonne jump from what we have been able to produce in the last fiscal.

""We registered an increase in production of 104 million tonne in the last four years - between 2015 and 2018,"" Jha said at a conference of Mining Geological & Metallurgical Institute of India here on Saturday.

CIL achieved an output of 567.4 million tonne in 2017-18, 32.6 million tonne short of its target.

""Producing 700 million tonne would be difficult, but CIL was ready to take on the challenge in the wake of the country's increasing power demand,"" he said.

The miner's production grew at 12 per cent in the first five months of this fiscal compared to the corresponding period a year ago, but dipped in August to 3.2 per cent.

""Producing more means that we will have to go deeper into the mines. Mines' stability and safety in an issue and for that we will need to change our safety policy,"" Director General of Mines Safety, P K Sarkar, said.

""We are open to all constructive criticism and suggestions to ensure safety of our miners, while we dig deep to increase our production,"" he added."
70,2018-09-30,Coal India,"The supply of coal by state-owned CIL to the power sector in the first five months of the ongoing fiscal increased by 12.1 per cent to 196.9 million tonnes (MT).

The dispatch of dry fuel by Coal India (CIL) in the April-August period of the 2017-18 was at 175.6 MT, according to official data.

The coal supply by the PSU in August increased by 7.3 per cent to 36.7 MT, over 34.2 MT in the corresponding month last year.

The coal supply by Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) in the April-August period of the ongoing fiscal was almost flat at 21.2 MT, over 21 MT in the same period of the last financial year.

The coal dispatch by SCCL in August this year declined by 7.6 per cent to 3.6 MT, over 3.9 MT in the same month last year.

The fuel supply to the power sector is estimated at 525 million tonnes for the fiscal as against 454 million tonnes in 2017-18, Coal India had earlier said.

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had in July asked Coal India to focus on meeting coal demand, particularly from the power sector.

Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic output, is optimistic about an aspirational production target of 652 million tonnes for the fiscal year 2018-19."
0,2018-10-01,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market took a breather on Monday to register a stellar start to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, buoyed by growth in India’s manufacturing sector activity.

BSE Sensex jumped 299 points, or 0.83 per cent to settle at 36,526.14. The NSE counterpart Nifty reclaimed the psychological level of 11,000 and shut shop up 77.85 points, or 0.71 per cent at 11,008.30. 

The gains in Sensex were led by banking and IT stocks.

In the 30-share index 22 stocks closed the day in the green. YES Bank was the top index performer. It was followed by TCS, HDFC, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, Coal India and Infosys.

Among Sensex losers were -- Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, RIL and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

On BSE for every two stocks that gained three stocks ended lower. 

Midcap and smallcap stocks underperformed Sensex. The BSE Smallcap index lost 0.25 per cent in today's trade.

Among Nifty stocks, 34 stocks ended in the green and 16 in the red.

On NSE, only the realty index closed the day lower. A strong performance by PSU bank, IT, media and financial stocks offset the losses logged by realty index.

The domestic equity, currency and commodities market will remain shut on Tuesday on account of Gandhi Jayanti.


Factors that led the indices higher:
1. Pick up in manufacturing sector activity: The investor sentiment amid lack of any positive trigger over the last few days got a boost from a rise in the September manufacturing activity data.

The country's manufacturing sector activity improved in September amid gains in new orders, output and employment, a monthly survey said Monday, according to a PTI report. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index strengthened slightly in September to 52.2, up from 51.7 in August, as sales rose from both domestic as well as foreign clients, it added.


2. Buying in banking and financials: The banking and financial stocks rallied in today's session after reports emerged that the government is likely to supersede Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) board, and may take a Satyam-like route to deal with the institution. The government has reached NCLT and an order is likely soon, government sources told ET Now.


3. Strong global markets: Optimism about a reconstituted free trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico and what it could mean for trade relations elsewhere helped world markets kick off the fourth quarter of the year in a positive vein. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.5 per cent to 27-year high and European stocks were up overall despite losses on Italian markets on political concerns, Reuters reported.


What experts say:
Jayant Manglik, President, Religare BrokingNifty recovered strongly and settled with decent gains amid volatility. It opened flat, but selling pressure in the select index majors pushed the index lower. However, encouraging macroeconomic data viz. uptick in manufacturing activities and GST collection figures, combined with recovery in the NBFC and banking majors eased the pressure. It was broad-based recovery and others also joined in as session progressed. 

Nifty may see further rebound but it's too early to call a reversal. It has immediate hurdle at 11,100. We've list of important data and event viz. auto sales and RBI meet ahead thus we suggest continuing with stock specific trading approach and preferring hedged positions. We believe participation of banking sector would play the key role ahead.


Abhijeet Dey, Senior Fund Manager-Equities, BNP Paribas MFStock markets in India started the day in the negative zone and trade below the flat line for most of the day before making a sharp recovery in the last 45 minutes of trade. Solid growth of the manufacturing sector during the latest survey period extended the current run of expansion to 14 months. Barring the realty index, all other sectoral indices on the National Stock Exchange closed the day with gains."
5,2018-10-03,Coal India,"KOLKATA: A strong air of optimism rules the outlook for metals sector as a whole led by solid demand environment, favourable pricing scenario, strong cash flow generation and focus on deleveraging to improve the balance sheet, according to Centrum Research.

The brokerage hosted an exclusive investor conference titled ‘The Metal Medley’ on the metals sector in Mumbai recently, which brought together some 16 companies covering all sub-sectors like ferrous, non-ferrous, pipes, refractories, graphite electrodes and other ancillaries.

Listing out the highlights of the meet, Centrum said in a report that large cap ferrous names sounded optimistic on demand and signalled strong focus on capacity creation. While investors were concerned that deleveraging would be taking a backseat with renewed focus of the companies in undertaking capex for both organic and inorganic expansions, companies sounded confident of balancing the cash flows and also expected the current cycle to sustain in medium term. Pipe companies were confident about sustenance of strong order inflow and robust earnings which is expected to result in strong cash flows. This will be utilised for either deleveraging or expansion of product basket, the report added. Ferrous consumables like electrodes and refractories indicated robust volumes and strong earnings growth driven by strong underlying demand and solid entry barriers in their businesses, while strong midcap ferrous companies were in the midst of finalising their expansion plans as they boast of strong balance sheets and are running at optimum utilisations, it added.

Sharing its recommendation, the Centrum report said: “In largecaps, we remain positive on Tata Steel and Hindalco in ferrous and non-ferrous pack respectively. We like Coal India in the large cap mining space. Among midcaps, we like Vesuvius India and IFGL and are positive on select ferrous midcap stocks like Tata Metaliks and Kirloskar Ferrous due to their strong business model and growth prospects.”"

9,2018-10-06,Coal India,"By Pavan Burugula

MUMBAI: The current bout of persistent selling in Indian equities has prompted the government to go slow on its proposed stake sale in Axis Bank, and an extended volatile run in growth assets may also lead New Delhi to defer some of the initial share sales scheduled to be completed in FY19.

Market sources told ET that the government was initially planning to sell up to 4 per cent of its stake in Axis Bank by early November. However, the Department of Public Asset Management (Dipam) decided to postpone the sale after meeting the empaneled bankers last week. Volatility could prompt the Centre to defer some other IPOs.

This delay in Axis Bank stake sale would adversely impact the government’s ambitious plan to garner Rs 80,000 crore through divestments this fiscal: It has raised only Rs 7,000 crore until now. The government owns 9.6 per cent in Axis Bank through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). The plan was to undertake an institutional placement in Axis Bank involving select foreign institutions and domestic mutual funds.

“The government was seeking to raise around Rs 7,000 crore through the stake sale. We had already conducted few roadshows earlier this year. We were optimistic about the share sale since Axis Bank stock was doing well until August. However, when secondary markets are falling, investors go risk-averse and, hence, getting big-ticket buyers would be a challenge,” said an investment banker privy to the development.

The Centre has been seeking to offload the bulk of its Axis Bank stake for more than three years now. However, the weak stock performance and concerns about hostile takeover have thwarted the government’s efforts. Axis Bank has underperformed its private peers by a huge margin since 2016. The Private Bank Nifty has gained close to 60 per cent since the beginning of 2016, while Axis Bank shares have only managed to climb 25 per cent.

Bankers privy to the development said things were looking optimistic during the April –August period when Axis Bank shares started catching up with the broader market. In fact, a bulk of the 25 per cent gains made by Axis Bank stock since 2016 was between June and August this year.

The government had offloaded 9 per cent its Axis Bank stake in 2014 to mop up Rs 5,500 crore – the last major transaction in the lender. It has also diluted a marginal stake in the private lender through the newlylaunched CPSE Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).

The ongoing market weakness will also impact other divestments.

“Primary markets are closely linked to secondary markets. It is difficult to rope in investors for any capital market issuance when secondary markets are witnessing a turbulent phase,” said V Jayashankar, senior executive director of Kotak Investment Banking. “The current correction is just a temporary setback and capital market activity is expected to revive soon.”

There are a dozen divestment offerings lined up currently, including the launch of a CPSE Debt ETF, another tranche of Bharat 22 ETF, and IPOs of several small and midsized PSUs, including the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). Bankers are also working on offers for sale (OFS) in Coal India and NBCC."
11,2018-10-07,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Captive power producers booked 87% of coal on offer by Coal India (CIL) at an average premium of 21.54% in the first 10 days of an auction that offered five-year supply contract through e-auction.

The auction offering 17 million tonne (mt) ends next week. Till now, the public sector fuel supplier offered 12.66 mt from its seven coal producing subsidiaries, of which some 11mt has been booked. Of this, some 9.38 mt was booked at premiums ranging between 1% on the lower side and 141% on the upper range, depending on grade of coal, its source and transport mode. The remaining, around 1.65 mt, was booked at notified prices.

Average notified price for bookings was Rs 1,216 per tonne which fetched an average premium of Rs 300.37 per tonne. CIL is expected to earn a total additional premium of Rs 331.54 crore annually on the 11 mt booked. It will fetch Coal India Rs 1,871 crore annually for five years.

The dry fuel supplier has lined up 17 mt for this round of auction meant for captive power producers only. It is the third round of long-term auction being held over the past few months. “In all, non-power sectors including cement, steel and others will be offered around 30 mt — including 5 mt of coking coal meant for the metallurgical sector,” said a Coal India executive."
10,2018-10-07,Coal India,"India's coal import increased substantially by 35 per cent to 21.1 million tonnes (MT) in September, as against 15.61 million tonnes in the corresponding month previous fiscal. The rise in imports comes at a time when the captive power plants in the country are grappling with the issue of coal shortages. 

""The increase in coal and coke imports in September is mainly due to higher imports of non-coking coal during the month under review,"" according to mjunction services, a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL. 

There was, however, a marginal drop in coking coal imports on a month-on-month basis, it said. 

Overall, coal and coke imports during the first half of the current fiscal increased by 13.9 per cent to 119.42 MT, compared to 104.81 MT in the April-September period of previous fiscal, mjunction added. 

Commenting on the coal import trend, mjunction CEO Vinaya Varma told that, ""With the coal shortage persisting in the power sector, there is high demand for imported material. This, accompanied by a correction in thermal coal prices in the global market, has led to higher imports in September. If other things remain the same, this trend is likely to continue in October"". 

Steam coal imports during the first six months of 2018-19 increased 17.5 per cent to around 82.5 MT, compared to 70.21 MT in the same period previous year, mjunction said. 

With the power plants grappling with acute coal shortage, the government has recently directed Coal India and its subsidiaries to give priority to power plants in fuel supply. 

Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) -- a Coal India arm-- in a recent letter said in view of the acute shortage of coal at power plants, it was decided in the meeting that rakes will be loaded only for power plants. 

After meeting the requirement of power plants, ""CPSUs like RINL, Nalco and SAIL (RSP) are to be loaded till the crisis is over"", the letter had said. 

The government had earlier said that during 2017-18 coal imports increased to 208.27 MT due to increase in demand by consuming sectors. 

The country's coal import fell from 217.7 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 190.9 MT in 2016-17."

CIL and NCIL on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for setting up a 50:50 joint venture company that would undertake the projects.

Coal India has been tasked to become a net zero emission energy company by ministry of coal, a move which requires it to generate 3,000 mw of solar power. The MoU, also extends for setting up of 2,000 mw of thermal power generation across CIL’s subsidiaries.

Solar projects will be set up over 15,000 acres on identified barren and reclaimed free land of Coal India and also at locations where free land is available. 

Estimated cost for Coal India’s solar power generation is pegged at Rs 12,000 crore.

The joint venture company will be scheduled complete the proposed solar projects and thermal projects within 15 months and 60 months respectively.

The projects will be financed through debt equity ratio of 70:30 as per the CERC norms. A concept paper has been initiated by both the companies to get clearance from their respective boards.

“This is a synergistic step, combining the resources of both the companies for a common goal. CIL will be riding the core technical expertise of NLCIL in thermal power generation and Solar PV Power,” a Coal India executive said."
12,2018-10-08,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Frontline equity indices Sensex and Nifty skidded sharply lower after opening Monday's session on a flat note as rupee's prolonged fall and weak Asian cues hit market sentiment.

The rupee on Monday opened 19 paise down at 73.96 against the US dollar on account of buying in American currency by banks and importers.

The local currency dropped 18 paise against the US dollar on Friday after the RBI surprisingly kept the repo rate unchanged. Meanwhile, the domestic currency crashed below the 74-mark for the first time ever in intra-day trade on persistent capital outflows and high crude oil prices.

Shares in Asia stumbled in early trade on Monday as investors waited with bated breath as China's markets prepare to reopen following a week-long holiday and after its central bank cut banks' reserve requirements in a bid to support growth, Reuters reported.

Around 9:29 am, the 30-share Sensex was 275 points, or 0.80 per cent, down at 34,102, with 21 stocks declining in trade.

The NSE Nifty50 was 82 points, or 0.80 per cent, down at 10,234, with 11 stocks in the green zone and 39 in the red.

14,2018-10-08,Coal India,"Demand-supply gap following improved power requirement in August this year was met by increased hydel and nuclear power generation bringing down peak deficits to 0.5% according to a report by India Ratings and Research.

In August 2018, all-India energy requirement increased 6% over August last year to 112.0 billion units and available energy increased 6.2% to 111.4 billion units. Peak demand deficit improved to 0.5% in August 2018 against 2% last August.

According to the report by India Ratings, increase in power demand was met through higher electricity generation, which increased 11.7% year-on- year to 105.7 billion units, especially driven by a healthy year-on-year rise in generation from hydel sources by 20% and nuclear by 18.1% while thermal generation remained almost at the same levels. Thermal plant load factor declined to 56.4% in August 2018 from 57.9% in August 2017.

Total renewable power generation rose 21.8% this August against last August to 15.8 billion units in July 2018, on account of improved generation from the wind sector due to higher capacities and wind speeds. Solar energy generation increased to 2.6 billion units in July 2018 from 1.7 billion units in July 2017. Wind power generation increased to 11.4 billion units in July 2018 from 9.8 billion units in July 2017.

Production from Coal India increased 3.1% in August against last August to 38.8 million tonnes, supporting thermal generation growth. Coal inventory at power stations improved 23.7% year-on-year, unlike previous months. This was on account of higher generation from hydel and renewable sources, which led to lower reliance on thermal generation for meeting incremental demand. Number of power stations with critical and supercritical levels declined to 11 in August 2018 from 12 in August 2017."

21,2018-10-10,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market staged a smart recovery on Wednesday, as BSE benchmark Sensex posted its biggest single-session gain in over six months after rising 461 points.

The surge in domestic stocks was technical in nature where a mix of both technical indicators, which were in oversold territory, and short coverings, resulted in a relief rally for the market. The rally, however, may not last long, analysts said. 

Besides short covering, a host of other factors -- recovery in the rupee against US dollar, fall in crude oil prices and hopes of foreign fund inflows -- also boosted the market. 

Buying in bank stocks was another positive that worked in the favour of the bulls. 

Sensex jumped 461.42 points or 1.35 per cent to 34,760.89, logging its biggest gain since April 5, 2018.

Meanwhile, volatility index, India Vix plunged 8.83 per cent to 18.01.

""Market turned positive from oversold region led by financial stocks and marginal gain in the rupee. Besides, RBI’s open market operation to buy government bonds will ease concerns about liquidity crunch in the system. Benchmark indices and midcap are currently trading at a five-year average 1-year forward PE of 16 times and 17.6 times, respectively, which provides accumulating opportunity once the yield and currency stabilise,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The domestic currency appreciated nearly 33 paise against the US dollar in intraday trade today, buoyed by RBI’s announcement to conduct OMO of Rs 12,000 crore to manage liquidity in the financial system.

Infosys, TCS, Sun Pharma, Wipro and Coal India were the losers in Sensex kitty of stocks.

The gains in Sensex were mainly on account of a rise in banking stocks.

The NSE Nifty reclaimed the 10,450 level to close at 10,460.10, up 159.05 points, 1.54 per cent. In the 50-share index, 42 stocks ended in the green and eight in the red.

27,2018-10-12,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The government has admonished Coal India’s brass for poor project management, long delays in tendering, leniency with contractors and other issues that have starved thermal power plants of fuel and warned the company’s nonperformers that it can take stern action.

The central government wants Coal India to liquidate 10 million tonnes of pit head stocks from its existing 21 million tonnes by end of October to take care of increased demand during festival season.

“Contracts management and monitoring systems, especially for big infrastructure projects like coal handling plants and washeries are very poor,” the coal ministry said in a letter to Coal India.

“There are inordinate delays in floating tenders after obtaining approval of competent authority, completion of tender process and issue of work orders, monitoring timely completion of works as per terms and conditions of work order, taking punitive action against defaulting contractors, leading to inordinate delays in completion of many important projects, thereby allowing valuable investment to remain unutilised or under-utilised.”

It has asked the company’s top brass to take prompt action.

“It appears the senior offices are not reviewing these matters on regular basis and not taking timely remedial measures as required… This calls for urgent action on the part of all CMDs, functional directors, and general managers,” said coal secretary Inder Jit Singh in a letter to Coal India.

A senior Coal India executive said this letter is part of regular correspondence from the ministry, asking Coal India to achieve targeted performance parameters.

The secretary has asked chairmen of Coal India and its subsidiaries to take immediate steps for achieving additional production capacity at mines during remaining part of current financial as well as beginning of next fiscal by obtaining necessary clearances in a time bound manner and resolving issues related to land etc.

The ministry is concerned that despite repeated instructions and reviews and even after the end of rainy season, coal production and supplies did not pick up to the extent necessary for achieving production and offtake target of 652.25 million tonnes and 681.20 million tonnes respectively. Progress of old stocks liquidation and over burden removal is also very slow and coal stocks at power plants are decreasing and number of critical and super critical plants are increasing.

Singh has also asked top bosses to frame a definite plan for producing one billion tonnes of coal per annum without any further delay.

“With a view to reduce our import dependence, supply of domestic coal has to increase iAmmediately.

This calls for ramping up of production with immediate effect so that production is increased to two million tonnes a day,” Singh said in the letter."

29,2018-10-13,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Seven companies including RKM PowerGen, Jaiprakash Associates and MB Power have secured contracts to supply 1,900 MW of power to five states.

Power Finance Corp Consulting Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of state-owned Power Finance Corp, awarded the contracts on Friday.

The companies, which also include Jindal India Thermal Power, IL&FS, Avantha Group’s Jhabua Power and SKS Power, will supply power to Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Bihar, West Bengal and Haryana, an official said.

Power purchase agreements (PPAs) with power distribution utilities of these states will be signed after receiving requisite clearances, the official added.

The seven power companies had in July quoted the lowest.`4.24 per unit price in the pilot auction scheme for plants stressed for want of power contracts.

The companies either have fuel supply agreements with state-run Coal India or have tie-ups for imported coal. The contracts will help the plants meet part of their debt obligations, sources close to the development said.



In the auctions, RKM Power-Gen’s Chhattisgarh-based coal project emerged as L1 with.`4.24/unit power supply for three years at state’s periphery.

Other bidders matched the lowest bid to win the contracts.

The pilot scheme assures minimum off-take of 55% of contracted capacity and the tariff will be fixed for three years without any escalation. The fixed cost for the PPA auction will be 1 paisa per unit. As per the tender, the distribution company would get additional discount of 1% in tariff on each 5% extra procurement over 55% of a project’s capacity.

The government had in April kicked off the pilot scheme for procurement of aggregate power of 2,500 MW with PFC Consulting Ltd as the nodal agency and PTC India as PPA aggregator. Initial bids were received for 2,200 MW from eight companies.

The scheme looks to address the issue of stressed assets. Lack of PPAs is one of the key reasons for stress in the power sector, besides factors such as promoters’ equity crunch, no coal supply, and regulatory and contractual issues. Electricity distribution companies have not called long-term contracts in the last few years."
30,2018-10-14,Coal India,"The government has asked Coal India Ltd and its subsidiaries to prioritise coal supply to state power producers like NTPC, leaving private electricity plants in a lurch, multiple sources said.

The coal ministry has directed CIL to prioritise the coal supply to select central and state government-owned power houses under the pretext of building coal stocks at these plants.

Following this, all subsidiaries of Coal India like South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) have been directed to supply coal to state power generators such as NTPC.

This has come at the cost of private power producers, who are running out of feedstock used to produce electricity.

Sources in private producers say rationally Coal India should give first priority to those plants having critical coal stocks. Next should come plants facing supplies below contractual obligations and then to most efficient plants, irrespective of ownership.

Preferential and priority distribution should not be limited to public sector, they said, adding that private power plants should not be discriminated against.

As per the sources, following the instruction from coal ministry, Coal India has its subsidiaries like SECL to supply 25 rakes per day of coal to NTPC's Korba, Mouda and Bhilai power plants and such other state power plants.

Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) has also accorded priority supplies to central public sector plants and WCL has been verbally instructed to supply coal to only Mahagenco (formerly known as Maharashtra State Electricity Board) plants.

As a result, SECL in October increased the supplies to state and central generating companies from an average 10 rakes per day (40,000 tonnes) to 17 rakes per day (68,000 tonnes) whereas for private power plants it has reduced from an average 10 rakes per day to only 6 rakes per day (24000 Tons).

Private power generators feel such priority supply only to state and central PSU electricity generating companies is discriminatory.

This discrimination based on ownership of assets puts into question the sanctity of level playing field and ease of doing business besides being bad in the eyes of law and equity, they said.

The move comes just when the festive season has started when power demand goes up. Also, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana will go to polls this year.

Also, power tariff in spot market have hit a record high past few days. In last week of September, spot electricity price touched nine year high of Rs 14.25 per unit and swelled further to Rs 18.20 in the first week of October on Indian Energy Exchange.

This spark in power tariff was attributed to inadequate coal supplies from Coal India, the sources said.

While domestic coal production during April-September has risen to 256 million tonnes from 232 million tonnes in the year ago period, increased power demand has meant that coal imports have also risen to 119 million tonnes from 105 million tonnes in April-September 2017.

Coal imports in September were 21 million tonnes as compared to 16 million tonnes a year ago.

On October 8, SECL wrote its operational heads that following a September 24 meeting chaired by Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, it has been decided to ""prioritize the supply of coal"" to 11 public sector generators including NTPC.

""You are kindly requested to prioritize the supplies to the plants (listed) so as to bring them at comfortable stock position irrespective of the overall allotments placed by SECL. The matter is of utmost importance, hence immediate and necessary attention is highly solicited from you end,"" it said."
32,2018-10-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: India may achieve about 76 per cent of the target of having 175 gigawatts of renewable power generation capacity by the scheduled date of 2022 as it faces myriad challenges, Wood Mackenzie said Monday.

India is targetting 100 GW of solar capacity and 75 GW of wind power by 2022.

""Even with significant cost declines, Wood Mackenzie expects about 76 per cent of the target to be met by 2022 and this would still be a noteworthy achievement,"" the world's leading research and consultancy firm said in a report.

Wood Mackenzie's solar analyst Rishab Shrestha said India faces a myriad of challenges in the renewables industry.

""The recent cancellation of auctions risks jeopardising investor confidence. Various duties on equipment and the associated uncertainty has led to a short-term uptick in solar prices. This leads to the knock-on effect on already cash-strapped state distribution companies who are showing an unwillingness to green light high priced solar projects,"" he said.

Nonetheless, the government's commitment and support towards renewables remain strong.

The government has been swift and adaptable at responding to various industry hurdles and are helping reduce project risks. As a result, renewable prices continue to remain competitive.

Wood Mackenzie said combined wind and solar capacity have almost doubled from 2014 levels to 61 GW this year.

""Driving this growth is the significant cost decline that auctions continue to deliver,"" Shrestha said. ""In the next five years, capital costs are expected to decline by 23 per cent for wind and 31 per cent for solar. This trend will only continue as new generation technologies replace old ones.""

Wood Mackenzie expected non-hydro renewables to make up 13 for per cent of power generation mix by 2023.

Improving grid flexibility through storage and flexible power generation will be extremely crucial in achieving high levels of renewable penetration, it said, adding that economic competitiveness, technological maturity, and financially healthy off-takers will provide a solid base for renewable capacity growth to cater to electricity demand growth.

""Over the longer-term horizon of 2040, India is forecasted to increase its renewable capacity by around seven times to 384 GW. This share will be driven by diverse sub-segments which include offshore wind, hybrid projects, floating solar and distributed solar. The 384 GW of non-hydro renewables will ultimately contribute 20 per cent of generation share by 2040,"" Shrestha said.

Wood Mackenzie, however, said coal remains principal energy driver in near term.

Its coal principal analyst Pralabh Bhargava said: ""We have increased India's imports for thermal coal from 158 million tonnes to 164 million tonnes in 2018 with a further upside risk of 3-4 million tonnes as coal stocks at Indian power plants and Coal India Ltd are at historically low levels"".

India's spot market prices, for both coal and power, are expected to remain strong in the coming months as continuous industrial production growth is pushing demand, while supply remains tight.

""Growth in domestic coal production and dispatches can only partially meet the growing demand for coal, which is resulting in increased reliance on imports. With a decade-low stockpile at Coal India's mines and more than half of the plants with a supercritical level of less than seven days' stock, the reliance on imported coal for several power plants will increase the flow of imports into India,"" Bhargava said.

Until recently, the demand for imported thermal coal was driven by non-utilities, where a lack of domestic supply and the need for high-energy coal kept the segment active in the seaborne market. With the power sector increasingly relying on imports, Wood Mackenzie expected the rally in Indian imports to continue till early next year.

It said industrial production in India has grown at an average of more than 7 per cent this year, leading to an increase in power generation by 6 per cent over January to August 2018.

Cement production was up 16 per cent and steel production 4 per cent for the same period.

""Policies to improve the power sector have started to have an impact. At the end of the financial year in March 2018, the performance of several states in reducing technical and commercial losses as well as increasing tariffs was improving. The government is looking to de-stress some power-generating units, which may result in improvements in load factors at several plants in the short-to-medium term,"" it said.

India's rupee depreciating against US dollar from an average of 63.65 to a US Dollar in January 2018 to 73.56 in the first week of October has increased the costs of imports and only the lack of domestic coal availability is forcing companies to import."

33,2018-10-16,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India claims to have increased supplies to the power sector by 9% between April 1 and October 12, but increased demand for coal has forced some 11,500 MW of generation capacity to remain idle for several days. Plants with a total of 17,780 MW capacity have stocks that won’t last a day, while another set of 3,300 MW has been lying idle due to lack of power purchase agreements.

In all, 66,579 MW of generation capacities including coal fuelled, nuclear as well as gas-based power plants are shut due to a combination of reasons including fuel shortage, technical issues and planned maintenance.

According to data from Central Electricity Authority (CEA), 30 stations with a coal fired power generation capacity of 28,824 MW are faced with critical stock position, which would last between a day to seven days for each plant.

Western India is worst hit with some 4,990 MW of generation capacity shut because of coal shortage, followed by southern India at 2,495 MW.

East and north have 2,910 MW and 1,100 MW respectively. Average stocks at power plants have dipped to six days from 10 days recently.

The new FSA tenure would be applicable from the fourth tranche of auction of coking coal linkages for the steel sector to be held shortly, Coal India said in a notice to its subsidiaries.

""In view of substantial investment required for setting up of coal washing capacity by the consumer and with the aim to reduce dependence of steel sector on imported coal further, the tenure of steel sector linkage auction FSAs (fuel supply agreements) has now been increased to 10 years, which would be mutually extendable by another five years,"" Coal India Ltd (CIL) said in the notice.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had earlier approved allocation of coal linkages for non-regulated sector only through auction.

Sectors included for the auction are cement, steel/sponge iron, aluminium, and others (excluding fertiliser, urea), the government had said.

Prior to auctions, the Standing Linkage Committee had been deciding on allocation of long-term and short-term linkages for the sectors, including power and steel.

According to ratings agency Crisil, in absolute terms, coking coal imports are expected to increase to 58 million tonnes (MT) in FY'23, from 47 MT in FY'18.

CIL accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal production."
38,2018-10-22,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has decided to offer an extra 5 million tonnes of coal to NTPC. It can be moved by road without paying any advances the company said in a statement on Monday. The decision has been taken to help NTPC curtail costly coal imports by NTPC.

“This will help NTPC boost power generation and build coal stock at its power stations. As against the normal supply term of ‘cash and carry’, the release of 5 million tonnes against this offer shall be made on credit basis without insisting for any advance payment and NTPC is to make payment after receipt of invoices. CIL has requested NTPC to immediately contact its subsidiaries to avail the benefit of this offer and to lift the coal within 30 days of release,” the company said in a statement.

Earlier in September, Coal India offered domestic coal to central and state power utilities as well as independent power plants, with the condition that they reduce import by proportionate quantities. Against this offer power producers opted to procure 7.94 lakh tonnes of coal per month from Coal India.

South Eastern Coalfields, the largest Coal India subsidiary, has offered to supply about 30% more coal than stipulated in the fuel supply agreement. This coal can be lifted by power producers through road and road-cum-rail modes.

Coal India claims that by prioritising supplies to power stations in East ensured enough generation to meet increased power demand during the just concluded Durga Puja festivals. Coal supplies to power sector dipped to 1.169 million tonnes per day during September due to rains and impact of cyclone Titli on coal production. It has now increased to 1.306 million tonnes per day during October.

With rains receding, Coal India is taking measures to ramp up coal production and raise supplies from November, 2018 onwards to meet requirements of power and non-power sectors."

43,2018-10-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The central government has identified nine coal blocks with total reserves of around 2 billion tonnes that may be auctioned to private players. It has also identified another set of nine blocks with total reserves of 1.1 billion tonnes for allotment to state-owned entities.

A committee, chaired by an additional secretary to identify coal blocks for allocation to different parties, has also proposed allotment of blocks for a state-owned fertiliser project in Odisha’s Talcher district and ultra-mega power projects in Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. The proposals were made last week.

The panel, which examined some 150-odd coal blocks, has decided to strike off 23 of them with total reserves of around 4 billion tonnes from this list since they cannot be mined due to insignificant reserves, difficult terrain, habitat or forest land.



Blocks recommended for auction include Dahegaon Dhapewada in Maharashtra with a total estimated reserve of 341.9 million tonnes spread across 28 square km. It is located under Western Coalfield’s Kamptee coalfileds and is currently under exploration.

The committee has also recommended auctioning Kunur coal block in West Bengal’s Ranigunj coalfields area under Eastern Coalfield’s leasehold area. It is estimated to hold a total reserve of 515 million tonnes and is an unexplored block spread over 11.3 square km.

The third block that may be auctioned is Mahuamilan in Jharkhand with a reserves of 210 million tonnes. This block, which is an unexplored one and is inside a forest, is spread over 6.7 square km and lies within Central Coalfield’s lease hold area.

Morga South A and B in Chhattisgarh holds an estimated 432.54 million tonnes of coal spread over 21.92 square km and is located under South Eastern Coalfield’s leasehold area. Although it lies within forest land it is a fully explored block, the committee feels the study of net present value of the block being undertaken by Coal India subsidiary, Central Mine Planning & Design Institute, may be expedited and considered for auction.

Other blocks in the list for proposed auction are Kalambi-Kalmeshwar with reserves of 97.46 million tonnes in Maharashtra and Phutamera and Meguli with reserves of 113 million tonnes and 63 million tonnes, respectively, in Chhattisgarh."
45,2018-10-26,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The successful allottees of the 19 coal blocks the government is planning to auction this fiscal for sectors including iron and steel will be allowed to sell up to 25 per cent of the actual production in open market at prices fixed by state-owned Coal India. ""The successful bidder shall utilise a minimum of 75 per cent of the actual production in the specified end use plants and is allowed to sell up to 25 per cent of the actual production in open market,"" according to the tender document for auction of coal mines for iron, steel, cement and captive power plants. 

When asked about the number of blocks to be auctioned, he said, ""Hopefully, 19 coal mines,"" a source said. 

Giving the break-up of blocks, the source said that of the 19 blocks, 13 mines would be auctioned in the sixth tranche for the regulated sectors, including iron and steel, cement aluminium, captive power plants. 

While in the seventh tranche, six coking coal blocks would be auctioned for iron and steel sector. 

""Obviously there is a demand for coal. The economy is growing and these sectors are also growing and coal is necessary input for them. So we cannot say right now that there is no demand for it. And we have not gone for any auction from almost last one-and-a-half years. So we thought that this is the right time when we should go for it. And the delays were mainly due to the changes which were to be made in tender conditions, and changes were suggested by the Pratyush Sinha Committee,"" the source said. 

""Two of the major changes which have been incorporated, first they (the allottees) will be able to sell 25 per cent of the raw coal in open market. Secondly the efficiency parameters have been relaxed. Now it has been extended to 66 months, earlier was 44. The reason is to give them more time to develop a mine. Because, the complaints generally were about environment clearance, forest clearance, and mining permissions were not forthcoming within stipulated time. So penalties were being imposed on them,"" the source said. 

When asked about the price the allottee can sell coal in the market, the source said, ""It will be at Coal India notified price. That will entail having more and more buyers."" 

 The mines to be put to auction in the sixth round include - Brahmpuri coal mine in Madhya Pradesh, Bundu, Gondulpara and Chitarpur in Jharkhand, Gondkhari and Marki Mangli IV in Maharashtra, Jaganathpur A and Jaganathpur B in West Bengal, Bhaskarpara, Gare Palma IV -1 and Sondiha in Chhattisgarh, Jamkhani in Odisha. 

 While in the seventh tranche the blocks are Brahmadiha, Choritand Tiliaya, Jogeshwar& Khas Jogeshwar, Rabodih OCP, Rohne in Jharkhand and Urtan North in Madhya Pradesh. 

 Both rounds of auction are likely to be over by January 15, next year."
44,2018-10-26,Coal India,"BHUBANESWAR: The Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) has set a target to increase its Angul plant's capacity to 20 mtpa by 2030, a top company official said today.

This was revealed by JSPL chairman Navin Jindal, who earlier in the day met Odisha steel and mines secretary R K Sharma here.

""We have plans to invest additional Rs 50,000 crore for enhancing the Angul plant's capacity from 6 mtpa to 20 mtpa in next 12 years,"" Jindal told reporters.

He said this time there would be not much borrowing as the company has decided to make investment from internal sources as well from equity shares from strategic investors.

""We will embark upon a new journey from 2021 to increase the Angul plant's capacity from 6 mtpa to 20 mtpa by 2030. The Centre has set a target to produce 300 mtpa steel by 2030-31 and we will also contribute to it,"" Jindal said.

He said the company has prepared the road map for enhancing the capacity of its Angul plant.

Claiming that JSPL's Angul plant has been doing very well, Jindal said the company was hopeful of producing 3 lakh metric tonne of hot metal in November, 2018 and 4 lakh metric tonne per month by March next year. He, however, admitted that the production at its Angul plant was affected due to month- long rainfall in the area.

Asked about the challenges in setting up of steel industries in the state, Jindal said availability of adequate coal and high price of iron ore are major hurdles before the steel industries.

However, Jindal maintained that despite the acute shortage of coal and iron ore at times, the company will move ahead with its mission to achieve the target.

He said that India is the fifth largest reserve of non-coking coal. Therefore, coal availability should not be a problem here. But, many steel plants face coal shortage. It is responsibility of Coal India to ensure that industries get their required dry fuel, he said.

Jindal said the state and the Central government should ensure that more iron ore was produced which would help normalise the price of raw material."
46,2018-10-28,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Finance Ministry is planning to launch a global exchange traded fund (ETF) with a view to attracting long-term investment from overseas large pension fund houses.

The new ETF, which will be constituted after studying the appetite of large investors, is being planned for launch in the next financial year, an official said.

Initially, the ministry was planning to list Bharat-22 ETF in the overseas market but decided not to go ahead with it as investors expressed apprehensions over the cost associated with hedging and currency conversion.

""The target is to tap the untapped investors, which is the large overseas pension funds. A new ETF is being thought of which will be constituted based on the sectors for which these investors show their interest,"" the official told PTI.

The official further said that the CPSEs in which there is substantial scope for further dilution of government equity, like where promoter holding is above 58-60 per cent, will be included in the proposed ETF for global listing.

The government has listed two exchange-traded funds -- CPSE ETF and Bharat-22 ETF-- on the domestic stock exchanges. ETFs function like a mutual fund scheme and have underlying assets of government-owned companies.

The government has already raised Rs 22,900 crore through two tranches of Bharat-22 ETF and Rs 11,500 crore through three tranches of CPSE ETF.

Launched in 2017-18, the Bharat 22 ETF, consist of 16 central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), three PSU banks and three private sector companies ITC, L&T and Axis Bank where Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) holds a stake. Bharat-22 ETF basket is diversified and there should be investor demand in the overseas market, the official added.

Technical outlookNifty50 made a smart rebound to settle above 10,250 mark today, forming a long bullish candle on the daily chart. The index needs to take out 10,290 level to instil confidence in the market. There is a possibility that the index can form an ‘Expanded Flat’ structure, in which case the pullback can stretch higher, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan. 

Alternatively, Nifty can take form of a Wedge pattern. “In that case the market can continue to be volatile with overall downward bias. From short-to-medium term perspective, the weight of evidence is still in favour of the bears with the possibility for Nifty to tumble back to 10,000-9,952,” the expert said. 


Global sentiment improvedAfter recent drubbings, global stocks improved on Monday as reports of positive earnings and Standard & Poor's decision to leave Italy's sovereign rating unchanged boosted sentiment. European shares opened in positive territory on Monday in a tentative rebound from a sell-off, Reuters reported. UK's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and French CAC 40 climbed up to 1 per cent. 


Crude oil easedGlobal crude prices eased today, bogged down by the rise in the dollar and concerns of slowing demand owing to weak economic growth. However, the prospects of a tight supply looms after US sanctions on Iran crude exports kicks in. The market is expecting an increased supply from Saudi Arabia as it has promised to keep the oil market adequately supplied. Benchmark Brent Crude and WTI Crude fell nearly half-a-percent.

50,2018-10-30,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Domestic coal supply remains significantly short of the domestic demand, on the back of a strong recovery in power demand, lower hydropower generation in the current fiscal, as well as a healthy growth in production levels from non-regulated consuming sectors like cement, aluminium said ICRA in a recent statement.

This is despite Coal India achieving a double-digit production growth of 10.6% during the first six months of the current fiscal, a feat which has not been seen in recent history, the rating agency said in its statement.

Notwithstanding this healthy growth, on September 30, 22 non-pithead power plants had less than 7 days of coal stock. As per an ICRA report, during the just concluded monsoon season, domestic coal production growth slowed down to 3.8% and 3.2% in September and August of 2018 respectively, against 10.6% in July 2018 and 13.2% in June 2018, leading to coal stocks at power plants steadily deteriorating from a high of 21.1 million tonnes in end-July 2018 to an estimated 15.8 million tonnes in end-September 2018.

Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president, and group head - corporate sector ratings at ICRA, said: “Given the tightness in domestic coal availability, and the healthy demand from coal consuming sectors, spot e-auction premia have reached 102% in September 2018, surpassing the level of 95% reached during October 2017, when coal stocks at power plants were at their lowest levels. With Coal India’s pithead stock running critically low at around 18.4 million tonnes as on September 30, 2018, against a much higher level of 55.5 million tonnes as on March 31, 2018, the central miner’s ability to stage a quick recovery in production levels after the monsoon would remain critical to close the gap between coal demand and supply.”

On the back of coal stocks at many power plants remaining critical, despatches to the power sector has consequently taken a higher priority, growing at a stronger pace of 9.6% year-on-year during the first six months of FY2019, compared to a Y-o-Y growth of just 2.8% in despatches to the non-regulated sectors during the same period.

Domestic coal shortage has led to rising thermal coal imports by end-users in the non-regulated sectors in the last one year, increasing from 75.1 million tonnes in H1 FY2018 to 84.7 million tonnes in H1 FY2019, and accounting for around 68% of the incremental thermal coal imports during this period.

“Apart from rising import dependence, a steep increase of over 25% in seaborne thermal coal prices during the current fiscal thus far, a sharp depreciation of the rupee, and rising spot e-auction coal prices are estimated to have led to a 20-34% rise in coal costs between April 2018 and October 2018 for a player depending entirely on e-auction and/or imported coal, with the extent of increase depending on the mix between domestic vs. imported coal, as well as the grade of coal consumed,” said Roy.

ICRA believes that over medium to long term, a major thrust towards CIL’s coal production is expected to come from the coalfields of North Karanpura (in Jharkhand), Mand-Raigarh (in Chhattisgarh), Korba – Gevra (in Chhattisgarh), Talcher (in Odisha), and Ib Valley (in Odisha).

However, given the logistical bottlenecks in some of these mine clusters, development of eight rail corridors remains critical, as these railway lines can support incremental coal evacuation of over 350 million tonne per annum from these clusters.

Among these eight-railway links, benefits are expected to flow-in from only two links in the near term. These include the 52.41 km Jharsuguda-Barpalli-Sardega line, which has been commissioned recently, and 44.37 km Tori-Shivpur line, which is expected to be commissioned in March 2019.

These two railway lines can evacuate a total of over 100 million tonnes of coal a year from mines in Odisha and Jharkhand. Progress of the remaining six railway links has been limited thus far, and this is expected to remain a bottleneck in the development of several large expansion projects of Coal India, which could take the central miner closer to its stated aspirational goal of reaching one billion tonne of coal production."
51,2018-10-30,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The centre has decided to sell 3% in Coal India through an offer for sale with a green shoe option to sell another 6% to financial institutions and retail investors at a floor price of Rs 266 per share.

It will allow Coal India to conform to the minimum public holding norm of 25% and help the government raise a minimum of Rs 4421.5 crore at the base price. In case the total green shoe option is exercised the government may be able to raise a minimum of Rs 9.907 crore. For a total 9% stake the centre may be able to raise a minimum of Rs 14,328.5 crore.

Employees of Coal India would be receiving a 5% discount on the offer price hence the minimum amount is likely to be around Rs 14,000 crore, a Coal India executive said.

At present centre holds 78.32% in Coal India which is 3.32% short of the 25% mandatory public holding mark. This 3.32% in the company needs to be divested by the government in order to comply.

“The norm required Coal India’s public holding to be at least 25% by August 21 this year. However, the deadline was recently extended by two years,” said a senior Coal India executive.

The original deadline for complying with the 25% public holding norm was August 21 last year. Looking at a dull stock market during 2017 the government decided to skip the last round of divestment in Coal India as its scrip price had dipped significantly making it impossible to fetch the sum it was planning to. Initial plans included divesting between 5% and 10% by August 2017 and it was looking at raising Rs 20,000 crore in the process."

China is considering a tax cut to revive its flagging automotive market, lending support to a key industry that’s been damaged by an ongoing trade war with the US, Bloomberg reported. 

The move is expected to bolster the automobile market which has taken a hit as the consumer spending declined in the wake of a trade war between world's two largest economies- the US and China.

Shares of Motherson Sumi Systems (up 5.97 per cent), Tata Motors (up 1.91 per cent), Mahindra & Mahindra (up 1.88 per cent) and Balkrishna Industries (up 1.80 per cent) witnessed decent traction.

Bharat Forge (up 1.36 per cent), Exide Industries (up 0.93 per cent), Apollo Tyres (up 0.70 per cent), Bajaj Auto (up 0.68 per cent) and Ashok Leyland (up 0.48 per cent), too, were in the green.

The BSE Auto index was trading 0.8 per cent up at 19784.67 around 09:35 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was down 21 points at 10,230, while the BSE Sensex was 70 points down at 33,997. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 23 were trading in the green, while 27 were in the red. 

In the Sensex basket of stocks, 19 stocks were declining and 12 were advancing.

69,2018-10-31,Coal India,"In the first big ticket disinvestment of the current fiscal — Coal India share sale kicked off for a smooth sail Wednesday as institutional investors put in bids worth Rs 4,300 crore and over-subscribed the shares reserved for them.

Of the 14.89 crore share on offer, institutional investors put in bids for 15.84 crore shares or 1.06 times the shares reserved for institutional buyers, as per data available with NSE.

Officials said the domestic mutual funds and insurance companies invested heavily in the offer for sale (OFS) on Wednesday, which was the first day of the two day share sale.

""Bids worth Rs 4,300 crore has been put by institutional buyers,"" officials said.

The share sale will on Thursday open for retail investors, who would be offered a 5 per cent discount. These investors can bid for shares worth up to Rs 2 lakh.

The government is selling over 18.62 crore shares or 3 per cent in Coal India Ltd (CIL) at a floor price of Rs 266 apiece. If fully subscribed, it will fetch the government Rs 5,000 crore.

""A Rs 5,000 crore successful OFS in this volatile and subdued market will help in uplifting investor sentiment in broader market,"" officials said.

Coal India scrip slipped to a low of Rs 263.80 apiece during intra-day trade. The scrip closed down 3.73 per cent over previous close on the BSE at Rs 265.60 -- below the floor price of the OFS.

The BSE benchmark Sensex ended 550.92 points up at 34,442.

On top of the 3 per cent stake sale, the government also has an option to retain an over-subscription of another 6 per cent stake in the CIL OFS.

If the additional 6 per cent stake or 37.24 crore shares are put on the block, then the government could get a further about Rs 10,000 crore. Taken together, the 9 per cent stake sale in CIL could fetch around Rs 15,000 crore to the government.

The floor price of Rs 266 a share was at a discount of nearly 4 per cent or Rs 11 a share over Tuesday's closing price of CIL scrip on the NSE.

The government had last sold 10 per cent stake in CIL through an OFS in January 2015. It had then mopped up about Rs 23,000 crore.

The government currently holds 78.32 per cent stake in Coal India.

It has already raised over Rs 10,028 crore through PSU stake sale, including by way of follow on offer of Bharat-22 ETF, and initial public offering of four PSUs -- RITES, IRCON, Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd (MIDHANI) and Garden Reach Shipbuilders.

The stake sale in Coal India will help the government move forward towards the Rs 80,000 crore disinvestment target in current fiscal."

Oil Prices Move up After 3 Days
Oil prices climbed for the first time in three days on Wednesday, but rising supply and fears over the outlook for demand amid the US-China trade war kept pressure on the market.

54,2018-10-31,Coal India,"Samvat 2074 — the period from last Diwali to this — has been a tough year for investors with the stock market tumbling from their highs. In the past year, the Sensex has risen 2.5 per cent while BSE’s mid- and small-cap indices have declined 14 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. Many smaller shares have fallen as much as 50-70 per cent from their highs, eroding the value of several portfolios. The next few months are likely to be challenging as well. In such an environment, it would be prudent to hold stocks that could stay resilient in testing times. ET spoke to five brokerages for their top picks for Samvat 2075:


Axis Securities

Mold-Tek PackagingImproved volume outlook from Paints and Food & FMCG customers with growing pie of F&F aiding strong margin delivery. We believe, with rising contribution from F&F segment, better off-take from paints sector, full scale operationalization of RAK plant, new product launches and consistent increase in share of IML products, MTEP can report 31 per cent earnings CAGR over FY 2018-20. We revise our estimates and assign it a 20 times PE basis FY20E EPS.


TridentThe company is the flagship company of Trident Group, with business interests in home textiles and paper. The company is trusted partner to the top global retailers & fashion houses adding premium customers globally present in USA, UK, Italy, France, Japan, Australia amongst other countries. Company is in process to reduce its debt burden thus making its balance sheet lighter. The net debt/equity ratio is already at 0.7 and the net debt stands at Rs 2,000 cr with LT debt at Rs 1,539 crore at the end of Q2FY19. We expect the return ratios to improve as debt falls and efficiency parameters improve.


Titan
While, we are cognizant of rich valuations for consumer and retail stocks, we believe these will continue to sustain the premium levels for companies offering highest visibility of earnings growth over medium to longer term. Revenue growth opportunity of 20 per cent CAGR over the long term is immense and far superior to peers. Further, with an up-trending margin profile driven by growing revenue from SSSG makes us believe in the structural growth outlook of Titan.


HDFC Securities

Cummins India
The company is well placed to capture the broad revival in industrial and infrastructure capex in India, with its bestin-class product portfolio, wide distribution reach, and technological leadership. With the kind of technological leadership CIL has in the Indian market, along with a healthy balance sheet and strong parentage, it deserves a premium over its peers in terms of valuation. We feel investors could buy the stock and add on dips to Rs 597–605 for a target of Rs 817.


Cyient
A niche engineering services, strong client relationships, timely acquisitions to support its roduct solutions profile, strong financial profile with minimal debt, and healthy debt protection metrics and liquidity makes a case for investment in its stock. It has some deals in the negotiation phase, and the overall deal pipeline remains good. We feel investors could buy the stock at the LTP and add on dips to Rs 545–555 (11x FY20E EPS) for a target of Rs 748 (15x FY20E EPS).


Hindustan Oil Exploration
The company is debt free, with net cash balances of Rs 35 cr and Rs 53 cr invested in its subsidiary. Over the next two years, company expects significant ramp up in volumes which would ensure growth visibility going ahead. Given strong management, a robust balance sheet and stellar growth expected over the next two-three years, we recommend buy at Rs 130, and add on dips to Rs 108 with a target price of Rs 177 till next Diwali.




IIFL

Petronet LNG
The company is set to benefit from 17 per cent capacity expansion at Dahej terminal to 17.5 mmt by FY 2019 from current 15mmt. We expect revenue and PAT CAGR of 16 per cent and 19 per cent over FY 2018-20 respectively. The stock trades at 10.8 times FY 2020 estimated EPS with discount valuation to its 3-year average. We recommend Buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 256.


Mindtree
India’s eighth largest IT services company has strong digital capabilities. The stock has corrected almost 30 per cent since Sep’18 and trades at attractive valuations vs. peers despite better revenue and EPS growth profile. In our view, the correction has factored in the concerns related to recent softness/macros and we reckon that Mindtree is likely to outperform peers like LTI, Mphasis and Hexaware.


Motherson Sumi
The company has successfully acquired / integrated 21 companies till date. Hence, it is set to achieve FY 2020 estimated revenue target of $18bn. At current market price, Motherson Sumi trades at 15 times FY 2020 estimated EPS and we believe the recent correction is overdone. We expect consolidated revenue, EBITDA and PAT to register 16 per cent, 29 per cent and 47 per cent CAGR respectively over FY 2018-20. We value MSSL at 18 times FY 2020 EPS and recommend Buy with a target price of Rs 293.

Motilal Oswal

ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank reported better than expected set of numbers for Q2FY19. ICICI is in the midst of an improvement in the operating environment and is showing healthy signs of earnings normalization. With challenges related to management transition getting addressed, the bank is now focusing on growing its core operating profits.


Britannia Industries
Rapidly expanding distribution, continuing investment in R&D, rapid pace of new launches and significant expansion of its own manufacturing indicate the immense confidence that management has on growth prospects. Opportunity beyond biscuits is also substantially high. Continuing premiumization, significant incremental cost savings and a favorable commodity cost outlook mean further EBITDA margin expansion prospects are bright as well.


Exide Industries
OEM and replacement demand remains healthy in both automotive and industrial segments. Also, there is a gradual shift away from unorganised to organised players. We believe that the battery industry should benefit the most and grow at a CAGR of 10-12 per cent over the medium-to-long term. We expect Exide to continue gaining market share, backed by new product launches for existing and new applications, and a sharp focus on customer service and marketing infrastructure.


Religare Broking

Asian Paints
The Indian paints industry is estimated to grow at a healthy pace of 13 per cent CAGR over the next two years. Further, the recent rationalization in the GST rates in paints could benefit the organized players in the long run. Moreover improved product mix and operating leverage should provide cushion to margins which would mitigate concern of rising crude oil price. We estimate revenue and PAT to grow by 10.9 per cent & 12.2 per cent CAGR respectively over FY 2018-20, driven by steady capacity addition, wide distribution reach and continued efforts towards innovative launches.


Ashok LeylandWe believe Ashok Leyland stands to benefit from the upcycle in the commercial vehicle industry given its strong position in the M&HCV and LCV segment. Further, implementation of BS-VI emissions norms from April 2020 would also lead to pre-purchases in H2FY20. Further, the proposed implementation of CV scrappage policy reduces concerns of volume growth post FY20 as it is likely to create an additional demand of ~2-2.5 lakh vehicles. We believe with positive industry growth prospects and Ashok Leyland’s strong brand presence in the CV segment and its focus on diversifying to less cyclical businesses makes it one of our preferred picks.


Godrej Consumer
Led by demand uptick and company led initiatives towards constant focus on product innovation, increasing penetration & distribution reach and sustained brand building efforts, we estimate GCPL’s consolidated Revenue and PAT to grow by 12.8 per cent & 16.8 per cent CAGR respectively over FY18-20E. Improving mix and cost efficiency measures should result in steady margin gains. Strong brand equity, low leverage, robust cash flows and healthy dividend pay-outs justify premium valuation. We recommend a Buy on the stock with target price of Rs 897."

67,2018-10-31,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks overcame an early hiccup as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 2 per cent in a session that was marked by high volatility.

The 30-share BSE index signed off October with a gain of 551 points, or 1.63 per cent, at 34,442. The session was so choppy that the index saw a swing of as much as 876 points during the day. 

The NSE Nifty shut shop at 10,386.60, up 188 points, or 1.85 per cent. 

Both indices had moved into negative terrain early during the day, only to reverse losses after the government softened its stance amid its ongoing tussle with the RBI.

IT and financial stocks were the largest contributors to the index's rally.

In the 30-share BSE pack, HDFC, with gains of 5.51 per cent, was the best performer. It was followed by IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Axis Bank, YES Bank and Sun Pharma, which rose 3-4 per cent.

Coal India was the worst laggard. Tata Steel, Maruti, Adani Ports, Kotak Bank and Power Grid were among other losers.

In the Nifty sectoral indices, all indices barring Nifty Media ended the session in the positive terrain.

Let's see what all drove market optimism today.

1. Govt blinks, says RBI autonomy essential
The government on Wednesday toned down its approach, saying it respects the central bank’s autonomy as it sought to calm investors worried about a growing public brawl. This came as an assurance for the stocks and the rupee that were hit this morning when reports about a possible resignation by RBI Governor Urjit Patel surfaced.

2. Firmness in global stocks
Global stocks ended a tumultuous October on a positive note which in turn buoyed investor sentiment back home. October was a grim month for investors across the globe as worries over the Sino-US trade, global economic growth, higher US interest rates and company earnings kept investors on the edge.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1 per cent, drawing support from gains on Wall Street overnight, Reuters reported.

3. Rupee recovers
The domestic rupee recovered after breaching the 74-mark against the dollar and was at 73.93 at the time of writing this report. The domestic unit clawed back 26 paise from the day's lows on signs of easing tension between the government and the RBI.

4. IT, financials in a sweet spot
Buying emerged in IT and financial stocks on Wednesday. The Nifty IT index surged over 4 per cent with all constituents settling in the green. The Nifty Financials rose over 2 per cent with Indiabulls Housing Finance leading the charge. 


Expert-speak (Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services)

""After a volatile start, the market sharply rebounded led by clarity over independence of RBI by the government. The rupee pared some losses while strong global cues and stock specific actions supported the market to remain positive. Signs of rising oil supply and gradual consolidation in yield may ease liquidity concerns. However, the focus will be more on the results outcome as there is a fear of further downgrade in earnings in H2FY19."""
52,2018-10-31,Coal India,"Successful bidders in the current round of coal block auction will be allowed to sell their production beyond 100% of their planned capacity to Coal India at a 15% discount on the state-owned company’s notified price for the power sector.

According to the bid document published last week, a successful bidder has to use 75% of its actual production for captive consumption. The next 25% can be sold in the open market. If the block operator produces more than 100% of planned production, it needs to be sold to Coal India. However, the excess production cannot be more than 50% of the planned production.

“The government has left the process of fixing prices for coal to be sold in open market on block operators and did not stipulate any price discovery mechanism,” said a senior coal sector executive familiar with the development. “They are open to auctioning or selling it at a pre-determined price. It will not require paying any extra to the government,” the person told ET."
68,2018-10-31,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: A government move to assure RBI about its autonomy calmed the nerves of investors on Dalal Street on Wednesday, which helped lift benchmarks Sensex and Nifty with decent gains. 

The market had developed cold feet in early trade, on reports of an aggravating spat between the government and central bank. Media reports indicated RBI Governor Urjit Patel might resign if Section 7 of RBI Act is invoked to transfer reserves. 
However, the government, sensing the nervousness in the market, clarified that it respects RBI’s autonomy and recognises its essentiality in governance. 

The market heaved a sigh of relief and started building on the gains thereafter. Sensex settled with a strong gain of 551 points, or 1.63 per cent, at 34,442, while Nifty rose 188 points, or 1.85 per cent, to finish at 10,386.

The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices extended gains into the third consecutive session, ending higher by 1.56 per cent and 1.38 per cent, respectively.

However, despite Wednesday’s gains, October proved to be the worst month for benchmark Sensex since February 2016, having lost 1,785 points or 4.93 per cent.


Let’s take a look at today’s highlights:

Who moved my SensexWith a 5.78 per cent gain, HDFC emerged as the top gainer in the Sensex pack, followed by IndusInd Bank (up 4.47 per cent), which snapped losses of four consecutive sessions.

Overall, nine stocks including Coal India, Tata Steel, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid Corporation, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp and HDFC Bank settled in the red in the Sensex pack.

Rs 1.93 lakh crore added to investor wealthWednesday’s market rally boosted investors’ wealth by nearly Rs 1.93 lakh crore on BSE. The cumulative wealth of investors shot up to Rs 1,38,45,109 crore from Rs 1,36,52,148 crore on the previous day. 


Earnings updatesLupin reported a 41.25 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in September quarter profit at Rs 268.45 crore, which was largely in line with a Rs 273 crore estimate projected by analysts in an ET Now poll. Shares of the company settled 1.42 per cent higher at Rs 888 on BSE. 

FMCG major Dabur India reported a 4.10 per cent rise in consolidated profit at Rs 377.55 crore for the second quarter, helped by growth of the core business in the domestic market. But the numbers failed to impress the market and the stock fell 2.41 per cent to Rs 385.40 on BSE.

Adani Enterprises reported a 192 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated profit at Rs 172 crore for September quarter. The stock inched up 0.68 per cent to Rs 170.15. 


Coal India fell as FPO openedShares of Coal India extended losses to the second session, falling 3.53 per cent to Rs 266.15 on BSE as an FPO to divest 9 per cent stake opened. The divestment plan is expected to fetch the Centre about Rs 14,000 crore at floor price, including a greenshoe option. 


BSE metals index only sectoral loserThe metals pack emerged the lone loser among the sectoral indices on BSE. The index settled 1.40 per cent down at 12,524, dragged by Coal India, Tata Steel, Hindalco, SAIL, Nalco, Hindustan Zinc and NMDC. 


141 stocks showed potential upsideAs many as 141 stocks, including Axis Bank, Vedanta, Tech Mahindra, Ujjivan Financial, Aurobindo Pharma, Biocon, HCL Technologies and Greaves Cotton, showed bullish crossovers on BSE, as per the momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence or MACD. On the flip side, Coal India, Hindustan Zinc, Power Grid Corporation, Sacheta Metals, Asahi India Glass and Star Cement featured among the 28 stocks that showed bearish crossovers.


Overbought & oversold stocksMomentum oscillator Relative Strength Index or RSI showed 63 stocks in the oversold zone on BSE. Kwality, Dolphin Medical, Atlas Jewellery, Bharat Road Network, Supreme Petro, Hinduja Ventures and Esaar were among the stocks that entered the oversold zone. 

Meanwhile, Mideast Portfolio Management, Pushpanjali Floriculture, Chambal Breweries & Distilleries, Orient Tradelink and Spicy Entertainment were among 24 stocks that entered the overbought zone. 


Spurt in open interestWith a 101 per cent change, Coal India witnessed the biggest spurt in open interest on BSE, followed by Cummins India (87.58 per cent), Syndicate Bank (34.38 per cent), Torrent Power (29.37 per cent) and Tata Global Beverages (22.18 per cent).


200 stocks hit lower circuitManpasand Beverages, Vakrangee, Kwality, 8K Miles Software Services and Magadh Sugar & Energy were among 200 stocks that hit lower circuits on BSE, while 164 stocks including Edelweiss Financial Services, Hindoostan Mills, Sun Retail, Bombay Dyeing and Birla Cable hit upper circuits. 


Britannia, Cummins top 200-DMABritannia, Cummins, Torrent Power, Aarti Drugs, Seamec and Astral Poly Technik traded above their 200 DMA. On the other hand, Just Dial, Bharat Gears, Hind Rectifiers and Berger Paints witnessed negative breakouts and traded below their 200 DMA.


Call/put writingNifty managed to breach its immediate hurdle at 10,280 and settled with decent gains. Maximum Put open interest was at 10,000 followed by 10,200 while maximum Call OI was at 10,700 followed by 11,000. Put writing was seen at strike price 10,200 followed by 10,300 while minor Call unwinding was seen at all immediate strike prices. 


Technical viewThe Nifty formed a large bullish bar at the end of the day. The hourly chart shows that the index today formed an inverted H&S pattern & broke out on the upside. The benchmark index also achieved the conservative pattern target on the upside. The larger picture shows that the volatility can continue going ahead & it can result into a wedge pattern formation. The recent bounce back seems to be a part of the unfolding pattern. Hence, the bounce is unlikely to develop into a larger structure on the upside. On the higher side, 10,440 shall be the key hurdle where the bears can look to come back. Overall, the Nifty is expected to test the crucial support zone of 10,000-9,952 in the short term, said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, senior technical analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

15,2018-11-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Supply of coal by state-owned CIL to the power sector registered a decline of 8.5 per cent to 253 million tonnes in the April-October period of this fiscal.

Fuel supply by Coal India in the year-ago period was 276.8 million tonnes (MT), according to official data.

The supply of coal to power sector by CIL in October dropped by 19.3 per cent to 33.8 MT, over 41.9 MT in October last fiscal.

With torrential rains hitting coal production, Coal India had said that it was keeping a close watch on the current situation to ensure smooth supplies to power plants.

CIL saw its output decline by 6 per cent to 241 MT in April-September on account of monsoon.

""CIL is gearing up to regain its production tempo and keep coal supplies to power sector going after the torrential rainfall across its subsidiaries dealt a crippling blow to the company's coal production and offtake,"" the company had said in a statement.

CIL had said that a team of officials is closely monitoring coal supplies to power plants and is working on plans to divert coal to fuel-starved plants.

The state-owned firm had earlier said that it will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year.

The PSU will further produce 1 billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi had said.

The PSU is currently given the target of producing 660 million tonnes of coal amounting to 82 per cent of the country's coal output.

Joshi had said that with the demand for power rising steeply, there is enough opportunity for both government and private sectors to produce coal without adversely impacting each other."
13,2018-11-22,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Indian boards are seem to be meeting slightly more frequently than they were earlier. The median number of meetings for 91 of the BSE 100 companies was seven in fiscal 2019, compared with six in FY18 as well as five years earlier in FY15, as per data from Bloomberg. Five was the most common number for board meetings held by the companies in the year ended March 31, 2019.

Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have a higher frequency of board meetings. The median number for the 16 PSUs in BSE100 index was 13, compared with 11 in FY15. Coal India topped the list with 21 board meetings in the last fiscal year ended March 31. The company’s board had met seven times in FY15.

Incidentally, the sitting fees for independent directors of PSUs is Rs 40,000 - around one-third of the statutory limit of Rs 1 lakh. ICICI Bank is the only privatesector company on the list of top 10 companies, with 18 board meetings in FY19. The bank’s board had met seven times in FY15. Incidentally, a dozen companies have had a sharp year-on-year surge in the frequency of their board meetings in FY19. This list is dominated by banks, with ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank featuring among these dozen companies. Banks have been under increased scrutiny of the regulators and investors, warranting a higher engagement for their boards. Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Larsen & Toubro, HCL Technologies and REC are the other companies on this list.


Agencies
In the case of nearly half of the 91 companies, a positive correlation was found between the frequency of board meetings and their stock performance. The boards of companies that are performing well typically meet more frequently compared with the opposite group. For instance, pharma companies Cipla, Lupin and Sun Pharma have witnessed a gradual decline in the number of their board meetings over the past five years as industry headwinds pressed along. The board of Indiabulls Housing Finance met nine times five years ago, but only five times in FY19. Likewise, Piramal Enterprises had eight board meetings in FY18, but that dropped to five in FY19. Housing finance business has come under pressure in the recent years.

Ten of the BSE 100 companies have conducted only four meetings in FY19 - the minimum needed to comply with the Companies Act 2013. Most companies on this list, such as Godrej Consumer Products, Page Industries, Lupin, Hero MotoCorp, Bharat Forge and JSW Steel, have been under performing in the past couple of years. To be sure, the median frequency of board meetings in India Inc is akin to that in the US. As per the Spencer Stuart 2018 S&P 500 Board Index, the median number of board meetings was seven for the year ended May 2018. A majority of S&P 500 company boards met on an average of six-nine times annually."
14,2018-11-22,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) plans to check illegal mining and pilferage with the use of drones, which it has tested in a pilot project.

Its exploration arm, Central Mine Planning & Design Institute, recently tied up with Centre for Aerospace Research, Anna University of Chennai, for drone technology.

“A pilot project was undertaken at Coal India subsidiary, Central Coalfields’ Topa Mine where drones successfully tracked sources of illegal mining as well as the route being followed by them to take away pilfered coal,” a Coal India executive told ET.

“In a recent meeting with CMPDI executives, secretary coal directed for implementation of drone technology in identified 35 top coal producing mines of Coal India with a focus on prevention of illegal mining activities, land reclamation monitoring. It was further directed to identify other applicable areas for drone technology,” he said.

The executive said the number of drones for each subsidiary of Coal India would depend on their command area and surveillance drones are not too costly and can capture such data successfully. For example, Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL) may require two, while South Eastern Coalfields may require more, he said. At present, CIL is using drones for survey of blocks and for preparing mining and expansion plans, he said. Small operators steal coal from operating and abandoned mines, carry them in cycles and bullock carts to a central location where it is sold at a throwaway price. The coal collected there is then loaded on trucks and a large volume of this coal finds its way to the coal mandis where it is sold at half of Coal India’s notified price.

Coal from mines allotted in the past but taken back by the government is also pilfered. “Here dumper, shovels and pay-loaders are being used on a large-scale to illegally mine coal,” a coal sector official said.

There are no comprehensive study on illegal mining, but a study by Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) in 2000 showed that brick kilns used 22 million tonnes of coal while Coal India could have supplied only 2 million tonnes.

“E-auction was introduced with the aim of cutting down on the illegal market,” former Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya said.

“It has reduced the market to some extent but could not wipe it out.”"
16,2018-11-23,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India has managed to command a premium of 62% premium over notified prices for coal sold through spot e-auctions conducted in October. During September the company managed to fetch 82% premium over notified prices for spot e-auctions.

For the period April-October, the company managed to command a premium of 67% over its notified prices on an average.

At special forward e-auction for the power sector, Coal India managed to sell coal at a premium of 39% over notified prices in October. For the April-October period, the company managed to command an average premium of 32% over notified prices.

There exclusive auction for the non-power sector, Coal India managed to command a premium of 32% for both October and the period April-October.

This year, Coal India intends to ramp up auction offerings by 14% against the previous year when similar supplies declined 5%. This year Coal India has decided to auction 137 million tonnes of coal which would include long term supply contract auctions, spot e-auctions and forward e-auctions.

Last year, the dry fuel supplier offered 120 million tonnes through similar auctions which was a 5% drop compared to the previous year (2017-18). Increased offerings this year is expected to bring down premiums which touched 92% in the spot market last year as availability through spot e-auctions had dwindled almost 38% among other reasons like higher international coal prices and Rupee depreciation.

Last year unforeseen demand from power generators forced Coal India to send them additional coal as the sector was grappling with dwindling inventory and many power plants were stranded with critical coal stocks. Last year, premiums for special forward e-auction for power and special spot e-auction was 72% while exclusive e-auction for non-power fetched 58% premium. The number of critical plants had touched 29 in October last year while stocks and dipped to 6 million tonnes."
17,2018-11-23,Coal India,"Three meetings, two hotels, one city. These were crucial to an eight-month-long investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2010 and 2011 to expose a cartel in India’s cement industry, which resulted in a penalty of Rs 6,317 crore, the regulator’s highest in a single case to date.

The CCI has since carried out many probes into alleged anti-competitive agreements and companies’ abuse of their dominant position, but it is still best known for the cement cartel case mainly because of the eye-popping fine. It is nearly half of the Rs 13,523 crore the CCI levied in 135 cases till March 2018, according to the latest data available with the regulator. Of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 55 crore, or 0.4%.




Compare this to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which collected $172 million in criminal penalties in fiscal year 2018 (October-September), with the highest ever being $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015. It has also sent several executives to prison.

While the CCI cannot boast figures like DoJ, the very fact that it has the authority to severely penalise violators could be working to its advantage. Meanwhile, some of the recommendations made by the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC), which submitted its report recently, could make CCI more nimble in the resolution of cases and take it a little closer to its counterparts in the EU, the UK and the US.




 It was in 2010, almost a decade ago, that the CCI, which had only become operational in May 2009, decided to probe its most high-profile case — to find out if 10 cement companies colluded through the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) to limit supplies and raise prices. The CCI said that after two of three CMA meetings at Mumbai’s Grand Hyatt and Hotel Orchid in early 2011, the companies hiked cement prices, which, the CCI said, “establishes that they co-ordinated their decisions and fixed prices after due consultations”. There were also questions over whether Ambuja Cement and ACC, which are part of the Swiss company LafargeHolcim, had attended two of these meetings despite no longer being members of the CMA.




The companies and the CMA disputed the CCI’s findings and appealed the penalty. The case has made its way through the Competition Appellate Tribunal, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which replaced the former in 2017, and is now pending before the Supreme Court, which asked the parties to deposit 10% of the penalty last year. Aparna Dutt Sharma, secretary general, CMA, did not respond to a request from 
ET Magazine for comment. Questions sent to Lafarge-Holcim, UltraTech Cement and Jaiprakash Associates, which were handed the highest penalties, also went unanswered.

The delay in the conclusion of this case — and others where fines were levied — has meant that companies have not coughed up what the CCI asked them to. Should that be a cause for concern? Kaushal Kumar Sharma, the first director-general of the CCI, says it would be wrong to equate deterrence to realisation of penalties. Vaibhav Choukse, partner, competition law, J Sagar Associates, concurs. “Companies do not want to be on the wrong side of the competition law as there is a huge reputational loss from a penalty.” A listed company will have to make disclosures to the stock exchanges in case it is fined by the CCI, which could drive its shares down.

“It’s not that the CCI wants to make money. The CCI’s idea in the early days was to make a splash and say, ‘We have arrived,’” says a competition lawyer, requesting anonymity. Nisha Kaur Uberoi, national head of competition law at Trilegal, a law firm, says the CCI has created deterrents through a combination of factors: “its ability to levy India’s highest economic penalties on companies, imposition of individual liability as well as advocacy to foster a culture of competition compliance”. By individual liability, she is referring to the CCI’s powers to penalise the directors of an errant company.

Ashok Kumar Gupta, chairman, CCI, recently told ET that penalties are not an end in themselves in any enforcement process. “In numerous cases, parties rectify their anti-competitive behaviour during the enquiry process itself so the market correction as such has taken place.”




As of March 2018, the CCI had noted 940 competition cases, ordered probes into 400 and completed investigations in 288. Even before the cement cartel case, a CCI order in 2011 gave India Inc an inkling of the regulator’s powers. It investigated the realtor DLF’s conduct in relation to one of its apartment buildings in Gurgaon and found that the company had set terms unfavourable to buyers in their agreement, like their inability to raise objections to changes in the structure by the builder. The CCI report added: “Despite knowing that necessary approvals were pending at the time of collection of deposits, DLF Ltd inserted clauses that made exit next to impossible for the buyers.”




The CCI fined DLF Rs 630 crore, which the realtor appealed; the matter is now in the apex court. Also before the Supreme Court is an appeal related to a Rs 591 crore penalty on Coal India for discriminatory terms in fuel-supply agreements. DLF and Coal India did not respond to questions sent by 
ET Magazine. Besides looking at anti-competitive agreements like cartels and abuse of dominance, the CCI also has to greenlight mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain size. The CCI, set up under the Competition Act, 2002 (amended in 2007), replaced the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.


Change is in the Air
The CLRC, which the government set up last year, has recommended a series of changes to the CCI. These include a dedicated NCLAT bench for competition cases, given that NCLAT is overburdened with cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. Though there is no NCLAT-specific data, as of September 30, there were nearly 1,500 IBC cases pending before the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.

Some of the report’s suggestions could make the CCI dispose of cases quickly. The introduction of settlement and commitment procedures, for instance, could help avoid pendency of cases. In the EU, which has had settlements since 2008, half the cartel cases are resolved using settlements, in which the parties admit to their guilt in exchange for a 10% reduction in penalties. Since 2004 the EU has also had commitments, in which the parties agree to change their behaviour. The US DoJ has consent decrees, which need to be court-approved.




Another recommendation made by the CLRC is that the CCI should be transparent in how it arrives at penalties, like in the EU and the UK. “It’s as if the CCI is pulling figures out of a hat,” says Aditya Bhattacharjea, professor at the Delhi School of Economics and a member of the CLRC.

The CCI, according to CLRC recommendations, can levy a penalty of up to 10% of the average turnover of the preceding three years in matters related to abuse of dominance. In case of cartels, it can impose a fine of up to 10% of their turnover or up to three times their profit in each year of the period during which the cartel existed, whichever is higher. “Having penalty guidelines will be good for the CCI when it has to defend its orders in courts,” says the competition lawyer quoted earlier.


Come Clean
Regardless of when these recommendations are incorporated into the law, experts say companies could make use of an existing provision to minimise a crippling penalty. A company engaged in an anti-competitive agreement with its competitors can alert the CCI to the existence of the cartel and cooperate in the investigation in the hopes of being waived a part, or the whole, of its fine.

Panasonic Energy utilised the lesser penalty option and went to the CCI in 2016 and admitted that it was part of a cartel with Eveready Industries and Indo National (which sells under the Nippo brand), aided by their industry association, to control the distribution and prices of zinc-carbon dry cell batteries, since 2008. Eveready and Indo National also availed of the lesser penalty provision. As a result, the CCI waived 100% of Panasonic’s Rs 75 crore penalty, and reduced Eveready’s and Indo National’s fines by 30% and 20%, respectively, to Rs 172 crore and Rs 42 crore.


Tech Challenge
Cracking down on cartels without one of the participating companies coming forward is not easy, especially since in some cases the CCI may not have more than circumstantial evidence to base its conclusions on. An even bigger challenge is dealing with violations in the fast-evolving world of technology.

Acting on information filed by Jaipur-based Consumer Unity & Trust Society and Matrimony.com, the CCI in 2018 fined Google Rs 136 crore for promoting its own specialised search — say, for flights — to the detriment of other websites. The order was stayed by NCLAT. Google is also being probed by the CCI for tying some of its apps to Android and limiting handset makers’ ability to sell devices with alternate versions. “Android has enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. We look forward to working with the CCI to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less,” says a Google India spokesperson.

Google’s dominance has been under scrutiny in the EU and the US as well. Since 2017, it has been fined a total of $9.3 billion by the EU in three different cases related to its abuse of dominance by favouring its advertising and shopping services over its competitors’ and for bundling some of its applications with Android. (Google has appealed all three orders.) It is also being investigated in the US and so are Facebook and, reportedly, Amazon. “Other than in the EU, competition regulators are exercising caution (with tech companies) because consumers are benefiting from these companies,” says Bhattacharjea.

While India may have got a competition authority later than several other countries, new technologies are coming to India soon after they are launched elsewhere. This is why Sharma, former CCI director general, believes that handling tech matters may not be too hard for the CCI. One of the emerging areas of concern for competition regulators worldwide is artificial intelligence-powered pricing algorithms of competitors colluding to fix prices. Who is to be held responsible here in the absence of executives of rival companies acting in tandem?

In addition to instances of cartelisation and abuse of dominance in the old-economy sectors, the CCI will have to increasingly deal with competition cases in businesses like ecommerce, ridehailing, food delivery and online travel aggregation (the CCI is currently investigating MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, which merged in 2017, and Oyo Rooms over allegations of predatory pricing, among others). The CCI has also made clear its intent to pursue cases on its own without a formal complaint. But what is unlikely to change, till the CLRC recommendations are implemented, is the time it takes for a case to reach its conclusion."
18,2018-11-24,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The Centre wants Coal India to speed up exploration and development of all its blocks or return them for auction to private parties or allotment to state-run firms.

These include existing blocks with geological reserves of 110 billion tonnes that are yet to be taken up for production and an additional 110 blocks with reserves of around 40 billion tonnes allotted in 2012.

The government has asked the company to prepare concrete plans in the near future.

Out of the 110 blocks allotted in 2012, Coal India has managed to explore 50, of which project reports for 25 have been prepared. Among the rest, 41 blocks are under exploration and 19 remains partly explored. The Centre has asked Coal India to quickly find out if coal extraction from all these 110 blocks is techno-economically feasible.

At a recent meeting, the coal secretary said blocks which Coal India subsidiaries do not want to explore or take up for production, maybe relinquished so that the ministry could offer them to other interested companies.

The Centre also advised Coal India subsidiary, Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, to prepare a detailed report on subsidiary- and block-wise coal reserves, depleted stock, blocks with areas yet to be explored, blocks under production and its plan for future projects and their reserves-to-production ratio. The Centre has asked it to demarcate large blocks so that they could attract bigger exploration companies.

CMPDI needs to speed up exploration of the remaining coalbearing area of the country, use modern technology and consider a revenue-sharing model in prospecting-cum-mining lease with the use of seismic exploration, the government said.

In 2018-19, about 6.6 billion tonnes of additional coal resources were added to the ‘proved’ category through 24 geological reports (prepared by CMPDI) covering about 260 sq km of exploration. Till October this year, CMPDIL has been able to achieve 98% of its exploration target with negative growth of 12% as compared to the previous year."

“The pithead coal stock with CIL was 54.15 Million Tonne (MT) as on April 1, 2019 which reduced to 19.15 MT as on September 30, 2019. Thus, the coal stock liquidation was 35 MT in the first half of the financial year 2019-20” the minister said in a reply to the Rajya Sabha. 

The minister also informed the upper house that CIL’s coal production rose by 10.6% in the first half of FY 18-19 to 256.47 MT as against 231.88 MT produced in the corresponding period of FY 17-18. 

In a reply laid on the table of the upper house the minister also informed that India’s coal production grew by 8.14% to 730.35 MT in FY 18-19 in comparison to 675.40 MT of coal produced in the county in FY 17-18. 

Nevertheless, production has started to pick up after a slowdown during monsoon. It is expected to increase further as winter sets in and will enable thermal power plants stock fuel for meeting increased power demand during summer next year. 

“We will try to make good the production loss in recent months and strive to achieve 660 million tonnes of production target for the year,” a senior Coal India executive said. “Till now we are beyond our pro-rata target for a variety of issues including heavy rainfall, flooding, law & order issues at a number of large mines.” 

“Issues with respect to appointing a contractor for overburden removal at one of our large subsidiaries also resulted in slower coal production at some mines. This is being sorted and we hope to be back on track soon,” he said. 

“The ministry has asked all stakeholders including consumers and railways to extend all help. With the necessary help, we are confident of reaching as close to the target as possible. This company is a very resilient one and it can bounce from any situation. With a dedicated and motivated team at Coal India, it is highly likely that the target will be achieved,” he said. 

According to an executive the coal ministry has also promised to lend Coal India all possible support to solve law & order issues that the company faces at some of its large mines. The ministry will also lend support in speeding up green clearances for mines expansion and setting up of new mines. 

“Coal production has already started to pick up on a month-on-month basis. It will further rise during winter as the weather turns fair at almost all mines. In tandem, demand for power falls during the same time allowing power companies to build up stocks to meet increased demand during next summer, provided they accept increased supplies offered by us,” the executive said. 

Coal India’s production rose almost 28% month-on-month in October to 40 million tonnes. In tandem, supplies increased 15% during the same time to 40.5 million tonnes. Supplies to the power sector during the same period increased 16.1% to almost 34 million tonnes in October. Stocks at power plants, which was adequate for 11 days during the beginning of October at 17.32 million tonnes also increased to 13 days at almost 21 million tonnes last week. Stocks at non-pithead plants have also improved by 21% to 18 million tonnes which are adequate for 15 days. During the beginning of October, stocks at non-pithead power plants were adequate for 13 days. 

In another reply to the Rajya Sabha, the minister informed that 319 Billion tonnes of geological reserves of coal have been estimated in India so far as on April 1, 2018."
24,2018-11-26,Coal India,"Kolkata: In October 2019, all-India energy demand declined 13.2 per cent year-on-year for the third consecutive month to 98 billion units (BUs) on account of an extended monsoon and a fall in energy demand from industrial states such as Maharashtra (down 22.4 per cent y-o-y), Gujarat (down 18.8 per cent y-o-y) and Tamil Nadu (down 5.2 per cent y-o-y) due to the economic slowdown, rating agency, India Ratings and Research said in a statement.

According to the rating firm, All-India energy supply declined 13.0 per cent y-o-y in October 2019, resulting in a reduction in an energy deficit to 0.5 per cent against 0.7 per cent during October 2018.

“On the supply side, electricity generation declined 12.9 per cent y-o-y to 98.9BUs on a 19.3 per cent fall y-o-y in thermal generation to 78.7BUs due to lower demand. Thermal generation was impacted due to a 21.8 per cent y-o-y increase in hydro generation to 15.1BUs. Average capacity utilisation for thermal power plants fell to 49.2 per cent in October 2019 against 63.8 per cent in October 2018, as central, state and private sector capacity utilisation decreased to 55.5 per cent (71.0 per cent ), 40.9 per cent (60.4 per cent ) and 51.0 per cent (60.8 per cent ), respectively,” it said in a statement.

Short-term power price at the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) decreased to Rs 2.71 per unit in October 2019 (September 2019: Rs 2.77 per unit) from Rs 5.94 per unit in October 2018 on account of a fall in demand on the short-term power exchanges. The difference in buy and sell bid volumes in October 2019 in day-ahead market widened to negative 5,848 million units (MUs) against 402 MUs in October 2018, on account of subdued demand, the Agency has estimated.

After declining for four consecutive months, coal production at Coal India (CIL) increased to 39.4 million tonnes (mt) in October 2019. However, it was still 21 per cent down on a year-on-year basis owing to lower production at its key subsidiaries Mahanadi Coalfields (down 34.9 per cent y-o-y) and South Eastern Coalfields Limited (down 30.6 per cent y-o-y).

Coal inventory at thermal power stations rose 88.6 per cent y-o-y to 19.0mt due to higher coal production and lower demand as coal offtake declined to 40.5mt (October 2018: 49.96mt). Coal availability at pithead and non-pithead plants on 31 October 2019 remained at six days and 14 days, respectively.

Transmission line addition has been lower in FY20 with 5,988 circuit kilometres added till October 2019 (April-October 2018: 11,799 circuit kilometres). The transmission line addition in October 2019 was 766 circuit kilometres (September 2018: 1,760 circuit kilometres) with 77 per cent of addition coming from the state sector."
23,2018-11-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has tied up with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to develop a satellite-based system to provide air pollution data online to the company and the government.

In the recent past, five Coal India subsidiaries were slapped a total fine of Rs 53,331 crore by states for producing in excess of available environmental clearance limits in at least 60 mines. If Coal India has to pay the levies, its finances will be critically hit as the penalty far exceeds its reserves of Rs 38,000 crore.

Coal India has used services of satellites for monitoring land reclamation and reforestation. Satellite-based pollution monitoring system exists only at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the US.

“ISRO’s Space Application Centre (SAC) in Ahmedabad has been trying to develop a similar system that is not fully functional yet. We are working with ISRO’s National Remote Sensing Centre for developing a new system for our mines,” said a senior Coal India executive. This will help the company dispense with the ground equipment used to monitor pollution, he said.

Coal India subsidiary, Central Mines Planning & Development Institute (CMPDI), has taken up the project for satellitebased monitoring of respirable particulate matter and it is under implementation at Singrauli and Talcher coalfields.

A CMPDI executive said sensors in satellites can measure particulate matter over mines by the extent to which these tiny particles obstruct light. “We intend to link this data to an online server so that pollution figures are available for everyone,” the executive said."
22,2018-11-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-run Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has expressed displeasure over West Bengal's land acquisition policy, as it continues efforts to procure around 3,600 acres of land for a coal mining project in Birbhum district. 

According to the policy, a company has to buy land from owners through a market mechanism while the state government only acts as a facilitator in the process, DVC sources said. 

""If the state government had acquired land directly for the Khagra-Joydeb coal block project, we could have avoided the delay in commissioning the mining activities. We are facing several issues to purchase a large tract of land directly from owners,"" a senior DVC official told on condition of anonymity. 

He, however, said the state government has been extending co-operation within the policy framework. 

The captive coal project will help the central public sector undertaking to reduce cost, he said, adding the power producer presently buys the dry fuel from Coal India. 

In FY19, the (power) 'plant availability loss' due to lack of coal till December last year was 20 per cent, a DVC document said. 

""We have already appointed Khagra-Joydev Resources Pvt Limited (KJRPL) in 2017 as the mine developer and operator (MDO). We will be able to commence mining activities only when land is acquired,"" the official said. 

A meeting between farmers at Loba village and DVC officials was held last week to fix the price, acceptable to both the parties, for the open-cast coal mine project, which was ""not successful"", company sources said. 

Of the 5,000-odd landowners, a handful of them had participated in the meeting, they said. 

""DVC had proposed Rs 14 lakh per acre in the meeting but it was rejected by the attendees,"" sources said. 

The board of the power utility had already approved an investment of Rs 1,094 crore to develop the Khagra-Joydeb coal block which has an estimated resource of 103 million tonnes. 

In addition to it, DVC has also secured the Tubed coal block in Jharkhand for captive use. 

The Kolkata-headquartered company has an installed capacity of 7,200 MW of thermal and hydel power."

28,2018-11-28,Coal India,"Coal India has firmed up plans to spend Rs 56,000 crore on 66 coal projects with an annual peak production capacity of 500 million tonnes.

The projects are at various stages of implementation and according to a memorandum of understanding signed between Coal India and the ministry of coal over the state-run company’s fiscal 2020 targets, almost 55% of the total capital outlay would be undertaken by South Eastern Coalfields (SECL) which is working on 23 projects with a total peak production capacity of 192 million tonnes. SECL is the largest coal producing subsidiary of Coal India, contributing almost a fourth of the total production at 157 million tonnes in 2018-19. The sanctioned capital for projects undertaken by SECL is around Rs 30,783 crore.

Mahanadi Coalfields is currently working on 11 projects with a peak production capacity of around 156 million tonnes, entailing investment of Rs 8,519 crore. It was the second largest contributor to Coal India’s production last year. Western Coalfields is working on 15 projects with a total peak rated capacity of around 35 million tonnes and would be investing Rs 5,949 crore.

Eastern Coalfields is working on four projects with a peak rated capacity of 17 million tonnes, involving a capital outlay of Rs 2,570 crore. Bharat Coking Coal has also undertaken four projects with a peak rated capacity of 18.5 million tonnes involving an outlay of Rs 2,345 crore. Central Coalfields is developing 7 projects with a peak capacity of 42 million tonnes and outlay of Rs 2,846 crore. Northern Coalfields is involved in two projects with capacity of 40 million tonnes and capital outlay of 3,038 crore.

“Coal India has advanced its targeted 1-billion-tonne production capacity achievement by two years to 2024. It intends to produce 750 million tonnes during the next fiscal, while this year the target is 660 million tonnes. In order to achieve these targets, Coal India and its subsidiaries will be required to achieve milestones for each of these 66 projects set out in the memorandum of understanding,” said a senior Coal India executive.

Recently, the ministry has asked all stakeholders, including consumers and the railways, to extend all help to Coal India to increase production. The coal ministry has also promised to lend Coal India all possible support to solve law and order issues it faces at some of its large mines. The ministry has also offered to help speed up green clearances for the expansion of mines and setting up of new mines.

From April to end-October, the company has produced 280 million tonnes of coal and supplied 316 million tonnes, including by liquidating 36 million tonnes of pithead stocks. If Coal India has to achieve its targeted supply and production figures, it needs to produce 380 million tonnes in the next five months to March 2020 and supply 344 million tonnes."

31,2018-11-30,Coal India,"New Delhi: The government is preparing to auction supply of coal to stressed power plants, which must sell the electricity produced using this fuel on the spot market.

The auctions, likely to start by February next year, will be reserved for non-captive power plants which do not have power purchase agreements (PPAs) for more than half their capacity, according to the bid guidelines released by the power ministry. Power minister RK Singh told 
ET that the move allowing coal supply for short-term electricity trade would help revive stressed power assets.

“So far, coal was allocated for long-term and medium-term PPA holders. With this, stressed power stations may be revived,” the minister said, adding that this would also enable deepening of the power market as the electricity would be traded through the power exchange.

However, industry officials said the upcoming coal auctions were not different from the special forward coal auctions held by Coal India for the power sector. They said the new auctions had many restrictive clauses, too.

According to the guidelines issued by the ministry on Wednesday, the power generated through use of this coal must be sold on the power exchanges or shortterm market through bidding on the power ministry’s DEEP portal.

Also, the net surplus proceeds generated in this manner, after meeting operating expenses, shall be entirely used for servicing debt. “The power ministry will work out in consultation with the Department of Financial Services a mechanism to ensure this,” it said.

The plan has been finalised eight months after the Union Cabinet on March 7 approved granting coal supply to power plants holding short-term power purchase agreements.

According to the rules, Coal India and Singareni Collieries Company will earmark mines for coal supply for these auctions. The quality and quantum of the coal, period for which it will be available and the schedule for the supply to start will be indicated to the bidders. Based on these facts, bidders can offer a premium on coal in the auctions.

“Auctions for coal linkage under this methodology shall be carried out every quarter to cater to the dynamic requirements and demand variations in shortterm and day-ahead markets. An annual calendar shall be published on coal companies’ website showing the months in which the auctions will be held,” the methodology said.

Sources said a dozen of the 34 stressed power plants were likely to become standard, with the steps taken by the government and resolution processes adopted outside insolvency by their lenders. The government’s coal supply auction scheme — Shakti, launched in May 2017 — and the two rounds of PPA auctions have helped ease the stress of many power plants, they said."
2,2018-12-03,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has dismissed a complaint against state-owned Coal India and its subsidiary, Western Coalfields, alleging unfair business practices regarding fuel supply agreements.

Udaipur-based Hindustan Zinc Ltd in a complaint had alleged that Coal India abused its dominant position by imposing unilateral and unfair conditions in the fuel supply agreements (FSA) and acted in a discriminatory manner during the supply of coal.

The complainant alleged that it violated Section 4 of the Competition Act which pertains to abuse of dominant position.

In a nine-page order dated December 3, the CCI said that it has earlier, too, disposed of such cases against Coal India and its subsidiaries where similar allegations were found to be made.

Besides, the issues highlighted by the complainant regarding ""sampling procedure, grade slippage/mis-declaration of grades"" have been substantially addressed by previously issuing appropriate directions to Coal India and its subsidiaries, CCI noted.

In March 2017, the regulator asked Coal India to modify the FSAs and directed it to incorporate suitable modifications in the pacts to provide for a fair and equitable sampling and testing procedure.

Disposing of the complaint, the CCI said it ""need not order investigations based on successive information which may be brought before it by different parties agitating the same issues"".

Hence, the case stands disposed of in terms of directions issued by the Commission in the previous cases decided against Coal India and its subsidiaries, CCI said."

4,2018-12-04,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is likely to transfer about 10,000 executives out of 18,000 executives to different subsidiaries or its headquarters next fiscal as it has adopted a policy that requires people to be relocated if they have been at the same place for 15 years, a senior company executive said.

Under the new policy, which aims to give an all-round experience to managers and prevent corruption, executives posted at Coal India’s headquarters in Kolkata will be transferred to one of its subsidiaries while those from subsidiaries may either be transferred to a different subsidiary or to the Coal India headquarters.

“Coal India has eight coal producing subsidiaries and one exploration arm. At present executives are being asked to provide three location preferences – at either the headquarters or any three subsidiaries. New posting would be based on overall manpower and skill-base requirement at each of the locations,” he said.

The company would wait for a few months to transfer the executives to avoid any disruption in the peak output period of November-March, he said.

Executives would be informed of their transfer two to three months in advance. This would give them time to prepare for the move, the executive said.

This is part of a new transfer policy under which executives stationed for five years, 10 years and 15 year in one location would be transferred. Transfer for 15 years is being taken up first.

Transfers every fifth year will be interdepartmental for an executive working at subsidiary headquarters or at Coal India headquarters. An executive employed in the marketing and sales department may be transferred to the purchases department within the same headquarters. For executives working at mining projects, the transfer would be from one area to another within the same project.

After the tenth year the executive would be eligible for transfer to a new project in the same subsidiary. On completion of the fifteenth year the executive will be eligible to be transferred to a new subsidiary or to Coal India."

The reversal of course came after three straight sessions of losses. 

Earlier on, sentiment got a leg-up on reports that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is looking to buy 10 per cent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

Crude oil prices lay low due to ambiguity over a cut in output by Opec. A stronger rupee had a big bearing, too. 

Asian and European markets were in a better shape after US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled that the three-year tightening cycle is coming to a close. IMF chief Christine Lagarde's comments that the US is not likely to see an economic contraction in the near term added to the buying momentum.

13,2018-12-08,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Top bosses at Coal India have recently realised that it is slated to run into serious leadership crisis 4-5 years from now, when there won’t be any adequately experienced general managers to run the state-run company. General managers are the senior-most non-board level executives and every department requires at least one to run smoothly.

Additionally, each coal-bearing area at all its coal producing subsidiaries has one or two general managers depending on the size of the coalfield. At present there are more than 500 general managers in Coal India and subsidiaries who take care of most day-to-day ground-level activities.

“For 14 years, between 1993 and 2007, Coal India had stopped recruiting executives on the pretext of excess manpower. It takes at least 20-25 years for an executive joining Coal India at the junior most grade (E1) to gather enough experience to assume a general manager’s (E8) position,” a company executive said. “Since there were no recruitments between 1993 and 2007, Coal India would not have enough adequately experienced executives to take over as general managers starting this year. In the meantime, executives who joined prior to 1993 are close to their retirement.”

“The issue has already started to show its ugly head and all of the 500-odd existing general managers are slated to retire 5-6 years from now. It cannot be solved through lateral recruitment since such a large number of adequately experienced executives may not be at all available,” a senior Coal India executive said.

In an effort to make sure the problem is not repeated in the future, the company has recently engaged IIT-Dhanbad for working out its manpower requirement for the next ten years. The IIT will also prepare a comprehensive manpower profile plan for the company. At present, the world’s largest coal producer employs 2.8 lakh people, including 17,200 executives."

mjunction -- a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL -- is a B2B e-commerce company and also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.

""Imports during November 2018 stood at 19.47 MT (provisional)... Earlier, coal and coke imports in November 2017 stood at 17.68 MT,"" it said.

Of the total imports last month, import of non-coking coal was at 14.24 MT, against 15.23 MT imported in October 2018.

""The significant correction in thermal coal prices in November prompted buyers to take a wait and watch approach. There, however, was a stable trend in met coal market and this was reflected in the buying pattern,"" mjunction CEO Vinaya Varma said.

The import of coking coal was at 3.93 MT in November 2018, almost flat against 3.94 MT imported a month ago.

""Metallurgical coke imports during the month were at 0.50 MT, while 0.53 MT was imported in the previous month,"" it said.

India's coal and coke import during November 2018 through 31 major and non-major ports is estimated to have decreased by 5.32 percent over October 2018, according to provisional figures compiled by mjunction, based on monitoring of vessels' positions and data received from shipping companies.

The results of elections of five Indian states are due on Tuesday. Exit poll results have already painted a picture of tough numbers for the BJP. 

A selloff in global stocks on growth worries and a flare-up of tension between the US and China made investors jittery.

23,2018-12-10,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Stocks got a sinking feeling on Monday as the possibility of the ruling BJP not measuring up to expectations in the just-concluded state elections, the results of which are due tomorrow, did not sit well with investors. 

A global selloff compounded worries on Dalal Street. 

A jump in crude prices post Opec's decision to slash oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day and a fall in the rupee to its weakest since November 20 were other headaches.

In percentage terms, the BSE benchmark Sensex crashed 2 per cent, ending at 34,959.72, down 714 points. The NSE Nifty ended at 10,488.45, down 205 points, or 1.92 per cent. 

Selling heat was so much that only Coal India and Maruti managed to settle with marginal gains in the Sensex kitty of stocks. Kotak Mahindra Bank, down 6.56 per cent, was the worst hit.

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slipped after the private lender upped the ante on the promoter shareholding issue as it moved the Bombay High Court seeking legal relief on Monday. 

Other stocks that joined Kotak Bank in the losers' list were Reliance Industries (down 3.95 per cent), Asian Paints (down 3.48 per cent), Tata Motors (down 3.45 per cent), Adani Ports (down 3.41 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (down 3.16 per cent).

All 19 sectoral indices lost on Monday, with BSE Realty hardest hit. Telecom, energy, finance, bankex and capital goods were other top sectoral losers, losing over 2 per cent each.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were as badly hit as the Sensex, declining 1.84 per cent each.


Top market drags for today:


Exit poll volatility
Exit poll results didn't augur too well for the BJP, as was expected. ""Unfavourable exit poll results for the ruling party has impacted the sentiment of the market today and this dullness will continue as tomorrow’s final outcome confirms their losing strength,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said. 

Investors are eyeing the polls in five states - Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Mizoram -- to look for clues as to how the BJP would fare in the general elections due next year.


Global stocks in pain
Globally, losses on global stocks snowballed on Monday, with European markets following Asian peers lower as fresh signs emerged of slowing growth worldwide and fears grew that simmering US-China tensions would derail chances of a trade deal.

15,2018-12-10,Coal India,"New Delhi: A power crisis is looming large on India and the country needs to immediately start planning coal-based power plants and transmission corridors to avert it, experts have cautioned. This is in stark contrast to statistics of the country’s electricity authority that showed planned capacity is enough to meet peak hour demand till 2026-27.

Adding only renewable generation capacity will add to the woes in tackling the unprecedented rise in demand due to higher industrial activity, new domestic connections and states’ resolve to improve power availability, industry experts have said.
“Not factoring incremental peak demand from revival in industrial activity, our existing capacity and pipeline can at best meet projected peak demand till FY23, post which we will start running peak deficit,” a recent report by ICICI Securities said.

According to experts, the country is already late in planning thermal capacity that have very long construction periods. Also, possibilities of the sector getting fresh investments in the near term look bleak with about 50 GW stressed capacity and coal-based plants operating at just about 60% capacity.

Close to 30 GW power assets are likely to move to bankruptcy court as banks have not been able to arrive at resolution.



While renewable projects are getting financed, thermal assets are not likely to get lenders because of banks’ over exposure, sectoral stress and fuel crunch, experts said.

According to the ICICI Securities report, the country reported peak power demand of 177 GW in September, an increase of 13 GW over FY18 peak demand — the highest year-on-year growth since 1993-94.

“Record peak demand increase in FY19, driven by increased domestic demand, new connections under Saubhagya and reduction in load shedding, appears structural,” the report said.

“Against this, adjusting installed capacity and pipeline with historical availability factor, foretells the end of current ‘peak surplus’ scenario by FY23.

To prepare for life beyond FY23, we need to ramp up capacity addition planning, or prepare to face another high price/supply deficit scenario,” it said.

India's installed capacity is 346 GW with ability to meet about 190 GW peak demand, to which 5-10 GW is likely to get added through plants under construction.

Renewable plants contribute little towards meeting peak demand as their variable nature renders them unreliable, the report said. Also, more non-renewable inter-regional transmission capacity addition is needed and capex planning for remaining 80 GW renewable power evacuation has to be done, it said.

“We have come to the conclusion that Saubhagya’s impact has been and is expected to be much sharper on peak demand than base demand… Pickup in industrial demand will positively impact both base and peak demand, which will require generation and transmission capacity additions, something we do not believe is being currently built-in,” the report said.

The Central Electricity Authority’s National Electricity Plan early this year had said India would need addition of only 6,440-mw thermal power during 2017-22.

Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana, however, said the demand-supply position may change drastically in the next three-to-four years “with slowdown in new capacity addition coupled with retirement of 40 GW of old capacity”.

“To avoid power shortages at the beginning of 14th plan, we need to initiate well thought of strategy of increasing coal and power production,” Khurana said. “For meeting power requirements now and in future, coal sector has to be commercialised. Coal India cannot deliver the required quantum.” A senior executive with a power firm said there is a clear trend that peak demand is growing much faster than the base demand.

“If the current fuel shortage is not resolved or coal reforms do not take place, we are staring at huge power deficit country by 2022,” the person told ET. “At the same time, planning for new capacities also needs to start at the right earnest, looking at the healthy energy demand due to Pradhan Mantri Housing Scheme and Saubhagya scheme,” he said.

The ICICI Securities report said that with improvement in financials after debt transfer or re-pricing under UDAY and the central government’s push for ‘24x7 Power for All’, there had been 32% reduction in declared load shedding in 2017-18 over FY17 to 7.7 hours per month from 11.3 hours per month."

25,2018-12-11,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India will see an additional annual outgo of Rs 800 crore on account of recent salary hike for executives. The state-run miner will bear a total outgo of Rs 1,000 crore this year on account of the hike, including a rs 200-crore arrear component, as it is effective from January 2017.

It has made a provision of Rs 100 crore per quarter totalling Rs 400 crore this year.

According to a senior Coal India executive, pay scales of all executives have been revised and made on a par with those at ONGC. This was a long-standing demand of executives who did not see their salary scales revised for several years. The pay scale for entry level executives was revised to Rs 40,000-1,40,000 per month from Rs 16,400-40,500. 

The new salary has merged the dearness allowance, which was 117% of the basic pay, and leads to an increase of about 20% in gross salary, a senior executive said. Pay scales for executives below board level have been raised to Rs 1.5 lakh-3 lakh from Rs 62,000-80,000. The chairman’s pay scale has been increased to Rs 2 lakh-3.7 lakh from Rs 80,000-1.25 lakh.

“Salaries of Coal India executives are revised every 10 years and the current revision fell due more than a year ago on January 2017,” said a senior Coal India executive, who is also part of the Coal Mines Officers’ Association of India (CMOAI).

“Since salaries are revised every 10 years, pay scales of ‘Maharatna’ companies were more than that of Coal India executives for a number of grades before the hike. Executives have been asking the management to correct the anomaly and make it on a par with other large PSUs.”

Some executives were being paid less than some workmen because the latter’s wages are revised every five years, he said."

32,2018-12-14,Coal India,"The worst case scenario that has not been priced in by the Indian markets will be some weak coalition 
  
  
  
  government that does not last very long, Jonathan Schiessl, Chief Investment Officer, Ashburton Investments, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is your broad overview on India? In local currency terms, the Indian market has been the best performing market in the world but even so the spoiler for India has been the currency situation which has been really the party-pooper for emerging markets this year.
There are people who would have predicted the results of the state elections earlier in the week and then what happened with the RBI governor. As you rightly say, India has performed so incredibly well particularly when other emerging markets have come off as well. So it has been an incredibly unusual few days. Clearly the markets are pricing in a much easier monetary policy coming out of the new RBI governor and has obviously moved on from the state elections.


What did you make of the drama that played out between the RBI and the government? What is your own expectation on the monetary policy front?
Most people would agree that the RBI as an institution has enough depth to be able to cope with what has been going on. From our perspective, we do not see turn back in the MPC, inflation targeting that whole process and the RBI itself as an institution is deep enough and strong enough to cope with the changes. 

We do not worry too much about that although obviously we have to keep cognisant of what is going on that is the key thing for us really with regards to that. Clearly from our perspective, there was some frustration with the prior governor particularly on the communication side. 

RBI earlier used to be very communicative with foreign investors. They would meet foreign investors very freely under the last administration. That became a little bit more difficult and we also found frustrations with some of the communications following the MPC meetings. 

Clearly being the head of RBI includes an element of politics and perhaps the new governor will be able to handle that a little bit differently.


 It was remarkable the way the market absorbed the state election result and then the RBI governor hanging up his boots. Do you think in the run up to 2019 elections, the volatility would persist?
I cannot believe that has been priced in that scenario. I would think state elections and national elections exhibit two very different voting habits from the same voters. However, the reality is the result from the state elections will give Congress a boost and therefore it is going to be much more of a two-horse race than perhaps people were predicting. 

If you look at what has happened to markets, then clearly I do not think markets are pricing that in. For anybody who has been following India for some time, it is not that the parties are that far apart on key policies. But what we want to see is a stable government at the centre that can actually drive policy. The worst case scenario that has not been priced in the markets will be some weak coalition government that does not last very long . That would be a concern particularly when you look at India again after the good performance of this week and last month as well.

India’s relative valuation compared to other emerging markets is going up and India is already looking fairly pricey vis-à-vis other emerging markets and there are some reasons for that. But there are also some risks out there that I would argue the markets are not quite thinking about at the moment. 


What then should the Indian investor do? Is it time to start hunting in the volatility that the market is going to see in the next six months or should one sit on a pile of cash and keep your shopping list ready?
It all depends on the investor’s time horizon. We are great believer in India as a phenomenal medium to longer-term story. Trying to time the market and buy all the dips is a very difficult approach. 

If you are in the market for a long period of time, you will make a very good return from the market. Ideally, you can try and buy when periodically it shows some value but it is very difficult to time that. For anybody on a medium to longer term basis, just dribbling the money into the market is still a very good policy. Cost averaging into the market is a good policy. 

But yes, we do believe that looking at the underlying macro, earnings and what is going on with growth, surely we are hitting at a little bit of growth halt at the moment. Things were getting a bit too hot. But inflation is coming off. We do believe India is recovering. We have been in a very long earnings recession and we are coming out of that slowly. We think this market will offer very good returns for investors over the medium and longer term. It does not concern us too much that in a short-term, volatility is just a good buying opportunity.


Where do you think bargains are available?
We have been getting more defensive over the last few months but we still think that there are pockets of real value in the market. We have been perhaps seeing counters like Coal India that offers tremendous good valuation point and very good dividend yield. We are pretty sure about the earnings trajectory of stocks over the next three years. It is not an over-loved stock. It is not overhyped and looks a good place for us. 

We also like GAIL India, which has come off a bit more recently because obviously the oil price did come off. So, stocks like that, where we see good dividend yields and valuation comfort, where risk reward is very favourable. For the longer term investors, they are the usual favourites if you can put out with a slightly higher valuations in the short term.

Most of the counters in the market do look okay to us but the newer stuff we have been putting in is definitely being a bit more defensive with high dividend yields where we can still see some visibility of growth over the next few years.


What is your take on the Indian NBFC space and do you think this euphoria is warranted?
Clearly that has been an area of massive focus over the last few months. Obviously, the liquidity has picked up. We have not seen these NBFCs being able to tap the markets. Ultimately we think the big NBFCs that have access to cheaper capital will continue to take market share. The space had been getting extremely competitive. There were probably too many new entrants and this whole event was a wakeup call for the space. 

Ultimately some of the more dubious business models are going to be put under pressure and therefore the big will just end up getting bigger. When I look at a lot of Indian financials, the big guys have access to cheaper capital and they will continue to win. We see plenty of scope for some of the larger NBFCs and private banks to carry on taking significant market share gains."
33,2018-12-14,Coal India,"Coal India subsidiary Northern Coalfields Ltd would invest Rs 1,150 crore this year which is expected to take it to the 100 million tonne (MT) production club in 2018-19, a top official said Friday.

As of now, only two Coal India subsidiaries -- South Eastern Coalfields and Mahanadi Coalfields -- are producing in excess of 100 MT per annum.

""We will be producing 100.5 MT this year, as against 93 MT achieved during 2017-18. Our capex target for the year is Rs 1,150 crore for expansion and equipment acquisition which will help us to increase our production in the future,"" NCL chairman cum managing director P K Sinha said on the sidelines of the International Conference on Opencast Mining Technology and Sustainability (ICOMS-2018) here.

NCL is also working on a plan to produce 115 MT by 2022-23 by when Coal India's total production is expected to touch 1 billion tonne. NCL is expanding its Jayant and Dudhichua mines while opening greenfield Semaria mine in the next 2-3 years that would add 2 MT per annum.

Sinha said that NCL, after meeting the demand for the pithead thermal plants totalling around 13,000 MW belonging to companies like NTPC, Lanco, and UP Rajya Vidyut Nigam Ltd also proposes to send about 20-25 MT dry fuel to the starved thermal power plants in north India.

The country's largest super thermal power plant at Vindhyachal of NTPC of approx 5,000 MW is fed by NCL. It supplied 26 days of coal stock against the normative requirement of 15 days.

Sinha said although coal evacuation remains an issue for the upcountry supplies, but it would get streamlined in the next 2-3 years once the doubling of railway lines between Katni and Singraulli (260kms), and Ramna and Singraulli (160kms) projects were completed.

The railways has approved these projects at an estimated cost of Rs 4,700 crore, NCL officials said.

Presently, coal mining activities of NCL are confined in the Moher sub-basin, where all operations are being carried out through 10 highly mechanised opencast mines.

At the inauguration of the first International Conference on Opencast Mining Technology and Sustainability (ICOMS-2018), BEML chairman and managing director H K Hota appreciated NCL's efforts to promote 'Make in India' initiative by rolling out the country's first 205 tonne electric dumper at Amlohri mine.

Meanwhile, NCL has been strengthening R&D capabilities and recently entered into a pact with IIT Varanasi in this regard."

34,2018-12-16,Coal India,"New Delhi: The government is planning to raise about Rs 10,000 crore through a follow on offer of Bharat-22 ETF in February, an official said.

""Plans are on for launching the third tranche of Bharat-22 ETF around February. The offer is likely to have a base issue size of Rs 5,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain an over-subscription of equal amount, taking the total issue size to Rs 10,000 crore,"" the official told PTI.

The government has so far raised Rs 22,900 crore through the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF). While Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.

The official said there would be a need to rebalance the ETF after the third tranche as the government holding in certain CPSEs in the basket could fall below 53 per cent.

The Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) that are part of the Bharat-22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

Also, the government's strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T held through SUUTI (Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India) has been put in the ETF basket.

Last month, the government had raised Rs 17,300 crore through a follow on offer of another exchange traded fund -- CPSE ETF, which comprises shares of 11 public sector enterprises.

As against the budgeted disinvestment target of Rs 80,000 crore, the government has so far raised Rs 34,000 crore by selling minority stake in CPSEs and ETFs."
35,2018-12-16,Coal India,"VADODARA: No power plant is facing fuel shortages, especially those fired by coal and that off-take by power plants has grown 8-9 percent till October, Union power minister Piyush Goyal has said.

The minister also claimed that none of the thermal power plants have reported any loss of generation due to coal supply shortage.

""Coal stock at power plants has been sufficient for operations and none of the power plants have reported critical/super critical coal stock position,"" the minister told PTI late Saturday evening.

He said national miner Coal India has supplied 22 million tonne more fuel to power plants during April-October this fiscal than what it had supplied in the same seven months period a year ago.

Coal off-take by thermal plants has been growing at 8-9 percent, he added.

Goyal, who is also the railway minister, was here last evening to dedicate the first railway university to the nation at the Pratapsingh Palace here.

A senior Gujarat State Electricity Company official said thermal plants in the state have sufficient coal stock and have been running at full capacity since Diwali days.

It can be recalled that coal fired power plants located in Wanakbori, Gandhinagar and Ukai in the state were facing severe coal shortages in September and October and were running at less than a day's stock and were on the verge of shuttering them.

During those months, the state was getting only one fourth of its demand just four rakes of coal supplies a day from the committed 12 rakes, forcing the state to import more coal from Indonesia, leading to a 40 paise spike in per unit cost for end consumers.

But the supply is yet to normalise as the present daily quantity is only 8 rakes and not 12 rakes, state officials admitted."
39,2018-12-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA:The Centre is considering a proposal to encourage power plants in remote areas to mostly use domestic coal while allowing plants closer to ports to use imported coal, interchanging their current sources of fuel to reduce cost of transporting coal. Such a move would lower cost of power generation and, subsequently, the consumer’s bill.

At present, some power plants located in the hinterland consume imported coal and have to spend additional money in transporting the fuel from the ports. Similarly, some plants in the coastal regions have a high transportation bill as they have to source coal from pitheads which are mostly located in eastern India.

Interchanging the type of coal will help bridge the gap between coal requirement and availability, thus reducing transport cost and crisscross movement on rail network.

According to a senior official, an Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) is examining the possibility of this swap and has invited interested parties to discuss pros and cons with other stakeholders.

Four years ago, state-owned NTPC and Gujarat State Electricity Corporation (GSECL) had entered a similar swapping arrangement. Prior to the swap, utilities in Gujarat were receiving coal from Korea-Rewa coalfields, Chhattisgarh while NTPC’s thermal plants in Chhattisgarh got coal from the Gujarat ports. There were savings for both, post swap.

Domestic coal swap agreements have also been executed in Tamil Nadu between Tangedco and NTPC, in Gujarat between GSECL and NTPC, in Maharahstra between Mahagenco, NTPC and NTPC-SAIL Power Company.

Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam and NTPC swapped coal sources, while in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, it was between Punjab State Power Corporation, Damodar Valley Corp and Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam. Haryana Power Generation Corporation, Damodar Valley Corporation and APCLP swapped sources in Haryana.

“However, it was decided there will not be any automatic route for swapping of coal source. Each case will be discussed and allowed on merit. Long-term swapping arrangements make more sense than short-term.

These are likely to be incorporated in the fuel-supply agreements signed by the entities with Coal India,” said a senior Coal India executive. According to the Centre, Coal India has rationalised sources to thermal power plants of PSUs to 30.46 million tonne on the basis of requests received from them."

37,2018-12-17,Coal India,"Jefferies has a buy call on NTPC with a target price of Rs 210.

The current market price of NTPC is Rs 146.30.

Time period given by the global brokerage is one year when NTPC price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by Jefferies

Fuel positive could be Rs11bn annually: NTPC’s average gross calorific value (GCV) of coal is approximately 3,200 Kcal. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), in its draft, has allowed energy charges per unit of power to be calculated with a variation of 85 kcal to billing on actual GCV of coal received. This accounts for losses between received coal and fired coal and potentially gives NTPC the benefit of nearly 2.7 per cent on its coal cost. Based on FY18 reported numbers it could add Rs11 bn annually to FY20E-21E EPS. The draft has also maintained regulated ROE vs expectations of a reduction in same.


Quarterly Plant Availability Factor (PAF) increases accountability: For earnings regulated ROE, NTPC’s plants must maintain coal stock (major driver of PAF) so the plant is available for generation at least 85 per cent of the year. In its draft, CERC has proposed changing this to quarterly, adjusted for scheduled shut-downs, which means NTPC cannot make up for under-recovery in one quarter in another quarter. NTPC has faced coal issues since 3QFY18, and in FY19E, vs under-recoveries of Rs8.21 bn in 1H, hopes to end the year at Rs6 bn under-recoveries. Under the proposal this would not be possible and in this context would affect EPS by 2 per cent. However, we do believe this move by CERC is logical as it tightens its performance check on NTPC on an important parameter. NTPC has typically been above par on operations except in years of coal issues due to shortage in Coal India production or railway issues. This tightening will hopefully make management more proactive in importing coal in the problematic years.


Detailed analysis in Exhibit 1: We have assumed NTPC’s coal availability normalises from FY20E onward and hence do not have an absolute negative impact of the change to quarterly from annual. Barring the impact of the first 7 changes mentioned in our table, which we have quantified, the balance should not be materially positive/negative impact and should likely net off.


Valuation: We believe NTPC’s earnings will rise at 15 per cent CAGR in FY18-21E. Maintain Buy with a target price of Rs 210, 1.5x P/B FY20E (13 per cent discount to its historical average). 


Risks: Consistent PAF issues due to lack of coal."
38,2018-12-17,Coal India,"To promote clean energy, Niti Aayog is pushing for the use of methanol as cooking fuel in households as well as transport fuel, a member of the government think tank said Monday.

The Aayog is in talks with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Assam over distribution of 20,000 and 50,000 gas stoves, respectively, powered by methanol, Niti Aayog Member V K Saraswat said.

""We are also looking at the use of methanol as cooking fuel and have provided methanol cooking stoves to 500 households inside the Assam Petro Complex as a pilot project.

""After Assam, we are working with the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh to cover areas in the eastern Uttar Pradesh and then will cover western region of Maharashtra, including Pune region,"" he told reporters here.

A plant each would be set up in Bengaluru and Assam for manufacturing methanol cooking stoves based on a technology sourced from Sweden, he said. Large stoves for commercial use will be imported till technology is developed locally.

Methanol is a clear and colourless liquid produced from natural gas, coal and a wide range of renewable feedstock. Also known as wood alcohol, methanol is naturally occurring and biodegradable.

Saraswat said that India is ready for 15 per cent blending of methanol with petrol and the Aayog will soon bring a Cabinet note to make it mandatory for passenger vehicles to run on methanol-mixed petrol.

""Cost of petrol will come down by Rs 3-4 per litre when we would make it mandatory for passenger vehicles to run on petrol blended with 15 per cent methanol,"" he said.

The Niti Aayog memeber also announced that the Road Transport and Highways Ministry will introduce 60 buses which will run on methanol.
""These buses will be initially imported and are likely to hit the road in six months,"" he said.

Saraswat, former Defence Research and Development Organisation chief, said India will commission nine ships that will work on methanol and the country has already issued rules for methanol vessels.

He also pointed out that Coal India has identified 14 blocks for the production of methanol from coal.

""We expect by 2022, we will have indigenous coal-based methanol production in the country. Currently we need imported methanol and the process of seeking tender from the outside world has started,"" he said.

""We will require 10 million tonnes of methanol by 2022,"" Saraswat added.

In a bid to lower crude oil import bill, Saraswat said that the government will also promote coal gasification to convert high ash coal into methanol that can be used as cooking gas and transportation fuels.

The Aayog has drawn out a comprehensive plan to replace 20 per cent of crude imports with methanol alone."
41,2018-12-20,Coal India,"By Anil Swarup (Former Coal Secretary)

All hell seemed to have broken loose when the CAG released its audit report on the allocation of coal blocks made between 2004 and 2010. Vinod Rai was the CAG when the audit of coal block allocation was done. Responding to some of the questions against the Report, in his book “Not Just an Accountant” he has raised certain pertinent questions: “What was CAG’s folly in this entire saga? The decision to audit the Ministry of Coal? Or the decision to make the audit report public by placing it in Parliament”.

The CAG was absolutely right on both these counts and in pointing out the f laws in the process of allocation of coal blocks that was termed as ‘non-transparent’ and ‘discretionary’. However, was CAG wrong in determining the loss to public exchequer? Was there a need to make a public spectacle of what he thought was right? Did this create an environment where decision making became even more difficult? These are some of the questions that should have been raised but were neither raised nor answered. Almost everyone was blinded by the enormity of the issues that came to the fore but were blissfully oblivious of the implications of stretching and highlighting the issues in the way it was done.

In the book, data from the CAG Report was used and the calculations were worked out as follows:

a) Average Coal India Limited selling price: Rs 1028/tonne
b) Average cost of coal mining: Rs 583/Tonne
c) Financing cost: Rs 150/tonne
d) Financial Benefit {a-(b+c)}: Rs 295/tonne
e) Extractable Reserves: 6,282 MT
f) Financial Gain {dxe}: Rs 1,80,000 crore

Let us look at each one of these aspects. The cost of coal mining by Coal India ranges between Rs 400 and Rs 4000 per tonne. Given this wide range, arriving at an average cost of mining, as was done by the CAG, was most inappropriate. In fact, the cost of mining varies significantly from one mine to the other because of several factors. There are issues relating to stripping ratio, grade of coal and transportation cost that were totally ignored by the CAG in arriving at the correct numbers. There was another aspect to it as well. Apart from the cost of mining, the then Coal Secretary had conceded before the Parliamentary Committee that there was a stark difference in the quality of coal in the blocks with the CIL and those given to private parties for captive mining. Hence, use of CIL numbers as benchmarks was faulty. If one looks at the statistics provided by the Coal Controller of India for the year 2014-15, it is evident that while 33.20% of the coal mined by CIL was of superior quality (Grades 1 to 9), only 9.4% of the coal mined by captive miners was of that grade. Similarly, the stripping ratio for captive mines was much higher than the one for Coal India mines. During the year 2013-14 it was 1.89 for Coal India and 3.46 in the captive blocks.

Such a calculation led to the cancellation of even those mines for which there are no takers subsequently. A careful calculation (if at all) would have clearly determined the ‘windfall’ gain from each mine. However, in a rush to give a report, average numbers were used. If mine-wise analysis, based on facts, had been made, allocation of only those mines would have been cancelled where there was a windfall gain.. There were indeed some mines where there were huge margins and the allocation of such mines deserved to be cancelled but we ended up dumping all the allocations lock, stock and barrel.

The next logical question would be, if margins were not so high, how did the government manage to garner an estimated amount of Rs 1.96 lakh crores by way of auction of only 31 mines that were auctioned in 2015? We must look at the context of the auctions. The bidding in the auction was decided by the following factors.

1. Perceived (actual) shortage of coal in the country
2. Uncertainty about imported coal price and availability
3. Committed expenditure in fixed assets like power/steel plants that were ready for production.
4. Uncertainty about the future availability of coal blocks.

All the above factors led to ‘irrational bidding’ for most of the blocks. The auctioned blocks were supposed to have produced 56 million tonnes annually but are producing, on an average, only 16 million tonnes per annum so far. A number of blocks haven’t even started production.

Ironically for 9 blocks put on auction during the 4th round during 2016, there were hardly any takers. No auction took place thereafter though there are still 120 blocks left. If CAG’s calculations are extrapolated, there is still around Rs 3.13 lakh crore tied up in these blocks. If there was a margin of Rs 295/- per tonne, why were there no takers?

What the CAG could not visualize was the impact of Coal India production on price of coal available in India. As the production of coal increased, and as the availability improved, thee-auction price of Coal India came down substantially. This affected the desire of the entrepreneur to go for coal blocks. By clubbing all the blocks together in deciding the ‘right’ and the ‘wrong’, enormous damage was done. The fact that some of the blocks were auctioned for more than Rs 295/- per tonne does not justify determination of ‘windfall’ about all the blocks. Like a true auditor (and not an accountant), details should have been worked out for each block. Averages do not work in such situations.

Vinod Rai states in his book that “All the records showed was that the Committee met, deliberated and merely recorded the name of the block allotted to a company, and the state where the end-use plant existed.”He finds fault with this. As an ex-civil servant, he should know that that is how the minutes are recorded, especially when there is a consensus. It is only when there is a difference of opinion that such an opinion and the reasons for over ruling it are recorded. The CAG, it appeared was on a faultfinding mission. Hence, apart from finding fault where it did exist, also found fault where it did not.

The job of any civil servant, more so of the CAG, is to do his job quietly and not go to town (though this is changing fast). Gauging the mood of the country, the CAG Report was ‘launched’ at a Press Conference. The image of Dy.CAG f lashing the report before the media is etched in everyone’s memory. Yes, a wrong had been committed. Yes, it is the job of the CAG to detect these ‘wrongs’. Yes, it is also the job of CAG to inform the Parliament about the wrongs. However, perhaps making public spectacle of the report was not becoming of a civil servant. In his book ‘Not Just an Accountant’, Vinod Rai justifies going to the media. He was right in doing so. However, he played to gallery in the way the Press Meet was organised by the CAG. He has set a precedent where future CAGs may also want to become Vinod Rais. His immediate successor did try to become one (narrated in another chapter) but met with a stiff resistance from a much stronger government.

Had the CAG taken care to go into the details of each mine and had it not taken the ‘half-truth’ to town, the consequences on the decision making process would not have been so devastating. Bureaucratic decision making suffered enormously. It is a moot point whether the high profiling of the Report by the CAG was essential to correct the system. It would be too much to credit the CAG for the transparency that came about in the later auctions of the coal blocks. Transparency came because of the commitment of the new government. Transparency was in areas where the CAG had no role to play whatsoever.

The CAG Report impacted governance adversely. The bureaucracy, in any case risk averse, became even more conservative in terms of making commitments on the file. They were now playing ‘safer’. This attitude was in evidence during the examination of bids when the auctions were conducted after the cancellation of allocation of coal blocks by the Supreme Court. The junior officers did not commit themselves on the files while making recommendations. Concrete recommendations on the bids were initiated at the level of Secretary. The confidence of the civil servants stood shattered as a consequence of what happened to officers like Mr Harish Chandra Gupta, the then Coal Secretary on account of the fallout of the CAG Report. The CAG report itself did not fix any responsibility. However, by making a public spectacle of the Report, it created a public hysteria where someone had to be nailed. Unfortunately, those that were nailed were the hapless civil servants, like Mr Gupta and the person who had taken the decision to allocate the mines went scot free.

40,2018-12-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Eight million tonnes of domestic coal extracted by private producers is expected to be commercially available for the first time in the open market after five-six years, a move that will end Coal India’s monopoly which has been the sole domestic supplier of the dry fuel for the past four decades after the sector was nationalised in the 1940s.

The government has already set the ball rolling this year and on Wednesday, iron & steel, cement and captive power plants were to submit technical bids for 18 coal blocks from which they can sell 25% of their production in the open market at Coal India prices.

However, following requests of potential bidders and also considering the number of requests received through email, the centre has decided to extend the timelines for various stages of the auction. According to the revised timeline, the last date for submitting technical bids is now January 2, 2019, while price-based bidding for block auction would be held between January 14 and January 27, 2019. This is for the second time that the timelines are being extended.

Nevertheless, the blocks on offer are scheduled to have a total peak rated production capacity of around 32 million tonnes of which eight million tonnes can be sold in the open market.

The process of coal block allocation was pushed on to a slow track last August when the fifth tranche of the coal block auctions did not evoke the necessary interest from the bidders.

On Wednesday, bids would be submitted by interested parties for the sixth and seventh tranche of the coal blocks auctions. In fact, the government has decided to offer the same set of blocks in the seventh tranche that were offered in the fifth block which did not generate much interest.

As per the clauses for this round of auction, the time limit for starting production from each of these mines has been increased to five years from four.

The government had initially offered 13 blocks for the sixth tranche, but it pulled off Odisha’s Jamkhani block from the list a few days ago. Cement and captive power plants can bid for these blocks.

The centre has put on the block Brahampuri in Madhya Pradesh for this tranche which is expected to produce 0.36 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) at peak rated capacity (PRC). Three blocks from Jharkhand are on offer — Bundu (PRC 1 mtpa), Chitarpur (PRC 3.45 mtpa) and Gondulpara (PRC 4 mtpa).

In Maharashtra too, three blocks — Gondkari (PRC 1 mtpa), Khappa & Extn (PRC 0.30 mta) and Marki Mangli (PRC 0.20 mtpa) — are on offer."

The BJP regime and Coal India have ramped up production and dispatched over the last four financial years FY14 to FY18 but cost creep, volatile e-auction pricing and poor fuel supply agreement pricing have kept profits in check during FY15-FY18 period, said HDFC Securities.

Having little leeway to alter prices for around 80 per cent of its volumes, the company’s pricing power is also restricted, the brokerage added.

44,2018-12-21,Coal India,"Four Central unions at Coal India (CIL) have called a two-day strike from January 8, demanding more money and no further sale of government stake.

This can lead to a loss of Rs 450 crore in revenue and 3.4 million tonnes of output at a time when 13 power plants have critically low stocks of coal.

CITU, HMS, AITUC and INTUC, representing a majority of 280,000 CIL workers, are serving individual strike notices to the management. BMS will stay off the strike.

The demands include a minimum wage of Rs 18,000 per month, pension of at least Rs 3,000 per month, discontinuation of privations of PSUs, including CIL, equal salaries and benefits for contract workers and removal of ceiling for bonus, ESI, provident fund and gratuity.

46,2018-12-22,Coal India,"Mumbai: Indian stocks nosedived on Friday, with benchmark indices sliding about 2 per cent each, on concerns that the global economy led by the US was headed into protracted slowdown even as an anticipated wave of competitive populism ahead of next year’s general elections threatens to worsen New Delhi’s fiscal arithmetic.

Local shares, which had withstood a global equity rout over the past week and remained a regional outperformer, ceded ground on Friday after the latest interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve late Wednesday underscored the likelihood of liquidity tightening in major financial hubs across the world.

The Sensex tumbled 689.60 points, or 1.9 per cent, to close at 35,742.07 while Nifty slumped 197.70 points, or 1.8 per cent, to end at10,754. The MidCap index on the BSE lost 1.8 per cent and the SmallCap index ended down 1 per cent. Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS, and HDFC Bank led the decliners. The market’s fear gauge, the India VIX, climbed 11.6 per cent.

“There is concern about the global fall. The market is also worried about the farm loan waivers across different states and what effect those could have on the Indian economy,” said A Balasubramanian, chief executive officer, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. “There is concern that farm loan waivers would be good for consumption, but it is coming at a cost to the government’s fiscal health.”

Several states, including Assam, Chhattisgarh, MP and Rajasthan, announced farm loan waivers this week.


Wary of more populist measures ahead of polls

Market participants are concerned that more such populist measures may be announced ahead of the 2019 general elections.

To be sure, some profit booking after the recent rally also exacerbated Friday’s slide in the benchmark indices.

The advance-decline ratio was heavily in favour of decliners, with about 1,700 stocks falling in Friday’s trade compared with 863 that advanced. Provisional data showed that foreign portfolio investors net bought Indian shares worth Rs 134 crore while domestic institutional investors net sold shares worth Rs 488.55 crore.

Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Wipro, Maruti Suzuki India, Infosys and TCS lost 3-4 per cent each, and were among the worst performers on the Sensex. NTPC and Coal India were the only two gainers, ending with marginal advances.

Elsewhere in Asia, markets in Japan, China and Singapore ended down 0.1-1.1 per cent, while Taiwan ended flat and Hong Kong gained 0.5 per cent.

“It is mainly the global factors that are pulling the markets down. The next few months are going to be volatile,” said Andrew Holland, chief executive officer, Avendus Capital-Alternate Strategies.

Friday’s decline led to the benchmark indices slumping on a weekly basis as well. Factors such as declining oil prices, recapitalisation of state-run banks, and liquidity boosting measures by the central bank were outweighed by the weakness in global markets and the mounting concerns over farm-loan waivers.

“Going forward, the BJP’s loss in the state elections in the three key majorly rural states and food deflation for two consecutive months have heightened the possibility of an all-India farm loan waiver, notwithstanding the constrained resources of the Centre, and… the failure of the 2008-09 Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme to achieve its intended outcome,” said JM Financial in a note. “This has put the general government consolidated fiscal deficit target under additional pressure,” the broking house said in the note."

49,2018-12-24,Coal India,"KOLKATA: By opening the door to private players for commercial mining, the coal sector this year witnessed its biggest reform in over four decades.

However, it may still take some five-seven years before coal blocks are auctioned and results become visible as exploration and mine development for actual production of private commercial mines begin, say people associated with the coal sector.

But, this has not deterred the management of Coal India to sensitise its employees about the looming threat that the private sector poses in the long run.

The world's biggest coal miner has asked its staff to pull up their socks and embrace the new challenges facing them.

Former Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya observed that revenue maximisation should not be the only focus of the auction methodology and mining experience and core competence should get more weightage in the bidding process.

He emphasised that in order to attract large domestic and global miners it is important to offer larger coal blocks, such as 50 MT annual capacity or more, for a period of about 25-30 years.

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier said the reform is expected to bring efficiency to the coal sector by moving from an era of monopoly to competition.

India is said to have coal reserves of up to 300 billion tonnes. The move of ending monopoly will also lead to greater energy security as 70 per cent of India's electricity is generated from thermal power plants.

State-owned Coal India and Singareni Collieries Company together accounted for 91.6 per cent of the total coal produced in the country during FY2017-18.

According to observers, CIL is unlikely to face major issue from privatisation beyond competitive pressure, as its prices are not import-linked and always been at a sharp discount despite its monopolistic position.

Coal consumers are hoping that the move would address their long-pending demand of supply and quality constraints.

""Allowing private sector in coal mining is likely to increase supply and a competitive scenario will help in improving quality,"" said Subhashri Chaudhuri, secretary general of the Coal Consumers Association of India.

This far, coal mines were auctioned only for captive power generation.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in February this year approved the methodology for auction of coal mines for sale of coal, the most ambitious coal sector reform since its nationalisation in 1973.

The year also saw a sharp rise in dry fuel demand from the power sector owing to rise in electricity demand, drop in hydel generation among a few others and that led to higher coal imports as Coal India failed to meet the 'sudden' spike in demand.

From April 1, 2018, to October 12 2018, Coal India Ltd had despatched 1.27 million tonnes (MT) of coal per day to the power sector as compared to 1.16 MT per day during the same period last year, a rise of 9 per cent.

Overall, coal and coke imports during the first half of the current fiscal increased by 13.9 per cent to 119.42 MT.

There had been allegations of the shortage of coal by several power plants during the last peak summer season. But, the allegations of short supply were also from non-power consumers also.

Vedanta Ltd CEO Abhijit Pati recently complained saying, ""Due to coal scarcity, power plants are operating at 60-70 per cent of their installed capacity which is ultimately hampering the interests of the state and nation.""

Owing to demand pressure, Coal India recently revised its production target to 652 million tonnes in FY2018-19 against the earlier estimate of 630 million tonnes.

But, CIL chairman A K Jha had termed the revised production target of 652 million tonnes as 'aspirational'.

Northern Coalfields Ltd chairman P K Sinha said production is also linked to evacuation issues and unless it is addressed mere higher production will not help in actual supply.

However, he said, several railway projects been taken up for new or doubling the lines including in the NCL areas and once completed these would help sharp increase in coal desptach to consumers."
50,2018-12-25,Coal India,"In an effort to support Make in India, Coal India (CIL), for the first time, has started using an indigenously-made, 205-tonne electric dumper, a critical piece of equipment in mining. The dumper has been developed by state-owned BEML and is expected to increase competition among suppliers, bring down costs and improve availability of spares. The electric dump truck is on trial at one of the largest Coal India subsidiaries, Northern Coalfields’ Amlohri coal mine, where all low-capacity dumpers are being replaced by larger ones. This e-dumper is the biggest deployed at NCL. 

“If the dumper can successfully complete its trial run of six months, BEML will be able to participate in tenders for higher capacity dumpers floated by Coal India. One such tender has been recently floated, which involves procuring 96 high capacity dumpers for NCL at a maximum cost of `1,500 crore. Another set of 10 dumpers is being procured for Eastern Coalfields,” said a senior executive from Northern Coalfields. NCL chairman and managing director PK Sinha said, “The use of latest and modern technology in various works related to coal production and dispatch has always been the basis of NCL’s success stories. Deployment of this indigenously-developed electric dumper will strengthen NCL’s preparedness to further new targets.” 

At present, equipment supply to Coal India is dominated by a Russia’s Belaz, Tata Hitachi and Caterpillar and each of these high-capacity dumpers come at prices upwards of Rs 15 crore. “The BEML dumper is expected to perform exceptionally well on haul roads with low maintenance and is equipped with hydraulic brakes, a modern dashboard, ergonomically-designed seat and emergency steering,” said Sinha. According to an NCL executive, requirement for dumpers and shovels are expected to rise in the near future and the plan is to phase out 10 cubic meter shovels with 20 cubic meter ones that would require higher capacity dumpers to carry the load."
51,2018-12-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has managed to command an average premium of one and half times the floor price for 5.99 million tonnes (mt) coal booked by consumers in the non-power sector at a recent e-auction for five-year supply term. 

Indian Captive Power Producers Association secretary Rajiv Agrawal said: “Such increase in auction premium is the result of coal shortage created due to various government actions, including stoppage of imports for blending by public sector generators and diversion of rakes from private sector coal consumers to government generators.” 

On offer was 6.2 mt coal from six Coal India subsidiaries meant for sectors other than power, cement, sponge iron and steel. Sectors that participated in the auction included small fertilisers, dyes, chemicals, paints and aluminium, among others. 

“As much as 96% of the coal on offer was booked at an average premium of 54% over the notified price of coal for the non-power sector. The actual premium managed by Coal India would be 20% more for coal grades between G6 and G17, since they are priced 20% higher than the power sector,” a senior Coal India executive told ET. 


Others

“Rising import dependence, increased seaborne thermal coal prices, sharp rupee depreciation and rising spot e-auction coal prices are estimated to have led to a rise in coal costs for players depending on mix of e-auction and imported coal,” said Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president at ICRA. 

Highest average premium was managed by Coal India subsidiary South Eastern Coalfields at 85%. It saw around 6 lakh tonnes of coal booked by bidders. This was followed by Mahanadi Coalfields managing an average premium of 84%. Bidders booked 1.4 mt of coal from the subsidiary. Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said: “With increased demand, quantum of coal under spot e-auction should have been increased, however, it is surprising that the quantum shows a decline leading to 50% increase in prices.”"
56,2018-12-26,Coal India,"Prabhudas Lilladher has a hold call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 270.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 249.75.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target. 


View of the brokerage

Rich dividend yield on depressed earnings: Impacted by grade slippages, wage revision and elevated capex, COAL’s FCFE grew at a tepid CAGR of 2.5 per cent over FY14-FY18 less than half of growth in volumes. We expect FCFE growth to languish between 2.0-2.2 per cent in FY19e-FY21e due to stable earnings growth and high capex intensity with investments in non-core businesses like Fertilizer and Power Plant. Investors would start getting nervous in FY21e for the next wage revision due in July-2021. Hence, we believe that high dividend high is just a mirage built on weak earnings base.


Opening up of the coal sector to gather pace: Given the poor show by COAL, we strongly believe that Govt of India would take decisive action by allowing the merchant mining and auction of more coal blocks for power and non-power sector. Admittedly, it is a time-consuming policy enabler; but it would pose a strong challenge to monopolistic stature of COAL’s operations. Non-power FSAs and E-auction business would face the headwind due to poor quality of service and high prices. Prices in Power FSAs would rise at slow pace due to highly sensitive customer base and nature of contracts.


Cut in target price led by earnings downgrade and valuation derating: Driven by cut in overall volume growth and E-auction volume estimates, we cut our EPS estimates by 7 per cent/10 per cent for FY19e/FY20e. Given the unimpressive earnings outlook, capital misallocation and visible policy headwinds, we trim our P/E multiple by 9 per cent to 10.0x FY20e. Hence, we downgrade the stock to HOLD with revised target price of Rs 270 (earlier Rs 330)."
55,2018-12-26,Coal India,"With the coal demand from power sector exceeding the supply in 2018, the government is hopeful of higher output in the new year from already allocated mines and plans to further allot 10 mines to state-run behemoth Coal India Ltd (CIL) in 2019.

Of the 85 mines already allotted, 23 have already started production and the Coal Ministry expects 20 more mines to begin production in the current financial year ending March 2019 or early in the next fiscal.

""This will increase our production substantially... This will also address additional coal demand from power sector,"" Coal Joint Secretary Ashish Upadhyaya told PTI.

Moreover, the government also plans to allot 10 mines to CIL in 2019, he said. This would be in addition to 10 mines allotted to the PSU this year.

""Our aim is to make all subsidiaries (of CIL) 100 million tonnes plus units in the long term,"" he said.

Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.

Talking about the coal shortage in 2018, Upadhyaya said it has happened because of the power sector demand having gone up substantially and attempts were made to meet this challenge of increased demand consistently through the year.

He said the government was actually able to meet the coal demand, but fuel stocks available at the power houses at times went down to the level of 3-4 days.

""And the number of critical power houses had gone up to 33 in the month of May, but gradually it is coming down. Now it is around 10. And the stock available at the power houses has also gone up to approximately 10 days... We hope to improve it further,"" he said.

""Ideally it (coal stock) should be for 21 days, but let's see how demand fluctuates,"" the senior official said.

Over the years, the coal production generally picks up in the third and fourth quarters and this trend was seen in 2018 as well, he added.

""So production is going up. If the demand remains stable, then the stock will start picking up,"" Upadhyaya said.

He said the government is committed to make coal available as per the demand in 2019 and the target is for 10 per cent growth rate in the next fiscal.

The sector has seen production growth of around 8 per cent in 2018 till date, which is ""quite good"" in comparison to the trend of past two years, the official said.

""The momentum which is being seen this year will continue in the next year.....We will be able to do much better next year in terms of production. Ultimately, it is the availability of coal that matters and how much coal we produce and put in the system,"" he explained.

""If the demand from the power sector does not shoot up drastically, we will be able to manage. We will put more and more mines that has already being allocated ((into production) ,"" he said.

On challenges faced in 2018, Upadhyaya said there was also an issue regarding import substitution because of the rising prices of the dollar.

""The effort was to supply more and more from the domestic sector and so it had put more pressure on the coal sector to supply from our own resources. So it has been overall a mixed feeling of satisfaction of doing 8 per cent growth,"" he said.

On achievements of his ministry in 2018, he said a fresh round of captive coal auctions kick-started in October this year after a gap of about 15 months.

""In 2017-18 we didn't get good response. It (coal auctions) had to be postponed. But in October this year, we started the process of coal mines auction and the response so far has been good. We have been able to get enough interest. Our bid documents have been sold and hopefully we will do better,"" he said.

The government has permitted captive coal block owners to sell 25 per cent of their production in open market and provided some flexibility in coal output.

The coal ministry had in October invited tenders seeking bids for 18 captive coal blocks to non-power plants in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.

Due to a lull seen earlier, a high-power expert committee was constituted to look into the reasons and they opined that there were some tough efficiency parameters and also suggested ""some sweetener"" in form of some portion of the coal being sold in the open market.

Upadhyaya said both the recommendations were being accepted.

In June this year, the AAP government in Delhi had written to Union Power Minister R K Singh that the national capital was staring at a power blackout due to the fast depleting coal stock at power plants in the city.

Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain had earlier also said that some thermal power generation stations were facing ""acute coal shortage"" for many days due to non-availability of transportation rakes.

Citing acute shortage of coal in thermal power plants in Karnataka, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy had also urged Coal Minister Piyush Goyal to ensure adequate supply to the state."

Meanwhile, PM struts about on Bogibeel Bridge posing for cameras. His government refuses to organise high pressure pumps for the rescue. PM please save the miners.

Modi was in Assam on Tuesday to inaugurate India’s longest road-cum-rail bridge Bogibeel Bridge in Upper Assam’s Dibrugarh.

The chief minister stated, ""Situation right now is very difficult .Almost entire River came into the mine,12 lakh litres of water have been pumped out .Water level is rising"".

He added, “We are in process to get high power pump. It’s not time to play politics on it .There is no question of calling off the operation. The operation is going to go to a different level now. Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is in touch and helping us. We will continue trying and give more efforts.”

There is apprehension that rescue operation has suffered due to lack of equipments. The chief minister has written to Coal India requesting for the high-powered pumps.

Congress legislature party will soon visit the area. On April 17 2014, National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned the rat hole mining, a practice unique to Meghalaya.

These mines are termed as the ‘rat mines’ of Meghalaya for its crude holes dug into the hills which are narrow in diameter. The indigenous population engages in traditional method of mining and ownership is with the community.

In a similar incident in 2012 around 15 miners were trapped in an illegal rat-hole coal mine near the Nangalbibra area in South Garo Hills in 2012. The bodies were never recovered."
57,2018-12-26,Coal India,"The ruling NPP-BJP in Meghalaya on Wednesday contested Congress president Rahul Gandhi's jibe on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over 15 labourers trapped in a coal mine, saying the state government is making efforts to rescue them.

In a sharp attack against Modi, the Congress chief said 15 labourers trapped in the mine in Meghalaya since December 13 struggled for air while he strutted about on Assam's Bogibeel Bridge posing for cameras.

The prime minister inaugurated the bridge on Brahmaputra river Tuesday. 



Gandhi also urged Modi to organise high pressure pumps for the rescue of the miners over media reports that the operation to rescue them is hampered by lack of equipment.

Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma, without mentioning Gandhi's comment, said there is no inaction and that the administration and the NDRF had really worked hard to trace the miners, but, unfortunately, the operation did not yield any result.

So far, 12 lakh litres of water has been pumped out of the mine, but it seems the whole river has gushed into the pit. Getting high-powered pumps and transporting them to the site of the mishap is not an easy task, he told a private news.

On if the rescue operation could be called off under such circumstances, Sangma said there is no question of aborting the rescue work.

The chief minister also hoped that the high-powered pumps would be available soon.

Sangma-led NPP's ally in the state, the BJP, also said the Meghalaya government is doing its best under the chief minister's leadership to bring the victims out of the rat-hole mine in East Jaintia Hills district.

 ""The government has done and is doing its best under Sangma. We have full faith in him. He has taken up the matter with the central government to send bigger pumps,"" BJP Minister A L Hek told PTI.

 The state government tried its best but water at the mine has not receded, he said.

 The chief minister has written to Coal India requesting for the high-powered pumps, the BJP leader said.

 East Jaintia Hills Deputy Commissioner F M Dopth said district authorities have taken up the matter with the state government and is awaiting a response.

 The high-powered pumps, as advised by ace mining mishap expert Jaswant Singh Gill, are not available in the entire North East region, as far as we are aware, Dopth told PTI.

 Dopth, who ordered temporary suspension of rescue operation last Saturday, said until the bigger pumps are made available, the operations cannot resume.

Congress spokesperson H M Shangpliang told PTI that with Gandhi's intervention, ""we hope the Centre will direct the state government to change its insensitive attitude and do what is necessary to help save lives"". 

He said a special team of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) will soon visit the site at Lumthari village and will try and meet the affected families.

However, a senior member of the ruling National Peoples Party (NPP) criticised the Congress, saying the opposition party was creating a ""fuss"" over the entire December 13 episode.

""The Congress has forgotten what happened in 2012 when it abandoned the 14 miners who were trapped when a mine collapsed in South Garo Hills. Then the UPA and the Congress were in power. What have they done?"" the NPP leader said, requesting anonymity.

""The chief minister is taking special interest in this case and is trying to retrieve the miners dead or alive,"" he said. In the 2012 case, none of the victims could be retrieved out of the mine and ""I do not remember compensation was paid to any of the affected families by the then Congress government,"" the NPP leader said."

Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma and Union Minister of state for Home Kiren Rijiju stated that the government in association with the Centre doing best to rescue the miners.

The ban on coal mining by NGT in Meghalaya was one of the major issue in assembly election held early this year. On April 17 2014, NGT banned the rat hole mining, a practice unique to Meghalaya. Economy of Assam and Meghalaya is hard hit following the ban.

70,2018-12-28,Coal India,"Indian Navy divers on Saturday will join the operation underway to rescue 15 miners trapped inside a flooded rat-hole coal mine in Meghalaya since December 13, officials said Friday.

The Navy spokesman said in a tweet that a 15-member diving team from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh will reach the site in the remote Lumthari village in East Jaintia Hills district Saturday morning.

""The team is carrying specialised diving equipment including a re-compression chamber and remotely operated vehicles capable of searching underwater,"" he said.

The Navy carried out an initial assessment on Friday to determine an effective response.

Pump manufacturing company Kirloskar Brothers Ltd and Coal India were jointly moving 18 high-powered pumps to drain water out of the 37-foot-deep mine. A team of surveyers from the two companies also conducted an on-the-spot assessment of the situation.

They will submit a report to East Jaintia Hills district authorities on the technicalities about positioning pumps for effectively carrying the operation, officials at the site said.

The team would carry special diving equipment including a remote-operated vehicle capable of conducting underwater search.

The Air Force has airlifted 10 pumps from Bhubaneswar. Its personnel have landed in Guwahati, 270 kilometres away from the coal mine, official sources said.

The mine got flooded when water from the nearby Lytein river gushed into it on December 13, trapping the 15 diggers.

A PTI reporter who went to the site on Friday reported that the mine is located on top of a hillock fully covered with trees. To reach the mine, a person has to pass the 30-foot wide Lytein river three times.

No habitation was found nearby and 80-90 illegal coal mines dot the area.

The reporter was told by locals that the illegal private mine was closed for a long time and opened for mining 2-3 days before the the miners were trapped on December 13.

The mine is owned by Krip Schullet, a local who has been arrested since the incident came to the adminstration's knowledge, state officials said.

General Manager of North Eastern Coalfields J Bora arrived with two officials of the company Friday and they were followed by a 10-member team of experts of the Coal India (CIL) to the site to assess the situation, they said.

Bora said CIL is arranging eight high-powered pumps for the rescue operation.

""We are waiting for the initial 10 high-powered pumps. They will be brought here this evening,"" the Superintendent of Police said.

The high-powered pumps will be transported by road from Guwahati till about two kilometres from the accident site. From there, vehicles have been requisitioned to carry them to the mine, a senior district official said.

Meanwhile, a 20-member team of the Odisha Fire Services Friday left for Shillong with equipment, including high-powered pumps, high-tech equipment and gadgets to assist the local administration in the search and rescue operation, a report from Bhubaneswar said.

Pumping of water from the mine was suspended on Saturday as there was no visible receding of the water level in it. The district authorities had written to the state government seeking high-powered pumps as the two 25 hp pumps, which were being used, were found to be inadequate, an official of the NDRF, which is involved in the rescue operation, said.

The incident has become a political issue after Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted about it and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help save the miners.

Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in the national capital Thursday.

The National Disaster Response Force on Thursday contradicted media reports which quoted it as saying the trapped minors were suspected to be dead on the basis of the foul odour the force's divers had smelt when they had gone inside the mine.

It said the foul smell could be due to the stagnant water in the mine as pumping had been halted for more than 48 hours.

Rat-hole mining involves digging of narrow tunnels, usually 3-4 feet high, for workers to enter and extract coal. The horizontal tunnels are often termed ""rat-holes"" as each just about fits one person."
71,2018-12-28,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Capital markets regulator Sebi Friday expanded its offer for sale (OFS) framework to all the companies with market capitalisation of Rs 1,000 crore and above.

Currently, the OFS framework is available to top 200 companies by market capitalisation.

Also, if the seller fails to get sufficient demand from non-retail investors at or above the floor price on the first day of offer, then the seller may choose to cancel the offer post bidding, in full (both retail and non-retail), on the first day itself and not proceed with the offer to retail investors on the second day.

""OFS mechanism shall be available to companies with market capitalisation of Rs 1,000 crore and above, with the threshold of market capitalisation computed as the average daily market capitalization for six months period prior to the month in which the OFS opens,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular.

The mechanism has been successfully used to divest stake by promoters and large shareholders.

The move comes after the board of Sebi approved a proposal in this regard earlier this month.

According to a report by Prime Database, a total of Rs 10,678 crore have been raised through the OFS mechanism this year. The largest OFS was that of Coal India (Rs 5,274 crore) followed by Larsen & Toubro Infotech (Rs 1,846 crore)."

Coal India Limited has started sending high power pumps from its different subsidiaries across India. 

A senior official in CIL, who do not want to be named, told ET, “State government has sought pumps and we have started sending it. Surveyors and experts from the CIL have reached the site.”

A two-member team from Kirloskar Brothers' Limited has already reached the site.

A team from congress legislature party on Friday visited the site. Congress MLA and former minister, Ampareen Lyngdoh told ET , “The situation is bleak and grim. Three or four agencies are working there but there is no one to co-ordinate. The deputy commissioner of the district is on leave and there is no other person entrusted to carry out co-ordination work.”

“There is no medical facility and there is no power supply. The equipment is coming by road from Guwahati. There is need to put a co-ordinating agency,” she said.

She added, “The water level in the mine site is still rising and no one knows from where this waters are gushing. Experts and surveyors must be deployed to identify from where water is coming. 

Meghalaya government on Thursday said it will not call off the rescue operation. Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said that the challenge that the state is facing now is how to get the logistics.” We are in touch with the Central government and we have been assured of all their support”.

The district administration has temporarily suspended pumping of water from the coal pit since December 24.

74,2018-12-29,Coal India,"There are some signs of bottoming out in mid and smallcap segments, said Amitabh Sonthalia of SKS Capital, who is holding on to a reasonably high cash level. In an interview to ET Now, Sonthalia said one may strictly avoid low quality names at the moment given the likely volatility in the next 3-6 months. Excerpts:ET Now: Which cycle of the bull market do you think are we in? We have managed to defend ourselves a fair bit all of 2018. What were the top highlights for you that impacted the domestic equity market in the year?Amitabh Sonthalia: 2018 has been a very difficult year for investors as most of the portfolios have underperformed the market. Even as the frontline indices have done well, they peaked out in the middle of the year. Most small and midcap indices had already peaked out in January. The small cap index is down about 40 per cent for the year and its chart pattern is somewhat similar to 2008. As they say history does not really repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes. In that sense, we have had a year which is reminiscent of 2008.ET Now: While we can feel happy about the fact that the Nifty and Sensex are in the positive for the year, individual portfolios are very much bleeding. Do you believe that the broader market has also bottomed out or do you think that we are bound to see more pain for the broader end of the market while stepping into 2019?Amitabh Sonthalia: Just like in 2008 where the bulk of the fall was seen October-November months, we saw similar chart pattern this year. We see some signs of bottoming out in small and midcap spaces, both technically and fundamentally. We are yet to see a period of consolidation in the next three to six months. It will coincide with elections in May. I expect the volatility to continue in the next three to six months. But bulk of the price risk is out of the system. I see a favourable risk-reward environment for investing in small and midcap stocks from a one-year perspective.ET Now: In the year gone by, the market gave you enough opportunities. In 2017, valuation was a concern. But you could not complain of that in 2018, at least in some concentrated pockets. What is it that you have bought recently? What looks interesting to you right now?Amitabh Sonthalia: I have been on the sidelines and holding on to a reasonably high cash level as I expect volatility and consolidation to continue in the next few months. However, I am happy to bite the bullet, as and when opportunities present themselves or one comes across relatively safe ideas. One such opportunity was in the CPSE ETF. When I looked at the components of the ETF, they were all attractively priced. In terms of price action, those stocks were at multi-year lows and had valuations at almost half of the market PE. They had single digit PE ratios, high dividend yields and businesses which are relatively stable. Their businesses have no threat of disruption as some are monopolies such as NTPC, Bharat Electronics, Coal India or IOC. The reason they are probably at these levels is due to the irrational selling by the government, the promoter via repeated follow on offerings. But hopefully, over a year’s time, once the disinvestment targets are met, these companies should revert to their mean.ET Now: 2018 also saw election outcome in three states completely going against what the market would have like irrespective of that the markets actually rose up. Would you say that elections, given their actual bearing on the market, is a little overrated?Amitabh Sonthalia: Going by this month’s price action, it seems like the recent setback was well absorbed. It also reminds us that politics matter lesser than what we think or believe. It might be the harbinger of things to come. May be that market will place less importance on that than they have last few months and hopefully it will make our lives easier if they do so.ET Now: How are approaching the low oil price environment and low valuations for the mid and the smallcap segments?Amitabh Sonthalia: The crash in oil prices makes India macro trade really attractive. This is other than the obvious plays such as oil marketing companies and airlines, which have already done well. There are also a lot of derived plays which are beneficiaries of lower oil price. A lot of companies and sectors have input cost, which are a derivate of the oil price. Paint is a good example. Of course, markets are very quick to react to such triggers. Most of the stocks, which are obvious beneficiaries, have all moved up very sharply. One has to keep looking for second level thinking. Auto sector could potentially revive as the cost of ownership come down with lower oil prices. Cement had got hit due to high oil prices and therefore could be another potential beneficiary sector.
ET Now: Your call on NBFC crisis in 2018 hit the bull’s eye. But what are the things that worry you?

Amitabh Sonthalia: We are not completely out of the woods as far as the shakeout in NBFCs is concerned. We seem to have somewhat hit a bottom for now. But in India, there are always surprises in store for us. We do not know what disclosures are yet to be made by certain banks or NBFCs and clearly the last few months has separated the men from the boys. The confidence has shaken. It has sort of exposed the chinks in the armour. I would not be too confident about going in and betting on some of the lower quality names at the moment."

0,2019-01-01,Coal India,"The government raised a record Rs 77,417 crore from sale of its stake in public sector units in 2018, and the disinvestment programme is headed for another blockbuster year in 2019 with planned privatisation of national carrier Air India. 

The BJP-led NDA, which in its previous stint privatised the most number of PSUs ever, continues to shy away from the outright sale of bluechip state firms to the private sector in the present regime and is instead pursuing a newfound strategy of merging companies to meet its revenue targets. 

While big-ticket disinvestments, including ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, CPSE ETF, Bharat-22 ETF, and Coal India stake sale, along with 6 initial public offerings (IPO) brought Rs 77,417 crore to the government coffers last year, while the year was marred by botched attempt of the government to sell 74 per cent stake in Air India. 

The government has now firmed up a fresh plan for the sale of the airline. As part of the plan, it will sell subsidiaries, like Air India Air Transport Service Ltd (AIATSL), Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL), and land and building assets of Air India separately to help trim Rs 29,000 crore debt burden of the national carrier. 

Alongside, the government will continue to infuse funds into the airline to keep it viable, and finally sell it after extensive deliberations with potential investors to ensure that the airline gets the best valuation. 

The subsidiaries and assets alone are expected to fetch the government close to Rs 9,000 crore. 

The first off the blocks in strategic sale plan for 2019 will be Pawan Hans where the government holds 51 per cent, while oil major ONGC holds the remaining stake. The sale of helicopter service provider Pawan Hans is expected to be completed by March. 

Besides, buyback programme of as many as 10 CPSEs, including ONGC, Indian Oil Corp, Oil India, NLC, BHEL and NALCO, are on course, which could fetch about Rs 12,000 crore to the exchequer. 

CPSE (Central Public Sector Enterprise) merger and acquisitions will be one of the focus areas of the government this year as it waits to see PFC's (Power Finance Corporation) plan to buy out government stake in Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) for an estimated Rs 15,000 crore fructify. 

The next such M&A deal will be NTPC, buying government stake in SJVN for about Rs 6,000 crore. 

These M&As are being planned in the lines of ONGC-HPCL deal, which happened in January last year. ONGC bought government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. 

Budget targets for disinvestment proceeds are fixed for the financial year beginning April and ending in March. The ONGC-HPCL deal helped the government cross the magical Rs 1 lakh crore mark in disinvestment mop-up in 2017-18 fiscal, up from Rs 72,500 crore target. 

For the ongoing 2018-19 fiscal, which ends in March 2019, the target has been set at Rs 80,000 crore. 

The year 2018 saw IPO of two CPSEs from railway sector -- RITES and IRCON. Four more CPSEs -- Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Dynamics, Mishra Dhatu Nigam and Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers -- also made their debut on the stock exchanges last year. 

With markets remaining volatile for the most part on account of geopolitical tensions and trade war concerns, the offer for sale (OFS) route for CPSE disinvestment was not tapped much in the last year. 

The government raised Rs 5,218 crore from Coal India share sale in November and Rs 1,200 crore from NMDC stake sale in January. 

Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) emerged as the most viable route for CPSE share sale with CPSE ETF garnering Rs 17,000 crore and Bharat-22 ETF Rs 8,325 crore. 

This year will see more of ETF offering, even as the government goes on to test waters with the launch of a debt ETF to help CPSEs and public sector banks to raise capital to meet their capital expenditure needs."

5,2019-01-02,Coal India,"Coal India (CIL) has fulfilled its supply quota to almost all thermal power plants for April-December 2018, but stocks at some 36 plants are down to last between zero to three days due to increased thermal power demand.

A top CIL executive said the dry fuel supplier has increased supplies by 8% to thermal power generators during April-December, 2018.

“Last year Coal India sent close to 332 million tonnes of coal to the sector. This year, it has already sent around 358 million tonnes to the sector during the same period despite which some plants have depleting stocks,” the executive said.

Central Electricity Authority data showed there are 10 power plants with no coal. CEA’s data also suggests that all these plants received coal amounting to either their slotted volume or more than their stipulated quantity for the period.

Coal India, along with thermal power plants, calculates the annual contracted quantity (ACQ) of coal each power plant needs, to generate power at 80% capacity utilisation for a year.

However, CIL does not supply the full quantity of coal required to generate power at 80% for a year. Instead, plants set up before April 2009 receive 90% of their annual contracted coal quantity, while those set up after April 2009 receive 75% of their annual contracted quantity.

“We have already supplied either more than the contracted supply quantities on a pro rata basis to almost all plants or have met our supply obligations. Increased demand for power has forced them to generate extra power leading to depleting stocks” the CIL executive said.

For example, the executive said, NTPC’s Korba Super thermal power station has received 101% of its annual contracted quantity on a pro rata basis between April-December 2018, yet the plant is stuck with zero-day coal stocks as it generated electricity at an average 87% capacity utilisation due to increased demand.

In November the plant generated at almost 94% of its capacity.

“They are producing more than their planned generation, using up stocks faster than anticipated, leading to stock depletion,” he said. CEA data suggests that nine power plants have coal stock for only one day. Out of this eight plants have received between 87% and 109% of their annual contracted quantity of coal.

Another set of six plants is left with stocks for two days, though despite getting between 77% and 107% of their annual contracted quantity. Some six plants are stuck with four-day coal stocks although they have received between 77% and 107% of their annual contracted quantity."
13,2019-01-03,Coal India,"by Anil Swarup

Former Coal Secretary, GoI

Last month, Union coal minister Piyush Goyal publicly stated that India does not have a shortage of coal. However, recent coal import figures tell a different story. Despite sitting on 300 billion tonnes of coal reserves, India has been perennially short of coal.

After the opening up of the power sector in 2004, demand for coal suddenly shot up. Import of 21.7 million tonnes in 2006 grew to 131.3 million tonnes in 2014. Perhaps the only period when there was some level of comfort was between 2014 and 2015 when there was an unprecedented incremental growth of 32 million tonnes in coal production.

Consequently, thermal power plants had an average inventory of coal for more than 20 days. Import of coal came down substantially during 2015-16, resulting in a foreign exchange saving of more than Rs 24,000 crore.

Coal production had increased to unprecedented levels because there was an attempt to find the cause of poor coal production. Among other factors, those relating to land acquisition, environment and forest clearances, and shortage of railway rakes to transport coal were found to be critical.

Even though land acquisition for coal mining was governed by the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, the legislation for land acquisition had brought this process to a grinding halt in most sectors. State governments with the authority to acquire land were, at best, indifferent. Environment and forest clearance was extremely cumbersome, involving numerous layers of bureaucracy.

Most coal lies in inaccessible areas of the country. Hence, transporting it to the location of its use posed additional challenges. Though trains are the most economical way of transporting coal, a large number of mines are not connected to a rail network. Additionally, there was shortage of rakes on account of competing demand from sectors like food and steel.

Anumber of steps were taken to take care of these problems. At the outset, planning for ramping up coal production was undertaken in consultation with stakeholders that included those involved in mining of coal at the ground level. The states, too, were involved as a value proposition.

Excavation of coal resulted in an enormous amount of revenue, and direct and indirect employment opportunities in the states. Meetings with state governments were not held in Delhi. Instead, team of officers from Delhi went down to each state to discuss with senior state officers.

Technology was used extensively to monitor various clearances. A web-based portal, based on the successful Project Monitoring Group’s (PMG), was put in place that was updated real-time. An institutional arrangement was made to meet critical ministries of the railways and the environment and forest every month.

These steps led to land acquisition soaring to 5,500 hectares in 2014-15, and environment and forest clearance reached 3,400 hectares. All this, in turn, helped increase coal production dramatically. So then, why didn’t production grow at the same rate in the years after 2015-16?

One of the biggest contributors to the increase was Coal India Limited chairman-managing director Sutirtha Bhattacharya during 2014-16 who built up a motivated team. However, after his departure, this public sector utility was left virtually headless — rather, with heads changing every few months. Now that Coal India has a chairman with longer tenure, signs of improvement are already visible.

What is NITI Aayog’s prescription? In June 2017, it had floated a paper that recommended the splitting up of Coal India subsidiaries into independent companies. It isn’t clear how such a splitting will lead to an increase in coal production. Now, NITI Aayog is planning to come up with a policy to increase production. Here again, it isn’t clear how a policy would help when the issues that beset the sector are more operational in nature.

GoI has already taken a commendable policy decision to allow commercial mining. The key factor now is to implement this, and not scout for another one.

The factors that limit coal production, as earlier mentioned, are land acquisition, various clearances and evacuation of coal. None of these requires a policy intervention. It requires action on the ground. Can NITI Aayog make things happen on the ground? Should NITI Aayog be entrusted with this task?

The last time coal production was tackled, it was not on account of what NITI Aayog did, but because the ministry understood the nature of the problem, went down to the states to resolve issues, conveyed value proposition to the states and other stakeholders, and played the role of facilitator in helping Coal India achieve record production. It has been done in the past. So, it can be done again."

According to an official bulletin issued by the district administration, state-run Coal India was making preparations to install a 100-hp submersible pump that could discharge 500 gallons of water per minute. This is expected to significantly boost the dewatering work.

A multi-agency team comprising personnel from the Odisha Fire Service, National Disaster Response Force and the Indian Navy among others is working to find the trapped miners. The miners are trapped inside the coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills district since December 13, when water from a nearby river gushed in, puncturing the mine wall."
9,2019-01-03,Coal India,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday a public interest litigation that seeks to enlist army, navy and air force personnel in the efforts to rescue 15 miners trapped underground in a submerged coal mine in Meghalaya.

The miners have been trapped for the last 16 days in a socalled rat hole mine, the type of which dot the terrain despite a top court-imposed ban on such mining.

Though the state government has not called off the rescue operation yet, efforts have been hampered by lack of heavy equipment needed to pump out the water from the mine.

Both the Union and the state governments are parties to the petition filed by lawyer Aditya N Prasad.

The petition was mentioned on Wednesday before Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul. The bench then listed it for Thursday.

The petition seeks a court order to immediately direct the armed forces to move in and rescue the trapped miners, a direction to the state to requisition high capacity self-priming pumps to flush out the water from the mine and a direction to Coal India Ltd to provide the necessary technical know-how, equipment and guidance immediately at the rescue site.

The petition also urges the court to ensure that Coal India and the authorities prepare a standard operating procedure for rescue in mines and similar conditions.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in 2015 banned rat hole mining following allegations that it was turning rivers acidic in the state.

Rat hole mining, a phenomenon unique to Meghalaya, is a mostly unscientific way of private mining involving digging of small holes to ferret out minerals, often with disastrous consequences for the environment and the ecology.

Though the Supreme Court upheld the ban, rat hole mining continues unabated in Meghalaya."
8,2019-01-03,Coal India,"Mumbai: Foreign brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded shares of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Hindalco Industries saying that deteriorating Chinese demand outlook is likely to continue to weigh on commodity prices. The brokerage has cut earnings per share estimates for the FY20-FY21 period by 9-38 per cent to factor in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.


“We expect large cuts to street estimates ahead,” said CLSA.

Shares of Tata Steel ended down 4 per cent at Rs 493.85 on Wednesday while JSW Steel and Hindalco ended down 5 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.

CLSA downgraded Tata Steel to sell from buy and cut target price to Rs 460 from Rs 855. JSW Steel was downgraded to underperform from sell by CLSA and target price was lowered to Rs 260 from Rs 375. The brokerage has downgraded Hindalco to underperform from sell and trimmed target price to Rs 210 from Rs 255.

CLSA has maintained buy rating on Vedanta and Coal India. However, target price for Vedanta has been cut to Rs 250 from Rs 300 while target price for Coal India has been reduced to Rs 310 from Rs 360 by CLSA.

2018 was a tough year for commodities despite decent global growth led by concerns on Chinese demand, escalating trade wars and benign winter cuts in China, said CLSA.

The brokerage said the calendar year 2019 is likely to offer little respite because of the deteriorating Chinese demand outlook.

“...India’s steel market is on the cusp of multi-year tightening due to insufficient capacity additions and we expect imports to rise sharply in coming years. However, the deterioration in global steel industry outlook is weighing down on Indian steel prices, weakening the earnings outlook of the steel companies,” said CLSA.

The brokerage is relatively more positive on Coal India and Vedanta.

The brokerage cut FY20-FY21 EPS estimates for Vedanta by 22-23 per cent on lower oil prices and stronger rupee but added that the company has decent volume growth, better earnings trajectory and an attractive 8 per cent dividend yield, it said.

CLSA sees Coal India as a defensive play amid the global headwinds in the resources sector.

While production growth for Coal India has been patchy but demand outlook for coal in India remains healthy, said CLSA."
12,2019-01-03,Coal India,"NEW DELHI/SHILLONG: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed strong dissatisfaction over the rescue efforts to trace 15 people trapped in a mine in Meghalaya for 22 days, telling the state government to bring them out dead or alive.

The tough talk by the apex court came on a day when the multi-agency operations to rescue the miners failed to make any headway with efforts to pump the water out of the mine not yielding any result.

The 15 miners remain trapped in the 370-foot-deep illegal rat-hole coal mine in Lumthari village of East Jaintia Hills district since December 13 after water from a nearby river gushed in.

""For people who are trapped there, every minute counts,"" the court said and suggested that the help of the Army could be also taken.

Holding that ""prompt, immediate and effective"" operation is needed to rescue the trapped people, the court said there should not be any delay as it was a question of life and death. ""We pray to God that they all are alive.""

A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, to apprise it by Friday the steps which the government intends to take in the matter.

""As the Union, you should do something now. Either you take the help of Army, which has not been done yet. They (Army) are ready and they have volunteered also,"" the bench told Mehta, issuing notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking effective and best rescue measures.

""We are not satisfied (with steps taken for rescue). It is a question of life and death. What has happened in the last so many days we do not know.""

""No matter whether they (trapped persons) are all dead, some alive, few dead or all alive, they should have been taken out by now. We pray to God that they all are alive,"" it said.

Family members of at least seven trapped miners have already given up hope to rescue them alive and requested the state government to retrieve the bodies for last rites.

The divers of the Navy and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were unable to resume the search operation as they could not go inside due to the high water level.

Asked if the divers would take another chance later in the day, operation spokesperson R Susngi told PTI that they would wait, but there was a remote chance of the water level reducing so soon.

Fire Service personnel from Odisha resumed work at 10 am and it was found that the water level rose again, a day after full-day pumping resulted in the water receding by 16 inches, Susngi said.

During the hearing in the apex court, the solicitor general told the bench that several members of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were working at the site and instead of the Army, the government has sent Navy personnel there as the mine was submerged in water.

""72 members of NDRF are already there but still no result,"" the bench observed, adding, ""Why can't you take help of the Army? He (petitioner) says that water pumps were sent to Thailand. Why cannot it (pumps) be used here also?"".

The petitioner said in his plea that Kirloskar Brothers Ltd (KBL) had offered high-powered water pumps and given technical support to the Royal Thai government in June-July 2018 for the operation to rescue a football team trapped inside a cave system in Thailand.

KBL offered to provide four specialised high capacity Autoprime de-watering pumps, which were kept ready at Kirloskarvadi plant in Maharashtra to be airlifted to Thailand.

Mehta, while maintaining that the petition seeking urgent steps for the rescue said he would take instructions in the matter.

He said the Union coal minister had held a meeting, which was attended by the chief minister of Meghalaya, and a nodal officer has been appointed.

""We have requested solicitor general Tushar Mehta to look into it with regard to the urgency involved as it is a question of life and death,"" the court said.

The counsel appearing for the state said adequate steps were taken and besides 72 NDRF personnel, members of state disaster response force, the Navy, fire department and Coal India Ltd were also involved in the rescue operations.

At the outset, the counsel appearing for Meghalaya said they have already taken steps for rescue of these persons.

""What steps have you taken? These miners are trapped there for long time. You may have taken steps but they are still trapped. You need some support from the Central government,"" the bench said.

To this, the state's counsel said the Centre was also lending support to them in the rescue operation.

""Then why you are not successful yet? Is it because of the water?,"" the bench asked.

The state's counsel said the illegal mine where the 15 persons were trapped was connected with a nearby river.

Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for petitioner Aditya N Prasad, told the bench that an adjoining mine was connected with a river and the authorities were using only pumps of 25 horsepower(hp) to flush out the water.

He said the KBL had sent water pumps of 100 horsepower(hp) during the rescue operation in Thailand last year.

""We need a central coordinating machinery to deal with such situations,"" Grover said, claiming that authorities have not taken appropriate steps.

He claimed that persons, who have no prior experience in dealing with this type of situation, have been sent for rescue operation in Meghalaya.

The PIL also sought a direction to the Centre and other authorities concerned to prepare a standard operating procedure (SOP) for rescue operations in ""mines and other similar conditions"".

It sought directions to the Centre and the state to utilise the services of the technical wing of the Indian Armed Forces -- the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force -- in the rescue operation immediately."
18,2019-01-04,Coal India,"SHILLONG: Efforts to rescue the miners trapped in a Meghalaya mine for 23 days made little progress on Friday as most of the pumps brought in to draw the water out are yet to be installed, officials said.

Only three out of the 13 high-powered pumps that were brought to the site could be installed and used so far, operation spokesperson R Susngi told PTI.

Susngi said preparations to install another three pumps are on. ""More pumps will be used in the adjacent shafts and we hope that the pumps from Coal India and Kirloskar Brothers are ready at the earliest so that they can also supplement the dewatering process.""

Fifteen miners remain trapped inside a illegal 'rat-hole' coal mine in Lumthari village of East Jaintia Hills district since December 13 after water from a nearby river gushed in.

Coal India has set up a platform on the old shaft near the mine to install the submersible pump and the operation is expected by Friday. A team from Kirloskar is also preparing to lay the platform to keep their pumps on the main shaft and it will start functioning whenever the task is completed, Susngi said.

As the rescue operation entered the 23rd day, the efforts to pump out water from the main shaft, where the miners were stuck, and in the nearby abandoned mines have not made any visible impact.

Divers from the Navy and the National Disaster Response Force want the water level at the main shaft to go down from the current 160 feet to about 100 feet in order to resume rescue operation, an official of the diving operations team said.

Three pumps brought in by the Odisha Fire and Disaster Service personnel have been operational since Wednesday. The water level in the nearby mines has remained somewhat stable and the personnel will go down and measure in the evening, the official said.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court had expressed strong dissatisfaction over the rescue efforts to trace the miners and had asked the state government to bring them out dead or alive.

Meanwhile, the district authorities have sought an additional fund of Rs 50 lakh to make payments for the various utilities hired for the rescue effort."
17,2019-01-04,Coal India,"Civil society groups want a freeze on all land registrations in and around the mining areas but for the youth the tiny mines are often the only way out of joblessness. ET reports.

The arterial road linking Shillong to Guwahati, the gateway to the Northeast, snakes past a clump of low hills beginning at Khanapara, an outlying suburb of the Assam capital. The road acts as the geographic divider between Assam and Meghalaya, the south side dotted with numerous auto-fuel stations and liquor vends because taxes are lower in the hill state. Any visitor to the region four years ago would also have found another commodity rather plentiful on that side of the motorway – heaps of coal piled right along the sidewalk, with handscribbled price tags for each variety of the solid fuel being sold.

That was the output of what’s called rat-hole mining, a practice unique to Meghalaya and banned by the National Green Tribunal in on April 17, 2014. Back then, industrial units located in the region used the production at these mines that had mushroomed in virtually every backyard. Although illegal, the practice seems to have continued even more than four years after the green ban was announced, as is evident in the crisis at the forested East Jaintia Hills, where 15 miners have been trapped in underground shafts at a rat-hole mine for more than three weeks.

Meghalaya has 576 million tonnes of coal. The sub-bituminous solid fuel is spread across South Garo Hills, West Khasi Hills, East Garo Hills, Jaintia Hills and the East Khasi Hills. After the environmental ban came into effect, ostensibly only the transportation of extracted output is allowed. The Supreme Court on December 4 allowed the transportation of an estimated 176,655 tonnes of coal already mined.

Survivor Sayeb Ali
Unlike the elaborate establishments at mines owned by Coal India Ltd, these pits in Meghalaya are called small-scale coal mines, operating beyond the purview of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act.

The six-party-led state government is in favour of an exemption for Meghalaya from the federal laws on mining.

Until that happens, extractions appear to be continuing, albeit illegally and jeopardizing lives. Former miner Shahjan (name changed) is waiting for a vehicle at a makeshift camp to go to Ksan village in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills district, where a multi-agency operation is on to rescue 15 miners trapped inside a rat-hole mine since December 13.


The pit personnel
Shahjan is from Rajabala in West Garo Hills, one of the prime suppliers of labour to the coal mines across Meghalaya. Of the 15 miners trapped at Ksan, at least seven are from this area.

The fear of local coal barons prevented Shahjan from revealing his identity. His fears are not unfounded. Recently, prominent anti-corruption and rights activist Agnes Kharshiing was attacked allegedly by the coal mafia in East Jantia Hills. She was gravely injured and is still recuperating.

“I have been a miner for six years, working for six to seven hours a day for Rs 2,000 per day. There is no other gainful employment opportunity and people risk their lives working in the mines,” Shahjan told ET.

He left this job after the green ban on rat-hole mining was announced. The rescue teams, comprising members of the Odisha Fire Service, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Indian Navy and miners, have roped in Shahjan for his knowledge of the terrain and the nature of these mines.

“Initially, there was hardly any equipment, including high-power pumps to drain the copious amounts of water. Now that high-tech machinery is being used, I am hopeful that those miners will be rescued,” Shahjan said.

The search for the miners is feasible only when the water level in the narrow coal mine recedes, the district administration said, citing the rescue workers. Hounded by the horror of being trapped, Sayeb Ali (21), a survivor of the incident, is barely able to talk these days. “I only see the pit and people being trapped before my eyes. Those are my friends and relatives with whom I have worked over the last couple of years,” says a distraught Sayeb Ali.


Rat holes? No longer so
A sardar (head) engages a group of personnel, around 10 to 15, for extraction from Meghalaya mines. Lower Assam, Nepal, Bhutan, and Garo Hills are the major manpower suppliers to these hazardous mines.

Zubar Ali, another miner who previously worked here, used to mobilize labour earlier. He now lives in a small village in Dhubri district, along the Indo-Bangladeshi border. The majority of the people in this marginal locality used to work in the coal mines of Meghalaya and property sites at Guwahati.

“Earlier, in these mines a small hole was dug and children were employed as they can enter through the hole. However, the depths have increased over the years and these days, one has to go 250 to 300 feet down to extract coal,” said Zubar Ali. “In Meghalaya, East Jaintia Hills happens to be the hotbed of illegal coal mining.”


Miners say that there have been several incidents where people were trapped, and many may be missing from earlier incidents. In a similar incident in 2012, around 15 miners were trapped in an illegal rat-hole coal mine near the Nangalbibra area in South Garo Hills. Their bodies were never recovered.


State seeks to enforce ban
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conard Sangma acknowledged the prevalence of illegal coal mining in the state, but said his government is seeking to completely enforce the ban.

Congress MLA from Rajabala, Azad Zaman, said: “Seven people trapped in the mine belong to my area. The situation is such that the educated unemployed, with bachelor degrees, go to work as labour hands in the mines. In the absence of employment opportunity here, they move out and risk their lives.”

A citizens’ report prepared by civil society groups in Meghalaya submitted in the Supreme Court alleged that politicians might have stakes in the mining business.

“Unregulated mining in Meghalaya has resulted in serious environmental degradation and large-scale violations of labour laws and livelihood disruptions because of the flow of cheap labour brought in by coal miners,” the report said. “Strict enforcement of existing laws is urgently required. Until such time, the National Green Tribunal- monitored stay should continue.”

Civil society groups have suggested the need to freeze all land registrations in and around the mining areas until regulations are strengthened.


“…uphold the NGT ban until proper regulatory framework on prospecting, granting of leases and necessary clearances, environmentally sustainable mining, mine reclamation, land laws and labour laws are in place… and the area properly mapped to indicate forest land, community land etc,” said the citizens’ report."
16,2019-01-04,Coal India,"Edelweiss Financial Services has a buy call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 325.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 235.70.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage
Coal India’s (CIL) shipments fell (first time since October 2016) 1.2 per cent YoY to 52.8mt in December 2018. Key highlights: 1) SECL’s (largest subsidiary) offtake & production dipped 6 per cent and 13 per cent YoY, respectively; and 2) inventory continued to pile up for the second successive month. Going ahead, we expect SECL to contribute to production as well as off take as operating issues have waned. Hence, we expect CIL to meet our 5.5 per cent YoY offtake growth estimate in FY19. Maintain ‘BUY’ with Rs 325 target price on an attractive valuation of 7.4x FY20E EPS.


YoY shipments decline a one-off: CIL’s December off take fell 1.2 per cent YoY to 52.8mt primarily due to operating issues at SECL—largest subsidiary. However, CIL’s production volume continued to pick up, surpassing offtake for the second successive month. This is expected to increase coal availability in ensuing months. We expect production uptick as our channel checks indicate that local issues at SECL have been resolved. Going by YTDFY19 volume growth of 5.5 per cent, we do not see risk to our FY19 offtake estimate of 613mt (5.5 per cent YoY growth).


Imports have not inched up despite lower e-auction volumes: Our channel checks indicate that the bulk of the coal has been diverted to the regulated sector. Hence, we expect e-auction volumes to dip to below 10mt in Q3FY19. Despite this, imports declined in November possibly due to likely erosion in e-auction premium.


Outlook and valuations- Volume estimate intact; maintain ‘BUY’: Despite off take coming off in December, we perceive easing of production issues at CIL as a positive for the company and non-power end users. Going ahead, we expect production at SECL to pick up and see no threat to our FY19 volume estimates. We maintain ‘BUY/SP’ with a target price of Rs 325 (exit multiple of 10.2x FY20E EPS)."
15,2019-01-04,Coal India,"The country faces no shortage of coal and its imports have declined to 208 million tonnes (MT) from 217 MT in 2014, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.

Replying to a query in the Question Hour, the Minister said coal production has witnessed an increase of 7.4 per cent in April-December (nine months) period of the ongoing fiscal.

There is no coal shortage in the country and Coal India production increased by 104 million tonnes (MT) in the last four years between 2014-15 and 2017-18,he said.

He, however, said that initially when power plants were being set up, they were designed for imports. Besides reserves of coking coal were limited in view of fire in Jharia and Raniganj areas for several decades.

Apart from this, initial delays in environment clearances, land acquisition etc. proved detrimental for coal production.

Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of the total domestic production in the country."
14,2019-01-04,Coal India,"The Centre Friday told the Supreme Court that they were facing difficulties in the operation to rescue 15 miners trapped in an illegal coal mine in Meghalaya since December 13 as there was no blueprint of the 355-feet well. The government told the apex court that the illegal mine was located near a river and seepage of water was hindering the rescue operation. 

 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, informed a bench of justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer about the steps taken for a swift rescue operation. 

The bench directed the Centre and other authorities to file a status report on the steps taken and progress made in the rescue operation on January 7. 

The apex court on Thursday had expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Meghalaya government to rescue 15 miners trapped in the illegal coal mine and had said ""prompt, immediate and effective"" operation was needed to rescue them as it was a matter of life and death. 

It had asked the Solicitor General to apprise it by Friday the steps which the government intends to take in the matter. 

The rat-hole mine, atop a hillock fully covered with trees in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district, was flooded when water from the nearby Lytein river gushed into it, trapping 15 miners. 

Rat-hole mining involves digging of narrow tunnels, usually three-four feet high, for workers to enter and extract coal. The horizontal tunnels are often termed ""rat holes"" as each just about fits one person. 

The Solicitor General had told the bench that several members of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were working at the site and instead of the Army, the government has sent Navy personnel there as the mine was submerged in water. 

""72 members of NDRF are already there but still no result,"" the bench had observed, adding, ""Why cannot you take help of the Army? He (petitioner) says that water pumps were sent to Thailand. Why cannot it (pumps) be used here also?"". 

The petitioner, Aditya N Prasad, has said in his plea that Kirloskar Brothers Ltd (KBL) had offered high-powered water pumps and given technical support to the Royal Thai government in June-July 2018 for the operation to rescue a football team trapped inside a cave system in Thailand. 

KBL had then offered to provide four specialised high capacity Autoprime de-watering pumps, which were kept ready at Kirloskarvadi plant in Maharashtra to be airlifted to Thailand. 

Mehta had maintained that the petition seeking urgent steps for rescue of these 15 persons was not adversarial. 

The counsel appearing for the state had said adequate steps have been taken and besides 72 NDRF personnel, members of state disaster response force, the Navy, fire department and Coal India Ltd were also involved in the rescue operations. 

Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for petitioner Aditya N Prasad, had told the bench that an adjoining mine was connected with river and the authorities were using only 25 horsepower pumps to flush out the water. 

The plea has also sought a direction to the Centre and other authorities concerned to prepare a standard operating procedure (SOP) for rescue operations in ""mines and other similar conditions"". 

It has sought directions to the Centre and the state to utilise the services of the technical wing of the Indian Armed Forces -- the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force -- in the operation immediately to rescue the 15 miners. 

Family members of at least seven trapped miners had already given up hope to rescue them alive and requested the government to retrieve the bodies for last rites."

India’s power sector is undergoing a noteworthy change, and this has redefined the industry outlook. Demand for electricity is seeing a steady growth with a pick-up in the economy, especially manufacturing activity, as well as favorable government policy. The government has implemented various progressive measures to maximise power generation capacity and improve distribution.

India has made great steps in raising access to electricity; as more than 13 crore people joined the power grid since 2013. Also, a close look at the index of electricity showed it has been growing considerably in core sector data. Per capita electricity consumption, which was a mere 16.3 units in 1947, has increased to 1,122 units in 2016-17. 

Below in the graphical representation of the various index in the core sector.






Government initiatives like 24x7 power, power to all households by March 2019 and UDAY, which has improved viability of discoms to buy more power to serve more customers and the CEC initiatives that include linking of deviation settlement mechanism (DSM) prices to DAM prices at the exchange average clearing price, have helped the sector witness robust growth.

In 2018, power demand has increased 8 per cent to 177GW. However, the coal supply chain has tightened up. On the contrary, coal-based power generation capacity in India, which currently stands at 190.29GW is expected to reach 330-441 GW by 2040.

Meanwhile, the government is hopeful of higher output next year from already allocated mines and plans to further allot 10 mines to Coal India. The government targets to increase renewable capacity to 175GW in FY22, and further to 275GW in FY27 from current 72 GW.

Moreover, the railway ministry has also decided to electrify its entire broadgauge network. In order to achieve this target, India needs to add more renewable capacity, improve fuel-supply chain for coal and gas plants and efficient utilization of existing capacity. Total installed capacity of power stations in India stood at 346.62 GW as of November 2018.

Electricity demand in the country has increased rapidly and is expected to rise further in the years to come. Electrification is increasing with the support of the government schemes like DDUGJY (Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana) and IPDS (Integrated Power Development Scheme). The government has also delicensed the electrical machinery industry and allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector.

India’s power sector is forecast to attract investments worth Rs 11.56 trillion between 2017 and 2022 in thermal, hydro, nuclear and renewable segments.

In order to further boost the sector, there is an urgent requirement for reforms relating to prioritising efficient coal allocation and delivery, promoting competition in coal and electricity supply, rationalising energy prices and using incentives to promote more efficient power generation and delivery.

Besides, other reforms already proposed such as re-designing of real-time market, ancillary services regulations and linking of DSM prices with exchanges prices, if implemented, will help absorb more renewable in the grid going forward.

India’s rapid growth over the past decade has increased power demand, which is still largely unmet. With the robust outlook of the sector, it is expected that India will see foreign participation in the development and financing of generation and transmission assets, engineering services, equipment supply and technology partnership in nuclear and clean coal technologies going forward. Going forward, NTPC, NHPC, PTC India, Torrent power and Adani Power are some of the stocks that may give good returns.

20,2019-01-05,Coal India,"The operations to rescue 15 miners trapped in a flooded coal mine in Meghalayas East Jaintia Hills district for the past 24 days got a shot in the arm Saturday when two high powered pumps started dewatering the main shaft.

The pumps were operational 10 days after the Kirloskar Brothers Ltd offered to help and assist the state government in the rescue operations, officials said.

But, since the pumps functioned only for one hour, the Navy divers did not go down to gauge the water level inside the shaft so that they could resume the search for the diggers.

At about 3:30 pm today, a team from Kirloskar Brothers Ltd was able to start their pumps in the main shaft (where the miners are trapped),"" operation spokesperson R Susngi said.

He, however, said that since the pumps were operational for only one hour, the Navy divers did not go down to determine the water level inside the main shaft.

The rescuers stop work at 5 pm daily with descend of the night darkness.

The pump has to run at least 10 to 12 hours of continuous pumping before the water level will be determined, Susngi said.

He said that on Sunday, the unmanned remotely operated vehicle will be sent down to check at the bottom of the shaft again.

Meanwhile, a high power submersible pump from Coal India and two other pumps from Odisha are engaged in dewatering the nearby abandoned mines, which might be interlinked and as much help in lowering of water in the main shaft, he said.

Rescue divers from the Indian Navy and the NDRF are yet to be able to make any significant impact in their search and rescue operations as the water level is still beyond 100 feet, the safe diving capacity for the divers, the official said.

The water level at the main shaft where the miners are trapped is about 160 feet, he said, adding that total depth of the main shaft is about 370 feet."
21,2019-01-06,Coal India,"Rescue operations for the 15 miners trapped in a flooded illegal coal mine in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district for the past 24 days hit a roadblock Sunday as the two high-powered pumps engaged in dewatering encountered technical glitches, officials said.

The high-powered pumps of Kirloskar Brothers Ltd were recently pressed into action to dewater the main shaft, where the miners are trapped.

Another submersible pump from Coal India Ltd (CIL) also faced a snag, affecting dewatering operations in the nearby abandoned mines.

""Two pumps from Kirloskar Brothers and the submersible pump from Coal India encountered glitches and the dewatering process in the main shaft was affected,"" R Susngi, spokesperson of the operation, told PTI.

The two high-powered pumps are undergoing repair work, he said, adding that the CIL pump was replaced with a new one.

The CIL is expected to put into operation at least three more pumps on Monday, Susngi added.

However, little headway could be made in reducing the water levels in the main shaft and the nearby mines due to the malfunctioning of the pumps and fresh seepage, the official said.

Rescue divers from the Indian Navy and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) too could not venture down to gauge the water level inside the main shaft as it was beyond the safe diving limit of 100 feet, the spokesperson said.

The current water level in the main shaft is about 160 feet, while its total depth is around 370 feet.

Rescue work is suspended daily at around 5 pm as night falls. The Kirloskar Brothers pumps could be used for just one hour on Saturday, he said.

At least 15 miners are trapped in the illegal coal mine, whose owner has been arrested, since December 13.

Meanwhile, the Opposition Congress Sunday alleged that the BJP-backed Meghalaya Democratic Alliance government allowed illegal coal mining within six months of coming to power.

""The BJP and the National People's Party (NPP) had both promised the people of the state to open up coal mining, if they were elected to power. Actually, what they did was open up illegal coal mining within six months,"" Leader of Opposition Mukul Sangma told reporters here."

26,2019-01-09,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The power ministry has recommended ‘maharatna’ status for Power Grid Corp of India Ltd (PGCIL), the country’s largest power transmission company, according to an official.

‘Maharatna’ status allows state-run firms greater financial autonomy — they can decide on investments of up to 15% of their net worth in a project without government approval.

In comparison, ‘navratna’ companies such as Power-Grid can invest only up to Rs 1,000 crore without government approval.

If the proposal is approved by the Centre, PGCIL will become the eighth ‘maharatna’ public sector undertaking — and the second in the power sector — after Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, Indian Oil Corp, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Coal India Ltd, NTPC Ltd and Steel Authority of India Ltd. PowerGrid had applied for ‘maharatna’ status after it achieved the qualifying parameter of average annual turnover of Rs 20,000 crore for three years, the official cited earlier said.

The company’s consolidated net profit in 2017-18 was Rs 8,198 crore compared with Rs 7,451 crore in the previous year, while total consolidated income was Rs 30,431 crore against Rs 26,283 crore in 2016-17.

24,2019-01-09,Coal India,"Kolkata: Production and sales came to a grinding halt at Mahanadi Coalfields on the first day of the two-day strike which, however, didn’t take a major toll on other Coal India subsidiaries.

The Odisha-headquartered miner is one the largest subsidiaries of Coal India and has been producing around 460,000 tonnes of coal a day. Tuesday’s loss has been pegged at Rs 60 crore, which may double on Wednesday.

A senior Coal India executive said attendance at MCL was nearly zero and all major mines and offices of the company were closed. This was corroborated by a union leader.

According to an MCL executive, trade unions had political backing and the law-andorder machinery was inadequate to foil the strike.

Labour arms of political parties like Citu, HMS, AITUC and Intuc, which represent majority of the 280,000 Coal India workers, had served a two-day strike notice to the management. BMS, however, stayed off the strike.

SQ Zama, secretary-general of the Intuc-affiliated Indian National Mine Workers’ Federation, claimed the strike affected other subsidiaries too. According to him, nearly 100% workers refused to turn up at Northern Coalfields and North Eastern Coalfields, while Bharat Coking Coal had 75% workers absent, South Eastern Coalfields saw 85% absentees, Central Coalfields recorded 50% on job, Central Mine Planning and Design Institute had 20% absentees, Western Coalfields saw 65% absent and Eastern Coalfields had 35% absentees.

A senior CIL executive claimed that attendance at Northern Coalfields was 88%, while production was to the tune of 98% and sales around 84%. He claimed that attendance at Bharat Coking Coal was slightly affected, while production and despatches were normal. He said the strike did not have much effect on attendance, production and sales at South Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields and Eastern Coalfields.

“Production was affected marginally at Western Coalfields. Contractual workers attended work, while a small section of departmental employees joined the strike,” the executive said. The executive also claimed that attendance was affected to some extent at the exploration arm Central Mine Planning and Design Institute."
23,2019-01-09,Coal India,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 338.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 234.50.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage

Lowering volume growth expectation as production sputters: Coal India’s (COAL) coal production growth has started sputtering. It has reached a point where growth of dispatches will suffer not only in FY19E, but also in FY20E. COAL builds inventories during 2H of any financial year in order to meet demand in the 1H of the next financial year, when production is usually lower due to seasonally high heat followed by monsoons. Unfortunately, COAL’s inventories are now significantly lower than the historical levels. Our channel checks suggest that COAL is unlikely to surprise positively in the remaining three months of FY19E. SECL is struggling with production growth. Talcher coal fields have inventories but offtake is an issue, while IB valley’s mines are suffering from slow land acquisition. Various government agencies and COAL’s top management need to work on a war footing to address these issues, else production growth will suffer. Therefore, it has become inevitable that we tone down our expectations. We are reducing our sales estimates by 1 per cent/2 per cent to 612mt/645mt for FY19E/FY20E.


Power plants restocking demand squeezing high margin E-auction volumes: Low inventory level at power plants is another factor that will impact earnings of COAL because more coal will be dispatched to power plants on priority basis, which will leave behind lower tonnage for high margin E-auction. Although low inventories at power plants in FY18 was a result of voluntary destocking during FY17, the lower level in FY15 and FY19 are a result of slower-than-expected growth in domestic coal production. Coal dispatches grew 12 per cent in FY18 and continue to grow at 11 per cent so far in FY19E. Since inventories at power plants remain low, the restocking demand will continue to drive higher demand in FY20E as well. Therefore, we need to reduce E-auction volumes by 3 per cent to 79mt in FY19E and by 25 per cent to 69mt in FY20E. A scarcity of coal for non-power will ensure that E-auction prices remain high. Therefore, we are increasing E-auction realization by 10 per cent to Rs 2200/t for FY20E, which is still a decline of 12 per cent YoY.

  struggling to find industries which are expanding capacities, Anand Tandon, Independent Analyst, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:



What is the outlook for the metals basket because it seems like a lot of the concerns have not abated and experts across the board are still advising a bit of a wait and watch. What is your assessment?
On metals, my view for a long time now has been that if you do not have action in India, there is very little that you should expect in terms of a price uptick. That view has been pretty much vindicated. Whenever we hear that the Chinese market and the economy are slowing down, the prices have also moved down accordingly, despite the anti-import duties.

Add to that the fact that at least for steel, more capacity would be coming back on stream as some of the mothballed facilities that were operating below their rated capacities were to come back as the NCLT resolutions happened. I do not see a major case for uptick in the sector anytime in the near future. Prices will remain under pressure and I would think margins as well. 

If the margins were to improve somewhat because of fall in raw material prices, that is a different issue but it does not look very apparent right now and something similar is working out in terms of aluminium as well. So, at least for these two major metals, there is still some softness left.


In the near term, one is seeing crude spiralling up. It has climbed up all the way to $61 to a barrel. Would you say that the crude sensitive trade is also going to reverse? Some of the aviation stocks are already under pressure and OMCs have taken a wee bit of a knock as well?
OMCs will take a knock largely because of the fact that they will have inventory losses this quarter but other than that, the margins are now probably better than they have been for a long time. To the extent, they will be able to recover and the OMCs will not suffer that much in terms of margins. But there will be a mark-to-market loss in terms of the inventory that they have purchased and which they are having to sell off at a slightly lower price.

But other than that, I do not see a major problem for them. They may be underperforming the market because the government tends to do stupid things like taking cash out of the companies more than they should be doing, but other than that, I do not think the business is any worse or better off. 

As far as airlines are concerned, there are specific issues with regard to the companies and anyway that industry is still struggling with its own inability to raise prices for the customers and volumes. It is better to stay away from the cyclical sector unless you are an insider.


Are you okay with what is happening in some of the names like Coal India, NMDC and BHEL, where buybacks and probably hefty dividends are getting announced but stocks are languishing near all-time lows? Any investment idea on those names?
You should largely stay away from the PSUs for the simple reason that the only PSUs that ever make money are the monopoly ones. So oil companies will make some money when and if the money is released for defence for example. The defence PSUs will make some money. They are almost mandated to make money because they have margins that are guaranteed. 

But otherwise the main issue is that the PSUs have a social objective or at least the government seems to think that it has a social objective and therefore as an investor, may not want to share the same objectives. You will find that the largest shareholder is not necessarily aligned with you in terms of where you want to go. 

Looking at it purely on the basis of valuations has never worked and it not likely to work in the future. At best, they remain the kind of trades you may pick on the basis that there will be a dividend payout and that may give you a high dividend yield. 

But immediately after that, you will find that the stock will correct fairly significantly. So if and when they get to a stage where they are operating independently and working as businesses, you could look at them because some of them are very large companies. By and large, my advice would be better to stay away from them and look at the private sector.


What is the expectation when it comes to results within the capital goods space? Are you pencilling in an outperformance here?
Near term, government is the only one that has been actually spending and though the numbers for the last quarter seem to indicate that there is generally a pick up in demand, I am actually struggling to find industries which are expanding capacities. 

We seem to be closer to 80% or at least late 70s in terms of capacity utilisation and yet I do not see that happening in most of the industries when you look at it bottom up. The government has been attempting to push the capex cycle up, but that is not enough to make any major dent. 

If you want to play the infrastructure sector and industrial sector, the best bet remains L&T. If you are willing to take a three-year view and go against what I just said which is you should not buying public sector companies, then you can buy a BHEL largely because of the assumption that over the next 24 months, the demand-supply situation in the power sector will improve significantly enough that they will be operating in much PLFs and there will be some new project announcements.

More importantly, BHEL will come back to be an engineering company rather than an NBFC which currently because of its balance sheet, has got loaded up with receivables which it is not getting. Once that comes through, then there will be large value in BHEL, at least till the government steps in and messes it up again. 

So there will be a short window where you will be able to make some money in BHEL but otherwise, Larsen remains a more secular growth story."
27,2019-01-11,Coal India,"The Meghalaya government informed the Supreme Court Friday that the Indian Navy has deployed five remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) in the operation to rescue 15 miners trapped inside an illegal coal mine in East Jaintia Hills district since December 13.

The state government told a bench of Justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer that one crore litres of water had been pumped out from the illegal mine, but seepage from nearby rivers was creating hurdles in the rescue operation.

The bench sought to know from the state's counsel as to whether any action had been taken against those indulging in illegal mining activities.

The counsel told the court that the person running the illegal mine where the incident took place had been arrested.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the court that every possible step has been taken for the rescue of the trapped miners and the Indian Air Force has deployed planes and helicopters for airlifting requisite equipment and manpower.

The bench has posted the matter to January 18 for further hearing.

The apex court is hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Aditya N Prasad, who sought urgent steps to rescue the 15 miners trapped in the illegal coal mine.

Earlier, the Centre had informed the top court that all appropriate steps were being taken to rescue the miners.

Mehta had earlier told the apex court that 71 members of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), 20 from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), 16 Navy personnel and others, including those from Odisha fire service and Coal India Ltd., were working in the rescue operation.

The Meghalaya government had filed a status report on the rescue operation and said there were problems like difficult terrain and lack of proper infrastructure at the site which were creating hurdles.

The state government, in its status report, had said there was no blue print of the illegal coal mine as it was being run ""clandestinely"" and rescue operation was extremely challenging as the site was in a difficult terrain where public services, infrastructure and material required were not easily available.

It had said that the site was located at Ksan near the river Letein. It was about 3.7 kilometres deep inside a jungle and can be accessed after crossing three streams.

The state had said that water was rushing into the mine from the nearby river and it was interlinked with at least 20 other mines there.

It had said the site can be accessed only by 4X4 vehicles and there was complete lack of availability of electricity in nearby areas.

It had informed the court that fuel required to run generator sets, pumps and vehicles there have to be brought from a distance of one hour and high-powered generator sets have to be brought in there for the rescue operation.

On the issue of funds, the state had said, ""Advance fund for meeting any emergency arising from natural calamities is placed with the Deputy Commissioner (DC). At the start of the rescue operation, DC had more than Rs 30 lakh at his disposal. On January 3, the government took a decision to place additional Rs 20 lakh with the DC to meet the requirements.""

It had said the state was getting requisite support from the Centre, the Indian Navy, Odisha Fire Department and other agencies concerned to expedite the rescue operation.

The Meghalaya government had said that on December 13, the district administration had received information at around 2 PM that some miners are trapped and the NDRF, SDRF and civil defence services were immediately requisitioned for rescue operation.

It had said that on December 28-29, Indian Navy divers reached at the spot and high-powered water pumps were also being used there to flush out the water from the mine.

The rat-hole mine, atop a hillock fully covered with trees in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district, was flooded when water from the nearby Letein river gushed into it, trapping 15 miners.

Rat-hole mining involves digging of narrow tunnels, usually three-four-foot high, for workers to enter and extract coal. The horizontal tunnels are often termed ""rat holes"" as each just about fits one person.

The apex court had earlier expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Meghalaya government to rescue the miners trapped in the illegal coal mine and had said ""prompt, immediate and effective"" operation was needed to rescue them as it was a matter of life and death."
29,2019-01-13,Coal India,"SHILLONG: It is exactly a month after 15 miners have been trapped in an illegal rat hole coal mine in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills district. The chances of their rescue continue to remain bleak as dewatering the mine has so far been a futile effort.

Scientists and top notch agencies, known for their work in underground mines of the country, Sunday arrived in the East Jaintia Hills to step up efforts to rescue the miners in what is perhaps the country's longest rescue mission.

Operation spokesperson R Susngi told PTI that a team headed by a scientist and comprising experts from Hyderabad-based National Geophysical Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (NGIR-CSIR) and Gravity and Magnetic Group, was at the spot.

Besides, a team each from the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Chennai-based Remotely Operatated Vehicle (ROV) have arrived to step up the mission, he said.

Till date, the dewatering of the 370-foot-deep mine where the miners are trapped has proved futile as over 1 crore litres of water has been pumped out of the main shaft in the past one month, but there has been no visible change in the water level, the offcial said.

Another 2 crore plus litres of water was pumped out from the nearby abandoned mines suspected to be connected to the mine where the miners are trapped, but the rescuers are clueless 'how' and 'where' the water is coming from, he said.

In the Khloo-Ryngksan area, where the ill-fated mine is located at the western side of a small hillock, the Lytein river crisscross the valley for over 2 km.

Experts have been visiting the spot since December 20 for rescuing the miners after the news broke out at the national level, but the huge water level inside has foiled all their efforts.

Susngi said senior scientist of CSIR-NGRI Devashish Kumar and his team have arrived for the operation. Another scientist from the Gravity and Magnetic Group, Niraj Kumar and his team too arrived as have Jayanti Gogoi of GPR and Vineet Upadhyay, who is heading the team of operators of the ROV from Chennai.

A team from Pune-based KSB has also arrived at the site and work is in progress to instal another high power pump at the site, he said.

The teams have been joined by about 200 people from different agencies of the Government of India, including Indian Navy and NDRF, besides Coal India Ltd and Kirloskar Brothers Ltd.

The Supreme Court which is monitoring the rescue efforts has directed the authorities to step up their efforts and bring out the miners 'dead or alive'.

A citizens forum here associated with RTI activist Agnes Kharshiinz has approached the Supreme Court for a complete ban on coal mining in the state, saying there has been an ""absolute"" loss in terms of revenue from the industry and that all indices in the mining district are down with 76 per cent of people being landless.

Forum leader Angela Rangad said Sunday there were 24,626 coal mines in the district - about 52 mines/sq km at different stages of mining.

The forum alleged collusion between the state government and the illegal coal miners wherein the courts and the NGT were misled on several occasions on the total amount of extracted coal waiting to be transported.

""This is evident from the fact that out of the 57 months (since May 2014 when the ban was enforced), the NGT and the Supreme Court has allowed 32 months of transportation. Where did so much untransported coal come from?"" Rangad said.

""We have requested the court to issue direction to the state government to confiscate all untransported coal and use it in public undertaking factories,"" she said.

The report has been submitted to the Supreme Court for its perusal in Tuesday's hearing, the forum leader said and hoped that the judiciary would take cognisance of the evidence put forth in the 600-page report of the citizen's forum.

The National Green Tribunal had put a blanket ban on this type of mining since May 2014 as it said it was unscientific and put the life of miners at risk.

An interim relief of Rs 1 lakh has been offered to the family members of the trapped miners, officials said.

The mine owner, Krip Chullet, was arrested on December 14 while two of his accomplices are still on the run, Superintendent of Police Sylvester Nongtynger said.

Kharshiing, who narrowly escaped attempts on her life by coal mafia on November 8 last, Sunday demanded that the attack case be handed over to the CBI.

Eight out of the nine persons involved in masterminding the attack have been arrested so far, police said.

The arrested include Nidamon Chullet, the district leader of the ruling National Peoples Party, they added."

32,2019-01-16,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: It's a long walk from the last interim Budget. But a few stocks have stood tall and made a big difference to investors' wealth. 

The stage is all set for the NDA government to present its last Budget before the general elections, which must be held before May. Expectations are running high that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 1 will leave no stone unturned to woo farmers and the middle class alike in the interim Budget 2019.

Yet, some on Dalal Street believe that the Budget will be a non-event for the market.

Since the last interim Budget on February 17, 2014, the domestic stock market has rallied 75 per cent till January 11 this year. During this period, the Sensex has added 15,546 points to 36,009.80. 

Along the way, Dalal Street has witnessed several multibaggers, which multiplied investors’ wealth by up to 9,700 per cent!

Sadhana Nitro Chem stock has soared 9,715 per cent to Rs 760.60 on January 11, from just Rs 7.80, followed by Uniply Industries (up 5,986 per cent), Dolat Investments (up 4,787 per cent), Nath Pulp & Paper Mills (up 3,867 per cent), Tasty Bites Eatables (up 3,742 per cent) and Mangalam Organics (up 3,361 per cent).

The interim Budget 2014–15 was presented by the then finance minister P Chidambaram. Jaitley presented the full Budget for 2014-15 on July 10 after the BJP came to power.

Mahesh Patil, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Fund Manager, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, said they are not really looking too much into this upcoming Budget just before the elections. “I do not think much could be expected in terms of big policy decisions in this Budget, but by and large, the narrative would be towards trying to go for a feel-good factor and some kind of a stimulus for consumption,” he told ETNow during an interaction.

He stressed that it will be pro rural, and the general consumer sector is a better way to play the event. ""The focus should be on low-ticket discretionary consumer items with a rural push,"" he added. 

“We expect some kind of a money flow into the hands of the farmers because of farm distress and one could play some of the rural themes purely from a short-term perspective,” said Patil.

Apart from the aforesaid wealth creators, Dalal Street saw as many as 100 other stocks that rallied over 1,000 per cent during the same period. Some on the list included Ducon Infratechnologies, KEI Industries, V2 Retail, Stylam, Minda Industries, Olectra Greentech, Star Paper Mills, IG Petrochemicals and Gujarat Borosil.

On the other hand, companies such as Videocon Industries, Rainbow Papers, Tara Jewels, SRS, PMC Fincorp and Mandhana Industries tripped 97-99 per cent during the same period.

Sector-wise, BSE Consumer Durables index rallied 269 per cent. BSE Auto, Bankex, Capital Goods, FMCG, Oil & Gas, Realty, IT, Teck, Healthcare and Power indices went up 30-161 per cent. BSE Telecom was the only loser with a decline of 10 per cent.

Sunil Subramaniam, MD and CEO, Sundaram Mutual Fund, in an interaction with ETNow said, “The expenditure has already caught up in line and revenues are dropping. There is not much headroom for the government to go and spend money. The Vote on Account will be pretty much a non-event. It will be a like a steady thing, not rocking the boat whichever way.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi won the general elections in 2014 on the development plank. During the the last five years, the government took several steps to tackle corruption and black money with the implementation of demonetisation, good and services tax (GST) and RERA.

On Modi’s second term as Prime Minister, Matt Gertken, BCA Research, said, “Our base case is Modi will remain in control. Clearly, the polling is working against him right now and against his party and we have seen the high tide of the BJP both in terms of its seats in the Lower House and control of states. There is a downshift in terms of his overall political sway, but broadly speaking, we would expect him to still squeak by and remain in power.”

In the Sensex pack, as many as 15 stocks rallied more than 100 per cent since last interim Budget in 2014. Bajaj Finance zoomed 1,573 per cent, followed by Maruti Suzuki (up 339 per cent), IndusInd Bank (up 297 per cent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 275 per cent) and HUL (up 216 per cent). However, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, ONGC and Coal India slipped 9-53 per cent."
36,2019-01-17,Coal India,"CLSA believes that a lot of bad news is now priced in and select public sector undertakings offer favourable riskreward, especially as there is a risk of slowing domestic flows driving a market de-rating.

The brokerage said Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, NTPC and Coal India are its top buy ideas among non-financial public sector companies and among financials, it prefers State Bank of India. India stands out as the only emerging markets trading above its historical average but its state owned enteprises are trading close to all-time lows at a forward price to earnings ratio of 8.8 times, said CLSA.

Valuations relative the Nifty appears even more compelling at a 50 per cent discount, it added. Concern of a rising fiscal deficit, cross holdings and PSUs being called to do national duties are the key reasons for the de-rating, according to CLSA. For instance, margins of oil marketing companies were trimmed by Rs 1 per litre by the government in October 2018 to bear the burden of rising oil prices. In January that year, the government sold its 51 per cent holding in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation to ONGC to meet the divestment target.



Shares of ONGC has fallen 26 per cent in the last one year while that of NTPC and Coal India have declined 16 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. SBI has fallen 3 per cent in the last one year. In comparison, benchmark Sensex has gained 3.7 per cent in the last one year.

Although the brokerage has advised investors not to ignore PSUs, it believes that the overhang of divestment will remain.

""There is likely to be a continued focus on disinvestment receipts as fiscal pressure remains high as GST (Goods and Services Tax) collections have been weak. The government has so far only met Rs 350 billion (Rs 35,000 crore), versus a Rs 800 billion (Rs 80,000 crore) budgeted target,"" said CLSA.

There is possibility of more crossholding transactions such as the sale of SJVN to NTPC and REC to PFC, said CLSA."
35,2019-01-17,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: With back clearly to the wall after a not so pleasant year for equities, mutual funds (MFs) went about recasting their portfolios a bit in the December quarter.

They made changes to their holdings in 220 out of 850-odd companies that have reported their December quarter shareholding so far, data available with AceEquity suggest.

While their stake went up by more than 1 per cent in at least 41 stocks, there was a drop in exposure in 23 others during the period.


Portfolio rejigs 
Midcap IT stocks were on the radar as the domestic fund houses bought additional stakes in MindTree by 2.15 per cent and L&T Infotech (up 1.43 per cent) while they reduced stake in KPIT Technologies by 1.5 per cent. They added shares of housing financiers such as LIC Housing Finance (up 1.32 per cent) and Repco Home Finance (up 6.7 per cent), but cut stake in PNB Housing Finance (down 1 per cent).

Pharma stocks JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals and Indoco Remedies, where the holding went up by 1.99 per cent and 1.44 per cent, respectively, were snapped up over Divi’s Labs (down 2.2 per cent) and Granules India (down 3.4 per cent).

Oil plays IOC (up 2.32 per cent), ONGC (up 1.49 per cent) and an oil-derivative Spicejet (up 1.33 per cent) caught MFs hooked while metal and mining stocks such as Nalco (down 2.1 per cent) and Jindal Steel (down 1.5 per cent) lost their lustre a bit.

Among the 41 firms where MF exposure rose, only 15 could outperform Sensex’s 4 per cent return in the past three months while 21 delivered negative returns of up to 21 per cent.

Among the 23 firms where MFs cut their holdings in the December quarter, none could outperform Sensex, the data showed.


Heightened activity 
Repco Home, among others, buzzed with activity, where domestic funds raised their stakes by 6.7 percentage points to 24.9 per cent in October-December, from 18.2 per cent in the September quarter. 

Dixon Technologies (up 5 per cent), IFGL Refractories (up 4.8 per cent), Control Point (3.6 per cent) and Automotive Axles (2.3 per cent) were some other stocks that saw high MF buying during the quarter. None mentioned could beat Sensex returns in the last three months.

A few largecap stocks also saw heavy buying by mutual funds. Institutional investors raised their stake in Axis Bank to 13.9 per cent in the three months to December, from 10 per cent in the previous quarter. They hiked stake in Coal India by 3.6 percentage points to 5.4 per cent, ACC by 2.7 percentage points to 8.9 per cent and Infosys by 1.3 percentage points to 12.8 per cent and SBI by almost 1 per cent to 13.22 per cent. 

Bharat Financial Inclusion, Arvind Granules India, Astra Microwave Products, Lakshmi Machine Works and PSP Projects saw mutual funds selling to the tune of 2.2-3.9 per cent during the quarter. 

Mutual fund categories such as smallcap, midcap and multicap logged up to 21 per cent fall in assets they managed in the last one year. 

That said, these schemes, on an average, have returned 5-7 per cent in the last three months. Data suggest that monthly SIP inflows into funds continued to remain strong despite the market weakness, which led to strong Rs 25,300 crore worth of inflows into equities by domestic institutional investors during the quarter gone by."
34,2019-01-17,Coal India,"India's biggest insurer LIC chose to play safe and kept its stake unchanged in most companies for the quarter through December 2018, initial shareholding data of 150 companies showed. 

However, Life Insurance Corporation of India offloaded 4.76 crore shares in Axis Bank during October-December. With this, the insurance behemoth's stake in the private lender stood at 11.53 per cent as of December against 13.54 per cent on September 30 last year. 

It also sold 2.75 crore, 1.47 crore and 1.02 crore shares in Infosys, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail and National Aluminum Company, respectively, during the same period. 

State Bank of India too saw LIC bringing down its holding in India' biggest lender by assets to 10.13 per cent, from 10.23 per cent. It also let go of 79 lakh shares of Bharat Electronics, followed by Sterlite Technologies (11.30 lakh), Union Bank (11 lakh) and NHPC (6.75 lakh).

Tourism Finance Corporation, Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals, Lupin, Pidilite Industries, Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Ambuja Cement, Simplex Realty and SV Global Mills are others where LIC sold 3000-6,50,000 shares during the December quarter.

Data showed that the insurer kept its stake steady in more than 110 companies while it offloaded stake in as many as 17 firms, adding additional shares of over 20 companies. 

The leading insurer did not stop there as it went on to increase its stake in IDBI Bank to 44.30 per cent in the December quarter from 7.98 per cent in the preceding quarter. In August, the Cabinet approved acquisition of a controlling stake by LIC as a promoter in the bank through combination of preferential allotment and open offer of equity.

LIC has been looking to enter the banking space by acquiring a majority stake in IDBI Bank as the deal is expected to provide business synergies despite the lender’s stressed balance sheet.

It also scooped up 3.75 crore shares of Coal India and 1.05 crore shares of Indian Oil Corporation during this window. 

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Gail (India), Bharat Dynamics, Hindustan Unilever, Premier, HDFC Bank, Aban Offshore, Apollo Hospitals, TVS Motor, Gillette India and Procter & Gamble Hygiene saw LIC stepping up its exposure.

Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty plunged nearly 1 per cent to 36,068 and 10,862, respectively, during the last quarter of 2018. 

A payment default by a leading NBFC player, wild swing in oil prices, rupee's fall in fortune and state elections kept the market cautious during the quarter gone by. 

Complete shareholding figures for the said quarter are still to come by."

38,2019-01-19,Coal India,"New Delhi: Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd, one of the largest coal producing companies in the country, has lost about 20 million tonne of production so far this fiscal due to strikes and agitations at its mines.

This is one of the highest loss due to disruptions recorded by any Indian coal company, and the Sambalpur-based subsidiary of Coal India will now have to nearly double its present production pace to meet its annual targets, officials said.

Mahanadi Coalfields (MCL), which lost about 1.5 million tonne of production during a five-day strike last week, is presently producing 47 lakh tonne of coal per day on an average. It would have to ramp up the output to at least 79 lakh tonne a day to achieve its target of 162 million tonne this financial year, an official said.

The January-March quarter is the peak production period for coal companies.

Union coal minister Piyush Goyal has taken up the matter with Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik. 

“Unfortunately, MCL continues to encounter severe problems in achieving the annual production target of 162.5 million tonne in 2018-19,” Goyal wrote in the letter to Patnaik. “By De-cember 2018, MCL has already suffered production loss of nearly 20 million tonne, which has resulted in revenue loss of about .`1,130 crore to the government of Odisha. This has also resulted in cumulative loss of power generation in the country to the tune of nearly 32,600 million units.”

Goyal also expressed concerns on safety of mines. “It has reached the stage wherein mines safety has been adversely affected and may worsen as the machines deployed in mines may get submerged due to stoppage of pumping operations,” he wrote. “Further, the risk of spontaneous heating or fire in the coal stock cannot be rules out.”

MCL, which contributes about 25% to the total output of Coal India, commands over Talcher and Ib Valley coalfields in Odisha.

Intermittent stoppages and disturbances in mining operations, particularly in various mines under Talcher coalfields, have affected production from the fields.

Last week, an indefinite strike by Talcher Suraksha Manch on issues related to implementation of the state’s rehabilitation policy in the Talcher coalfields had disrupted production.

Of its targeted production of 162.5 million tonne of coal for this fiscal, MCL had planned for a record 100 million tonne to come from Talcher, known as the Coal City of Odisha, with the rest coming from mines in Ib Valley coalfields.

Goyal, in his letter, sought the Odisha chief minister’s intervention in resolving the issues related to MCL. “The contribution of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd does not need any emphasis as it is the highest revenue earning entity for the state of Odisha,” he wrote."
39,2019-01-20,Coal India,"New Delhi: Concerned about coal projects worth over Rs 11,000 crore facing delays, the Centre has asked Coal India and NLC India Ltd to identify the reasons behind it and submit a report, an official said. The matter came up during a recent meeting to review projects worth Rs 35,000 crore at a time when India is witnessing significant amount of coal imports. 

""At a recent meeting to review coal projects costing more than Rs 500 crore and 3 million tonnes, Secretary Coal Sumanta Chaudhuri sought exception report from Coal India Ltd (CIL) and NLC India and asked them to identify reasons behind delay,"" a Coal Ministry official said. 

An exception report is a document stating instances where actual performance deviated significantly from expectations. 

The review meeting covered 51 projects of Coal India Ltd -- which accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic dry-fuel production -- nine of NLCIL (formerly Neyveli Lignite Corporation) and two belonging to Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) 

Out of these, 21 projects are facing inordinate delays -- 17 by CIL and four by NLCIL, the official said. 

Coal India's delayed projects include Magadh Expansion, Karo, North Urimari and Rajrappa RCE. 

The delayed NLCIL projects include Pachwara South Coal Block, Talabira II and III Coal Block and Rajasthan Power Projects. 

The delays come against the backdrop of coal demand from power sector exceeding the supply in 2018. 

India has imported of over 200 million tonnes of coal annually in the recent years. 

Earlier this month, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said the country faces no shortage of coal and production has witnessed an increase of 7.4 per cent in April-December period of the ongoing fiscal. 

He, however, also admitted that coal production did not go up in the past because of delays in environmental clearances, land acquisition and other problems. 

Goyal said Coal India's production increased by 104 million tonnes (MT) in the last four years between 2014-15 and 2017-18."
40,2019-01-21,Coal India,"New Delhi: The ministries of coal and power have agreed to a slew of reforms suggested by the Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha-led panel, including allowing use of Coal India (CIL) contracts for short-term electricity trade, in a bid to resolve fuel stress at power plants.

The coal ministry is expected to move Cabinet soon to alter the coal allocation policy – Scheme for Harnessing & Allocating Koyla Transparently in India (Shakti) — to let power projects trade electricity generated with CIL coal in shortterm markets, including exchanges, a government official said. The decisions were taken early this month at a meeting of a Group of Ministers on power sector stress alleviation headed by finance minister Arun Jaitley.

Officials said power producers will be able to meet debt obligations in the near-term and auction of coal supplies with aggregated power purchase agreements (PPAs) will alleviate stress in the long run. An executive with a private power firm said the decisions will mean radical reforms.

Currently, domestic coal allocation is provided for plants with long-term PPAs only. The restriction on merchant power plants, introduced during days of acute coal shortage for power plants, was lifted in 2017 for plants with mediumterm PPAs. Plants supplying to short-term competitive markets procure either from coal e-auctions or global markets.

Modification to the policy to enable allocation of coal supplies to an agency for aggregation and auction along with PPAs without requisition by states has also been agreed upon. In the current form, the policy provides that state governments have to indicate coal allocation to distribution companies or the aggregator.


ET Bureau The government official said the power ministry will also make suitable changes in its model bid documents to provide for auctioned coal linkages under Shakti. Currently, the PPA bid rules are based on old coal distribution policy.

A proposal to allow state power generating companies like NTPC share their fuel supply contracts with private companies has also been approved. The Sinha panel had suggested a scheme enabling NTPC to aggregate power from stressed plants through a bidding process and offer the same to discoms till its own plants are commissioned.

The coal ministry has also agreed to earmark 50% of e-auction coal for the power sector. Sinha’s high level empowered committee had recommended reserving 60% spot coal for power plants citing reduction in its quantity in recent months. The committee said due to lesser coal in special forward eauction for power sector, the premium for bidding has gone up substantially causing increased financial stress to generators.

Among other measures, the coal ministry has also agreed to extend Coal India contracts for short-term trade on exchanges for up to two years in case of cancellation of long-term power agreements with defaulting distribution companies.

The panel report dealt with issues related to 34 stressed projects with a combined capacity of 40,130-mw. This includes commissioned projects of 24,405-mw and under construction capacity of 15,725-mw stressed due lack of fuel, demand, equity, timely payment by discoms and other regulatory affairs. Coal related problems have been listed on top of the reasons for the stress in the sector.


Coal Imports Up 6.7% in Apr-Dec
New Delhi: Coal imports in India saw a surge of 6.7% to 171.81 million tonne in April-December, as per a report by mjunction services. Coal imports were 161 mt in the previous corresponding period. This comes at a time when the government is mulling relaxing the timeline for achieving the 1 billion tonne production target for Coal India. Imports, though, fell 8.09% to 17.25 mt (18.77 mt) in December. (PTI)"
41,2019-01-23,Coal India,"New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government has opened 52 new coal mines since coming to power in May 2014 to fuel its flagship village and household electrification programmes without tripping the system, officials told TOI.

These 52 mines represent 86% growth over the number of mines added in the five-year period between 2009 and 2014, when most projects were stuck in red tape, especially pertaining to environment and forest clearances, before the NDA government took over.

The officials said structural reforms in the government's functioning since 2014 made it possible to quickly open such a large number of coal mines, a cumbersome process involving approvals and permissions from various statutory authorities.



The new mines have added 164 MT (million tonne) to India's annual coal production capacity, marking 113% increase over capacity added during the 2009-2014 period. Since 57% of power is generated in India by burning coal, these mines allowed the government to rapidly move towards universal electricity access without creating shortages.

This is borne out by data in the Central Electricity Authority's latest annual report, which shows demand-supply gap narrowing to 0.7% in 2018, down by 90% from 2009-10 level, and energy supply rising 120% over the 2004-2005 period. But for these new mines, this would not have been possible as the electrification drive has been pushing up demand for power by 5-6%.

On December 19, coal and railway minister Piyush Goyal told Parliament in a written reply that all-India coal production stood at 433.9 MT during the April-November period of 2018-19 financial year, indicating a growth rate of 9.8%. During the same period, state-run Coal India Limited's production stood at more than 358 MT, marking a growth rate of 8.8% over the previous corresponding period.

In April, the government completed the task of hooking up all the 18,452 un-electrified inhabited villages to the national power grid under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. It is now in the process of bringing power to all households without electricity by giving free connections under the Saubhagya scheme. So far, 91.9% of the 2.48 crore households identified without power have been electrified."

“The coal ministry has been in constant endeavor to maintain coal stock at sufficient level and increase coal supply to meet energy need of the country,” it said.

As on January 22, 2019 power plants are having 18.663 million tonnes coal stock sufficient for 11 days. Last year on the same date it was 13.759 million coal stock sufficient for nine days. There has been an increase of 35.6% in coal stock at the power plants as compared to the same period of last year, the statement said."

""The Indian Navy has informed us that another body was found at 3am and is located at about 280 feet away from the bottom of the main shaft,"" District Deputy Commissioner F M Dopth told . 

He said the body is decomposed and efforts are on to retrieve it to the top of the mine, using the Navy's remotely operated vehicle (ROV), with the help of the National Disaster Response Force. 

The first body, of Amir Hussain from Assam's Chirang district, spotted in the mine was handed over to the family members Saturday morning. 

In a joint operation, the Navy and the NDRF pulled Hussain's body out of the mine's shaft on Thursday, after it was first spotted on January 17. 

On December 13, water from the nearby Lytein River flooded a network of tunnels in the illegal rat-hole coal mine in Lumthari village of East Jaintia Hills, trapping 15 men and prompting a multiple-agency rescue attempt. 

Nearly 200 rescue personnel from the NDRF, the Indian Navy, Odisha Fire Service and state agencies are involved in the search-and-rescue operation. 

Efforts to de-water the nearby abandoned mines with the help of high-powered pumps of Coal India Ltd, Kirloskar Brothers Ltd and Odisha Fire Service are still continuing, the officials said. 

Anxious family members of the trapped miners are camping in the district headquarters and visiting the site frequently for any news of their loved ones, they said. 

The owner of the mine, Krip Chullet, was arrested from his home on December 14. His accomplices are on the run.

47,2019-01-27,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Flagging lower coal production in Chhattisgarh's Korba Coalfield that contributes around 25 GW to the country's power generation capacity, the Association of Power Producers (APP) has urged ministries of coal and power to resolve issues to augment production, especially contractual.

In a letter written to the ministries earlier this month, APP said the entire upto 100 mm sized coal production by surface miners should be dispatched through direct rail mode from South Eastern Coalfields Ltd's (SECL) own sidings and merry-go-round train (MGR), or conveyor belt.

The industry body pleaded that less than 250 mm sized coal should not be supplied through direct rail mode at the SECL sidings and should be allocated through washery or road mode, which are having the facilities to handle such ROM (run of mine) coal.

The body also said there is a need for immediate action to be taken for resolving the long-pending contractual issues at Korba area.

According to the letter, the reduction in surface miner 100 mm coal production has directly impacted despatches to power sector through direct rail mode from the SECL sidings. The overall rake loading has reduced 167 rakes (0.7 million tonne) from 25.5 rakes per day in November 2018 to 19.9 rakes per day in December 2018.

It pointed out that there have been severe operational difficulties in rake loading and the scenario for January appears to be worsening.

It said: ""Rail programmes of power houses are valid up to the 3rd of the next month February and non-availability of coal in Korba area is forcing power houses to convert maximum quantity to Washery / Road mode. Even after transferring of rakes from rail mode to washery or road mode substantial rakes are lapsing.""

According to the association, the overall production in the SECL Korba Coalfield (Gevra, Kusmunda and Dipka mines) was 2.99 lakh tonnes per day during April to November 2018. The production in December 2018 was 2.95 lakh tonne per day.

A power company official said the fall in production at Korba mines directly impacting coal supplies to close to 25,000 MW of generation capacity of state-run power giant NTPC, state-owned utilities of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan besides independent power projects of Adani, KSK, GMR, DB Power, RKM, Jindal, SKS and Lanco, among others.

The official pointed out, ""These power producers are struggling with logistics issues as Coal India is unable to produce crushed coal necessary for transportation through rail sidings, which is the most preferred & efficient mode of transportation."""
50,2019-01-28,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The Railway Protection Force (RPF) Monday said it has decided to harvest modern technology and increase coordination with Government Railway Police (GRP) to reduce pilferage of coal in transit.

While a loss of 0.8 per cent of total movement of coal through railways is permissible during transit due to various technical reasons, the actual amount lost during transportation is as high as 1.2 per cent, RPF Director General Arun Kumar told newspersons here.

He said that the 1.2 per cent loss during transit includes pilferage, apart from various technical reasons.

""Surveillance during transit will be increased by harvesting modern technology like using CCTV cameras in rakes,"" the RPF DG said after a meeting with officials of Coal India Limited, Central Coalfields Limited, SAIL, etc to discuss the loss of coal during transportation.

He said that closer coordination between RPF and Government Railway Police (GRP) of different states at divisional security commissioner level will be encouraged to ensure prompter action in stopping pilferage of coal.

""We discussed the loss right from starting points to unloading points, including coal sidings,"" he said.

Stating that security requires to be increased at coal sidings which are loading or unloading points, Kumar said that the main problems lie at places of loading coal on railway wagons.

Kumar said that some of these are traditional loading points where settlements exist and people there take coal from these places.

The RPF DG said that it was proposed at the meeting that checking of calibration of weighbridges be done once every six months, instead of the present one year period.

Claiming that theft of coal in transit has come down, he said ""reporting of pilferage of coal is not always done, which is reflected in the recovery being higher than the amount reported.""

Stating that some sidings are notorious for coal theft with as much as 10 per cent of the total coal being lost in transportation, he said that security has to be increased at these places.

He said that while some bigger privately-operated sidings have hired CISF for providing security, many smaller ones have engaged private security personnel.

Kumar said that RPF can provide them with its personnel for ensuring a better security system to prevent theft."
49,2019-01-28,Coal India,"Monday blues came back to haunt benchmark stock indices as the Sensex and the Nifty tanked 369 points and 119 points, respectively. 

As many as 36 stocks of the Nifty turned red. Adani Ports plunged over 12.53 per cent, followed by Indiabulls Housing Finance (down 6.51 per cent), Bajaj Finance (down 5.45 per cent), YES Bank (down 5.28 per cent) and Bajaj Finserv (down 4.30 per cent).

On the other hand, some buying in Zee Entertainment, Bharti Infratel, Larsen & Toubro, TCS and Coal India capped the downside.

Here are key reasons that put pressure on domestic equities on Monday. 


Weak Q3 numbers: Subdued quarterly numbers by select heavyweights dampened sentiment on Monday. Maruti Suzuki on Friday posted its second successive decline in quarterly net profit with a 17.21 per cent fall for the third quarter ended December, also the steepest fall in nearly five years. 

India's largest carmaker said its net profit for Q3 came in at Rs 1,489.3 crore as against Rs 1,799 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.


Financial stocks bleed: ICICI Bank alone shaved off more than 100 points from the Sensex during the late afternoon trade. The scrip was down 4.84 per cent at Rs 339.80 at around 11.45 am. 

India's biggest mortgage lender HDFC, IT major Infosys and largest lender by assets State Bank of India together dragged the Sensex down by more than 100 points. HDFC and Infosys were down 1.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent, respectively, at around the same time. SBI was trading 2.37 per cent down at Rs 278.50. 

The CBI has transferred the investigating officer in the ICICI Bank case as its “discreet inquiry” suggested his role in leaking information related to searches, according to a report by PTI.


FII selling continues: Foreign investors offloaded nearly Rs 5,000 crore so far from the domestic equity markets in January and experts believe this trend will continue in the coming months as well. Prior to that, they had sold shares worth Rs 28,900 crore in October. Their net inflows stood at Rs 5,980.89 crore and Rs 3,143.22 crore in November and December, respectively.


Populist measures: Traders were also concerned with Bloomberg report stating that Indian bonds are pitted against a familiar foe: likely record debt sales by the government to finance populist measures before national elections due by May.


US-China trade talks: Uncertainties over the high-level trade talks between the US and China were another major overhang."

Founder & MD Equinomics Research & Advisory

I have been holding Reliance Capital at Rs 450, Reliance Infrastructure at Rs 460, VIP Industries at Rs 320 and SRF at Rs 1,400.Please advise on a course of action. –PHILIP D'SILVA
In my view, adverse perceptions have impacted Reliance Capital and Reliance Infrastructure — hold both of them with respective target price of Rs 260 and Rs 350. While Reliance Capital trades at around book value and very low PE of 4 times, Reliance Infra, too, trades at just around 8 PE on FY19 expected earnings. VIP is fairly valued at 32 times FY20 expected earnings — hence, sell the stock if it moves up even 5 per cent from the current level. Sell SRF around Rs 2,200, which is a fair price for this stock with a PE of around 18 on FY20 expected earnings.


I hold 400 shares of Suzlon Energy at an average price of Rs 18.45 per share, Coal India at Rs 388 and General Insurance Corporation at Rs 434. Shall I hold it or sell?—RONAK GADA
Having lost three-fourths of your investment, you may hold Suzlon now, but sell if there is any tactically recovery in the stock price to minimise your loss. Fundamentally, prospects are bleak. Hold both Coal India and GIC Re as both PSU stocks are beaten down enormously beyond fundamentals and both have the potential to recover at least 15 per cent to 20 per cent from the current levels, in my view.


I hold Gujarat Borosil at Rs 133, BPCL at Rs 470, IDFC Bank at Rs 76 and South Indian Bank at Rs 31for the last one year. I can hold for another six months. Please advise. —MALLIKARJUN ACHAR
Hold both BPCL and IDFC Bank, add some more quantity of South Indian Bank to reduce the average cost. While BPCL trades at very low PE and recent moderation in oil price is positive, these two banks trade at attractive valuation of price to adjusted book values. Though Gujarat Borosil is fairly valued at current price, you may hold it as the company will allot shares in the restructured entities of Borosil Renewables Ltd and Borosil Ltd. You may exit them on their listing post-restructuring if he combined stock prices move close to your cost prices.


I am holding HEG at Rs 4,400, Graphite India at Rs 1,000 and Infosys at Rs 700. Please advise. — SYAMAL AP
You may hold Infosys at least till the election results as such large IT stocks would remain defensive in any possible event of political instability. If there is any recovery of 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the stock prices of HEG and Graphite, then exit theses stocks – in my view, current robust price realisations in their businesses are not sustainable in the medium-to-long term.


I have Apollo Tyres at Rs 280. Please advice as I want to hold for a year. —RAJKUMAR IDANI
Although automobiles sales have moderated, recent 27 per cent correction in oil prices and over 10 per cent fall in the domestic natural rubber prices are positive for the tyre industry including Apollo Tyres. Hence, hold it with a target price of Rs 265.

The joint ventures are also likely to enable Coal India inject coal bed methane into the proposed Urja Ganga gas pipeline that aims to meet energy requirements of 40 districts and 2,600 villages covering Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.

In June last year, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had waived the requirement for procuring separate licences from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for taking up coal bed methane projects on its lease hold areas.

Following the development, the world’s largest coal producer lined up two coal bed methane projects at an estimated investment of Rs 3,000 crore.

The first project will be undertaken by Coal India subsidiary, Bharat Coking Coal, at Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand. This block is estimated to hold methane reserves of 25 billion cubic meters and is expected to start production two years after the project is initiated.

The second project at Ranigunj in West Bengal is to be undertaken by Eastern Coalfields. The block holds around 3 billion cubic meter of coal bed methane that can be viably extracted and sold.

“Having learnt about Coal India’s coal bed methane projects, both Gail India and IOC expressed interest,” a senior CIL executive told ET on condition of anonymity."

Board meetings"
58,2019-01-31,Coal India,"Domestic stocks witnessed a spectacular rally on Thursday, reversing their four-day losing run, mostly on the back of US Fed's move to hold interest rates steady and positive expectations from the Interim Budget.

On a day when the January F&O series expired, Sensex soared 665 points, or 1.87 per cent, to settle at 36,257 while NSE’s Nifty rallied 179 points, or 1.68 per cent, to 10,831. In the Sensex bloc, 25 stocks ended in the green and five in the red. In the Nifty pack, 40 stocks advanced while 10 declined.

The solid bounce was also reflective of strength in global markets. Some analysts termed it a ""pre-Budget rally"". 

The rally boosted equity investors’ wealth by nearly Rs 1.69 lakh crore as market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies shot up to Rs 1,40,99,330 crore from Rs 1,39,30,614 crore on Wednesday.


Expert Takes: 

Pankaj Pandey, Head Research at ICICI Securities
The US Fed’s rate hike pause was the biggest trigger for the rally in market. Strong short-covering on the expiry of January F&O series contracts also gave a leg-up to the equity indies.



Viral Berawala, Essel Mutual Fund
The US Fed held interest rates and signalled that its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy may come to an end amid cloudy outlook for the US economy due to global headwinds and impasse over trade and government budget negotiations. Taking cue from these comments, Indian indices rallied post being in the red for 4 sessions, with private banks and technology leading the way. Key things to watch out for would be the interim Budget to be presented tomorrow and progress in US-China trade talks.

0,2019-02-02,Coal India,"The Finance Ministry Saturday said 10 CPSEs, including THDCIL, RailTel and TCIL, have been lined up for initial public offering (IPO) and plans are afoot to launch sector-specific ETFs to meet the ambitious Rs 90,000 crore disinvestment target for 2019-20. Besides, the ministry plans to march ahead with the strategic disinvestment of a host of CPSEs and monetise non-core assets of state owned companies, said Atanu Chakraborty, Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). 

 ""We have about 10 IPOs which are lined up already. Then there are lot of companies which have to meet their minimum public shareholding target. We will also bring new theme based based ETFs. Then there would be strategic disinvestments and post elections we would top it up sharply and asset monetisation framework will see the light of the day next year,"" Chakraborty told in an interview. 

The Interim Budget has set a target of Rs 90,000 crore to be mopped up from CPSE disinvestment in 2019-20, higher than Rs 80,000 crore in the current fiscal. 

 In the 10 months of the current fiscal so far, Rs 36,000 crore has been raised through stake sale in CPSEs, as well as tranches of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and share buybacks. The government has an uphill task of mopping up another Rs 44,000 crore from disinvestment by March-end. 

""All transactions are in place to meet the Rs 80,000 crore target set for current fiscal,"" Chakraborty said. 

The government is expected to raise around Rs 12,000 crore from share buyback offerings by CPSEs, including ONGC, Coal India and IOC. In addition, about Rs 15,000 crore would come in from PFC buying out government equity in REC. 

 Further, the strategic disinvestment of Pawan Hans is also expected to be completed by March 2019. 

 For the next fiscal beginning April, Chakraborty said DIPAM has already prepared a blueprint to achieve the target of mopping up Rs 90,000 crore from disinvestment. 

 With ETF emerging as the most viable route for offloading CPSE stake in the market, he said the department would conduct a study to provide risk-free investment option to retail investors in the form of sector-specific ETFs. 

 The government has already floated two ETFs -- CPSE ETF and Bharat-22 ETF -- which have mopped up Rs 17,000 crore and Rs 8,325 crore respectively this fiscal. 

 ""You should not see ETF as an individual share. In an ETF, we bring all the shares together to reduce the systemic risk,"" he said, adding that DIPAM is looking at the possibility of forming basket of shares from the same sector and design an index. 

Chakraborty further said the government is also examining the possibility of listing the existing ETFs on overseas bourses. JD CS ABM ABM"

5,2019-02-05,Coal India,"BHUBANESWAR: Union Minister for Mines Narendra Singh Tomar has ruled out any amendment to extend the leases of mines which will lapse in less than two years and said that the Centre will not intervene in Goa’s mining crisis either.

Nearly 300 mining leases across the country are set to lapse in 2020 under provisions in an amendment introduced by the Narendra Modi government in January 2015 making e-auctions mandatory in the grant of mining licences.

The amendment led to Goa ending up in a Catch-22 situation when the Supreme Court, on February 7, 2018, ruled that the BJP-led state government’s renewals of 88 leases, including that of Sesa Goa’s, was illegal. The court concluded that it (the renewals) had been done to circumvent the Centre’s 2015 Amendment.

Manohar Parrikar’s coalition government has since been lobbying with the Centre for an amendment to extend these mines’ terms. However, Tomar has ruled out this possibility.

“The Goa situation was brought about after a Supreme Court order. That this should be something that the court decides, is the view of the state government and the Centre. This concerns the state and the court –– minerals are the state’s property, the court order was directed at them -- they will have to do it…the Centre can’t intervene. Goa is working on placing its view before the court,” he said.

In the city to attend an international conference of aluminium producers on Saturday, Tomar said his government had inherited a sector mired in uncertainties. “We were determined to tackle these challenges and introduced legislation that brings in transparency. As these five years come to an end, not one of those questions (uncertainties) remains unresolved,” said Tomar. “Neither the state nor Centre can allocate any lease today, unless it is through e-auction,” the minister said.

As concerns of a shortfall in 2020 loom –– specifically of iron ore for steelmakers –– the ministry has been pushing for the exploration of the remaining resources so that the auction of these deposits to new owners can be done without delay.

“Only those mines whose terms end in 2020 will be auctioned. To ensure that there isn’t any shortage of ore, the ministry is working with the Environment Ministry so that these leases can be auctioned seamlessly with environment clearances remaining valid (for the new lessee),” said Tomar. The minister ruled out the possibility of extending their terms to 2030, the cut-off granted to captive mines under the amendment.

Meanwhile, while the ministry claims that nearly a hundred virgin deposits are ready to be auctioned, Odisha, one of the most important mineral-bearing states, is still waiting for either the Centre, or the courts, to clear a roadblock. The current cap of 10 sq kilometre (for iron ore) is keeping Tata Steel, whose plants (within and outside the state) depend on Odisha’s iron ore, from participating in the auctions.

The Centre’s view that environmental violation was tantamount to illegal mining resulted in Odisha’s iron ore and manganese miners paying Rs 13,000 crore as fines.

However, on the subject of Coal India being slapped with similar steep recovery notices, the minister said: “Coal India is operating as per legal procedures. Until they get a stay (from the coal tribunal) they can work. It’s an SC order and there’s nothing we can do about it under the circumstances.”"
2,2019-02-05,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-owned Coal India, Neyveli Lignite and Singareni Collieries will have a capex of Rs 20,121 crore in 2019-20, 15% more than the previous fiscal, according to the interim budget.

According to the Expenditure Budget, this spending would be part of internal and extra-budgetary resources (IEBR) of the central public sector undertakings.

Plan outlay of the Centre consists of two distinct parts: a part implemented directly by ministries concerned and departments; and the other through investment by state-owned entities in respect of their own plan projects and programmes. Investment by state-owned companies is financed either through budgetary support provided by the Centre, which is part of the total plan outlay and IEBR raised by state-owned companies on their own.

IEBR comprises internal resources and extra-budgetary resources. Extra-budgetary resources are the sum of domestic and foreign loans raised directly by the companies.

Broadly, the internal resources comprise retained profits -- net of dividend to government, depreciation provision and carry forward of reserves and surpluses. Extra budgetary resources consist of receipts from the issue of bonds, debentures, external commercial borrowing, suppliers’ credit, deposit receipts and term loans from financial institutions.

The Expenditure Budget stipulates that Coal India would be spending Rs 10,000 crore on capex in 2019-20, against Rs 9,500 crore during the current fiscal. If achieved, this would be a 5.2% growth.

Neyveli Lignite would be investing around Rs 8,271 crore during 2019-20 against a planned capex of Rs 6922.34 crore during 2018-19. When achieved, capital expenditure would increase 19.4% during the period.

Singareni Collieries would be investing Rs 1,850 crore during 2019-20 against planned capital expenditure of Rs 1,100 crore during 2018-19. If the company manages to meet its investment targets, it would be achieving a near 68% rise in capex.

“This money for Coal India would be financed either from internal reserves or from borrowings. With internal reserves on the decline following payments of dividend and expenditure on share buyback Coal India may need to borrow funds from the market to finance its projects,” a senior Coal India executive said.

""The capex would be for opening up new mines, taking up new projects and setting up additional infrastructure facilities. For example, Coal India would be opening up a few new mines in its command area, and would be investing in setting up infrastructure as well as investment in new projects like coal bed methane and invest in railways projects as well as coal handling plants,” the executive said."

Those Heavy Earth Moving Machineries (HEMM) would be pressed into operation in the CIL's opencast mines, the major source of the maharatna coal miner.

The miner will spend the amount from its capex kitty.

""Nine global tenders built on a common NIT at CIL level through a transparent e-procurement process with reverse auction have been issued. All the subsidiaries of the CIL would reap benefit of this purchase process,"" said an official.

11,2019-02-07,Coal India,"Coal India, NBCC, IDFC Bank First, Ashok Leyland and Eicher are going to be marquee names where you will 
  
  
  make money, Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive VP, Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:


What is your take on the RBI policy? Is the rate cut of 25 bps what the markets were looking forward to? What did you make of it?
The rate cut has left all the analysts on the sidelines of both the equity market and on the credit side. Nobody was expecting a rate cut and nobody was talking of Nifty at 11,000 and beyond. Those are both proverbial points. Now credit will expand over a period of time but the sentiment is extremely positive. 

The new RBI governor has done a lot to reinstate confidence in PSU banks, in NBFCs and over a period of time, I see most of the problems getting sorted out. There is an overhang from the IL&FS issue but a large part of that is telling you that some of the NBFCs which have stretched themselves extra are definitely going to be hit. 

But the larger picture is that banks are going to be in a sweet spot because they may not transmit the entire 25 bps and cost of funds will fall for them. Also you are in an environment where inflation, yields are at multi-year lows. This is much in order, given that even the Fed is now sounding dovish. 

On equity markets, the left out feeling was there and most people are still doubting the rally because selective largecaps have made this high. The broader market has still underperformed but that is the way equity markets are. The broader market may start to catch up and you could see consolidation in the largecaps.


You believe that auto is a good contrarian bet. You like Eicher as well as Ashok Leyland. What is the rationale?
I liked Eicher very much below Rs 20,000, Maruti at Rs 6,500 and Ashok Leyland at Rs 81. All three have given a stellar rally. The rationale was that autos for the last three years has been the biggest consumption driver. There has been one or two quarters of NBFC fiasco and the insurance part may have played out negatively. Consumption spending is coming back and we are very bullish on the broader market. 

Autos as a consumer discretionary will see valuations very much in buyer’s favour if you were buying the fear. I continue to be overweight on Maruti, Eicher, Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland by the way will be the largest bus-maker not in India, but globally. They are getting huge traction on some of the EU orders on electric vehicles and so on.

The bus and the LCV market is now looking very bright for slightly longer term. Autos and metals as a contrarian have played out well. We still think there is at least 10% upside in the likes of Maruti and Eicher.


What exactly is your take on the cement space? The overall demand-supply mismatch has narrowed down significantly. What is the view on the general trend within the cement basket?
Cement has been a slight bit of a laggard in the sense that volumes may have played out but margins and the price of petcoke has affected profitability. But this is a one to two quarter hiatus. 

Low-cost housing continues to be the theme and let us not look at the next three months, but months beyond the election. You will see a huge capex from both the private and the government side gathering steam and cement is a no-brainer. If you have a slightly longer-term view, on this correction, accumulate UltraTech and ACC. You can add JK Lakshmi Cement and Shree Cement. Shree Cement by the way came out with the best numbers as their margins were highest amongst the lot and that trend can continue. Cement and commodities could be a huge outperformer in the second half of 2019.


How have you looked at the steps that have been taken? These efforts to create fewer but stronger banks with large balance sheets?
These are welcome steps. You merge some of the bad apples with the good ones and you are opening that synergies of space and more economies of scale play out. Obviously, it will have short-term dampener because the bad banks will take time to be recapitalised. But banks have been well recapitalised and if you stick with the larger ones, then there is a huge amount of wealth to be created given capex revival and write-backs for corporate facing banks. The likes of State Bank, BOB and Can Bank can be huge outperformers. 

Their numbers will prove from the March quarter, when we see a lot of write-backs on infra, power and some of the resolutions of IBC. IBC is the powerful tool. Only, these stocks can take some time before the return on balance sheet improves. It is a very welcome step if you get fewer banks with more consolidation and mergers, but in the short run, they may not create too much wealth for you. It is only in the longer term that they play out well.


What is view on Coal India and NMDC?
Coal India is a proverbial value play with 8.5% dividend yield and the results this quarter will be the best in 18 quarters. At 11 times price to earnings, I have never seen it cheaper. Obviously there is the overhang that at Rs 260, the government sold some of its stake and so on but PSU stocks are trading at abysmal levels. ONGC, NTPC, GMDC, even Coal India. Once we are through elections, PSUs will create a lot of wealth in the second half.

We have seen that most of the PSUs have been performing excellently in their business lines. So, Coal India becomes a no-brainer. I do not rule out a 25% upside. I know it has been a laggard but that is where a value pick comes. 

With that, you can also add NBCC, one of my old stocks which has not performed much but I can reiterate that this is an excellent company. It has pan India visibility in tier I, tier II cities where order flows and construction activity are picking up in a big way. 

GMDC dividend yield is extremely attractive and NMDC also, given that iron ore prices are moving up. This means the steel cycle and commodities are expected to do well globally. Definitely, these would be contrarian buys with a 25% upside by the end of the year.


Which are the pockets that could take the markets higher in the next phase? 
Autos, metals, consumption and construction are looking good. As a sector, consumption has been a huge outperformer -- whether it is durables or discretionary or staples. Even though valuations are looking stretched, they still seem to be the best place to be. The other caveat is that we have had a very good rally from 10,500 back to 11,200. Nifty maybe pricing in everything here. You may consolidate but not see too much on upside over there. 

It is the broader market which I think can come back and that will again depend on soothening of a lot of ex-factor, the ADAG problem, DHFL. Sooner, rather than later, people will try to get into better names like IDFC Bank First. I have been extremely bullish on this stock. This is a doubler in next two years. It is going to be one of the biggest gainers on the fiasco. So be stock specific.

Coal India, NBCC, IDFC Bank First, Ashok Leyland and Eicher are going to be marquee names where you will make money, but I think maybe the index is done for the time being. You will wait for more colour, closer to the election but it will be the broader market which should stand to gain in the next month or so. 


When will L&T start performing?
That is a good question but you have to be patient. Look at the numbers from Siemens, Cummins. They are both telling you that industrial capex is reviving. The L&T management is extremely bullish. Remember that these stocks will not trade at a significant discount to better valuations because in two quarters they can come out with numbers which they have not done in 12 quarters. 

So L&T, ITC are no-brainers. If you are a value investor, you will make a lot of money. The problem is they may have been in range for some time and the market is justly rewarding some of the outperformers. But these are extremely good stocks to own and must-haves in your portfolio."
12,2019-02-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Headline equity indices Sensex and Nifty ended flat on Thursday after seesaw trade as RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) lowered the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent in a surprise move and changed its policy stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘calibrated tightening’. 

The market was expecting a change in policy stance, but the rate cut came as a surprise. The market swung between gains and losses after the RBI move that economists say can give a boost to the domestic economy. 

However, after an initial knee-jerk response, the market turned stock-specific and remained so for the rest of the session. Sensex closed 4 points down at 36,971, while Nifty settled with a nominal gain of 7 points at 11,069.

Gains in shares of Sun Pharma, ITC, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto were offset by losses in Reliance Industries, HDFC and Larsen & Toubro in the 30-pack Sensex.

Global cues, too, were lacklustre. However, rupee's rise against the US dollar and a fall in crude oil prices offered some relief for the market. 


Let's take a look at highlights of Thursday's session:

Chalet Hotels gains on listing dayShares of Mumbai-based Chalet Hotels closed 3.71 per cent higher after listing at 5 per cent at Rs 290 on BSE against an issue price of Rs 280. The company's Rs 1,641 crore initial public offering (IPO), which was sold from January 29 to January 31, had been subscribed 1.57 times. 


Vodafone Idea surges 8%Shares of the country's largest telecom operator by subscriber closed 8.22 per cent higher at Rs 32.25 on BSE after the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) directed the telecom department to release bank guarantees worth Rs 2,113.50 crore which the government had taken from the telco as one-time spectrum charges (OTSC) as a precondition for approving the merger.


Grasim gains 3% post Q3 numbersShares of Grasim Industries closed 2.90 per cent higher at Rs 753.20 after the company reported a 76 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated December quarter profit at Rs 958 crore. Consolidated revenue for the quarter rose 22 per cent to Rs 18,419 crore from Rs 15,153 crore reported for the corresponding quarter last year. 


Tata Motors gains ahead of Q3Shares of the automaker climbed 2.64 per cent to close at Rs 182.90 ahead of December quarter earnings. Later, the auto major reported a massive Rs 26,961 crore consolidated loss for the quarter post market hours on a major impairment hit at JLR. Consolidated revenue for the quarter rose 5 per cent YoY to Rs 77,001 crore. 


Lupin falls on Q3 lossLupin shares declined 2.40 per cent to close at Rs 821.75, a day after it had posted a Rs 151.75 crore loss for December quarter against Rs 221.73 crore profit reported for the corresponding quarter last year. Many brokerages expressed disappointment over Lupin's numbers. Credit Suisse has maintained an 'Underperform' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 800 per share. 


Arvind falls on poor Q3 showShares of textiles manufacturer Arvind closed 2.11 per cent down at Rs 81.30 after it reported 49.27 per cent drop in December quarter consolidated profit at Rs 40.07 crore against Rs 78.99 crore reported for last year. 


81 stocks show potential riseMomentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, showed bullish crossovers on 81 counters on BSE. Among them were Dish TV India, Manappuram Finance, Adani Gas, ACC, Coal India, Tata Elxsi and KEC International. On the other hand, 40 stocks, including KRBL, Generic Engineering, NIIT Technologies and Symphony showed bearish crossovers, signalled downside in near future.

They included Reliance Communications, Reliance Power, Reliance Naval, DHFL, IDBI Bank, Unitech and Arvind. Meanwhile, 31 stocks, including Accel Transmatic, Mahamaya Steel, Shangar Decor and Esaar (India), have entered the overbought zone.

13,2019-02-07,Coal India,"KOLKATA: In December last year, short-term power prices declined to Rs 3.30 per unit on a month-on-month basis owing to the ongoing winter season, during which there is subdued demand for power, particularly in northern and western states.

However, power prices increased on a year-on-year basis compared with Rs 3.00 per unit in December 2017.

In December 2018, all-India energy requirement increased 4.9% year-on-year and available energy increased 5.0% year-on-year, leaving a power deficit of 0.5% against 0.6% in December 2017.

During the month, power supply was met through higher hydro and thermal generation. Moreover, total renewable power generation rose 10.5% year-on-year to 9.0 billion units during the month. The rise in wind and solar power generation was driven by an increase in capacity. However, Ind-Ra estimates a decline in plant load factors of wind and solar capacity due to the seasonal impact.

Although capacity utilisation of thermal plants improved to 60.5% in December 2018 from 59.1% in December 2017, they were lower on a month-on-month basis due to low power demand owing to the ongoing winter season. In addition, part of the demand was met by increasing hydro and renewable power generation.

Coal India’s monthly coal production declined 0.9% year-on-year in December 2018. However, total coal dispatched by Coal India to the power sector increased 1.9% year-on-year during the period.

As a result of the rise in coal allocation to the power sector, inventory at power stations improved to 16.6 million tonnes (up 25.8% year-on-year) in December 2018.

Higher hydropower generation led to relatively low reliance on thermal generation, aiding in the inventory levels. Furthermore, power plants with subcritical levels of coal declined to 9 in December 2018 from 23 in November 2018 and 13 in December 2017."
14,2019-02-08,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India and Gail have formed a committee of senior executives to work jointly on coal bed methane projects of Coal India on its blocks. They are considering a joint venture in which Coal India would be producing the gas while Gail would be marketing it through its network.

Coal India chairman AK Jha and Gail chairman B C Tripathi met in Kolkata on Wednesday to discuss the proposed projects, company executives said.

The proposed joint venture is likely to enable Coal India inject coal bed methane into the proposed Urja Ganga gas pipeline that aims to meet energy requirements of 40 districts and 2,600 villages covering Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.

A Coal India executive said Gail India is interested in downstream processing, transport and selling the gas in bulk to industries. Gail is into transport of bulk gases and has its own distribution network including pipeline which could be used to sell the produce.

“Gail can also help Coal India supply the produce in eastern states via the Urja Ganga gas pipeline project since it is being undertaken by a consortium of state-run companies headed by Gail,” the executive said.

In June last year, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs waived the requirement for procuring separate licences from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas for taking up coal bed methane projects on its lease hold areas. Following the waiver, Coal India has already lined up investments of Rs 3000 crore for its coal bed methane projects.

The first project will be undertaken by Coal India subsidiary, Bharat Coking Coal, at Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand. This block is estimated to hold methane reserves of 25 billion cubic meters and is expected to start production two years after the project is initiated.

The second project, at Raniganj in West Bengal, is to be undertaken by Eastern Coalfields."
15,2019-02-10,Coal India,"The coal ministry has expressed concern over delay in the commissioning of around 18 washeries by state-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) and stressed upon the need for timely completion of the projects.

In a review meeting on the upcoming washeries of CIL, Coal Secretary Sumanta Chaudhuri expressed ""his concerns on the delay in commissioning of washeries"", according to the minutes of the meeting.

16,2019-02-11,Coal India,"There is widespread abhorrence towards Pigs for wallowing in mud, but most do not appreciate that they wallow in mud because they have no sweat glands. However, they are the smartest animal on the earth and cleanest in their natural habitat.

Drawing this analogy about the perception of Pigs, Hong Kong-based broker CLSA, in a note titled “Pigs That Might Fly,” lists 22 stocks in Asia region where valuations are at record low levels due to perception concerns, but offers significant upside if valuation reverts to the mean. Of the 22 stocks, six are from the Indian market including ONGC, Coal India, Bharti Airtel, ACC, ICICI Pru and ZEE Entertainment.

The rationale for ONGC appearing attractive is that the government hiked oil subsidy budget allocation by 22 per cent in the interim budget, which suggests realisation of the company could be much higher than implied by current stock prices. ONGC is one of the cheapest exploration and production companies in the world and as the subsidy overhang subsides, it offers sizable earning improvement.

Coal India, one of the largestcoal producing companies in the world, offers a dividend yield of 9 per cent based on FY20 earnings, the third-highest dividend yield in the Asia ex-Japan region. Coal India stock is available at nine times of FY20 earnings with 70 per cent return on equity.

India’s largest telecom company by revenue and market share Bharti Airtel’s focus on deleveraging due to the stake sale in Bharti Infratel, an initial public offering of African IPO could potentially bring down debt by 24 per cent. CLSA has a price target of Rs 410 on Bharti Airtel, which suggests a 34 per cent upside from the current level. ICICI Pru Life is trading at 40 per cent discount to HDFC Life, therefore narrowing of valuation discount could offer upside for the stock.


Other prominent stocks included in the list are Standard Chartered, Robot maker Fanuc, Singtel, Baidu and Nintendo. CLSA also listed 10 piglet stocks — basically smallcap companies — in the note. However, no Indian company figure in the list."

25,2019-02-12,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: India’s top three mutual funds, which manage over Rs 9 lakh crore in debt and equity assets, added a number of PSU stocks to their schemes in January, as valuation discounts of many state-operated enterprises vis-à-vis Nifty widened to more than a half.

While India’s largest HDFC AMC was seen buying PSU stocks such as Union Bank, NTPC, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC and Punjab National Bank, second largest fund ICICI Prudential added shares of Power Grid, NHPC, GAIL, SBI and HPCL. SBI Mutual Fund, the third largest, bought fresh shares of SBI, NTPC and ONGC, among others, data compiled from database Ace Mutual Fund showed.

PSU stocks have had a poor start to 2019, with the benchmark BSE PSU Index falling 4.58 per cent in January and another 3.26 per cent so far in February. This was against a 0.52 per cent rise in BSE Sensex in January and 0.79 per cent jump so far this month. Analysts say some of the PSUs look very attractive due to lower valuations.

HDFC AMC bought 76.49 lakh shares of Union Bank in January, as the exposure of its schemes to the PSU bank rose to Rs 398 crore at the end of January from Rs 348 crore last month. This was HDFC’s top buy in January in terms of number of shares purchased.



Out of the top 10 stocks HDFC AMC bought (in terms of number of shares) during the month, five were PSUs. The fund house added 50.49 lakh shares of NTPC, even as the total value of its investment on the counter declined to Rs 3,783 crore at the end of January from Rs 3,961 crore at the end of December. The fund house also bought additional shares in Bharat Electronics, REC and Indian Bank.

CLSA, which showed preference for PSU stocks such as ONGC, NTPC, SBI and Coal India last month, argued that while India was the only emerging market trading above its historical average, its state-owned enterprises were trading close to their all-time lows at a forward PE of 8.8 times. Their valuations relative the Nifty were compelling at a 50 per cent discount, it said. 

ICICI Prudential bought 2.14 crore shares in NTPC, raising total holding to 43.21 crore at the end of January, up 5.2 per cent in a month. Its holding in ONGC jumped 7.78 per cent, or by 2 crore shares, to 25.70 crore shares. In value terms, it held Rs 6,000 crore worth of NTPC shares and Rs 3,900 crore worth of ONGC shares as of January 31.



In BHEL, the fund house raising its holding by 50 per cent. IOC and Coal India were the other PSUs where the fund raised its holding. 

""Coal India is a proverbial value play with 8.5 per cent dividend yield. December quarter earnings will be the best in 18 quarters. At 11 times PE, I have never seen it cheaper. Obviously, there is an overhang that the government may sell some of its stake. But PSU stocks such as ONGC, NTPC, GMDC and Coal India are trading at abysmal levels. Once we are through these elections, PSUs will create a lot of wealth in the second half of 2019. Because they will then be focussed on governance,” Sanjiv Bhasin of IIFL told ET Now. 



SBI MF was seen buying shares in SBI, NTPC and ONGC during the month. “Concerns over rising fiscal deficit, cross-holdings and PSUs being called to do national duties were the key reasons for the de-rating. However, a lot of the bad news is in the price, and select PSUs now offer favourable risk-reward, especially as we see the risk of slowing domestic flows driving a market derating,” CLSA said in January note."

""On an overall basis, while the margins may have been under strain, the consumption story seems to be intact and that has come out in the results in companies across sectors, be it FMCG or other sectors. One pocket of concern is the auto sector because of the restricted flow of credit and high fuel prices. It has also translated into their quarterly performance and if this persists, one will have to be a little guarded about this sector,"" said Sanjay Sinha, Founder, Citrus Advisors.


Expert-take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services 
Lack of positive triggers is impacting sentiment of domestic equity market. India is underperforming in spite of improvement in the global market and appreciation in INR. Inflows have reduced this month due to muted Q3 results and outcome of general election. Expectation is that market momentum will reverse as economy stabilizes post-election and borrowing cost reduces.

26,2019-02-12,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government will launch an additional offering of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on February 14 to raise at least Rs 3,500 crore, officials said Tuesday.

The ETF sale would be for a single day, in which both institutional and retail investors can participate, they said.

""The additional offering of Bharat-22 ETF would be on February 14. This is an on-tap issuance. The base issue size has been fixed at Rs 3,500 crore, with an option to retain any additional subscription,"" one of the officials told PTI.

The proceeds from the ETF sale would help the government move towards meeting the Rs 80,000 crore disinvestment target set for the current fiscal.

So far, the government has mopped up approximately Rs 36,000 crore by paring minority stake in public sector companies, and through ETFs.

Conventionally, the follow-on fund offer (FFO) of an ETF remains open for four days in which the first day of the sale is reserved for anchor investors. The next three days are kept open for subscription from retail and other institutional investors.

Since this is an additional on-tap offering of Bharat-22 ETF, the issue would open for a single day for both institutional and retail buyers.

The government has so far raised Rs 22,900 crore through the Bharat-22 ETF. While Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.

The central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) that are part of the ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

Also, the government's strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, held through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), has been put in the ETF basket.

This would be the second ETF offering by the government in the current fiscal which ends in March. In November last year, the government had raised Rs 17,300 crore through a follow-on offer of another exchange traded fund -- CPSE ETF, which comprises shares of 11 public sector enterprises. This was the biggest-ever fund raising from an ETF domestically."

36,2019-02-13,Coal India,"There are strong fundamentals to back the elevated valuations for Axis Bank, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, 
Angel Broking, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts: 


What a surprise coming in from Sun Pharma! But do you believe that is enough to take the stock away from all the corporate governance issues?  An encouraging set of numbers were reported but there was an element of forex gain as well. But even after adjusting for it, the numbers were still better off than what a lot of analysts on the Street had pegged. 

The second element is going to be related to corporate governance issues. Although the management has tried to allay fears in terms of related party transactions -- whether it is Aditya Medisales or Atlas Global -- what actually comes out of it over the next few weeks or months is going to be very interesting. 

At the same time, the Halol resolution is going to be extremely critical in terms of ANDA applications that get filed from that facility and the speciality pipeline that Sun Pharma has, puts it in a very good position as these approvals start coming through. 

So, there are lot of offsetting effects. Prima facie, looking at numbers the stock can give a positive reaction but a fresh rerating will happen only after clarity emerges in all these aspects. They again would maintain the stance that the stock might react positively, but would stay in a range if it does open higher at consolidated level in a range-bound manner. 


What about Coal India and the kind of earnings growth that it has delivered? Strong realisations lifted its numbers. Brokerages as well are hailing this as quite a positive. What is your assessment of the earnings?
 The realisations, both on the FSA and the e-auction front show that of the 150 million tonnes produced, 135 million tonnes are on the FSA front. The realisations are at the rate of Rs 1034 per tonne. The e-auction realisations did surprise. 

Even though the e-auction volumes came a tad bit lower around 14-14.2 million tonnes, the realisations at Rs 2,850 per tonne were significantly higher. But when you are looking at the kind of supplies that power plants have at this point of time, Coal India might need to supply more in terms of the FSA or the coal that is required by these power plants and e-auction volumes can actually come down over the next few quarters. 

The second element that probably binds Coal India together is the dividend yield that they probably pay out and even if one looks at valuation on a EV/EBITDA basis, it is very attractive. Volume growth is something that one really needs to look at. Volume is expected to grow 6-7 odd per cent over the next year, year and a half with the assumptions of a greater proportion of FSA sales. 

While e-auction volumes may come down, but price increases on the e-auction front will offset the volume de-growth. So, there is sufficient value there. However, the stock might get stuck in a range-bound mode over the next few months, unless we see sustained improvement in overall production.


 I hate to say this, but I hope that Axis Bank is not turning out to be a hope trade. Yes there is a marked improvement in their NPAs but a lot is riding on the fact what Amitabh Chaudhary will do. 

 If one looks at the qualitative aspects even within the loan book, a large provisioning has been done for the lower rated power exposures. And a large element of the power exposure for Axis Bank again is the better rated book which A and above. So, there is sufficient amount of confidence in terms of both the book that it carries on the power side and generally, if you look even outside the watch list, a large element of recognition has probably taken place already . 

Second,in terms of leadership change, expectations do run very high, but one needs to understand that from a qualitative perspective, a lot of cleaning up has happened and when you are talking about some cleanup over the next few quarters, that clearly gets offset in terms of the strategic roadmap that the management has put in place. 

Coming to the de-risking model, if one looks at the non-interest income component for the bank as a whole,retail also has a lion’s share in that part. That alleviates a lot of risk that comes in through that component as well. So there are sufficient levers in place. The valuation is not cheap but if the bank is able to provide all this in terms of qualitative aspects going forward, there is no reason to worry about the bank’s performance from a fundamental perspective. 


 The Axis OFS (offer for sale) got a very strong response. Is it a blind bet to subscribe?
 I would not call it a blind bet but if one looks at the numbers that the bank has been producing over the past few quarters, the trend is on the positive side. Coming to qualitative parameters, advances growth has been stellar. Within the advances growth, retail advances have been growing at a very fast clip and the entire derisking model in terms of retail is actually growing faster than the corporate book. That is a very encouraging sign. 

The second element obviously is asset quality and with the large recognition of their watch list done over the past few quarters, the asset quality pressures are ebbing off. These are clearly getting reflected on the balance sheet. 

The third element is the provision coverage ratio and the PCR including the NCLT cases have improved significantly for the bank and that instills confidence in terms of how their book is panning out. 

The fourth element obviously is their cost to income ratios and credit costs in general. If one expects them to top out and start tapering off over the next few quarters with the assumption of credit growth also improving significantly, asset quality remaining stable along with capital adequacy remaining strong, they have got the capability to push their balance sheet growth and expansion into a fast track mode. This will reflect on better ROAs and ROEs over the next couple of years. The book value also gets enhanced. There are strong fundamentals to back the elevated valuations for Axis Bank.


Bata India that too came out with a pretty impressive quarter. The profits have jumped 51%, EBITDA has grown quite smartly but that there is that fear of increased competition and more economic offerings by other footwear makers. Would Bata continue to see a spring in its step?
This has been one of my favourites over the past few months. The revenue growth of 60% and the EBIT growth was quite stellar as well and that is getting clearly reflected in terms of the strategic roadmap that the management had put in place a few quarters back. The clear strategic roadmap also included opening up of stores in tier-2, tier-3 towns. Competition always exists, but it seems competition intensity pressures have cleared out. Bata has produced a stellar set of numbers in my opinion. 

Again, if you look at the numbers top down, it has been a beat all through. So even on the operational front, the performance has been quite stellar. One really needs to normalise margins going forward and a large element in terms of the increased foray into the ladies footwear where the margins are relatively higher.

The kind of product suite that Bata has at this point of time makes a very attractive proposition in terms of how they will be able to deliver both in terms of volumes, realisations on the operating front and they do possess a very healthy balance sheet as well. 

The only argument against Bata can be the run-up in the stock and the valuations that have stacked up from a near term perspective. Apart from these two factors, the show has been pretty stellar by Bata."
37,2019-02-13,Coal India,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 338.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 223.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target. 


View of the brokerage-

Valuations attractive; maintain 'Buy': Coal India has managed to keep the cost under control despite inflationary pressure from the diesel price increase. Cash cost (ex-OBR) declined by nearly 5 per cent YoY in 9MFY19. While at the same time, nearly 10 per cent YoY increase in realization (price hike and increase in evacuation charges) boosted earnings. Adjusted EBITDA and PAT doubled YoY in 9MFY19.

Inventory levels at power plants have started to improve, which should reduce pressure on Coal India to give priority supply to the power sector and should thereby aid e-auction volumes. 

Our adjusted EBITDA estimate is upgraded by nearly 14 per cent to Rs 275bn for FY19 due to change in provision accounting. PAT estimate is raised by nearly 6 per cent to Rs 169bn due to better-than-expected performance in 3Q.

The stock trades attractively at nearly 4x FY20E EV/adj. EBITDA. We value the stock on 6.5x FY20E EV/EBITDA at Rs 338 per share."

45,2019-02-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark Sensex suffered losses for the sixth successive session on Thursday, marking its worst losing streak in five months as the rupee fell against the US dollar and crude oil prices saw a spike in global markets.

Brent crude oil hit the high of 2019 on hopes of a Sino-US trade deal, which can lift global growth and thus raise oil demand. The rupee fell 37 paise against the dollar in intraday trade. 

Investors avoided fresh bets in Indian equities, mirroring a recent trend, keeping in mind the political uncertainty ahead of the general elections. Moreover, concerns over the health of the domestic banking and financial sectors continued to hurt investor sentiment, analysts said. 

Sensex closed 158 points, or 0.44 per cent, down at 35,876, with 19 stocks ending in the red. NSE benchmark Nifty shed 48 points, or 0.44 per cent, to close at 10,746, with 29 of the 50 index stocks ending in the red and 21 in the green.

However, midcaps and smallcaps managed to log gains, as BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed higher by 0.52 per cent and 0.17 per cent, respectively. 

We walk you through the highlights of Thursday's session:


Rs 3.63 lakh crore gone in 6 daysInvestors have lost over Rs 3.63 lakh crore in last six sessions, as the overall market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies plunged to Rs 1,38,37,238 crore at the end of Thursday’s trade from Rs 1,42,00,186 crore on Wednesday, February 6. 


WPI inflation hits 10-month low
Inflation based on wholesale prices fell to a 10-month low of 2.76 per cent in January on softening prices of fuel and some food items, government data showed. Earlier this week, government data had shown an ebb in retail inflation in January. The decline in inflation may provide further head-room for RBI to cut interest rate in the coming months, experts said.


YES Bank surges 31%
Shares of YES Bank closed 30.73 per cent higher at Rs 221 after the lender received ""no observation on divergence"" in the bank’s asset classification and provisioning in RBI’s Risk Assessment Report for FY2018. With this, the scrip broke its four-day losing run on BSE. 


DHFL shares surge 16%
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) staged a smart rebound and closed 15.69 per cent higher at Rs 127.

CG Power soars 22%

Jute stocks surge after MSP hike
Shares of some jute product manufacturers surged on Thursday after the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs hiked the minimum support price for raw jute. Gloster jumped 4.92 per cent to settle at Rs 1,044 and Ludlow Jute & Specialities closed the day 2.47 per cent higher at Rs 60.10.


OMC stocks suffer

44,2019-02-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Auctions for commercial coal mining may not take place soon as the country is entering the election mode, said a senior government official.

The statement comes amid resistance from the trade unions operating in the coal sector against commercial coal mining.

""With the nation almost entering the election mode, I think it will be difficult to hear anything soon. Maybe, after a couple of months, we will be able to make bigger progress in this area (commercial coal mining auction),"" said Ashish Upadhyaya, joint secretary, coal ministry.

He was speaking during a conference on the coal sector organised by Assocham here.

""When the policy (on commercialisation) came....labours and workforce, who are important stakeholders in this industry, had apprehensions; fear that the conditions of pre-nationalisation will come back. So, it was necessary for the government to allay those fears... Had a constant interaction, dialogue and convinced them that ultimately, privatisation will be in favour of everyone,"" he said.

""Gradually, that consensus building has taken place and soon, maybe, we will have some decision on it but now timing is also an important factor,"" he said.

Last year, the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC)-affiliated Indian National Mine Workers Federation (INMF) threatened to observe a strike at Coal India Ltd (CIL) to protest against commercial mining by private companies.

In a major reform in the coal sector since its nationalisation in 1973, the government last year allowed private companies to mine the fossil fuel for commercial use, ending the monopoly of state-owned CIL.

Announcing the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had said the reform is expected to bring efficiency in the coal sector by moving from an era of monopoly to competition.

The CCEA, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had in February 2018 approved the methodology for auction of coal mines/ blocks for sale of coal under the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

The opening up of commercial coal mining for the private sector is the most-ambitious coal sector reform since the nationalisation of the sector in 1973, the minister said.

India is estimated to have coal reserves of up to 300 billion tonne."
43,2019-02-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Stock benchmark Sensex fell for the six straight day on Thursday -- its worst losing spell in over five months -- dragged down by losses in index heavyweights. 

Surging crude oil prices and a declining rupee came as a double whammy for the equity market. 

The 30-share BSE pack declined 158 points, or 0.44 per cent, to close below the 36,000-mark at 35,876. Its NSE counterpart Nifty lost 48 points, or 0.44 per cent, at 10,746. 



Market at a glance


Who won, who lost 
According to the Sensex tally, 19 declined and 11 advanced. Bharti Airtel (down 3.09 per cent) was the top loser. Singapore Telecommunications, which owns 15 per cent stake in the telecom major, saw a 14 per cent drop in its third quarter net profit.

Infosys, Asian Paints, Reliance Communications, Coal India and HDFC Bank were among other major Sensex losers, each coming off by up to 2 per cent. 

YES Bank, on the other hand, was on cloud nine, notching up significant gains to become the best performing Sensex stock. The scrip soared 31 per cent after the lender received ""no observation on divergence"" in the bank’s asset classification and provisioning in the RBI’s Risk Assessment Report for FY2018. 


Minnows flex their muscles
Midcap and smallcap indices, however, outperformed benchmark Sensex and settled in the green. BSE Midcap shut shop up 0.52 per cent while BSE Smallcap settled 0.17 per cent higher.


Sectoral watch
BSE Oil & Gas was the worst hit in the sectoral space, losing 2.11 per cent, as most of the OMC stocks like IOC, BPCL and ONGC declined. Telecom, Energy, IT and technology were other indices that took a hit today. 

Meanwhile, BSE Industrials was the top index gainer, with CG Power as the lead gainer, followed by BSE Bankex. 


Stock-specific action
DHFL shares staged a smart rebound in intraday session following a 6 per cent plunge to close 15.69 per cent higher on the BSE. The stock declined in early trade after the company said its Chief Executive Harshil Mehta has resigned.

Now, turning to factors, let's see what moved the market today.


Sharp jump in crude prices
Oil prices rose by around 1 per cent, with Brent crude futures hitting a 2019-high, buoyed by hopes that the Sino-US tariff dispute could end soon, and as China's trade figures including crude imports beat forecasts, according to a Reuters report. International Brent crude oil futures were at $64.35 per barrel, up 74 cents, or 1.1 per cent.


Rupee in a sticky spot
The domestic currency depreciated 36 paise to 71.16 against the dollar on Thursday on increased demand for the greenback from importers and banks amid rising global crude prices. A strong dollar in overseas markets and a lower opening of the domestic equity market weighed on the rupee, a currency dealer said. The decline in the domestic currency dampened investor mood. 


Expert-take
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

""Market extended losses despite positive global market as investors continued to give more focus on domestic cues while assessing global developments. Moderation in WPI to 2.76 per cent in January provides an insight about the slowdown in the economy and earnings growth. Mid and small cap rebounded after many days of correction. However, investors are yet to find stability in the market in expectation of election outcome."""

42,2019-02-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Mutual funds were seen churning their portfolios in information technology, consumption and private banking sectors during the month gone by, even as they were busy buying into a couple of metals and m ining names ahead of the Interim Budget 2019.

The domestic institutional investors offloaded shares of Wipro and HCL Technologies but accumulated those of Infosys. In the banking space, they dumped shares of private lenders IndusInd Bank and YES Bank to accumulate shares of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. They also showed preference for consumer stocks such as ITC, HUL and Asian Paints over discretionary plays such as Maruti Suzuki. Farm play M&M, too, was on the radar of these funds.

In addition, fund managers showed preference for oil marketing major IOC over BPCL. Besides, they also dumped several NBFCs and telecom stocks, data suggested.

January was the third straight month when inflows into equity funds slowed down. In fact, inflows shrank 60 per cent to Rs 6,158 crore in January over the same month last year. Lack of returns in last one month and cautiousness ahead of the general elections were seen as major reasons for the slowdown in inflows.

“Churning was evident across sectors. Akin to the trend of last few months, select private banks were in demand followed by IT and consumption names. Fund houses also reduced exposure to select auto and cement names,” Edelweiss Securities said, adding that the market has entered a wait and watch period ahead of the all-important general elections.


Select private banks saw MF buyingData suggests ICICI Bank was the biggest buy, with funds buying 4.41 crore shares of the private lender during the month. On a net basis, their exposure to the counter increased by Rs 1,606 crore during the month. HDFC Bank and Axis Bank saw mutual funds buy additional shares worth Rs 1,402 crore and Rs 1,127 crore, respectively.

In his Budget speech, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal adhered to the path of fiscal prudence by projecting a marginal 10 basis points slippage in FY19 fiscal deficit to 3.4 per cent of GDP, compared with the market expectations of 3.5 per cent. The government had initially targeted a fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent for FY19.

Post last week’s money policy review, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said if one were to go to the second decimal point, fiscal deficit would be 3.37 per cent for FY19 and 3.35 per cent for FY20, which is broadly in alignment with the path of fiscal consolidation. 

This less-than-expected slippage and the recent drop in inflation persuaded RBI to cut policy rate by 25 basis points last week. Among stocks seeing brisk buying among mutual funds, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank were the top two preferred picks of CLSA.

“The recent earnings from ICICI Bank and Axis Bank give us more confidence that the NPL cycle has indeed peaked out for these two,” CLSA said in a note. IndusInd Bank and YES Bank saw selling by mutual funds.


Agencies

Tractor maker saw buying, car makers losersThe Interim Budget 2019 was special as it was the last Budget for the ruling NPA ahead of May general elections. It was expected to appease farmers and the middle class, and it did.

Ahead of the main event, MFs were seen buying shares of tractor maker M&M to the tune of Rs 171 crore. But they sold shares of Maruti Suzuki worth Rs 218 crore in January. CLSA has cut its weightages on both stocks. 

Maruti Suzuki, like other car makers, is seeing a slowdown in auto sales growth. The largest carmaker saw its December quarter profit drop 17.21 per cent to Rs 1,489 crore.


NBFC, telecom on sell radar; metals saw buyingBajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance were a few NBFCs that saw selling by MFs during the month.

Ambit Capital in a recent note said credit growth for NBFCs would decelerate to 12 per cent in FY18-21E from 18 per cent CAGR in FY14-18, with borrowing cost rising by 35-40 basis points. It, however, noted that auto and consumer financiers are better placed than housing finance companies (HFCs) and wholesale lenders.

Metals & mining stocks Hindalco, Coal India and JSW Steel saw buying interest, but selling was seen in telecom stocks Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India. 


Funds dump Wipro, HCL for InfosysMFs bought 11.65 crore shares of Infosys in January, increasing their exposure to the IT major by Rs 1,238 crore. CLSA has increased its weight for the stock in its model portfolio. Domestic funds’ exposure to Wipro fell by Rs 383 crore, and in HCL Tech by Rs 220 crore."

47,2019-02-15,Coal India,"Bottom-fishing can start in midcaps which have corrected 50-60% and where earnings growth continues, Vivek 
   
   
   Mavani, Independent Investment Advisor, tells ET Now. Edited excerpts:

There is a lot of nervousness ahead of the elections and some of the other key geopolitical events. What do you feel market is watching out for? To what extent are they being impacted by this? Are they looking at the market technicals at the moment?
It is only market technical at the moment. The geopolitical events, terrorist attack and even the upcoming elections in the next couple of months are passing phases. Quite honestly, it is not the first time that a terrorist attack has happened. We have seen plenty of them in the last 20 years and it has not stopped market from moving on. It has not necessarily moved up always but market has a mind of its own.

Number two, as far as elections are concerned, if we look at the last 25 years, only corporate earnings and liquidity have determined the market trends. You can forcefully juxtapose election outcomes and correlate it to market movements but there is enough data in arguments against it as well. 

Finally it is only about earnings and we are almost at the conclusion of the earning season. Today or tomorrow, the last of whatever results remain would be announced. The result season has been quite mixed. Of course, positive surprises have been very few and far between. Very few companies have delighted on earnings. Even companies which delivered on good numbers did see a selloff. At a larger level, what seems to be happening and going unnoticed as a trend but is widespread irrespective of the size of the companies and across sectors, a huge amount of leverage position has been built during the bull market between 2013 and 2018, which is now unravelling. 

A huge amount of leverage was taken by promoters, by market participants -- be it brokers, operators or investors. That leverage seems to be unravelling, creating panic in stocks or sectors where it was largely prevalent. Lastly, news flow form select corporates also not been something to be delighted about. Positive news flow has also been scarce, leading to selloffs that only aggravates the leverage situation. 


Every section of the market is talking about the heinous attacks in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. What would it mean for the economy as well as the markets as it seems that it is just a matter of time before a strong retaliation from our country is going to come in as well ?
Eventually a strong retaliation will indeed come and I am sure the whole country is going to welcome it and even the markets are going to welcome it. What we may have is negative sentiment during that period but eventually markets will get back to earnings and liquidity. The last time we had that kind of retaliation and a full-fledged war was Kargil, way back in 1999 -- 20 years ago. Let us not forget it was right in the middle of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) led bull market. War continued for about a month or so. The bull market had continued even while the war was fought and subsequently. Markets have a mind of their own and these are passing phases. 

If this could be compared to 26/11, the Mumbai attacks in 2008 had a huge bull market unravelling just a couple of months after that, from 2009 onwards. Whether you can correlate that to a one-day event of the terrorist attack or any other factors, my view is it is always all other economic factors which will determine the market trend more than the terrorist attack and India hitting back and so on.


While some of the earnings may have been in line with expectations, it is still not necessarily providing that fillip to the markets that we are hoping for. How many quarters before we start to see that engine running?
It may perhaps be a while. The bull market between 2013 and 2017 saw a huge expansion of multiples -- PE ratios, EV/EBITDA, price to book. In some cases, this was supported by earnings growth and in a large number of cases, with sub-par earnings growth. What we are now seeing is contraction of those multiples and basically a reversal of the cycle that you had between 2013 and 2017.

In spite of earnings growth, the prices not being supportive is a clear indicator of contraction of multiples happening. In some sectors, namely the consumption-oriented sectors, the multiples had gone out of whack. I mean 70-80 times earnings, 100 times earnings in some cases like Page Industries, Astral Poly. There were enough high flier names. Eicher Motors comes to mind. What we have seen is even if some of them have disappointed in earnings where the contraction of multiples is justified, but even say in case of Page Industries -- another high priced stock with multiples much higher than market averages -- where the numbers have been decent, much higher than its own historic average over the last 10 years, we are seeing a contraction of those multiples. For that trend to reverse, it has to normalise first.


Would you concur then with the findings of where the EPS trend may be headed and how long we have to wait to see an all-round recovery in India Inc’s performance?
All round recovery may be difficult to really put a finger on but sectorally…


Or maybe go beyond the sectors which have performed this quarter?
Basically, not just this quarter but even if I were to look back at the last eight quarters or last two years of earnings, barring the tech sector, the consumer oriented sectors and private banks to a certain extent NBFCs, none of the sectors has really given you consistent performance. 

Company-wise, across sectors, some have consistently delivered but there have been roadblocks or headwinds here or there as well. Maruti comes to mind as it has delivered maybe in six out of the eight quarters but the last two quarters, it been facing challenges. Maybe Bajaj Auto and Hero had challenges in the previous four quarters and last three-four quarters they have started to deliver. But a) this trend is not really something which is encouraging. b) In terms of large recovery, it is time, PSU sector, banks and even non-banks in the PSU space starts delivering on earnings growth because some really large names are part of the index. They are large even by way of contribution of market cap. If we are talking of Coal India and NTPC, these kind of companies have to deliver on earnings because finally when we are talking of Nifty earnings, it is an aggregation of all of those and it is not just TCS and HDFC and HDFC Bank and Reliance actually. 

Of course it is the few names which have been holding up the Nifty but if I were to exclude the top five names in the Nifty – Reliance, HDFC, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, perhaps Nifty would be much lower than 10,000 levels or even 9500 levels. 

It would be a couple of quarters that we would see a broad-based recovery in the Nifty constituents or even across sectors. But as far as midcaps are concerned, there are enough bottom-up picks, enough companies of reasonable size which continue to deliver and have not yet disappointed and which have corrected significantly. They have corrected anywhere from 40-50-60% and in some cases even 70% and the earnings growth continues. 

So probably the bottom-fishing can start there first and my sense is the broad markets will bottom out much before your Nifty will bottom out."
48,2019-02-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The single-day additional offering of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) turned out to be a roaring success as the Rs 3,500 crore offer got subscribed over 14 times, aggregating approximately Rs 50,000 crore.

""Bharat-22 ETF (additional offering) received applications aggregating approximately Rs 50,000 crore and was subscribed over 14 times in one day,"" ICICI Prudential AMC, the manager of the issue, said in a statement.

The Additional Offering Period (AOP) set a new record in the ETF space and mutual fund industry in terms of single-day fundraising for an investment product, ICICI Prudential claimed. 

The total number of applications received was nearly 1.25 lakh.

The proceeds from the ETF sale would help the government meet its Rs 80,000 crore disinvestment target set for the current financial year.

The foundation of Bharat-22 ETF was laid in Union Budget 2017 and this was the third tranche. 

The government has so far raised Rs 22,900 crore through Bharat-22 ETF. While Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.

49,2019-02-17,Coal India,"Coal imports increased by 5.1 per cent to 189.9 million tonnes (MT) in the April-January period of the ongoing fiscal, according to a report.

Coal imports were at 180.61 (MT) in the April-January period of the previous fiscal, the report by mjunction services showed.

mjunction, a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL, is a B2B e-commerce company that also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.

But January month saw a decline in coal import to 17.25 MT from 19.59 MT in the same month of the previous fiscal.

""There was modest demand for coking and non-coking coal from Indian buyers during the month. The marginal decline in hot metal production and volatile coking coal prices in January prompted buyers to keep a tab on imports,"" mjunction MD and CEO Vinaya Varma explained.

In non-coking coal, the coal stock scenario at thermal power plants showed a steady improvement and this helped to curb volumes, he added.

Of the total imports during January 2019, non-coking coal shipments were 12.35 MT and coking coal at 3.53 MT.

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier urged state-run Coal India to pledge self-sufficiency in production to eliminate import of the dry fuel.

The government has set a target of one billion tonne of coal production by 2019-20 for the mining major, but is considering relaxing the timeline.

Coal India has announced a production target of 652 million tonne in 2018-19."

56,2019-02-18,Coal India,"I do not see any impact on my quality of assets, rather it is improving and we are settling the stressed assets 
  
  
  because there is demand increase in the market after implementation of Saubhagya scheme, Rajeev Sharma, CMD, Power Finance Corporation, tells ET Now.Edited excerpts:


You have received CCI’s nod for acquiring 52% in REC. What would be the impact on the financials due to the acquisition?
I do not see negative impact on my financials. Very recently, we have received approval from Reserve Bank of India also. So, all regulatory approvals are in place for this deal. As there are rumours in the media, our capital adequacy is increasing and we have reached 19% capital adequacy ratio. In tier-1 capital, we are having 16% and we are trying to maintain better capital adequacy ratio through various means like tying up with various banks for tier-2 capital and we are regularly monitoring our ongoing projects which we have funded. Once they are commissioned, the risk weight comes down to 50%. 

Similarly, in the advances where state government guarantees are there, we are trying to expedite those state government guarantees because risk weight comes down to 20%.


There are concerns that this acquisition is going to lead to an increase in leverage for PFC since you are resorting to borrowings to fund this acquisition. What is the mix of debt and equity?
Time and again I have clarified that it will be through repayments of our existing loans and for the rest, we will get debt from the market. I do not see any impact on my quality of assets, rather it is improving and we are settling the stressed assets because there is demand increase in the market after implementation of Saubhagya scheme. So, load is increasing in the system and these stressed assets are likely to get better rates now. We have very recently resolved one Ratle hydro project which was a hydro project in J&K of GVK Group. We have settled with the developer which is regularly paying back to us and in Q4, we will be reversing around Rs 600 crore provision which was made for this account. 

Similarly, in some other assets like SEGA, DAN Energy and Essar Transmission, we are likely to get 100% principal. We are seeing a positive movement towards resolution of these stressed assets.


Could you share with us the rough estimates of the funds you would be requiring for the acquisition? How is it going to impact your return ratios as well as CAR?
Actually the amount will be decided in accordance with SEBI guidelines and the final decision will be taken by the committee chaired by the honourable finance minister. We will come to know the exact amount only then. However, we do not see any impact on regulatory requirements of capital adequacy. We are fully aware that once we raise more than 10% of our own funds from the market, my tier-1 capital will be reduced by that amount but even after that, we will be in a comfortable position to meet the regulatory requirements of capital adequacy for our own future as well as ongoing business.


You have already made a 52% provision for stressed assets for PFC. By how much will this provision rise due to RECs acquisition?
REC is a consortium partner in most of the private sector projects. So, most of the stressed assets of REC is also with us and they have also made a provision around 48% in all these stressed assets. I do not see any further provisioning required either in REC case or in PFC case because we have made a provisioning of 52%. Rather, I am expecting that some percentage will be reversed after resolution of these stressed assets and as I explained earlier, the demand in the system is increasing after implementation of the Saubhagya scheme.

These stressed assets will fetch a better rate in the market. In one case, we were getting around Rs 3,500 crore but now a new bidder has come and he is offering me around Rs 4 crore per megawatt. So, we are getting a better rate. That is why in most of the cases we are expecting to get a better price for these stressed assets.


What is the quantum of assets that you see getting resolved and the possible provision write back as well for both PFC and REC?
Our loan asset book is roughly Rs 3 lakh crore, out of which 82% is government utilities and so there is no stress at all. In the remaining 18%, private sector 8% is also perfect. They are regularly paying back to us. So in 90%, there is no stress. Remaining 10% we have stress but these all assets are at various stages of resolution and in some cases, we are getting a good rate.

Therefore I am expecting that 52% provisioning which we have already made in all these stressed assets may be reversed. It is very difficult to specify at this stage. One asset I already said is Ratle. Of three other assets -- SEGA and DANS Energy are two hydro projects in Sikkim. We are likely to get the principal amount and similarly, in case of Essar Transmission, we are likely to get principal amount back. So we are quite comfortable. 

In all other remaining stressed assets we are making sincere efforts along with our consortium partners to resolve them amicably and to get a better rate.


 Is there going to be an open offer to minority shareholders?
It is not there but as I told you that we are already going ahead with the proposal in accordance with the SEBI guidelines and whatever approvals were required have been received already. Now REC is taking the consent from the foreign currency lender and that is pending now.


Rating agencies have said that depending on REC’s rating, PFC rating may get impacted. How would you assuage these concerns?
We are regularly in touch with these rating agencies. As you may be aware, domestic rating has been maintained AAA by CRISIL and Icra and we are regularly interacting with them and we are sharing with them our efforts and initiatives to maintain our rating like we are offloading our investments. PFC GEL has already been merged with PFC, a notification has already been issued by Corporate Affairs Ministry. 

Similarly, our investments in Power Grid we have offloaded some of it as in in NHPC and at the right time we will offload our investments in Coal India Ltd when we get a better price. We are trying to address the concerns of rating agencies. We are regularly in touch with international rating agencies as well as domestic rating agencies and we have explained to them very clearly the efforts being made by PFC in this direction."

52,2019-02-18,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices on Monday saw a positive opening but the further weakening of rupee hurt sentiment, dragging the indices into the red. 

At 9.40 am, the BSE Sensex was trading 148 points, or 0.41 per cent, lower at 35,661. The index was up over 50 points in early trade. Nifty50 fell 43 points or 0.40 per cent to 10,681. This index was trading above 10,750 in early trade.

A weakening of rupee hurts foreign inflows. Data showed foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold Rs 966 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday. The domestic currency depreciated amid a rise in crude oil prices overseas. 

Among Sensex stocks, YES Bank dropped 3.57 per cent to Rs 210.90. TCS, HCL Tech and Coal India declined 1.54 per cent, 1.43 per cent and 1.37 per cent, respectively.

YES Bank shares took a hit after the RBI warned the lender of regulatory action for disclosure of nil divergence report in violation of the confidentiality clause. YES Bank in a press release earlier this week had said the RBI has not found any divergence in the asset classification and provisioning done by the lender during 2017-18.

Shares of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group jumped up to 10 per cent after the group reached an understanding with more than 90 per cent of its lenders to avoid selling any stock pledged by the promoters until September 30 on account of lower collateral cover or reduced margin due to the recent unprecedented fall in share prices.

NTPC, Vedanta, ONGC and Tata Steel advanced 2.42 per cent, 1.87 per cent, 1.74 per cent and 1.70 per cent, respectively."
55,2019-02-18,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Rising crude oil prices came back to haunt Dalal Street as stock benchmarks Sensex and Nifty declined on Monday.

Investors shrugged off positive global sentiment as optimism on expectations of a trade resolution between the US and China was offset by the rising oil price. The trade talks shift to the US this week.

The domestic currency depreciated as a higher import bill strengthens the dollar. 

This was the eighth straight day of loss for BSE barometer Sensex, which tanked 311 points, or 0.87 per cent, to 35,498. NSE's Nifty settled lower by 0.78 per cent, or 83 points, at 10,641.

Heavyweights took more blows, which pulled down the main indices. 



Market at a glance
Among Sensex stocks, 23 declined while only seven advanced. TCS was the worst performer with a loss of 3.02 per cent, followed by YES Bank (down 2.54 per cent), ITC (down 1.95 per cent), Sun Pharma (down 1.94 per cent), Reliance Industries (down 1.91 per cent) and Coal India (down 1.67 per cent).

ONGC, on the other hand, topped the gainer's chart. Tata Motors, Axis Bank, Vedanta and NTPC were among other winners. 

Barring realty and telecom, all sectoral indices turned red. BSE Consumer Durables index was the worst hit, down 1.39 per cent, followed by energy, FMCG and IT indices. Each lost over 1 per cent. 

Midcaps and smallcaps had to put up with more pain than the Sensex. BSE Midcap bled 1.04 per cent and BSE Smallcap 1.01 per cent.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd rose as much as 7 per cent on Monday amid reports that Baring Pvt Equity, Bain Capital and Hero Fincorp are in talks to buy a stake in the debt-laden housing finance company. The scrip pared some gains to settle the day 4.67 per cent higher. 


Let's talk about market factors.



Rupee tumbles
The rupee took a hit against the dollar as crude prices firmed up to 2019 highs and tensions rose over Pulwama terror attack. The domestic unit gave up nearly 30 paise to hit a low of 71.52 against the greenback as of 15.30 hours (IST).



Oil prices hit 2019 highs
Oil prices on Monday hit their highest levels since November last year, lifted by OPEC-led supply cuts, US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, and hopes that the Sino-US trade dispute may soon end. International Brent crude futures were at $66.66 per barrel, up 41 cents, or 0.6 per cent, from their last close. Brent earlier climbed to its highest since November 2018 at $66.78 a barrel.



Persistent selling by FIIs
Foreign institutional investors were net sellers to the tune of Rs 48.73 crore during the past week as the rupee came under pressure. FIIs had bought shares worth Rs 2,518 crore during February 4-8. 



Expert-take

Rajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking

Weak sentiment continued to give the benchmarks much pain which opened the session in the red amidst broad-based selling. Market extended losses in the afternoon session with the sharp selling in IT, FMCG and banking stocks. Broader indices remained on the selling radar with mid and smallcap indices losing nearly 1 per cent. The rupee continued to be under pressure as crude crossed the $66 per barrel. Market is expected to remain volatile in the upcoming sessions."

MD, Equinomics Research & Advisory

I have recently bought some 300 shares of IOC at Rs 140. I can hold them for 1-2 years provided decent return is generated. Please advise. —S KUMAR
You may hold IOC for another two years as I expect its earnings per share to come back to around Rs 35 level within 2-3 years and the same would enable decent return from the stock.


I have 1,000 Coal India purchased at Rs 330 and 200 GATI purchased at Rs 142. I am a long-term Investor. Please suggest. —ONKAR NATHJHA
Hold Coal India (CIL)for another two years with a target price of around Rs 300 as it is most likely to revise coal prices upward and thereby improve its profitability going forward. Hold GATI for more than a year to minimise your loss with a target price of around Rs 100.


I have 500 Reliance Capital at Rs 450, 302 Jet Airways at Rs 818 and 125 GM Breweries at Rs 912.What should I do? Hold or sell? —HATHIYARI MURTUZA.
Hold GM Breweries with a target price of around Rs 600 which is a fair value of 12 PE on one-year forward earnings. Considering attractive investments it holds in insurance, home loan and consumer finance ventures, Reliance Capital looks attractive even after adjusting for the exposure to the group companies. Hence, I suggest holding it for more than two or three years to recover your cost. Recent debt resolution plan, outlook for the aviation industry, also possibility of further correction in oil price due to the slowdown in the global growth and its premium positioning in the market place give confidence that Jet Airway stock may bounce back substantially, if not to your cost prices, at least to Rs 450 level in the next two years.


I am holding shares of South Indian Bank, Tata Motors, SBI Life and ICICI Prudential Life. Are these good long-term investments? — VGK PILLAI
All stocks except Tata Motors give confidence for the long term considering the recent severe fall in their stock prices and current valuations. However, you may exit Tata Motors if it moves close to Rs 200 level as uncertainties for its European business and margin pressure in the Chinese market would continue to remain a drag on its short to medium term fundamentals.


I hold 200 stocks of Engineers India at Rs 168.71. Please advise. —SAMPATH SRINIVASAN
If you are willing to hold it for more than two years, then you may continue to hold it to realise your cost of purchase. Otherwise, you may shift to very high dividend yield stock like Balmer Lawrie Investment.


I have Tata Elxsi share at Rs 1,100. Should I average? —ASHISH YADAV
Considering its valuation of around 19 PE on current year earnings, you may add it if price goes below Rs 800. Otherwise please hold it for medium to long term to recover your cost.

59,2019-02-19,Coal India,"Mumbai: As fiscal year 2019 draws to a close and focus shifts on corporate report cards for fiscal year 2020, analysts are divided on the extent of earnings growth recovery possible in the year ahead.

While some are estimating a pickup in earnings of corporate-focused lenders, others are not so confident that credit growth would pick up substantially so soon.

“We will finally be seeing earnings growth, which has been elusive for so many years now,” says Gaurav Dua, Head of Research at Sharekhan, which is owed by BNP Paribas. He pegs Nifty earnings growth for FY20 at 18-20 per cent.

“This quarter, we again had earnings downgrades, especially in the metals space, and this downgrade cycle is somewhere close to bottoming out,” Dua adds.

He expects corporate lenders to see a dramatic improvement in profitability next financial year, due to peaking of issues related to non-performing assets (NPA). 

Dua says within the Nifty index, incremental profit from three top lenders – ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI – will contribute to double-digit growth in aggregate profit for the index companies in fiscal year 2020.

That said, he expects earnings growth to slow down in metals and energy segments due to softer global scenario. 

Kotak Institutional Equities echoes the same optimism. In a note dated December 15, Kotak analysts projected net profit of Nifty companies to grow 26 per cent in fiscal year 2020, led by a steep rise in profits of certain banks, whose bottom lines were hit by higher credit costs in 2017-18.

They also expect profit recovery in the auto sector in FY20, led by higher volumes, and in the pharmaceutical space led by revival in US generic revenues. They are also baking in moderately strong profit growth in consumption-related companies. 

For fiscal year 2019, Kotak analysts expect net profit to grow 13 per cent, led by banks due to lower loan loss provisions, lower slippages and reasonable provision coverage ratio. Coal India is also expected to contribute to Nifty earnings expansion on the back of price increases.

But other analysts are not ready to estimate higher double-digit profit growth next fiscal year.

“People expected 25 per cent growth in Nifty earnings this financial year; it will now come down to probably 8-9 per cent,” says Dhananjay Sinha, Head of Research at Emkay Global Financial Services. 

“We are projecting 8-10 per cent earnings growth for Nifty in FY20. For banks, we think loan growth is still modest and still driven by retail lending. While some NPA resolution has happened, it is not enough,” Sinha adds.

Capital goods companies, which are mostly dependent on government expenditure, may see a slowdown in an election year, Sinha says, adding that the pressure in the auto space will continue next financial year too.

In a note on Monday, ICICI Securities said the earnings downgrade cycle continues, as Nifty’s earnings per share (EPS) has been downgraded by around 5.6 per cent in December quarter and around 13.4 per cent so far this financial year. Out of 457 stocks with consensus estimates, 251 companies have seen downgrades in FY19 EPS and 274 in FY20 EPS.

ICICI Securities says even after considering the base effect of corporate lenders, Nifty earnings growth may not exceed around 15 per cent over fiscal years 2019-2021, in the absence of a broadbased pickup in private investment, lack of booster from operating and financial leverage due to a lukewarm demand environment and relatively low return on capital employed (RoCE) for leveraged and capex-heavy firms.

It hasn’t been easy for analysts to draw their estimates, given the varied view points and as hope clashes with harsh ground realities. 

“When the first set of December quarter earnings came in, things appeared to be on track, but the overall picture now looks disappointing,” says Amar Ambani, President and Head of Research at Yes Securities.

“There has been pricing pressure on auto companies, while pharma firms have seen a drop in India business. For telecom companies, Arpus (average revenue per user) are declining. Commodity cost pressure has also impacted bottom lines and cyclical businesses have disappointed,” Ambani says.

“This kind of distortions across sectors make it difficult to predict the FY20 numbers. Having said that, I will still go with a double-digit profit growth estimate for Nifty in FY20 on a lower base,” says he."
60,2019-02-20,Coal India,"NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The Union Cabinet approved a slew of decisions on Tuesday, including a new electronics policy that aims to create 10 million jobs, the promulgation of four ordinances, a scheme to build 19.5 million houses for the rural poor, a Rs 30,000-crore rapid transport system for the National Capital Region and policy changes to make oil exploration more attractive.

Separately, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs allowed captive coal mines to sell up to 25% of their output in the open market, 40,000 MW of rooftop solar projects, a new solar power scheme for farmers and the extension of key schemes for three more years.

Cabinet also approved an additional dearness allowance (DA) of 3% over the existing rate of 9% for government employees and pensioners, effective from January 1, 2019.

In all, the cabinet and the CCEA cleared 27 decisions. No major policy announcements can be made once the general elections are announced. “These are matters which have been pending, not for weeks but months… many of these matters – in fact all of them – the discussion has been physically prevented,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said.

“Indian democracy can’t be helpless,” he said when asked if the issues should have been left to the next government.


ELECTRONICS POLICY
The National Policy on Electronics 2019 seeks to make India a hub for electronic manufacturing for exports, with emphasis on a special package of incentives for mega high-tech projects including semiconductor facilities. There will be a thrust on fabless chip design, medical, automotive, power electronics and strategic electronics industry, the government said.

Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology RS Prasad said the government was aiming at $400 billion revenue by 2025 and generating over 10 million jobs.



“We are looking at making India a manufacturing and export hub. You are already aware that lots of companies are looking at moving from China to India,” said Prasad. India’s share in global electronic manufacturing is 3%, up from 1.31% in 2012-13, he said.


COAL MINING AND OIL EXPLORATION
The decision to allow 25% of production from captive mines to be sold in the open market with an additional premium on such sales seeks to make mining more attractive. The coal ministry will cancel the ongoing auction of captive coal mines as the bid documents allowed 25% output sale in the open market but did not have the provision for paying premium, an official said.

Presently, captive coal miners are not permitted to sell coal in the open market. Any coal extracted in excess of requirements has to be supplied to Coal India at a notified price. The reforms seek to enhance domestic exploration and production of oil and gas. It grants marketing and pricing freedom for new gas discoveries whose field development plan is yet to be approved.


SOLAR POWER
The CCEA approved the launch of the Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan to provide financial and water security to farmers, with central financial support of Rs 34,422 crore.

The scheme, announced in the Budget for 2018-19, includes 10,000 MW of decentralised, ground-mounted grid-connected renewable power plants, installation of 1.75 million standalone solar-powered agriculture pumps and solarisation of 1 million grid-connected solarpowered agriculture pumps.

With all three components combined, the scheme aims to add solar capacity of 25,750 MW by 2022, the government said.

The CCEA also approved Phase-II of the Grid Connected Rooftop Solar Programme to achieve cumulative capacity of 40,000 MW with ?11,814 crore support from the Centre.


ORDINANCES
The cabinet approved the promulgation of four ordinances to implement bills that were passed by the Lok Sabha but could not be cleared by the Rajya Sabha.

These are the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Second Ordinance, the Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, the Companies (Second Amendment) Ordinance and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Second Ordinance, which deals with triple talaq.

Three of the bills were agreed items but could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha because of disturbances, Jaitley said. The Companies ordinance aims to fill critical gaps in the corporate governance and compliance framework while extending greater ease of doing business to law-abiding companies."

Board meetings"
63,2019-02-20,Coal India,"Tata Power’s losses at its 4,000-MW Mundra power unit are likely to halve as the company is close to finalising revised tariff with power distribution companies (discoms). In an interview with ET, the company’s MD & CEO Praveer Sinha said that while the company is looking for acquisition opportunities in power generation, both coal-fired and renewable, it is increasing its focus on consumer-centric businesses such as power distribution, electric vehicle charging and rooftop solar. Edited excerpts:

When will Tata Power finalise the revised tariff for the Mundra project? How will it impact the company’s losses?
The Gujarat government has approved the proposal and we have circulated the draft modified power purchase agreement to all the other four procurer states. All these states are inclined to approve the PPA. There may be some differences in views, but they are keen that some solution is found because Mundra supplies one of the lowest cost power, in spite of the increase in tariff. We are supplying at Rs 2.80/unit, it will increase by 30 paise to Rs 3.10, which across all five states would still be one of the best rates. We hope to achieve consensus among states in two months. Today, we are making a Rs 1,500-crore loss on the project, which we will reduce by 50% upon tariff revision. We would still be making loss, but it will give us some relief in running this business.


Some discoms are not paying generators on time and some are seeking discounts. How do things look on the ground?
The challenge for discoms is that the more they supply, whether it is in rural areas or semi-urban areas, the more money they are losing due to under recoveries. Saubhagya scheme is very good, as it has given access to electricity to people, but for every unit that they are supplying, they are losing money heavily. Unless these discoms become financially viable, no new technology will come, no large-scale improvement will happen and they will continue to struggle to make payments. Power generators need to pay Coal India and railways in advance and transmission provider on a monthly basis. So if generators don’t get paid by discoms, there is a liquidity challenge. Banks can fund working capital for some time, but eventually you need payments to come in time. People need to respect payment terms. In our case, we have problems in one or two states, where Rs 200-300 crore is delayed beyond six months, otherwise, we get most of the payment within 90 days.


Tata Power has said that clean energy will play an important role in capacity growth. What is the growth strategy?
We are not moving away from thermal. Our investment platform with ICICI Bank, Resurgent Power, is looking for more opportunities, like the recently acquired Prayagraj Power. All thermal and hydro assets will be acquired through this platform. We will also look at acquiring good transmission asset and renewable projects. We would looks at existing large-scale utilities, more in solar than wind.


You have entered consumer-centric businesses like rooftop solar, electric vehicle charging, and even power distribution. What’s the plan to expand this segment?
We have typically been in business-to business and business-to-government. We are now moving more to consumer business as an integrated service provider. The rooftop solar or micro-grid segment is competitive; but we have an advantage as we offer end-to-end solution. We are looking at large scale rooftop solar as we can offer full services and even offer financing through Tata Capital. In 3-5 years, the rooftop solar business could become big and account for 10-15% of our business, from less than 5% now.


What is the growth plan for power distribution and electric-vehicle charging business?
We want to grow very big in power distribution since we have good knowhow. We bid for one project in Odisha and are awaiting results. Post-election, there will be more opportunities as state discoms are finding it very difficult to sustain. In the EV business, we can not only do EV charging but also do solar power-based charging and provide automation solutions. We have 15 charging points in Delhi and 15 in Mumbai and some in Hyderabad; we will set up more."
61,2019-02-20,Coal India,"Kolkata: Power companies that participated in an auction for long-term fuel supply contracts may sue Coal India for holding another round of auction and not allowing them to bid.

Coal India executives, however, said the second auction would help the stressed power plants that could not participate last time for reasons beyond their control.

Participating power companies said that the 2017 auction, Shakti B(ii), was a one-time process and was for power plants that had managed to sign power purchase agreements (PPA) but did not have steady fuel supply contract from Coal India. Bidding was on the basis of discounts on existing power tariffs offered by power producers.

Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, in a letter to cabinet secretary PK Sinha, alleged changes in CIL’s stand. “Coal India’s answers to several queries reiterated that the auction will be a one-time process only. To avoid any litigation issues arising out of loss of opportunity to bidders of the first round, it would be prudent to allow them to participate in subsequent rounds of Shakti B(ii) auctions,” he said.

A senior Coal India executive said there was confusion among power companies with the interpretation of one-time process. “Several stressed power assets could not participate in the first round of auctions for reasons beyond their control, including non-availability of discom certificates due to litigated or revised PPAs and some coal blocks being mired in litigation. The government has decided to offer this set of stressed power producers a chance to secure fuel supply contracts. We are executing the Centre’s decision. They will also be subject to the same set of rules and there would be no more Shakti B(ii) auction,” he said.

Khurana said that if the offered quantum in the second round of auction was made available in the first round itself, then the maximum quantum on offer would have increased, offering the bidders additional quantity against their requirements.

“The maximum allowable quantity (in the first auction) would be restricted to 80% of maximum requirement of all eligible bidders. Therefore, given the situation of possibility of conducting second round of auctions for participants other than earlier bidders would result in a loss of opportunity to earlier bidders,” the power producers’ lobby wrote to the cabinet secretary.

“It is clear that the shortage of 20% of requirement for the bidders was built into the scheme document and the Shakti Policy as approved by the Cabinet did not restrict coal to 80% of requirement… The earlier bidders of Shakti B(ii) auction are finding it very difficult to meet their PPA obligations in view of shortfall in coal supply. They cannot even opt for e-auction of coal as they have already offered discount on the earlier tariff,” the association wrote.

“Capping supplies to 80% of requirement was necessary to make sure all long-term coal consumers in the power sector receive the same treatment. At present, all new power plants receiving coal supplies through longterm contracts receive no more than 80% of their requirement,” the CIL executive said."
68,2019-02-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Riding on the back of gains in bank stocks and heavyweight Reliance Industries, domestic indices settled higher for the second day on Thursday. 

Optimism in Asia rubbed off on Indian equities, too. But what held back the market from going higher was losses in IT stocks, including Infosys.

The government's recapitalisation move for banks also kept the morale high.

The 30-share Sensex settled higher by 142 points, or 0.40 per cent, at 35,898, with 18 stocks in the green and 12 in the red. 

The broader NSE Nifty closed just shy of the crucial 10,800-mark at 10,790, up 54 points, or 0.51 per cent. On the 50-scrip index, 36 rose while 14 fell. 



Market at a glance

Tata Motors was the big Sensex hitter, with gains of 2.94 per cent, followed by Vedanta, ONGC, Bajaj Finance and Vedanta. YES Bank was the worst hit, down 1.33 per cent. Infosys, Maruti, Coal India and IndusInd Bank were among those that bled. 

Barring IT and technology, all sectoral indices scored. Basic Materials, metals and consumer durables were the lead gainers, rising over 1 per cent each. 

Midcaps and smallcaps left the benchmark Sensex behind. While the BSE Midcap index rose 0.88 per cent, BSE Smallcap went up 1.07 per cent. 

Shares of Reliance Nippon Asset Life Management (RNAM) surged by 19.98 per cent to Rs 187.05 after Reliance Capital said it has invited Nippon Life Insurance to acquire up to 42.88 per cent, which is its entire stake, in RNAM.



So, what factors were at play?



World stocks lend support
Signs the United States and China were tackling some of the stickiest issues in their trade war kept world shares near a four-month high, though it could not prevent a favourite Chinese proxy, the Aussie dollar, hitting the skids, as per Reuters.



Fed minutes cheer investors
Federal Reserve minutes of the January meeting affirmed that the central bank would be ""patient"" on further interest rate rises as the economy remained fundamentally strong. This cheered investors the world over. 


Expert-take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Market extended gains as investors sentiment has been boosted owing to recapitalisation of PSU banks and Fed's affirmation of slow pace in rate hikes. Accumulation is seen on heavyweights after recent fall while mid and small cap outperformed. Undercurrent in the market is yet to stabilise due to caution on global trade and growth while falling interest rates and reforms by government will give impetus to consumption led stocks."
67,2019-02-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The market is telling you what’s on the investor’s mind: While low PE stocks continue to bleed, so-called growth stocks have been among the top gainers in an otherwise depressed market.

Looks like investors are in no mood to chase value at the moment. And given the pre-election uncertainty, the trend is unlikely to change for now. 

The disconnect between price and value in ’growth’ and ‘value’ stocks is such that many of the growth stocks are trading at expensive valuations, even on FY2021 earnings estimates, while many value stocks are ruling at inexpensive valuations, even on FY2019 basis, said Kotak Securities. 

Out of the 49 BSE 200 stocks that have gained between 10 per cent and 60 per cent in last 12 months, half had PE multiples in excess of 40, data compiled from AceEquity suggests.

Shares of HUL and Nestle India have gained 30 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively. The two FMCG stocks have managed to sustain high price multiples in last 12 months, even as the benchmark BSE200 has declined 2 per cent in the same period. 

Shares of United Breweries are up 28 per cent; Jubilant Foodworks has gained 34 per cent and Bajaj Finance 56 per cent while Pidilite Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur India have risen up to 25 per cent in last one year.

And look at the low PE stocks: oil firms ONGC, BPCL and HPCL, power firms NTPC, REC, Power Grid, Torrent Power, NBFC stocks Dewan Housing and Reliance Capital, metals & mining companies Vedanta, Coal India and NMDC are down up to 77 per cent during this period.


What disappointed
Calendar 2019 has an even worse record: none of the 40 stocks that quoted single-digit PE as of December 31, 2018 are in the green. 

Analysts say poor returns by these stocks are either reflecting the poor growth prospects and, in many cases, concerns over corporate governance.

“Stocks quoting low PEs at this point mostly belong to heavily-indebted firms or companies with unstable earnings. As such, the pressure on stock prices are further dragging their valuations. Low PE in no way suggests a stock is cheap and that it is a better company to bet on for the future,” said Sameer Kalra of Equity Research Analyst and Founder, Target Investing.

Among the top 10 BSE200 losers so far are three ADAG group stocks Reliance Power (down 63 per cent), Reliance Infrastructure (down 62 per cent) and Reliance Capital (down 35 per cent). These stocks have been hammered after two lenders sold shares pledged with them by the promoters.

Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation have dropped xx per cent. Company’s CEO Harshil Mehta resigned earlier this month. A news portal recently alleged that the NBFC was involved in a financial scam as big as Rs 31,000 crore. The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

“Certain so-called value companies have found new ways to disappoint investors on corporate governance, thereby making the valuation argument largely redundant for such stocks,” Kotak Securities said.

Graphite electrode makers Graphite India, HEG are seeing tough days as electrode prices have softened due to weak global steel prices, increased Chinese imports into India and select trade restriction placed by the US.

Adani Power and IDBI Bank have been posting losses. Nalco has seen 58 per cent plunge in Q3 earnings, while Vedanta has been in news on concerns over corporate governance.

In contrast, among the top BSE200 stocks this year are from IT sector, where firms do offer earnings guidance at the end of each quarter. Two are private lenders, and one is consumer-oriented firm (Titan Company, which too offers guidance on its jewellery business).


Smart money chases growth
Smart money will always chase growth even at the higher premium, Kalra said. “For good retail and institutional investors, growth has always been a key criteria as cleaner growth is much more sustainable. Growth is what makes them give premium valuations to stocks. Consumer stocks are a case in point. They always trade at a higher premium as they are high cash flow businesses and there is high earnings visibility. It’s easy to estimate growth simply by looking at volumes,” he said. 

Kotak Securities said: ""The market seems to have taken a permanent view on the future of most companies, thereby effectively segregating companies into long-term winners; which are companies with superior business models, trustworthy managements and good corporate governance practices where no price or valuation may be too high to own the stocks, and long-term losers; which are companies with inferior business models and poor governance practices where no price or valuation may be too low to avoid the stocks.""


Election & demand for qualityElection dates are likely to be announced over the next three weeks. In a study of past three general elections, Elara Capital found that volatility usually rises sharply ahead of Lok Sabha elections and cool off only after the election outcome. In a study of the 2004 -2018 period, the brokerage found that quality stocks tend to outperform in an uncertain market.

The brokerage says by high quality, it refers to companies with RoCE of greater than 15 in each of last five years, net debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1, positive free cash flow (FCF) yield for at least four out of last five years and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) either stable or increasing. Within the BSE200 universe, there are 34 companies that fit the bill.

The brokerage has recommended 15 of them, which include Castrol India, Cyient, Eicher Motors, Gillette India, GSK Consumer, Infosys, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, Oracle, Sun TV Network and Tata Elxsi.

65,2019-02-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Stock benchmarks Sensex and Nifty got off to a flat start on Thursday amid gains in select bank and financial shares. 

A day after logging healthy gains, both indices saw some turbulence early today despite an upbeat trend in major Asian markets. 

Asian shares pulled ahead to fresh 4-1/2-month highs after the US Federal Reserve reaffirmed that it would be ""patient"" on further interest rate hikes as Sino-US trade talks hinted at progress towards a breakthrough in their tariff war, Reuters reported.

The gains of Nifty and Sensex were capped by the rise in crude oil prices as the commodity rose more than 1 per cent in global markets to their highest in 2019. 

The rise in oil prices dragged Indian rupee slightly lower. The domestic unit had appreciated by 23 paise to end 71.11 against the dollar on Wednesday, snapping the losing streak of four sessions.

The rupee, however, was still in the green and traded 13 paise higher against the US dollar around 9:30 am. 

The BSE Sensex was 35 points, or 0.10 per cent, up at 35,791, while the NSE Nifty was 13 points, or 0.12 per cent, up at 10,748 at that time. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.44 per cent and 0.40 per cent up, respectively.

ICICI Bank, Vedanta, ONGC, Tata Motors and Sun Pharma were among the top gainers in the Sensex index. Infosys, Bharti Airtel, YES Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra and Coal India were among the top losers.

Telecom, IT and teck were the losers in the sectoral space on BSE. Losses in shares of Bharti Infratel (down 2.16 per cent), Bharti AIrtel (down 1.05 per cent) and ITI (down 0.47 per cent) dragged the BSE Telecom index 1 per cent down.

The finance ministry on Wednesday announced a Rs 48,239 crore capital infusion in 12 public sector banks to help them meet regulatory capital requirements and make growth capital available for the stronger lenders. 

Shares of most PSU banks were trading with gains as the Nifty PSU Bank index climbed 1 per cent.

Meanwhile, Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 713 crore worth of domestic stocks on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 113 crore, data suggested."
66,2019-02-21,Coal India,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 281.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 213.70.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target.


Investment rationale by the brokerage:

Valuations at 50 per cent discount to its averages and dividend yield at 9-10 per cent: Coal India (COAL) has witnessed unprecedented de-rating over the past 2-3 years. Its stock is currently trading at 7.4x P/E v/s average of 14x (Exhibit 1:), despite strong RoE at 35-40 per cent (Exhibit 2:) and 3.5x EV/EBITDA v/s average of 7.2x (Exhibit 3:). The company continues to generate strong free cash flows (Exhibit 4:), which allows it to distribute dividends in excess of 100 per cent of earnings (Exhibit 5:). Currently, dividend yield has increased to 9-10 per cent with current valuations at 45-50 per cent discount to long-term averages, which is a typical trait of a commodity stock at the peak of an earnings cycle. But, the same is perplexing in the case of COAL as 81 per cent of its revenue is non-cyclical. Selling price of FSA coal is currently at 50 per cent discount to E-auction prices i.e. market price, which means there is still significant pricing power left with the company. Only 19 per cent of the revenue is subject to the market price of coal and is cyclical in nature. If we were to model historically the lowest E-auction price of Rs 1,536/t (in FY17), the stock would still be trading at 4.3x EV/EBITDA, P/E of 9.2x and dividend yield of nearly 8 per cent, which means valuations would still range between 35-40 per cent discount to historical averages.


Valuations and dividend yields are compelling: COAL has managed to keep cost under control despite inflationary pressure. Operating leverage and high natural attrition are driving operating efficiencies. Price hike about a year ago boosted earnings, offsetting the wage hike impact. Coal quality issues have completely worked through in the revenue. Adj. EBITDA is expected to increase at CAGR of 12 per cent and EPS at 16 per cent over FY18-21E. We have reduced target price to Rs 281 (earlier Rs 338) by reducing EV/EBITDA multiple from 6.5x to 5x to account for our concerns. Maintain Buy.


Unprecedented de-rating of stock: Coal India (COAL) has witnessed unprecedented de-rating over the past 2-3 years. Its stock is currently trading at 7.4x P/E v/s average of 14x (Exhibit 1:), despite strong RoE at 35-40 per cent (Exhibit 2:) and 3.5x EV/EBITDA v/s average of 7.2x (Exhibit 3:). The company continues to generate strong free cash flows (Exhibit 4:), which allows it to distribute dividends in excess of 100 per cent of earnings (Exhibit 5:). Currently, dividend yield has increased to 9-10 per cent with current valuations at 45-50 per cent discount to long-term averages, which is a typical trait of a commodity stock at the peak of an earnings cycle. But, the same is perplexing in the case of COAL as 81 per cent of its revenue is non-cyclical. Selling price of fuel supply agreement (FSA) coal is currently at 50 per cent discount to E-auction prices i.e. market price, which means there is still significant pricing power left with the company. Only 19 per cent of the revenue is subject to the market price of coal and is cyclical in nature. If we were to model historically the lowest E-auction price of Rs 1,536/t (in FY17), the stock would still be trading at 4.3x EV/EBITDA, P/E of 9.2x and dividend yield of nearly 8 per cent, which means valuations would still range between 35-40 per cent discount to historical averages."

India strikes: Following the Pulwama attack, IAF bombed and destroyed Jaish-e-Mohammed's trainings camp in Pakistan in the early hours on Tuesday, killing terrorists. Eventually, the domestic indices bled over 500 points, though recovering in the midday trade. Sameer Kalra, equity research analyst ,Target Investing said that this panic gap down and any further slide in the indices can be a buying opportunity.



Global markets fizzle: After surging to a five-month high, Asian shares lost cheer on Tuesday, as market watchers awaited if Washington and Beijing can strike a trade deal. European markets were also weak despite fading fears of a no-deal Brexit. On the other hand, US stocks were down too, with E-Minis for the S&P 500 falling 0.4 per cent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares fell 0.5 per cent.



Rupee weakens: Indian markets faced south, as the rupee depreciated by 5 paise to 71.05 against the greenback at around 15:30 pm on fresh demand for the US currency from importers, strengthening of dollar against some currencies overseas and a lower opening in domestic indices.

     Despite fear of escalation in geopolitical tensions, market recouped some losses and stayed rangebound for further cues from both the countries. The rupee also weakened, as investors haven’t ruled out the possibility of heightened tension. Market movement is likely to be cautious until further clarity over cross border threat.

     We expect market to remain volatile in the near term. On the global front, positive developments on the US-China trade deal is good for the global markets, however, progress on the Brexit deal front, crude oil price and currency movement would be actively tracked by the investors. Domestically, geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan would keep the markets volatile. Further, India’s Q3FY19 GDP numbers on Thursday would be keenly watched. We advise investors and traders to follow stock specific approach."
71,2019-02-26,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India’s e-auction prices rose about 53% in the December quarter, when the company offered half the quantity it did a year ago after diverting supplies to power plants.

It offered 14.65 million tonnes of coal during the quarter against 30.8 million tonnes a year earlier. As a result, average prices rose to Rs 2,847 per tonne from 
Rs 1,859 per tonne. Coal India increased supplies to power, its priority sector, at the cost of other customers.

“Non-power companies including captive power plants were thus hard pressed for coal, raising demand and its prices at auctions,” a company executive said.

ET reported earlier that the government had asked Coal India’s subsidiaries to increase supplies to the power sector. About 5,800 goods trains allotted to other customers were not loaded in November and December.

Demand from power plants started rising last July. Coal India’s average realisation from auctions was Rs 2,678 per tonne in the September quarter, which was 52% higher than a year earlier. The company had reduced e-auction offerings by 8.8% during the quarter."
72,2019-02-26,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Headline indices Sensex and Nifty opened with deep cuts on Tuesday, as escalating tension between India and Pakistan spooked investors on Dalal Street.

Nearly two weeks after a terror strike at Pulwama, Indian Air Force is claimed to have carried out aerial strikes on terror camps early Tuesday.

Indian Air Force on Tuesday carried out aerial strikes at major terror camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, completely destroying them, 12 days after the ghastly terror attack in Pulwama, ANI reported.

Pakistan has claimed that the Indian Air Force violated the Line of Control (LoC).

Experts say, the move may aggravate the already simmering tension between the two neighboring countries and may have other geopolitical ramifications.

Sensex plunged nearly 500 points in opening deals and Nifty slipped below the 10,740 level. The volatility index India VIX surged 17 per cent, logging its biggest intraday jump this year.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.46 per cent and 0.87 per cent down, respectively, at that time. 

Rupee also pared some losses, following dollar's weakness and a fall in the global crude oil prices. However, it was still trading 9 paise lower.

Asian markets also showed bearish trend. Asian shares lost steam on Tuesday after scaling a five-month high as investors waited to see if Washington and Beijing can clinch a trade deal, while the pound advanced on hopes UK Prime Minister Theresa May will delay a Brexit deadline, Reuters reported.

79,2019-02-27,Coal India,"We always thought the next few months are going to remain volatile that but obviously this geopolitics has
  
  
  added an extra level of volatility we were not expecting, said Andrew Holland, CEO, Avendus Capital Alternate, in an interview with ET Now.Edited excerpts: 

How are you looking at the sort of geopolitical events and how the has the market been reacting to it? Would you to take heart from the fact that there have not been too many knee jerk reactions and we are still looking at a level of 10823 despite changes in the geopolitical front?
We have walked away from yesterday in terms of hoping that there have been a fair bit of escalation to being spooked by what we heard this morning and which is why the market fell. We are just thinking what next and that means the markets may just remain volatile until the whole thing unfolds. Until then, we can hold these levels depending on what is said and what is not said.


Are you bullish or bearish right now?
Notwithstanding what is going on geopolitically, we have been feeling for some time that the market is going to be volatile. It has been volatile and it remains volatile. We are more concerned about global factors. We do feel that the US is in recession already and Europe and the UK are heading towards recession. China unfortunately has no data, but we think it is slowing very quickly.

The government environment is not great but if global markets fell, that would be a good opportunity to pick up good stocks in India if we got tarred with the same brush. We will see how that one plays out and then we have got the election. We always thought the next few months are going to remain volatile that but obviously this geopolitics has added an extra level of volatility we were not expecting.


What exactly are markets pricing in from election verdict? Scenario number one is return of the current administration in the existing avatar, which comes back with majority. Second, the current administration comes back with outside support and third, change of administration. Out of the three possible scenarios, what do you think markets are betting on?
Markets would love number one; number three would be fine as well and number two as long it is not too messy, would be okay too. You are not going to change the economy. The economy is still going to grow at 7-7.5% and as long as the market feels that the reforms that we have seen in past year continue, then there is not that much to worry about.

Obviously since the budget and including yesterday, the market was expecting that the BJP’s vote base was increasing and we are going to see it come back with 250 seats. So, there is a bit more confidence that we are going to get the same government, the same processes, same reforms. That was heartening for the markets this morning initially.


The intense sell-off in four-wheelers and two-wheelers is getting arrested. Do you think that the one-time adjustment that we saw in October, November, December and January will see a slowdown in auto sales? The crunch in NBFC lending and fear of an interest rate hike is behind us . Could auto be considered as a good contra buy in a market like this?
No, I do not think so. I think the whole sector is a structural sell. It is on a great-great run but with volumes and revenues falling, the operational gearing that these companies enjoy is going to reverse and this is where you are going to see some big downgrades. I still do not think we are over in the downgrade stage yet and consider it is a sector to avoid. It is a sell basically.


What are those names according to you would turn a buyer on 10-15% correction?

 Let us just take the overall FMCG sector. It will continue to be highly rated. If you saw any correction of that magnitude, we would be stepping in straight away because the long-term as well as the short-term growth story is compelling. This is where you will get operational gearings. This is where you are going to get margin improvements and the consumption at this level is going to continue to a pace.

The big change obviously is GST where the bigger will get bigger because the smaller players just cannot compete, given all working capital problems and the transparency that you have to have now. So for the FMCG majors, it is open fields to go in and take market share. They do not need to get into pricing wars because all are enjoying good volume growth.

In the auto sector on the other hand, you are now going to see pricing wars and so cost pressure will get higher and higher. The profit forecast will have to fall for the auto sector and can be increased marginally for the FMCG sector.


Nifty 50 companies have the strongest dividend yield and I was actually surprised to see that it starts with PSUs. Coal India with 8-9% dividend yield, HPCL, BPCL 5-6% dividend yield. ONGC 4-5% dividend yield. Is there merit in buying some of these PSU stocks?
 It is very tempting and we have talked for many years about PSU stocks and particularly oil marketing companies. The problem is that you just do not know what the government interventions are going to be. Yes they are going to pay dividends because the government needs money but you are never quite sure how they are going to change in terms of the overall outlook, as we saw a few months ago for oil marketing companies. The government just took half of the revenue away. These kind of things affect the share price and not the dividend yield.

This is where I see the problem for the PSUs and this is same in the PSU banks as well. You just do not need to own them. You can rent them occasionally to maybe hide or enjoy a short-term rally but owning them is fraught with risks of intervention by the government.


What is the take on the cement space as a whole?
The cement sector has picked up from recent lows on the basis that prices will increase going forward. I am not sure I would like to chase this sector. There are only two sectors I really like -- FMCG and private banks. 

The rest will get dragged down with the market. I mentioned the global headwinds which could bring all markets down including ours. But just fast forward six to eight months and interest rates would be lower in India because globally they would be lower; commodity prices, in case of a downturn in terms of global commodity prices including oil, would be way below where they are today. If you have a stable government, that will set India apart from anywhere else.

I think that is where you would get a very strong rally. So I am more looking at that scenario which obviously includes you question on the elections as well. That is what I am looking to do. Whenever I see the markets fall, it is an opportunity from some of the problems which are going to be emanating elsewhere in terms of the global economy.


Which part of your portfolio are you committed to irrespective of the election or geopolitical tensions? The core of the portfolio which you have locked up in your mind for three, four, five years?
I have to answer slightly differently than maybe you wanted but as you know, we have a number of funds. One of the funds is called the Avendus Enhanced Fund -- 70% of which is invested in 15 to 20 high conviction stocks over the next three years. I would not be expecting churn in these stocks very quickly but with the rest 30%, I can hedge when I feel I need to do so.

So, it is a different strategy. The high conviction stocks will stay and the 30% will be used to hedge the downside or even enhance the upside, if we feel the markets are at a value which we can make better returns as well. The aim of the fund is to try and beat the Nifty over the next three years by at least one and a half times."
80,2019-02-28,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India (CIL) has decided to reopen a number of mines that were closed earlier due to safety or viability issues. It is an endeavour to generate local employment and increase production of higher grade of coal.

Subsidiaries such as Central Coalfields — which had closed three mines — and Bharat Coking Coal — that has many such mines — are collating data and assessing feasibility.

“Once ascertained, we would make sure safety issues are addressed and work on receiving environment clearances,” said Gopal Singh, chairman and managing director at Central Coalfields. He also holds additional charge of chairman of Bharat Coking Coal.

“Reopening mines will generate employment for locals and produce more coal, which will help in furthering the country’s effort towards providing affordable electricity for all and generating employment,” he said.

A senior Coal India executive said surplus manpower can also be deployed at such mines.

On Monday, Central Coalfields reopened the Rajhara coal mine in Jharkhand, where operations had been suspended since 2010 due to safety concerns.

A senior Coal India executive said the mine was opened on Monday after getting environmental clearance on February 14.

Rajhara was initially an underground mine but after nationalisation it was converted into an opencast mine to recover good quality reserves of coal which otherwise would have been lost.

The mine, located close to Sadabah river, a tributary of North Koel, had to be closed since operations were below the high flood level of the river.

“We took several corrective and precautionary measures for safety of mine and its environmental clearance so that the mine could be reopened,” said a senior executive from Central Coalfields.

Expected grade of coal from the mine is G9 which is priced at Rs 1465 per tonne for the power sector. Existing reserves in the mine is estimated at 5 million tonnes. With a capacity to extract 3 lakh tonnes of coal per year, the life of the mine is pegged at 18 years."

According to the official, the body, located 200 ft away from the bottom of the mine, was brought out using the Indian Navy's underwater remotely operated vehicle (UROV) and an NDRF boat on Wednesday.

This is the second ""heavily"" decomposed body to be lifted from the mine after it flooded accidentally on December 13, 2018.

It was dispatched to the civil hospital at the district headquarters at Khliehriat for post-mortem examination, operations spokesperson R Susngi told PTI.

The miners were trapped deep inside the coal pit after water from the nearby Lytein river had gushed into the mine at Lumthari village in the Ksan area of East Jaintia Hills district.

The first body, identified as that of Amir Hussain from Assam's Chirang district, was pulled out of the mine on January 23.

Apart from the Indian Navy, the Army and the NDRF, the state's agencies are engaged in the operations that began hours after the accident took place.

Three companies, the Coal India Ltd, Kirloskar Brothers Ltd and the KSB, continued with de-watering the mines and their total water discharge in 24 hours is over 1 crore litres, Susngi said."

88,2019-02-28,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal stocks at power plants and mine pitheads have risen to a total of 60 million tonnes, enough to generate electricity for 36 days, ending scarcity that lasted several months. 

Power sector executives say lower demand in recent winter months helped reduce fuel consumption, which increased stocks. Power plants now have stocks to run for 15 days and every unit has fuel, a marked improvement from October when they had enough coal for just six days and many had no coal at all. 

Pithead stocks are enough to run power plants for 21 days. Stocks at power plants have risen to 25.37 million tonnes from about 10 million tonnes last October, while pithead stocks have risen to 34.50 million tonnes from 20 million tonnes in November. A senior Coal India executive said stock situation is critical at only three plants and ‘super critical’ at another two. 

“Supplies to these plants are an issue due to logistics constraints,” he said. 

Power producers said stocks rose because it was the lean season but plants need to stock up fuel as much as they can afford to. Coal India is requesting power firms to lift as much coal as possible to prepare for the summer demand."

0,2019-03-01,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty witnessed a healthy start to Friday's session on signs of an ebb in Indo-Pak tensions and positive Asian cues.

Asian shares rose on Friday, driven by a rally in Chinese markets after index publisher MSCI announced it would boost the proportion of mainland shares in its global benchmarks, Reuters reported.

The market shrugged off the worries over weak macroeconomic numbers. 

India's GDP growth slowed to a five-quarter low of 6.6 per cent in October-December on the back of the lower farm and manufacturing growth and weaker consumer demand, government data showed Thursday.

Economic growth estimate for the current fiscal year ending March 31 has been revised downwards to 7 per cent from the earlier estimate of 7.2 per cent. This is the lowest growth in the last five years.

Another set of government data showed the eight core industries grew at the slowest pace in 19 months in January as the production of crude oil, refinery products and electricity contracted. The infrastructure sectors expanded by 1.8 per cent in January 2019, the lowest growth rate since June 2017.

Despite weak key macroeconomic numbers, market cheered the ebb in tension between India and Pakistan. Pakistan is to release captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman today.

Moreover, the market is hoping that a weaker set of macro data may push RBI for a further rate cut in its next policy meet. 

Sensex jumped 270 points and Nifty topped 10,870 in early deals. Around 9:25 am, the Sensex was 258 points, or 0.72 per cent, up at 36,125, while Nifty was 75 points, or 0.70 per cent, up at 10,868.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were 0.79 per cent and 0.87 per cent up, respectively, around that time. 

In the Sensex index, Vedanta, YES Bank, NTPC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Tata Steel were leading among gainers. Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Auto and Coal India were in the red.

Barring telecom, all sectoral indices on BSE were in the green. Losses in the shares of Bharti Airtel and Tata Communications dragged the index lower. 

Shares of Bharti Airtel fell nearly 4 per cent even as the company's board approved plans to raise as much as Rs 32,000 crore through equity and bond sales in one of the largest such exercises by an Indian company. 

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 3,210 crore worth of domestic stocks on Thursday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 5,240.62 crore, data suggested."
1,2019-03-01,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Most sugar stocks jumped higher in Friday's session, a day after India's cabinet approved funds to pay interest on loans to the sugar industry.

India's cabinet on Thursday approved a plan to spend up to Rs 1,054 crore to pay interest on loans to the sugar industry for a year, in a bid to help sugar mills clear their dues to farmers.

Shares of Dharani Sugars & Chemicals (up 6.75 per cent), Uttam Sugar Mills (up 5.90 per cent) and DCM Shriram Industries (up 5.77 per cent) were the top gainers in the sugar space.

Shares of Kesar Enterprise (up 5.63 per cent), Triveni Engineering & Industries (up 5.54 per cent), Dwarikesh Sugar Industries (up 5.53 per cent), Thiru Arooran Sugars (up 4.97 per cent), Parvati Sweetners (up 4.74 per cent), Indian Sucrose (up 4.69 per cent) and Rana Sugars (up 4.41 per cent), too, were trading with healthy gains.

2,2019-03-01,Coal India,"As investors chase dividend-paying stocks on Dalal Street in an uncertain market, it has spelt good times for Bharat 22 ETF, the exchange-traded fund that made news this past fortnight with record subscription to its third tranche offering.

In a volatile market with mixed outlook, companies with a strong track records of doling out dividends are finding favour with investors.

Many of the cash-rich PSU stocks that are part of Bharat 22 are high dividend yield companies and are trading at cheaper valuations compared with the broader market. These stocks have been performing well in the past few days, aiding the performance of the ETF. 

This has come as an icing on the cake for the investors, who subscribed to the additional offering of Bharat-22 ETF during the single-day window for the third tranche. While these subscribers were offered a 5 per cent discount on the units, the scheme also delivered around 9 per cent return this past fortnight against a 0.14 per cent rise in Nifty50. 

On an absolute basis, the ETF delivered 3.87 per cent return compared with a 0.58 per cent gain in Nifty during this period.

Analysts on Dalal Street estimate Nifty50 companies to deliver an aggregate dividend yield of 2.2 per cent for financial year 2020. Within the Nifty pack, the constituents are projected to deliver an aggregate dividend yield of 2.2 per cent for FY20. The highest yield is expected from the energy sector at 5.3 per cent and lowest from the pharma basket at 0.75 per cent. Analysts expect six out of 50 Nifty stocks to have a dividend yield in excess of 5 per cent.

The PSUs that are part of Bharat 22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India, Nalco, Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Besides, there are three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- and private sector firms Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, where the government holds small stakes through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India or SUUTI.

Most of these are cash-rich companies with history of declaring dividends generously. Analysts expect Coal India, ONGC and IOC to deliver best dividend yields in the Nifty50 pack in excess of 5 per cent in FY20. In the midcap basket, Nalco is projected to deliver over 5 per cent dividend yield.

The Bharat 22 ETF, which is managed by ICICI Prudential AMC, tracks the BHARAT 22 Index.

“BHARAT 22 Index is available at a cheap valuation compared with the broad market indices. All the companies forming part of BHARAT 22 are high dividend yielding companies. The index constituents of BHARAT 22 have performed well in last few days, which has added to the performance of the scheme,"" said Chintan Haria, Head of Product Development and Strategy at ICICI Prudential AMC.

The government has been using the BHARAT 22 ETF for disinvesting its holdings in profitable PSUs. The government has so far raised Rs 26,400 crore through the Bharat-22 ETF – Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018 and Rs 3,500 crore this February.

BHARAT 22 ETF is exposed to six sectors with a 15 per cent cap on single stock and 20 per cent on a single sector.

ETFs are considered better investment options within the mutual fund basket because of the cost advantage they offer. Being passive funds, they charge miniscule fund management fee.

Bharat 22 ETF has a 93 per cent exposure to largecaps, which makes it a safer bet in an uncertain market. Haria says improving domestic macros are a major positive for the ETF, while favourable government policies, too, are expected to work to the advantage of some of the PSUs, eventually helping the ETF."

Expert-take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

""Market rallied as cues on easing border tensions and expectations of US-China trade agreement lifted sentiment. Outperformance was seen in bank, small and midcaps in expectation of rate cut from RBI, after a slowdown in GDP growth in the third quarter. Investors are gradually churning their portfolio to high quality small and midcaps where valuation looks attractive."""
5,2019-03-01,Coal India,"Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy call on Coal India with a target price of Rs 281.

The current market price of Coal India is Rs 232.40.

Time period given by the brokerage is one year when Coal India price can reach the defined target. 


Investment rationale by the brokerage:

Valuations at 50 per cent discount to its averages and dividend yield at 9-10 per cent: Coal India (COAL) has witnessed unprecedented de-rating over the past 2-3 years. Its stock is currently trading at 7.4x P/E v/s average of 14x (Exhibit 1:), despite strong RoE at 35-40 per cent (Exhibit 2:) and 3.5x EV/EBITDA v/s average of 7.2x (Exhibit 3:). The company continues to generate strong free cash flows (Exhibit 4:), which allows it to distribute dividends in excess of 100 per cent of earnings (Exhibit 5:). Currently, dividend yield has increased to 9-10 per cent with current valuations at 45-50 per cent discount to long-term averages, which is a typical trait of a commodity stock at the peak of an earnings cycle. But, the same is perplexing in the case of COAL as 81 per cent of its revenue is non-cyclical. Selling price of FSA coal is currently at 50 per cent discount to E-auction prices i.e. market price, which means there is still significant pricing power left with the company. Only 19 per cent of the revenue is subject to the market price of coal and is cyclical in nature. If we were to model historically the lowest E-auction price of Rs 1,536/t (in FY17), the stock would still be trading at 4.3x EV/EBITDA, P/E of 9.2x and dividend yield of nearly 8 per cent, which means valuations would still range between 35-40 per cent discount to historical averages.


Key concern #1: coal demand will be crowded out by renewable energy- Indian power has huge potential for growth because per capita electricity consumption in the country is just 1/3rd of the world average. Currently, average energy load is nearly 140GW (equivalent to 100 per cent PLF), which is expected to grow to more than 3x over time, while total renewable energy (RE) potential is 900GW, meaning an average energy generation of nearly 150GW. RE’s share in the power mix can reach maximum of 35 per cent in India, which means that an average demand of 250-280GW will have to be met by coal. Thus, we believe coal demand will increase 2.5-3x over time even if the entire RE potential is fully tapped. Coal will continue to be the key driver of power generation in India. Though COAL accounts for 83 per cent of the domestic coal production, it meets only 66 per cent of the domestic demand, with a huge opportunity for import substitution. Therefore, we believe, demand for domestic coal will grow at a faster rate than power generation.


Key concern #2: continuous selling by the promoters- The Government of India (GoI) has sold nearly Rs 378b worth of shares in the last five years. GoI can further reduce stake by maximum 20 per cent (worth nearly Rs 220b at current market cap). Future selling will be much less than in the last five years.


Valuations and dividend yields are compelling: COAL has managed to keep cost under control despite inflationary pressure. Operating leverage and high natural attrition are driving operating efficiencies. Price hike about a year ago boosted earnings, offsetting the wage hike impact. Coal quality issues have completely worked through in the revenue. Adj. EBITDA is expected to increase at CAGR of 12 per cent and EPS at 16 per cent over FY18-21E. We have reduced target price to Rs 281 (earlier Rs 338) by reducing EV/EBITDA multiple from 6.5x to 5x to account for our concerns. Maintain Buy.


Unprecedented de-rating of stock: Coal India (COAL) has witnessed unprecedented de-rating over the past 2-3 years. Its stock is currently trading at 7.4x P/E v/s average of 14x (Exhibit 1:), despite strong RoE at 35-40 per cent (Exhibit 2:) and 3.5x EV/EBITDA v/s average of 7.2x (Exhibit 3:). The company continues to generate strong free cash flows (Exhibit 4:), which allows it to distribute dividends in excess of 100 per cent of earnings (Exhibit 5:). Currently, dividend yield has increased to 9-10 per cent with current valuations at 45-50 per cent discount to long-term averages, which is a typical trait of a commodity stock at the peak of an earnings cycle. But, the same is perplexing in the case of COAL as 81 per cent of its revenue is non-cyclical. Selling price of fuel supply agreement (FSA) coal is currently at 50 per cent discount to E-auction prices i.e. market price, which means there is still significant pricing power left with the company. Only 19 per cent of the revenue is subject to the market price of coal and is cyclical in nature. If we were to model historically the lowest E-auction price of Rs 1,536/t (in FY17), the stock would still be trading at 4.3x EV/EBITDA, P/E of 9.2x and dividend yield of nearly 8 per cent, which means valuations would still range between 35-40 per cent discount to historical averages."
6,2019-03-04,Coal India,"The recent fall in international steel prices— around 20% during the past six months, has put all domestic steel manufacturers, including Steel Authority of India (SAIL), under pressure. This explains the 14% drop in the revenue of this Maharatna company in the third quarter of 2018-19. However, SAIL reported strong Ebitda and net profit growth during the quarter because of improvement in operating efficiencies and leverage, and lower forex hedging losses. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Growth in Ebitda per tonne for SAIL was also better than peers due to volume ramp up and the low base effect.

Availability of quality coal is one bottleneck for SAIL now. Though SAIL has a small captive clean coking coal facility now with a production capacity of 0.7 metric tonne per annum (mtpa), it is not enough and, therefore, SAIL primarily sources coal from Coal India. However, as Coal India has also not been able meet its demand, SAIL has had to depend on imported coal—around 85%-90% of its coal needs are met through imports. Due to such high imports, volatility in SAIL’s production cost is quite high. To mitigate it, SAIL plans to develop Tasra captive coal mine to produce 4 mtpa of coal. The company has also approached the Ministry of Coal for allocation of new coking coal blocks in line with the recommendations of Niti Aayog.

After a deep cut, the domestic and global steel prices have started stabilising offering some relief to steel producers. Though quite slow, revival in the domestic steel demand is another positive factor for companies like SAIL. The growth in domestic steel demand is expected to be about 7.5% during calendar years 2019 and 2020. SAIL is expected to report around 8% sales volume growth till 2019-20, given the smooth execution of its expansion plans. 

For instance, SAIL added two additional blast furnaces during the past year. Its new steel melt shop at Bhilai is also expected to be fully operational soon. The better operating leverage due to this increased volume growth will help SAIL report better margins too. Low valuation is another factor that has made analysts bullish on this counter. For instance, the market-cap of SAIL, the largest domestic steel maker, is below Rs 20,000 crore now. As is visible from the valuation table, its price-to-book value is now placed at just 0.54.

9,2019-03-05,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Weak global sentiment extended to the Indian equity market as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty opened in the negative territory on Tuesday in the absence of any major domestic trigger.

Renewed concerns over slowing global growth as China cut its economic growth target and signs of a slowdown in the US economy weighed on investor sentiment even as the ongoing US-Cina trade talks are yet to bear any fruit.

Asian shares stepped back on Tuesday, weighed by US growth concerns and as China cut its economic expansion target amid growing challenges from rising debt and a dispute over trade and technology with the United States, Reuters reported.

However, a fall in crude oil prices and rupee's tepid gain against the US dollar capped the losses for the market.

The rupee was trading 6 paise higher at 70.85 against the US dollar due to some selling in American currency by banks and exporters.

Sensex fell over 130 points in early deals but pared most losses and traded 42 points, or 0.12 per cent, down at 36,021.60 around 9:30 am. The Nifty index was 11 points, or 0.10 per cent, down at 10,852 at that time.

Meanwhile, midcaps and smallcaps outpaced Sensex, rising 1 per cent each.

Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Coal India and Hero MotoCorp were leading among the Sensex gainers. On the flip side, Larsen & Toubro, Bharti Airtel, Mahindra & Mahindra, HDFC and Bajaj Finance were among the top losers. Among the 31 stocks (including Tata Motors DVR) in the Nifty kitty, 15 were in the green and 16 were in the red. 

BSE Metal index jumped over 1 per cent, leading the pack of sectoral gainers. All components of the index were trading with gains. Nalco, SAIL, Jindal Steel, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and NMDC climbed between 1 per cent to 4 per cent.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 198.38 crore worth of domestic stocks on Friday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 117.05 crore, data suggested. 

Meanwhile, MSCI India’s weight in the MSCI Emerging Market index is likely to fall 20 basis points by end of November this year to 8.2 per cent, assuming a 50 per cent inclusion factor for China A- Shares, said Goldman Sachs. 

“This could lead to potential outflows of $3.8 billion (active + passive) from MSCI EM tracking funds,” said Goldman Sachs in a note, retaining 'market weight' stance on Indian equities."

Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) ranks high among the options available as it has the shortest lock-in period of three years. Among ELSS schemes, investors can consider Mirae Tax Saver, a relatively new entrant in the space, which follows a multicap strategy and has built up a diversified portfolio. The scheme’s fund manager Neelesh Surana has invested a little over 75% in large-sized companies, close to 20% in mid-sized companies and the remaining in small-sized companies.

11,2019-03-05,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Thanks to a rally in bank and auto stocks, benchmark stock indices rose over a per cent on Tuesday, shrugging off weakness in global peers.

The broader market rallied too with BSE Midcap index soaring 2.01 per cent and BSE Smallcap index jumping 3.11 per cent.

Investors on Dalal Street ignored US President Donald Trump’s plans to drop preferential trade treatment for India and focussed on the rising possibility of a second term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the upcoming elections.

A sharp appreciation in the rupee against the dollar and a fall in crude oil prices boosted bullish sentiment.

BSE barometer Sensex ended at 36,443, higher by 379 points or 1.05 per cent while its NSE counterpart Nifty ended at 10,987, up 124 points or 1.14 per cent. The domestic indices opened in the red earlier in the day. 


Market at a glance:Among Sensex stock, Tata Motors was leading the gainer brigade with a rise of 7.58 per cent. The stock surged almost 10 per cent in intraday, logging biggest intraday gains since May 2016, on better-than-expected February retail volumes reported by arm JLR in the US market. Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, ONGC, Coal India and Tata Steel were among other gainers.

All indices, barring IT and Teck ended in the green. Auto index gained the most, jumping over 3 per cent. 


Factors:

Modi's re-election prospects
Top Dalal Street names are now confident of Modi's return as Prime Minister in the upcoming elections following border conflict with Pakistan. 

Emerging market guru Mark Mobius in an interview with The Economic Times said the skirmish between India and Pakistan seems to have strengthened the popularity of PM Modi. The BJP will return to power for a second term this May, when general elections will be conducted in India, said Mobius. 



Services and manufacturing picking up
Market sentiment also got a boost after India’s services, as well as manufacturing activities, gained momentum in February, driven by a quicker expansion in new work orders that supported a faster increase in output and job creation.

The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index rose from 52.2 in January to 52.5 in February, indicating an upturn in output. Earlier on March 1, the data also showed that the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) advanced to 54.3 in February, from 53.9 in January. The spurt in PMI indicates strong inflow of new orders and strengthening of manufacturing sector growth, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said Friday.



Rupee appreciated against dollar
The domestic currency on Tuesday bolstered against the US dollar by as much as 28 paise on weakening global crude oil prices. This seems to have boosted investor sentiment as a strong rupee may mean more FPI inflows.



Crude oil prices dip
Oil prices fell on Tuesday as China cut its 2019 economic growth target, dimming the outlook for fuel demand, although Opec-led efforts to cut output still offered some support, Reuters reported. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $56.31 per barrel, down 28 cents, or 0.5 per cent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures were at $65.37 per barrel, down 30 cents, or 0.5 per cent.



Strong FII inflows 
FIIs poured money into Indian stocks over the past five sessions. The foreign institutional investors plowed in a sum total of Rs 16,045.02 crore.


Expert View

While today’s gains may extend in the coming sessions, we prefer to remain cautious on equities at higher levels. Domestically, the extent of geopolitical risk between India and Pakistan will be closely monitored. Any re-escalation in the coming days could be negative for the stocks. Globally, the developments on US-China trade front, progress on Brexit and movement of crude oil prices and currency would be actively tracked by the investors. Investors should continue to accumulate fundamentally sound companies with strong growth prospects. Considering high volatility, traders should avoid taking any risky leveraged positions

The buoyancy in market sentiment is clearly evident from the last few sessions, where mid and smallcaps have come to the fore and started to outperform. The market breadth has also improved on the back of the market participants sensing the possibility of the incumbent government retaining power, which naturally provides policy stability. Only a few stocks, countable on fingertips rallied in the last few months, which kept the benchmark indices afloat, this polarisation had to end somewhere. The premium valuations of mid and smallcaps against largecaps, post correction have normalised and hence value buying seem to be emerging- Devang Mehta, Head – Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management"
15,2019-03-06,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Sustained buying across sectors helped equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty extend their winning streak into the third consecutive session on Wednesday.

Weakness in crude oil prices may be the immediate trigger for the rally in stocks while improved prospects for Prime Minister Modi in the forthcoming general elections have also lifted sentiments.

Analysts say geopolitical events and the political discourse in the run-up to general elections would be key issues steering the market over the next few weeks.

Analysts says the market is full of stock-specific opportunities. Based on various brokerage recommendations, here is a list of 12 stocks that can potentially deliver solid gains over the next 2-3 weeks. 


Aditya Agarwala, Senior Manager- technical analysis, YES Securities

JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals | Buy | Target price: Rs 350-370 | Stop loss: Rs 324
On the weekly chart, JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals has turned upwards after taking support at the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level. Moreover, it is on the verge of a breakout from a triangle pattern neckline placed at Rs 340.

Momentum indicator RSI has turned upwards from the 50-level after forming a positive reversal affirming bullishness.


IPCA Laboratories | Buy | Target price: Rs 900-925 | Stop loss: Rs 800
On the weekly chart, IPCA Laboratories has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, resuming the upward journey. A sustained trade above Rs 856 with healthy volumes would take the stock higher to the levels of Rs 900-925. On the daily chart, it has broken out of a sideways consolidation with high volumes, affirming the bullishness. Moreover, RSI has turned higher from the 50-level, indicating that bulls are in control in the stock.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher 

Wockhardt | Buy | Target price: Rs 490 | Stop loss: Rs 385
This stock has witnessed a decent correction and indicated signs of bottoming out around Rs 387 level. It has currently produced a bullish candle pattern on the daily chart to signify strength and potential to rise further. The RSI has slowly and steadily improved and has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy.


L&T Finance Holdings | Buy | Target price: Rs 146 | Stop loss: Rs 118
The stock has given a decent correction from the peak of Rs 159 to bottom out near the Rs 120 level. It has made a positive candle to make the chart attractive and signify potential for further upward movement in the coming days. The RSI also has indicated a trend reversal to signal a buy. ""With favourable indicators supporting and decent volume activity witnessed, we recommend a buy in this stock for an upside target of Rs 146, keeping a stop loss of Rs 118,"" said Parekh.


Jay Thakkar, CMT, Head Technical and Derivatives Research, AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

JSW Energy | Buy | Target price: Rs 71 | Stop loss: Rs 63
This stock has formed a symmetrical triangular pattern and the Wave E of the same seems to have got over. Now, the stock is likely to inch towards the upper end of the range and may, thereafter, provide a breakout.


Suven Life Sciences | Buy | Target price: Rs 287 | Stop loss: Rs 228
This stock has witnessed a breakout from the inverse head and shoulders pattern which is a bullish reversal pattern. The momentum indicator MACD has also provided a buy crossover on the daily as well as weekly charts.


Kkunal Parar, Senior Technical Research Analyst, Choice Broking

Coal India | Buy | Target price: Rs 247 | Stop loss: Rs 226
On the Daily chart, the stock has formed a ‘hammer candlestick’ and is trading above Rs 227.85, which is 50-days simple moving average. This indicates a reversal sign and the stock may see a northward movement. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed a big bullish candlestick and the volume activity is also very appealing during the trading session which indicates an accentuated buying activity.


Reliance Capital | Buy | Target price: Rs 199 | Stop loss: Rs 173
On the weekly scale, the stock has formed a bullish Harami pattern which is a reversal formation and suggests that the trend may reverse in the counter. On daily scale, the stock has given a breakout of its falling trend line, suggesting a bullish move in the counter. Daily momentum indicator RSI reading is at 58.13 level and has given a breakout of previous resistance with a positive crossover which indicates a positive breath in the stock.


Rajesh Bhosale, CMT, technical analyst, Angel Broking

IndusInd Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,600 | Stop loss: Rs 1,465
This stock seems to be back in momentum by crossing above the higher range of last few weeks’ consolidation. On the daily chart, prices have closed above the higher range of Bollinger band, indicating a strong trended move in the near-term, post its recent long consolidation. The above-said breakout is supported with above-average volume. Moreover, momentum oscillator RSI has given fresh buy signal with its smoothened moving and looking at all the above factors, a strong upside from the current level cannot be ruled out.


ICICI Lombard General Insurance | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,050 | Stop loss: Rs 892

The stock has broken above its resistance zone of multiple highs at Rs 930. The said zone acted as a strong supply zone three times in the last five months and breaking above the same now indicates a change of polarity. ""Technically, averages and oscillators are well placed in positive zone and with prices entering into unchartered territory, we sense a good momentum move in the counter in the near-term,"" Bhosale said. 


Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – technical research & trading advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Tata Elxsi | Buy | Target price: Rs 980 | Stop loss: Rs 895
The price behaviour of last couple of weeks is suggesting that this counter has stabilised after a deep cut from the highs of Rs 1,500–830 levels. After bottoming out around Rs 830, a higher bottom appears to be in place around Rs 875 after retracing 50 per cent of its last leg of rally from the lows of Rs 830-915 levels. Moreover, with Friday’s price action, it also appears to have registered a breakout above its inverted head & shoulders formation, confirming a reversal of trend. Hence, it can eventually head towards Rs 980, which is a bare minimum Fibonacci retracement of 23 per cent of the fall from the highs of Rs 1,470. 


Hero MotoCorp | Buy | Target price: Rs 2,890 | Stop loss: Rs 2,590
The price action of last couple of weeks in this counter is pointing towards strong buying interest emerging around Rs 2,650. Besides, there seems to be a double bottom formation around Rs 2,600. Last Friday’s price action resulted in a bullish Harami formation which is usually a reversal sign.

12,2019-03-06,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Dues of state-run power distribution companies to cash strapped power generators have increased by a third in April-January despite the government’s assurance that payments would be expedited.

As per data compiled by the Association of Power Producers, state-run power distribution companies (discoms) owed Rs 41,133 crore to private sector generators as on January 31, and many of these generators are struggling to keep their loan repayment schedule on track.

While these companies must pay state-run Coal India and Indian Railways in advance, they don’t receive payments from customers—the power distribution companies—on time.

Adding to the gloom is the possibility that the upcoming general election will push up power demand without any promise of recoveries.

“The alarming and progressive increase in receivables in payments and regulatory dues is not sustainable. Many projects that do not have financial resilience could potentially default and turn into non-performing assets. We need a resolutions at the earliest,” Ashok Khurana, director-general of industry body Association of Power Producers, told ET.



Of the pending receivables, Rs 17,140 crore is on account of regular energy bills, Rs 6,865 crore is the amount unpaid on account of change in law, or post adjudication. This also includes Rs 17,128 crore of dues that are stuck in litigation, according to data compiled by the association.

The association met power ministry officials yet again last week seeking intervention for clearance of dues to avoid assets turning into nonperforming assets. The Reserve Bank of India has listed 34 financially stressed power units, with loans totalling Rs 1,80,000 crore, at risk of turning into NPAs.

In the public sector, power generators had Rs 21,889 crore in receivables due as on end-November.

This is mostly on account of regular energy bills. “Two months’ delay by discoms has almost become a norm, but if it goes beyond that then it starts hurting us more. There are states which have delays of 5-6 months and then even ask for discounts on payment,” a top executive with a power company said.

Tata Power’s chief executive officer Praveer Sinha had recently told ET that his company faces problems from two states where Rs 200-300 crore is delayed beyond six months."
13,2019-03-06,Coal India,"If exuberance is a little bit ahead of you, you might start to short even today or maybe tomorrow some of the auto names and two-wheelers, rather than buying into them at this point of time, said Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Financial Services, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts:


There were enough naysayers who said that do not buy the market, election is round the corner, go for a holiday and come back only after the elections. What happens now for those who have gone on holiday? Are they missing on something?
No, I do not think they are missing on anything. These hope rallies do come out of nowhere and this is a rally which nobody had predicted. It has come out of nowhere in terms of purchase but it is always a part of a market which kind of bottoms out. There are not enough sellers left in the system. All the weak sellers on the weak hands have been out of the market. 

These hope rallies happen all the time. More surprisingly, it has come in the backdrop of the lowest GDP growth rate, farm income being negative and America saying that GSP preferences are gone and you still have a hope rally. It is not the first time that we have seen hope rally. It is not the last we are going to see it. All in all, we should enjoy it, giving an excellent opportunity to investors who are stuck for liquidity more than price in the small and the midcap sector to rebalance their portfolios. 

I am not saying let us not enjoy the rally but this is not something you want to buy into at this point of time. If exuberance is a little bit ahead of you, you might start to short even today or maybe tomorrow some of the auto names and two-wheelers, etc, rather than buying into them at this point of time.


You are sounding slightly bearish to me. When you say go short, that means you are not sceptic, you are bearish.
Of course! The auto story has got two components – the economy and the competition. It is an absolutely humongous competition. There is the discounting. So, it is not about volume, it is not about sentiment. It is about what is going to be the profitability of these companies as the discounts come in and eat up the bottom line. You can hope for best and there is a lot of hope for some of the smaller stocks which could have been beaten down. 

Some of the very good dividend paying stocks like you saw recovery in NALCO, etc, where it went down to Rs 42 or Rs 44 and the dividend declaration was Rs 4.5. You really were talking out dividend yields of 7% to 8% and did the same Rs 4.5 last year in February. Commodity stocks, of course, get re-rated because dividend outflows are going to be huge at this point of time. 

Some have been running in a band. Yes Bank which has recovered. Axis Bank is now on the path of consolidation. When you look at the story from a larger stand point and say this gives me an opportunity to rebalance my portfolio, this does not give me an opportunity to start splurging in terms of fresh investments. I would still say time for fresh investment is far away. We do not need to over commit in this market rally. We should use it to our advantage. It happens both ways. Exuberance happens and pessimism happens. Maybe we will be reaching exuberance very soon compared to the fundamentals of the companies and the profitability more than just the demand. 


How would you deploy this opportunity of a recovery in the market and across market caps? How would you rebalance the portfolio? What would be on which side of the scale?
Scale is very simple. It keeps taking your portfolio up in terms of size of the companies you are invested in. There is economic logic to say that if the economy is slowing to 6-6.5% or thereabouts or maybe 6.2% in this quarter and remains at about 6.5% next quarter after that, the burden of that will fall on the lowest part of the segment of the economy which are the smallest companies. 

It is a given that as the market gives you opportunity, you take your portfolio up to bigger set of companies. There has been a re-rating of sugar-related companies which has seen a substantial re-rating, thanks to government incentives, But let us see how long it runs because the rally has been fast and furious and you come back. You tend to exit some of the commodity stocks at this point of time. In sugar, you should definitely take profits off the table at this point of time. 

We do not know how the new allocation will pan out in the market and post the election fever, what kind of subsidies will again come back to the sugar industry. Right now, they are the darlings of the market because of the vote bank that they have along with them but what happens once the elections are well on the way? Will they actually get the disbursement? So, you should definitely get out of commodity. You definitely get out of the very small companies. You definitely get out small auto ancillaries. You do not want to be there. You definitely get out of small infrastructure stocks. You do not want to be there again. 

It is about making a portfolio more shock-proof and less volatile in terms of performance, in terms of stock market and in terms of liquidity. Go to more liquid stocks. Use this chance of liquidity to exit illiquid stocks. Long back, you could not sell 5,000 shares of most companies in a day. Today if you can, use it to your advantage. There is liquidity, use it. 


What is the outlook when it comes to the broader end of the market? The small cap index is mirroring 2008-2009. The small cap index declined 72% between January 2008 and February 2009. Do you believe risk aversion to a certain extent is fading and that we will see this sort of continuation in mid and smallcaps?
Of course not. That is why I said do not get fooled by hope rally because the issues of the smallcaps are very different. There are issues of corporate governance. You are seeing larger companies scrambling for corporate governance, i.e. Sun Pharma, Zee. Can you imagine what is happening below the line into the smaller companies where you hardly have any kind of supervision of analysts and all kind of stuff? 

It is not just about fundamentals. It is also about corporate governance. It is about promoter linkages. I am not painting all with the same brush and saying they are all bad but then it is very hard to pick and choose. Who knows which one will fall by the wayside next time? Where the intercompany loans are? What is the promoter doing? 

In a background, where you do not need to take those chances, this market is brilliant because it gives you a chance to make money at the top end with less risk, more certainty and less volatility. If you are trading that off to do something very risky in an unknown environment, the returns should be commensurate to that. 

Also, that segment cannot be a big part of your portfolio. Maybe you want to play around with 10% of your portfolio but you still need to judge yourself as to what you do with 80% of your money and not with the last 20% which you can speculate with. I would still say 20% will not drive your portfolio but will drive your anxieties.


Anything that you would buy afresh?
I am always a buyer of private banks. I always buy consumer stocks also because they are the greatest things this country has for a long time to come. These two segments are a very boring kind of a market but you really want to keep buying into this segment. We have started buying commercial vehicles. Commodities are still on the radar, We are still buying commodities because we believe most commodity companies are dirt cheap. You do not get value as we discussed just now 8%, 9% yields on dividend alone year on year now. 

We are already 65-70% invested in the market. I doubt I will put 30% more in this market. But I will not buy very smallcap companies.. I will certainly look at some of the rerated companies like DCM Shriram. The chemical companies are producing astounding results, paper companies are producing decent results. They are not the darlings of the market but one can get a 20% yield top-up over a year on the portfolios. Nothing much has changed in terms of markets.


What are your top three holding minus HDFC Bank?
Number one after HDFC Bank is Yes Bank, then Axis Bank and thirdly ICICI Bank. It is very small and I would not even count it.


How much of your portfolio currently is in small and midcap stocks?
A very small part of the portfolio is in defence-related stocks that we bought into very early and paying the price for it to be honest. Like rest of the country, we were not smart enough to understand that defence contracts will not flow through so easily. So, we bought into a slew of defence-related smallcap companies which has not been a very wide decision.


You mentioned that you like companies which have a strong dividend yield. That guess logic is applicable for a Coal India, Nalco, HPCL, NTPC. Dividend yield in Coal India is 9-10%, NTPC is 5-6%, HPCL, BPCL is 4-5%. Is that a bait enough? Is that a strong enough reason why one should buy into some of these stocks?
The answer is yes and not only because they are high dividend paying but because they carry no debt on the balance sheet. They have no debt price to book ratio or are closer to 1-1.5 which is like ridiculous absolutely. There is a peculiar situation in the market why these companies are valued at what they are but it is good enough. To me 8%, 7% dividend yield and on top of that a company which has a book value of less than 1 leads to natural resource, a kind of a monopoly because you cannot get another aluminium company apart from Hindalco and Nalco to come into this country. May be Vedanta may come around a little bit. Vedanta is a monopoly situation where price to book is one or closer to one, no debt on the balance sheet and a government which will ensure the fact that large part of the cash earnings is used for dividends and not frittered away. 

I am so glad that these companies are giving dividend and not behaving like ITC which for the last seven years have frittered away humongous amount of cash flows into paperboard, hotels and consumer companies which have given no returns to anybody.

I love this company which give me back the money. I can redeploy it and you keep making your money, keeping digging the ground for producing alumina and giving me the cash.

The way the company’s balance sheet is positioned and the possibilities of future cash flow distribution to shareholders makes it a wonderful place to be, instead of putting money in fixed deposits, If you bought Nalco at Rs 60, after it went to Rs 45, yes you are facing a capital gain issue but then you added these stocks because you saw a dividend of Rs 4.50 last February. That will not be changing this February because of the government’s fiscal position. So when we were in a position at 45,we knew that 4.5 is coming our way. So, your net cost of acquisition is now Rs 40 on a company like Nalco, at 0.8 times book value. I don’t know, whatever arithmetic one uses, it is a wise investment.


 I admiring the courage. I am also accepting that you got to be safe and conservative. That is my limited point.
 I keep saying that if you want excitement, go to the casino! This is not a place to go to for your hard-earned money! Let us put it to work to the best of our ability. There will be good years and bad years. Let us be honest about it. But as investors and people on the TV we have to make honest effort to tell our people that there is a concept called risk weighted return that you must look at. Sure some stocks may have done 40%, but the kind of risk you may have taken to do it could be a wipe-out risk at this point of time. You need to understand where your risk mentality is and deal with it. 

In a market like this, one of the things which happen is as price market goes up, you will find a lot more selling coming in. A lot of people are waiting for threshold levels to be reached before they liquidate the stocks. That puts a level to the midcap markets because lots more supply is going to hit as the prices come up. You will see more supply coming in midcaps in terms of investors getting out and mutual funds in the midcap category being redeemed."
19,2019-03-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Cabinet on Thursday gave the green light to power projects worth Rs 33,500 crore and breathed fresh life into stressed projects by facilitating coal supply to the fuel-starved plants.

The flurry of decisions in the run-up to the general elections include a new mechanism to speed up strategic disinvestment, giving a boost to the hydro power sector, supporting electric vehicles, a Rs 30,849-crore facelift to the Mumbai urban transport network over five years, a new Metro line for Delhi, steps to support sugarcane farmers, setting up Kendriya Vidyalayas and initiatives to improve regional air connectivity infrastructure.

The government has lifted restrictions on coal allotment to merchant power plants that supply electricity to shortterm markets, including power exchanges, after almost a decade. This is expected to help them clear their debts. Restrictions on coal supply were lifted last year for plants with medium-term power purchase agreements. Plants feeding shortterm competitive markets procure fuel from e-auctions or global markets.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has decided to treat all hydro plants as renewable, giving them access to cheaper overseas funds. The decisions include imposing hydro power obligations




on states to cover future projects. It also approved raising debt repayment period to 18 years from 12 years and budgetary support for funding connecting roads and flood moderation component.

Power minister RK Singh said that the Cabinet’s decisions would address coalrelated issues of stressed assets and make hydropower more affordable.

The panel approved various recommendations on coal supply made by a group of ministers on stressed power plants. The decisions include allowing power plants to use coal contracts in case of termination of power purchase agreements due to payment default by discoms and procurement of bulk power by a nodal agency against pre-declared Coal India contracts. Increasing quantity of coal for special forward e-auction for the power sector and holding coal supply auctions at regular intervals were also allowed.


DISINVESTMENT PUSH
The CCEA delegated more responsibilities to the alternative mechanism in all the cases of strategic disinvestment of central public sector entities (CPSEs) with in-principle approval to stake sale. “This will facilitate quick decision-making and obviate the need for multiple instances of approval by CCEA for the same CPSE,” the government said. The alternative mechanism includes finance minister and minister for road transport and highways as permanent members. The minister for the relevant ministry of the CPSE being divested joins the mechanism as a temporary member for decision on that unit.

The CCEA has allowed the alternative mechanism to decide on the quantum of shares to be transacted, mode of sale and final pricing of the transaction.

The Cabinet also cleared three separate measures to boost new-age mobility solutions such as setting up of a National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage to drive clean, connected, shared, sustainable and holistic mobility initiatives.

It will have an inter-ministerial steering committee chaired by the NITI Aayog chief. The mission will also finalise a five-year phased manufacturing programme (PMP) till 2024 to support setting up of a few large-scale, export-competitive integrated batteries and cell-manufacturing giga-plants in India. The PMP will aim to localise production across the entire electric vehicles value chain.

For regional air connectivity, CCEA has given more time for and extended the scope for revival and development of unserved and underserved airstrips of states, Airports Authority of India (AAI), civil enclaves, central public sector undertakings (CPSUs), helipads and water aerodromes. A budgetary support of Rs 4,500 crore has been earmarked for this.

The CCEA on Thursday approved Phase-IIIA of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project that will improve the city’s suburban rails by introducing air-conditioned coaches with automatic doors, extension and creation of rail corridors, modern control systems and decongestion of entry/exit points at stations. The network is severely congested as it carries traffic four times its capacity.

The new projects include two 1320-MW thermal power plants at Buxar in Bihar by SJVN Ltd and in Khurja, Uttar Pradesh, by THDC Ltd. Announcements for both the projects were made in 2015 and THDC was allotted the Amelia coal mine in Madhya Pradesh in January 2017. UP discoms will purchase 60% power from the Khurja project, while Bihar discoms will offtake 85% from the Buxar plant.


TEESTA PROJECT CLEARED
Approval for acquisition of Lanco Teesta Hydro Power Ltd (LTHPL) and execution of balance work of the Teesta Stage-Vl project in Sikkim by NHPC at a cost of Rs 5,748 crore was also cleared.

Investment sanction of Rs 4,287 crore for construction of the 624-MW Kiru Hydro Electric Project in Jammu & Kashmir by NHPC and the state power development utility was also approved."

20,2019-03-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Stocks changed their mind many a time today, but in the end both benchmarks Sensex and Nifty rose for Day 4 as they took comfort from a rising rupee.

What factors are at work?

Rupee shines, again!
Extending its winning streak to the third consecutive day, the domestic currency rallied against the US dollar amid firm foreign inflows. The rupee rose 32 paise against the greenback to gain past the 70-mark. 

Buying in index heavyweights
Select buying in index heavyweights boosted the domestic indices higher. L&T, HDFC Bank, ITC, Axis Bank and RIL were among the top contributors.

Rural push ahead of elections
The Cabinet on Thursday made various decisions, including measures to promote the hydro-power sector and provide additional funds for sugar mills. The development led to gains in FMCG stocks as it was viewed as a sign for bolstering rural demand. 



Expert-take

Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities

Post a three-day rally, Dalal Street witnessed some consolidation, which kept Nifty50 rangebound. Broader market indices showed signs of weakness as they traded mildly in the red, but overall market depth tilted in favour of the bulls.

Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking
With no major event on the local front, we believe global cues will continue to dictate market trend. Though the recent rise in benchmark combined with recovery in broader markets has eased some pressure, we're not completely out of the woods yet. Banking looks strongest among the sectoral indices while indications are mixed from others. We suggest keeping focus on stock selection and maintaining balanced portfolio."

28,2019-03-11,Coal India,"Relative valuations have come down a little bit from the highs we saw a few months back, said Jonathan Schiessl, Fund Manager, IIFL. FIIs are definitely beginning to have a look again, he told ETNow.Edited excerpts:


After stark underperformance year to date, finally in the last one week, India has begun its outperformance and if I just look at the rest of the globe, we have managed to starkly outperform. Do you think it is valuation comfort or this is more of a pre-election rally which is playing out, given that the official date for elections got announced and it is next month?

Absolutely. Yes, it is interesting to see India starting to outperform, as you know, last week was a pretty miserable week around the rest of the world. India seems to be quite defensive from that perspective, January was obviously a difficult month for India vis-à-vis other global markets. 

The global markets came into a bit of profit taking, India obviously outperformed. You are right, people perhaps are getting slightly more constructive that they are worrying perhaps a little bit less about what might happen or might not happen in the election. 

People are looking at India. Relative valuations have obviously come down a little bit from the highs we saw a few months back. FIIs are definitely beginning to have a look again.


Are there particular themes that they are bullish on at a time like this, you know financials for example seems to be a space that is trending today. What kind of strategy do you feel FIIs are looking at the market with currently?

Financials remains probably one of the best ways to play India certainly. When you are looking at India from outside, it is a huge sector. There are also a lot of different segments to that sector. There is a lot of different ways you can play it. 

Obviously, on the structural side, there is so much growth potential over the next few decades in those sectors. FIIs definitely are interested in that space. The industrials is another interesting one as well, perhaps not the smallcap so much. 

Certainly, some of the data in some of the industrial activities seems to be pointing towards some capex beginning to pick up. That sector looks quite interesting although you have to obviously counter that with the problems going on in real estate, which perhaps will keep the data fairly subdued for a while longer.


Why not smallcaps because each and every brokerage domestic one is now actually rooting for mid and smallcaps because there is the valuation comfort, they have had stark underperformance for almost an year now and within pockets one is finding that value plus valuation comfort and the great bottom up stories nonetheless?

I totally agree. We are certainly looking at and have been increasing some of those mid and small cap exposure. They are certainly looking at price action over the last week, two weeks it has been very interesting to see pretty much across the board. You have seen quite strong gains in a lot of the smaller segments of the market. 

I am not sure that is particularly driven by FII buying, most FII buying tends to play in the larger cap space historically and yes, you do have some FII managers who do play in the mid and small cap space, but they it is not that common. 


Which sectors within small and midcaps do you find...

We have got a couple of pharmaceutical names in the portfolio, I am doing quite a bit of work on financial names at the moment, those are the sort of areas which are very interesting. But across the board, even in some of the consumer names, we have seen some derating stories. 

I guess the issue is liquidity and it is quite difficult to get back into these names without pushing the stock price up too much in the short term. You have to be very careful because obviously with the stock price falls that we have seen, a lot of liquidity has left the sector and those that have held on tend to want to hold on for longer term. It does not take much to push these stock prices up. 

There is still some caution and we have still got a few months to go before the election, we still are relatively uncertain global environment around us, there will probably be a bit of volatility from time to time where perhaps you will get entry points.


Let us talk about some of the other pockets as well, oil and gas seems to be one that is moving today and we have got RIL, ONGC as well as the oil marketing companies all seeing action. Are there any particular factors that you are tracking there or any particular stocks or would you be staying away from oil and gas at this point of time?

Yes, we do have some limited exposure to that space, we only have Coal India in the energy space, which is actually having a pretty strong day today. The reason we are in that stock in the short term is it is more of a defensive play, some of these PSU stocks yes, you can find plenty of potentially better managed companies elsewhere.

But they do have very quite good defensive characteristics for this phase of the market, strong balance sheet, high dividend yields, relatively under owned as well and they have all been underperforming for quite some time. So yes, we do own Coal India, we like the dividend yield in that. It is probably not a stock that will stand forever but certainly for this phase of the market we do quite like that. 



It is interesting that you briefly mentioned that there is interest in real estate. Most people that we have been speaking with say that instead of real estate what would be better perhaps is real estate ancillaries -- your paint companies, tiles etc. Your take.

Real estate is an interesting sector. There is obviously pain going on across certain segments of the markets, it is one that we have been looking after sometime and have not got any direct exposure on the space, but it is certainly an interesting one. But as you said the stock prices are relatively expensive. 

I am not sure we are in a stage where broad based real estate recovery has taken off. Obviously there is pain in this space but certainly some of those second derivative names are in interesting place.


What about the auto space? 

Yes, it has been a difficult space as you got the mixture of the domestic and the global factors at play in that space because clearly globally autos coming off a very very high base over the last year-year and a half and the issues with potential trade issues going on particularly with the US.

There is a massive transition going on in the auto sector anyway which we are seeing as we move away from petroleum base gradually towards more electric type cars. 

Just getting the balance right between getting an auto ancillary or a four wheeler play you know and try to work out how expose to both global and domestic sides. 


We have been tracking the index and cheering when we see momentum above 11,000 but going forward and I know we are entering a dicey time period over the next couple of months with elections around the corner, anything could really happen. But what is your overall sense in terms of direction for the index and the kind of upside you think is the reason to expect?

So what drives an index? There are many different factors that drive stock indices, fundamentals, liquidity, there are whole bunch of other issues. Obviously it is not just the macro. Obviously, the macro is important. However, I think if I look at from my recent trips in India, from my recent discussions with other FII investors, I think there is quite a bit of cash sitting on the sidelines that has been waiting there, a little bit more cautious, worried about the elections.

So definitely I get the feel that this recent rally has potential to suck some of that cash. Once we get the elections out of the way, India will be actually quite well positioned



What are you making of Indian aviation? 

It is a fascinating sector, I mean most investors would, a lot of investors would approach the aviation sector with some caution. I think historically it has been a sector which has just (37:52) chewed up capital and the discipline of companies has been certainly questionable. 

Some of the Indian companies particularly the market leader you can perhaps argue that is a different story, that it is new model with low cost travel which has certainly changed investors perceptions. It is a fantastic medium to longer term story that is there is only one way that aviation demand is going to go and that is significantly north. 

It is one of those sectors where you see very low penetration rate of aviation. So medium- to longer-term story looks very good."

I have 700 Sunil Hitech shares at Rs 13.65 and 1000 shares of Gammon Infra at Rs 6.75. Kindly advice.
— NIKHIL LODAYA
Having lost 90% of your investment, you may hold Sunil Hitech, but sell if there is any tactical rise in the stock price. Fundamentally, it is not worth holding as it is making losses and also postponed its December 2018 quarter results a couple of times which give rise to fear. In my view, it is very difficult to see Gammon India getting relisted as it has posted a net loss of over Rs 1,900 crore on a revenue base of around Rs 355 crore in FY2018 and sitting on a financial liability of close to Rs 6,000 crore. Take these investments as a good learning experience and in future, never compromise on the quality of balance sheet while investing in stocks.


I have 5,000 shares of Andhra Cement at Rs 14. Kindly suggest what to do. — B SANJEEV
Having lost 42% your investment, you may hold Andhra Cements for any possible tactical upswing of 15% to 20% to minimise your loss. Otherwise fundamentally, it is not worth holding considering its huge debt and net losses


I bought 70 shares of Coal India at Rs 240 per share. Should I buy moreRs I wish to buy 1,000 shares of Sanwaria Consumers.— CHANDRAJIT DOHUTIA
Hold Coal India for another one to two years with a target price of around Rs 300 as it is most likely to revise coal prices upward and thereby improve its profitability going forward. Personally, I don’t get confidence in Sanwaria Consumers considering past regulatory issues and poor dividend payout. Despite net profit rising more than 3-folds in FY18 from FY14, the company skipped dividend in FY18 and in the last 8 years, it paid dividend only for the year FY17.


Can I buy HEG and IDF CBank for long term. — H N JAJU
You should never buy highly cyclical chemical stocks for the long term. You should try to play on their cyclical downturn to enter them for the medium term (one to two years) returns. So, please wait for another 6 months or 1 year to accumulate HEG. In my view, its huge equity base and also peaking out of banking penetration in the urban centres may not help IDFC First Bank to make substantial wealth instead you may try with HDFC Bank or ICICI Bank.


I have Ashok Leyland at Rs 98.80, Motherson Sumi at Rs 165.70, National Aluminium at Rs 63.30, South Indian Bank at Rs 16.39. Please advise what to do. — SIB SANKAR
Considering slowdown in the commercial vehicle sales, you may sell Ashok Leyland if you get your cost price and then shift to M&M which can outperform Ashok Leyland due to the former’s diversification of business across different geographies. Hold Motherson Sumi, NALCO and South Indian Bank with respective target prices of Rs 185, Rs 75 and Rs 22.

29,2019-03-12,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Not much changed for Indian equity market overnight as the equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty witnessed a gap-up opening on Tuesday, a day after logging healthy gains due to across the board buying.

Indian equities, which is already going through the phase of a pre-election rally, got a boost from positive global sentiment after the European Commission agreed to changes in a Brexit deal.

Investors continued their buying spree ahead of key macroeconomic prints, including IIP (Index of Industrial Production) data for January and CPI (consumer price index) prints for February.

Healthy buying by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) is infusing confidence in the market, experts say. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 3,810.60 crore worth of domestic stocks on Monday, data available with NSE suggested.

Rupee's rise is another factor helping markets in maintaining the positive sentiment. The domestic unit extended its upward movement against the US dollar and rose to a two-month high today after the US dollar weakened as overall risk appetite improved amid stabilized equity market. 

Sensex jumped over 515 points and Nifty topped 11,310 intraday. 

Around 3 pm, the BSE Sensex was 505 points, or 1.37 per cent, up at 37,560, while the NSE Nifty50 was 145 points, or 1.29 per cent, up at 11,313.

Midcaps and smallcaps rose in sync with the benchmarks. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were up 0.98 per cent and 1.38 per cent, respectively, around that time. 

In the 31 share (including Tata Motors DVR) Sensex index, 23 stocks were in the green and eight were down. 

Bharti Airtel, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and Larsen & Toubro were among the top gainers in the Sensex index.

On the other hand, Bajaj Finance, Infosys, ONGC, NTPC and Coal India were among the top losers in the Sensex kitty of stocks."
30,2019-03-13,Coal India,"If one focuses on our place in the earnings recovery cycle, then we will come up with better conclusions about th 
  
  
  e market, said Taher Badshah, CIO-Equities, Invesco Mutual Fund, in an interview with ET Now. Edited excerpts:


Why was everyone caught with a bearish view when the markets surprised us in last 15-20 days? 
We have been holding a slightly different view for some time and we have been relatively constructive on the market. We have been advocating that these are conditions which are very similar to developments in 2014. There was anxiety, confusion. There was mid and smallcap correction and conditions were exactly the same. What has probably changed is probably that the market has not focussed as much on the earnings recovery cycle. That is something which we need to focus a lot more on rather than the ballot. 

And that is where the anomaly probably lay. Conditions for recovery in earnings continue to remain strong. We have not seen earnings intensity or magnitude of a nature that one would desire but incrementally things are looking up and the result season tends to indicate that the expected earning recovery is on the way. 

The market has overlooked that for a while and was caught up in geopolitical issues. Reality has now returned and that has led to the sharp move in the market in the recent past.


Where do we go from here? Should one not get carried away because the terrain is suddenly looking green?
I would like to think that we still have legs in the market. We are seeing a very sharp move in a very short period of time and that tends to be unnerving for many market participants but this is generally how the markets moves when it comes out of a groove after a very long period of time. 

But if one focuses on where we are in the earnings recovery cycle, then we will come up with better conclusions about the market and that is what you need to be focussed on. 

We are relatively more convinced about that unfolding over the next couple of years. Macro conditions are falling into place. We need to clear one or two events. Many of the other events are behind us. Liquidity situation in the market is looking reasonably okay. The market has borne a lot. Many of the negative developments in the last six months have been absorbed by this market. So to that extent, any of the positive news would get very quickly priced in. 


 What is your view on oil and gas pack?
We are incrementally constructive on oil marketing companies (OMCs), especially from a contra standpoint. Quite a lot of the negatives appeared to be priced in. It does not appear that oil is going to move beyond $60-75 price band for some time. OMCs are reasonably priced or are cheap enough now compared to a year back. The steady price increases that they have taken, is giving them enough cushion even if oil were to spike up by another $10 or $15 odd. So, there is merit in some of these OMCs. We have larger exposures in some of the other oil and gas companies including the heavyweights and also some of the gas pipeline and utility companies where we find value. 

We like different businesses for their own reasons. Aggregate it adds up to probably being an overweight situation on the sector but this is more a culmination of the bottom-ups.


hat is the future projection for L&T in terms of targets?
It is a little hard to comment on individual stocks but this is one of the stocks that we have in our portfolio. For us, it is a play on industrials and the infrastructure space and that is where we are positioned from that perspective. We are attracted to its balance sheet improvement over a period of time along with now conditions developing in industrial/infra space. Valuations are also reasonable, though not cheap.


You are bullish on corporate banks but I do not think any corporate will start committing to capital for next three, six, seven months. What is your view?
Yes, I would not expect many of these corporate banks to start lending to the infrastructure space in a big way. We do not really think they are configuring themselves for the next three to five years from that perspective but by and large, the credit cycle is improving and these corporate banks are getting a lot more consumer-oriented and working-capital-lending oriented. So, we might want to tag them as corporate banks but in next few years, they may not look like corporate banks have been traditionally. 

For us, they have been more value-related ideas which we have been holding for close to about two years now. We have seen the ups and downs but there is still value and some are still available at a cheap price. 

We are seeing the credit cycle improving, not as much from the project loans point of view. We are buying them for that reason not for the fact that they are going to be participants of a wider infrastructure/corporate investment cycle.


A lot of PSU names like Coal India or NTPC are starting to look fairly attractive now. Is this the right time to get into some of those counters? I would think so. From a value perspective, we have come across a couple of names which do provide that opportunity. Some of them are very cheap and some of these are cyclical in nature or are commodity businesses. But even if we budget for a weaker commodities cycle, when we look at them from the point of view of where they are on the cost curve, we find the market is probably pricing in the worst or not such a great scenario from a commodity price cycle standpoint.

Valuations are also turning not only comfortable but also cheap and to that extent, we have reflected some of these names in our portfolios as well. Clearly opportunities are emerging in this area but from a value perspective, not as much from a growth perspective.


What is you view on real estate sector?

We honestly have not really developed any great view around this sector. We also don’t own any names in this space at this stage. They still do not fit some of the requirements of our investment framework and we have found it difficult to come up with bottom-up ideas. 

This is a sector where you need to be a lot more stock-focussed. I do not expect a sector-wide rally, if at all, in this space. One has to be very choosy and we have not really yet come across any ideas in this area. I am not suggesting that this will not do well but it is something that does not appeal to us."

Among these, RBL Bank, GAIL and Mahanagar Gas logged gains, but rest suffered losses. Rising OI accompanied by rising price is indicative of a bullish trend, while rising OI and falling price indicates a bearish trend.


MSTC IPO fully subscribed on Day 3The initial public offering (IPO) of mini-ratna company MSTC got fully subscribed on the final day of the offer on Friday. The issue received bids for 1,90,49,220 shares by 4:40 pm, which was 1.08 times the total issue size of 1,76,70,400.

IIFL Holdings jumps 5%Shares of IIFL Holdings jumped 4.61 per cent to close at Rs 435.40 on NCLT nod to proposed demerger of the group. NCLT approved the proposed demerger of Fairfax-backed IIFL Group, paving the way for listing of three entities — IIFL Finance, IIFL Wealth and IIFL Securities -- within 60 days.


Allahabad Bank to raise capitalAllahabad Bank is looking for ways to raise capital next financial year. The bank has set a target of raising Rs 500 crore by selling non-core assets such as real estate properties and divesting its stakes in subsidiaries and joint ventures. Shares of the company closed 0.55 per cent down at Rs 54.70.


IDBI Bank stock extends fall to 4th dayShares of IDBI Bank closed 0.46 per cent down at Rs 42.90 after the Reserve Bank of India classified it as a private lender after LIC took control of it. Analysts said the move might lead to a rating downgrade and a rise in cost of funding, as investors would factor in the absence of sovereign backing for the bank. Meanwhile, rating agency ICRA has assigned a negative outlook to IDBI Bank and removed rating watch with developing implications.


RCom shares fall 6%Falling for eighth consecutive session, shares of Reliance Communications settled 5.97 per cent down at Rs 4.41. In last eight sessions, the stock came off 34 per cent. DoT is invoking bank guarantees (BG) to recover Reliance Communications’ latest spectrum dues and is set to issue a notice asking why the airwaves shouldn’t be withdrawn, adding to the woes of the telco whose chairman Anil Ambani faces jail for not paying a vendor, an ET report said.

44,2019-03-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Coal India fell over 2 per cent on Friday, a day after its board approved the payment of second interim dividend.

In a BSE filing, the company said its board of directors had approved the payment of second interim dividend for 2018-19 at Rs 5.85 per share with a face value of Rs 10.

From the time when some plants ran out of fuel, the only one with critical stocks now is GMR’s Warora plant, which has enough coal to run for four days.

A senior Coal India executive said the plant was running at more than 90% capacity, and that stocks were down because of logistical issues. “Two rakes are being sent every day and they are managing,” he said.

According to CEA data, there are a few coal plants with one-three days stock but they are not deemed critical as they are either close to a mine or have consumed most of their coal quota."
49,2019-03-16,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal stock position at power plants have improved considerably with number of plants holding critical stocks declining to one this week. It tipped to 33 during mid-October last year.

GMR’s Warora Thermal Power Station, the only plant with critical stock, however, is currently holding 4 days stock according to data compiled by Central Electricity Authority (CEA).

A senior Coal India executive said: “Coal sale to GMR’s Warora plant is not an issue, however, logistic issues have led to lower supplies although the plant is running at more than 90% capacity utilisation at present. Two rakes are being sent every day and they are managing.”

According to CEA data, there are a few coal plants with stocks ranging between one-day and three-days, they are not considered critical since they are close to mine mouth or have consumed majority of their coal quota for the period.


Agencies
Nevertheless, rising thermal power demand during summer last year led to rising coal consumption by power companies, more than their receipts, leading to dwindling stocks forcing some power generators to scale down generation and some had to shut units. As winter set in, demand for power declined leading to rising stocks which was also coupled with increased production from Coal India.

On a national level average stocks at power plants have almost trebled to 28.45 million tonnes this week from 10 million tonnes in October. At present stocks are enough to generate power for 17 days. It had dwindled to 10.17 million tonnes in October.

Stocks at 17 pithead power plants are now around 6.76 million tonnes enough for 15 days. This is double CEA’s stipulation which requires pithead plants to hold stocks for seven days.

For non-pithead plants, stocks are around 21.69 million tonnes enough for 18 days and close to CEA stipulation of 21 days stock.

Vendible stock at Coal India has also increased 65% between October and now to 34.76 million tonnes. It is enough to run power plants for another 20 days apart from the stocks at power plants."
50,2019-03-17,Coal India,"The fifth instalment of the Central Public Sector Enterprises Exchange Traded Funds (CPSE ETFs), through which the government intends to raise at least Rs 3,500 crore, will be launched on Tuesday for anchor investors. Subsequently, it will be open for all investors from Wednesday to Friday.

Financial planners believe long-term equity mutual fund investors and first-time retail investors should stay away from thematic funds despite low valuations and the discount on offer, as the fund is concentrated and susceptible to high volatility.

The CPSE ETF, which will be managed by Reliance Mutual Fund, has a concentrated portfolio spread across a few sectors such as energy, oil PSU, infrastructure & engineering and PSU financials. Top four holdings — ONGC, Indian Oil, Coal India and NTPC — account for 77.7 per cent of the portfolio.



In terms of valuations, the Nifty CPSE Index trades at a PE (priceto-earnings) ratio of 8.43 compared to the Nifty 50 PE of 26.32. It offers a dividend yield of 5.52 compared to Nifty 50’s 1.25 per cent.

“First-time investors would be better off with a well-diversified equity mutual fund than a thematically concentrated portfolio,” says Anup Bhaiya, MD and chief executive officer, Money Honey Financial Services.

In the past one year, the CPSE ETF has lost 7.62 per cent against the Nifty's gains of 10.3 per cent. In the past, investors have been disappointed with PSU stocks, which have been mostly underperformers.

“Mutual fund investors would do well to invest in actively managed equity mutual funds where chances of alpha creation are high as compared to passively thematic basket of government companies,” says Jignesh Shah, founder, Capital Advisors.

ETFs score on lower expense ratio and this one will have an expense ratio of less than 1 basis point, the lowest for the industry. In addition, all categories of investors will get an upfront discount of 4 per cent on underlying shares purchased from the government. No discount will be offered on the purchase of index constituents from the open market.

The latest CPSE ETF issue will be open for retail investors from March 20. All the previous four CPSE ETF issues have received a good response from investors, with the fund house refunding extra subscriptions.

The new fund offer of CPSE ETF was first launched in March 2014 in which the fund house mobilized Rs 4,363 crore. CPSE ETF's further fund offer (FFO) was launched in January 2017, where it collected Rs 13,705 crore, out of which the fund refunded Rs 7,705 crore due to the issue size limit of Rs 6,000 crore.

CPSE ETF further fund offer (FFO 2) in March 2017 collected Rs 10,083 crore, out of which Rs 7,583 crore was refunded to investors due to the issue size limit of Rs 2,500 crore. CPSE ETF further fund offer (FFO 3) was launched in November 2018 and collected Rs 31,203 crore, out of which Rs 14,203 crore was refunded to investors due to limited issue size of Rs 17,000 crore."
56,2019-03-18,Coal India,"Superior business performance almost always guarantees superior stock returns. But one stock has been defying this logic on Dalal Street all of this past decade.

Shares of Coal India have slipped 20 per cent this decade despite having an RoCE (return on capital employed) of between 25 per cent and 60 per cent since 2008, a high dividend payout record and robust capital efficiency ratio, read RoCE. 

As many as 28 other stocks on BSE with consistent RoCEs of over 25 per cent have rallied up to 2,100 per cent in these 10 years.

Specialty chemicals firm Vinati Organics topped the list with 2,074 per cent returns since December 2010. The company also delivered over 25 per cent RoCE in last 10 years. Other stocks with consistent RoCE included Symphony (1,504 per cent), Page Industries (up 1,483 per cent), Mayur Uniquoters (up 956 per cent), Titan (up 502 per cent), P&G Hygiene & Health Care (up 464 per cent), Abbott India (up 460 per cent), HUL (up 455 per cent) and Dhanuka Agritech (up 449 per cent).

RoCE is the measure of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for every rupee of capital (equity and debt) employed in the company. In other terms, it measures the capital efficiency of the company. Analysts often prefer this matric to value a business.

Some analysts say government policies coupled with environmental concerns and a slowdown in the economy affected Coal India in last few years.

Others say it was a high base effect of pricing. On the listing day, the stock fully priced in the fundamentals of the business. Over the years, production rampup leading to a drop in price realisations and increased focus on renewables dampened sentiment on the counter.

Meanwhile, regular stake sales by the government in PSU firms are keeping investors cagey. When Coal India got listed, the government held 90 per cent stake in the coal monopoly. Today, it holds around 73 per cent.

Analysts still look at the stock as an attractive investment bet with a 3-4 years outlook, citing expectations of a pickup in the economy.

“Investors want return either in the form of dividend or stock price appreciation. From an investment perspective, Coal India will become a very good investment bet on hopes of a rise in dividend yield. We may see a hike in dividend as PSUs are being forced to give higher dividends. Those who invest in the company at current price level may reap the fruits in 3-4 years due to a revival in the economy,” said Sanjeev Jain, Vice-President for Equity Research at Sunness Capital.

While the stock has not appreciated in value, its high dividend payout has resulted in 60 per cent or more return for investors since its listing. During FY12-18, the company gave a dividend of around Rs 140 per share.

“We have not been overweight on this PSU pack for a long time. Tactically though, things may improve for PSU stocks now. Coal India may be one among the few to bet on, going forward,” said Amar Ambani, President & Head of Research at YES Securities.

Jain says once the problems related to power and infrastructure companies get resolved, Coal India will emerge as a frontrunner to tap the opportunity as these businesses use coal in bulk.

The government held 72.91 per cent stake in the company as of December 31, 2019, while foreign portfolio investors, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions held 5.99 per cent, 5.38 per cent, 9.73 per cent and 2.49 per cent, respectively. 

Individual investors hold less than 2 per cent stake in the company, which does not help better price discovery. “Fair price is an issue for Coal India due to lower individual holdings, as institutional investors hold their stakes for the long term,” says Jain.

Independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga says cash-rich PSUs are like a milch cow for the government. Additionally, with the sword of disinvestment dangling, nobody is buying the stock despite it being a great dividend play, as investors do not see capital appreciation as long as the above factors are live.”


Others
“Investor should consider companies with higher RoCE. They give good returns to investors over time. However, RoCE alone is not important. There should be at least 10 per cent topline growth. Companies with high RoCE mostly comes at expensive valuation,” says AK Prabhakar, Head of Research, IDBI Capital Markets."

58,2019-03-19,Coal India,"Coal India’s standing with investors as a ‘dividend play’ could take a beating after the near-monopoly government miner declared interim dividends that fell below Street expectations.

Edelweiss said the company’s dividend payout for FY19 would be much lower compared to previous years as Coal India, whose output fires the country’s thermal power plants and cement kilns, has stepped up expenditure plans to undergird growth.

Last week, the public sector major announced an interim dividend of Rs 5.85 per share — its second for FY19. Investors in Coal India will expect a final dividend this month, but that may not be enough to match up to the company’s payouts in the previous years.

“Year-to-date FY19 payout of 54 per cent is far lower than that for the past three years, when the payout exceeded 160 per cent on every instance,” said Edelweiss in a client note.

The brokerage said if Coal India does not pay a final dividend, the payout for 2018-19 would be the lowest since 2012-13, which would dim the company’s attractiveness as a dividend play.



Coal India is expected to spend Rs 12,000- Rs 15,000 crore in annual capital expenditure over the next two years, said Edelweiss.

“…the payout is expected to remain within 70–85 per cent (lower than historical levels) assuming the company remains debt-free,” the brokerage said.

Coal India has been an underperformer on the bourses since it listed at Rs 287 late November 2010. After touching a high of Rs 447 in August 2015, the stock has fallen 45 per cent to Rs 244.20 on Monday."

There has been an ongoing pre-election rally on hopes that the incumbent government would come back to power after the general elections slated next month.

The rupee lost its morning gains and looked much weaker against the dollar.

The stock traction gained momentum in the second half of the day, with the BSE Sensex ending the day at 38,363, up 268 points, or 0.70 per cent. NSE barometer Nifty closed at 11,532, up 70 points, or 0.61 per cent. 

In the Sensex lot, only 7 declined while 23 advanced.


Market at a glance
ITC was the best performer, climbing 2.45 per cent, followed by NTPC, HCL Tech, Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel and Infosys. Hero MotoCorp, L&T, Maruti, Bajaj Auto and Coal India were among the worst hit, declining up to 2.10 per cent. 

RCom shares rallied as much as 10 per cent after the company completed paying Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson nearly Rs 580 crore, thus staving off a jail term for Chairman Anil Ambani.

Mid and smallcap indices covered themselves well, too. While the BSE Midcap index rose 0.52 per cent, the Smallcap one edged higher by 0.37 per cent. 

In the sectoral space, telecom hit the right note, rising 1.75 per cent. Energy, utilities, FMCG, oil & gas, power, technology were other indices that recorded solid gains, rising over a per cent each.

Auto and capital goods indices, on the other hand, were among sectors that came off, down 0.61 per cent. 


What are the market factors today?


Hopes of Fed dovish stance
Traders are factoring in a possibility of a dovish tone from the Fed on its likely path on borrowing costs. Market participants expect the central bank to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and stick to its pledge of a ""patient"" approach to monetary policy. Soft US manufacturing data on Friday helped cement that expectation, according to a Reuters report.

A dovish US Fed augurs well for emerging markets like India, which bolsters equities' appeal.


Global markets remain upbeat
World shares inched towards their longest winning streak of the year on Tuesday ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting. The pound kept calm after another dramatic twist in the Brexit plot bolstered bets on a lengthy delay to the process, Reuters said.

Europe's early 0.2-0.5 percent gains lifted MSCI's 47-country world index for the seventh straight day and to its highest since October.

Better liquidity conditions and positive movements in all major global markets have been supportive of the domestic markets. It may be noted that when the global markets were moving up almost a month ago, the domestic markets were sliding, and our markets are gradually catching up with other markets.” 

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services
As the market gained strength towards closing following a range-bound movement, the rally was broad-based characterised by the outperformance of large caps. The rupee witnessed selling pressure following a continuous surge while domestic bond yields inched higher as investors awaited the US Fed policy outcome due to be announced tomorrow. RBI’s interference through open market operation will support banks while any further rate cut from their upcoming monetary policy will stimulate the rally.

66,2019-03-20,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The fifth tranche of Central Public Sector Enterprises Exchange Traded Fund (CPSE ETF), managed by Reliance Mutual Fund, kicked off for non-anchor investors on Wednesday. 

Analysts said high dividend yield, low P/E ratio and discount are key attractions, but believe the issue is not suitable for first-time investors. 

The issue received an overwhelming response from 16 anchor investors, who bade for Rs 6,072 crore worth of ETFs, 5.78 times the base size.

The government intends to raise at least Rs 3,500 crore. A discount of 4 per cent will be offered to investors on the reference market price of the underlying Nifty CPSE Index shares. 


Here are key things you must know about the issue:

Sectoral & stock concentrationRisks associated with sectoral concentration are high. Oil and power sectors together accounted for 43 per cent of the weightage as of February end. Add two more sectors -- petroleum products and minerals & mining to the list -- the weightage goes up to 81 per cent. 

ONCG has the highest weightage at 20.43 per cent, followed by NTPC, Coal India and IOC, which account for 19.35 per cent, 18.90 per cent and 18.45 per cent weightages, respectively.

PerformanceThe NIFTY CPSE Index, which tracks the government’s disinvestment initiative in CPSEs through the ETF route, has dropped 6.97 per cent in the last one year, compared with a 14 per cent jump in Nifty50.

In last three years, CPSE ETF has delivered 9.73 per cent return compounded annually compared with 15.43 per cent delivered by Nifty50 TRI and 12.59 per cent on an average by large cap category. 


How CPSE ETF fared with Bharat 22 ETF?Bharat 22 ETF has 22 constituents against CPSE ETF’s 11. It is more diversified and captures the PSU universe better than the CPSE ETF, said HDFC Securities.

CPSE ETF has only state-run companies as its constituents, while Bharat 22 ETF has three private sector firms—L&T, ITC and Axis Bank, where the government holds stakes through SUUTI.

Recent value buying in PSU stocks has pushed returns by CPSE ETF to 17.96 per cent for the last one month compared with Bharat 22 ETF’s 12.28 per cent. That said, both the ETFs fared poorly in last six months.

ValuationsIn terms of valuations, the Nifty CPSE Index trades at a PE ratio of 8.43 compared to the Nifty 50 PE of 26.32. It offers a dividend yield of 5.52 compared to Nifty 50’s 1.25 per cent. Kotak Institutional Equities suggests PSUs are still trading at inexpensive multiples on market’s worries about unfavorable regulations, irrational government actions and incessant government divestment.


Should you subscribe?HDFC Securities said discount, dividend yield and low P/E are the main carrots in CPSE further fund offer. Investors could look to encash these benefits in the first 3-6 months of allotment provided the markets and PSU sector are conducive for profit taking.

A few experts suggest this issue is not for first-time investors.

“First-time investors would be better off with a well-diversified equity mutual fund than a thematically concentrated portfolio,” Anup Bhaiya, MD and chief executive officer, Money Honey Financial Services told ET.

60,2019-03-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India will fetch the Centre around Rs 19,000 crore on account of dividends paid and shares sold through various modes by the end of 2018-19 — almost double that of last year.

The dry fuel supplier, however, grew its reserves to Rs 28,000 crore from Rs 18,000 crore. “Handsome profits made in the last three quarters have helped increase the reserves despite handsome returns to the government,” a Coal India executive said.

In the nine months ending December 2018, Coal India recorded a 2.8-fold rise each in total comprehensive income and net sales to Rs 11,518 crore and Rs 66,192 crore, respectively.

According to the executive, the company will pay the government Rs 9,155 crore this year on account of two rounds of dividend and a buyback. Out of this, Rs 4,500 crore was paid after declaring the first round of dividend. Another Rs 3,605 crore will be paid for the second dividend declared this month and Rs 1,050 crore for buyback of shares which too was announced recently.

Coal India has fetched the government an additional Rs 9,315 crore through share sale under various modes. The Centre has already earned Rs 5,218 crore from the recently concluded offer-for-sale for the public, while an offer-for-sale for employees fetched it Rs 17.33 crore. It has also raised Rs 4,079.67 crore through an exchange traded fund (ETF) declared a few months ago. Another round of ETF, floated on Tuesday, is expected to draw at least Rs 665 crore, the executive said.

Few rounds of share sale, in the form of divestment or buyback, reduced the government’s stake in Coal India from 78.55% at the beginning of the current fiscal to 72.91% in December last year.

In 2017-18, the government received around Rs 10,000 crore on account of dividend payments only and there was no share sale or any buyback by Coal India."

61,2019-03-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Increased fuel supplies and reduced power demand during winter have reduced the number of thermal power plants with critical coal stocks to zero, a position that was last attained four years ago.

Average stocks at 126 power plants monitored by the Centre stood at 29 million tonnes, enough to run these plants for 17 days at a stretch. In contrast, in the middle of October last year, the number of plants with critical coal position was 33 and stocks at these power plants were down to 10 million tonnes then.

According to data compiled by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), at present there are 26 plants that have stacked up enough supplies to last one month or more.

Jayanta Roy, group headcorporate sector ratings at ICRA, said: “Average daily coal production from Coal India steadily increased post monsoon from 1.3 million tonnes a day in September 2018 to 1.9 million tonnes a day in February 2019. This led to an improvement in coal availability in thermal power plants, which is reflected in the number of plants having critical stocks reducing from 24 in early October 2018 to nil on March 17, 2019.”

Roy further said, “However, with peak summer months of April-June 2019 looming ahead, the central miner's ability to maintain the production momentum would be critical.”

According to CEA data, there are a few coal plants with stocks ranging between one day and three days, but they are not considered critical since they are close to mine mouth or have consumed majority of their coal quota for the period.

Stocks at 17 pithead power plants are now around 6.8 million tonnes, enough for 14 days. This is double the CEA’s stipulation that pithead plants hold stocks for seven days.

For non-pithead plants, stocks are around 22 million tonnes, enough for 18 days, close to the CEA’s stipulation of 21 days’ stock.

Vendible stock at Coal India has increased 65% to 34.76 million tonnes from that in October 2018. It is enough to run power plants for another 20 days, apart from the stocks at power plants."
63,2019-03-20,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: While BSE Sensex is barely 600 points (or 1.6 per cent) away from its all-time high of 38,989 hit last August, only five index stocks –ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Axis Bank and Infosys – are reflecting this bullishness.

Analysts said while one may expect the index to hit fresh highs going forward, a majority index stocks are unlikely to hit their record high levels.

Data showed half of index stocks need to rise at least 18 per cent from current levels to hit their respective record highs. As many as 10 index stocks need to rally anywhere between 50 per cent and 200 per cent to hit their previous peak levels.

“The performance of the Sensex pack has been a concentrated one. Some stocks have played catchup of late. But if we remain at these levels or somewhat higher levels, some stocks will perform. But don’t expect record high levels for majority of the index stocks,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities.

The combined market value of the five index stocks hitting all-time high levels (in 2019 so far) has climbed 6.19 per cent since August 2018, even as the rest 25 saw a 7 per cent erosion in their combined market value.

What does it mean? It means only a few stocks have driven up the indices in recent weeks. It was the case with the rally that the index saw from November till the start of February.


Risk-reward turning favourable
While some analysts say the risk-reward us turning favourable, others don’t feel the same way. Goldman Sachs has upgraded its view on Indian equities to ‘overweight’ from ‘market weight’ and set a one-year target for Nifty at 12,500 – a potential gain of over 8 per cent. The foreign brokerage is betting on cyclicals over defensives and exporters. These sectors have the highest weight in the Nifty pack.

Morgan Stanley said the Indian equity market could start pricing in a stronger election outcome in the coming weeks, which may help Nifty break its four-month range on the upside.

Kotak Institutional Equities doubts the rally.

“Indian market’s catch-up trade with other emerging markets after a period of under-performance in the first six weeks of CY2019 may be largely over, with weaker reward-risk balance for many largecap and midcap stocks after a 10-30 per cent rise in many stocks over the past 3-4 weeks,” the brokerage said in a note.

It said heavyweight stocks like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and HUL are trading above their fair values. It says Asian Paints and Bajaj Finance, which are near record high levels, are now at prices above their fair values.

Data suggests HDFC, Asian Paints, L&T, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HCL Technologies are among the stocks that are up to 10 per cent away from making fresh record highs. They hit their all-time high levels between February and September last year.


Can banks anchor rally?
AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital said Bank Nifty has hit an all-time high level ahead of the NSE barometer. “Fundamentally, the banking space looks exciting, especially the private ones which have been key beneficiaries of the NCLT resolutions. In case of IT, another heavyweight sector in the index, no downside is likely in the light of a rising rupee, but upside too is limited,” he said. 

Prabhakar says the ongoing rally has legs. “You don’t need all stocks to push the index to records levels,” said he.

A few new leaders may also emerge in the market.

“A few stocks from the corporate banking and industrial segments could emerge as new leaders, but others like those from auto and metals sectors continue to present a weak outlook and may remain a drag on the index,” said Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan. 


A lease of life for battered stocks
Since its February 19 low point, when Sensex hit sub-35,300 level, a few underperforming stocks have started rising again. NTPC has rallied 18 per cent to cut its losses since August 2018 to 5 per cent. The stock still needs to rally 84 per cent to reclaim its high point hit in January 2008.

YES Bank is up 15 per cent from February low, but is off 33 per cent from its August 2018 high. This stock needs to rally 65 per cent to reclaim Rs 404 level it had hit on August 20,2018.

Vedanta, Coal India, Sun Pharma and ONGC are among the stocks that have gained 10-15 per cent from their February lows, but still need to gain 80-180 per cent to reach previous high points.


Non-performing stocks
As many as 20 of the 30 index stocks have been trading in the red since August 2018 high, show data. Auto stocks Tata Motors, M&M, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp are down 31 per cent, 29 per cent, 24 per cent and 15 per cent from the point Sensex hit its high point last August. They are down 30-70 per cent from their respective record high levels. Prabhakar says the auto segment may not perform well for some time due to production cuts.

Metals & mining stocks Vedanta and Coal India are down 23 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. ITC and HUL have also failed to contribute to the recovery and are down 7 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. YES Bank has been the worst index performer. 

“Pharma, which performed pretty well between 2000 to 2017, is not participating in this rally. While IT, FMCG, private banks and NBFC have been doing well, metals and cements too have been laggards,” Prabhakar said."

81,2019-03-26,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The bulls showed who is in-charge with a spectacular comeback today, lifting the stock benchmarks by over 1 per cent. 

Buying picked up only during the final hours of the session. 

Today's show was driven by RIL and financial stocks, which were the major contributors.

The strength reflected optimism in most Asian markets as US 10-year Treasury yields edged up after two days of decline. 

A strengthening rupee amid firm FII buying helped cement sentiment further. 

The Sensex closed at 38,233, up 425 points, or 1.12 per cent, where only seven constituents ended in the red. The broader Nifty went up 129 points, or 1.14 per cent, to 11,483. 

Domestic indices in the previous session dropped because of recession fears in the world's biggest economy -- the US -- and global growth slowdown.



Market bulletin

Among Sensex stocks, SBI with gains of 3.23 per cent was the best performing stock. NTPC, Vedanta, RIL, ICICI Bank and Bajaj Finance too recorded strong gains. 

Infosys, on the other hand, declined the most at 1.23 per cent. Bajaj Auto, ITC, L&T, Coal India and TCS too joined the losers' brigade. 

Midcap and smallcap indices joined the party too. While the BSE Midcap climbed 1.09 per cent, the Smallcap index surged 0.66 per cent.

In the sectoral space, barring IT and technology, all indices ended in a pool of green, with bankex leading the charge. Energy, power and utilities saw value buying. 


The factors: A fact-check

Firm global cues: Most Asian shares ended the day in green, with Nikkei 225 rallying 451.28 points, or 2.15 per cent, to 21,428.39. Taiwan Weighted advanced 79.72 points, or 0.76 per cent, to 10,559.20, Jakarta Composite 57.19 points, or 0.89 per cent, to 6,468.44 and Straits Times 15.47 points, or 0.49 per cent, to 3,198.39. The Shanghai index slipped over 1 per cent. 

Asian shares looked good on Tuesday after two days of losses as US 10-year Treasury yields rose, but the outlook remained murky as investors weighed the odds of whether the US economy is in danger of slipping into recession, according to Reuters.


Liquidity position comfortable: Market sentiment also got some boost after the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday said liquidity situation of the economy is comfortable and it will be further increase by Rs 35,000 crore through the rupee-dollar swap window.


Strengthening rupee: The rupee appreciation pushed investors more towards equities. The local currency strengthened by 15 paise to 68.81 against the dollar intraday on fresh selling of the greenback by exporters.


Possibility of rate cut by US? Global market tanked sharply on Monday after 10-year US bond yield fell below 3-month bond yields, reflecting an inverted yield curve, which is seen as harbinger for recession. Former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said the US Treasury yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point, but it does not signal a recession.


Heavy buying in RIL and financial stocks: The oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries alone lifted the Sensex over 125 points on Tuesday. Financial majors, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance and IndusInd Bank, together added more than 250 points in the 30-share pack. However, Infosys and ITC offset some of the gains.


Expert Take

Devang Mehta, Head – Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management
Indian markets have been recipient of robust foreign flows this entire march on the back of increased likelihood of strong political stability and policy continuity post elections and the softer stance adopted by global central banks... With the fourth quarter result season being just round the corner, the participants will watch the earnings trajectory closely for the rally to sustain or gather further steam."
77,2019-03-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Thermal power plants have started delaying coal unloading as their fuel stocks have risen, industry executives said.

Coal India executives say a few plants are trying to cut supplies without formally asking for a cut, so that they would not have a problem when they need more fuel to meet higher summer demand. Power sector executives, however, say unloading takes longer than normal when coal is already heaped in the storage space.

Industry executives said this is happening in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Some plants are running out of storage space while others are financially stressed and are not in a position to stock the coal.

A power sector official said delay in releasing rakes attracts demurrage charges, payment of which requires approval from the management. Power plants try and balance demurrage charges with increased cost of maintaining inventory by reducing their stocks.

Some private and state-run plants have fuel enough to generate power for more than a month. A senior Coal India executive said these plants have not formally asked for a supply cut. A few years ago some plants had officially asked Coal India to reduce supplies but they struggled to get higher supply when summer demand rose.

Central Electricity Authority data shows 24 plants have stocks for more than 30 days. Average stocks at 126 plants are now about 30 million tonnes, enough for 17 days.

A senior Coal India executive said unloading a rake normally takes two to five hours depending on the level of mechanisation but some plants are taking as much as eight hours to release rakes."
82,2019-03-27,Coal India,"If you are someone who owns listed physical shares, you won't be able to transfer them after March 31 without first dematerialising them. After March 31, listed companies' physical shares will need to be 'dematerialised' to be sold or transferred. Consequently, after March 31, unless dematerialised, these shares would become technically 'illiquid'. 

The capital markets regulator had extended the previous deadline of December 5, 2018 for transfer of listed shares in physical. In a December 3 press release regarding the extension of the deadline, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) stated that it had ""received representations from shareholders for extension of the date of compliance."" 

The reason for this may be the fact that a lot of people still own equity shares in physical form, especially senior citizens. As on December 31, 2018, almost 4 percent of the total number of shares of the 30 Sensex companies were still held in physical form. That is 418 crore shares still in non-demat form. When 
ET Online did the story in November last year, there were a total of 423 crore shares held in physical form among the 30 companies that constitute the Sensex. Then, too, there wasn't a single company in the benchmark index where all shares are dematerialised. 

Sample this: a company like ITC has 375 crore shares in physical form in total, which is a whopping 30 percent of its total equity shares. Others are better off, Bajaj Auto l has 6.18 percent in physical form, Tata Steel has 1.9 percent, and HUL 1.7 percent. Coal India has the least number of non-dematerialised shares (5289 shares that is 0.000085 percent). And a slightly far away second is Power Grid with 41,973 shares held physically, which is 0.000802 percent. 

Now, since data on shareholding pattern is released when companies announce their quarterly results, we can only tell after March 31, 2019, (end of the Jan-Mar quarter) to see if investors have indeed dematerialised all their shares. 

So, if you are someone who hasn't dematerialised their physical shares here is a look at what will happen to those shares and how you can dematerialise the shares before the March 31 deadline. 


Why are there so many physical shares?
On June 8, 2018, Sebi notified the amended Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements regulations saying that except in the case of transmission or transposition of securities, listed companies will not be allowed to process requests for the transfer of shares shall not be processed unless the securities are held in the dematerialised form with a depository.

Most of these shares have been purchased decades ago before the Depository Act was passed and since the investors intended to hold them long-term, they did not see any reason to pay for a demat account.

These are some of the reasons why people still have physical shares. 



These are legacy shares held by many families, where certificates have been inherited from forefathers.
Investors who have changed their names.
Investors who have moved abroad and become NRIs.
Joint holders and combinations created for IPO subscription now difficult to bring back together.
Joint holders who are no more, with no nomination or documents needed to claim the shares.


What will happen to these shares after March 31?According to Sebi, no transaction for transfer of securities of a listed company, at a stock exchange or an off-market transactions between buyers and sellers, can happen in physical certificate form. So, all shares held in physical after March 31 will become illiquid except for transmission and transposition. Transmission (transfer to heirs in case of death of owner) would be possible in case of inheritance but the new owners will have to dematerialise the shares if they wish to sell or further transact in them. 


How to convert to demat?The first step is to open a demat account if you do not already have one. The demat account will have to be opened in the names of all the holders of the shares in case of shares which are held jointly and the order of holding (first and second) in the demat account will have to be the same as that of the shares. For opening of a demat account all the KYC verification procedures will have to be completed for all holders, incorporating the contact details, address, email, bank account for electronic transfer of dividends and such details of the investors. The second step is to complete the Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF) for the physical shares, along with all the required documents. Normally, separate demat forms need to be filled in for shares of different companies.

""If the company whose shares are being held has not joined a depository, and therefore does not have a unique number (ISIN), such shares cannot be dematerialised. Except these, all other physical shares can be converted into electronic entries, which make it easy to sell, pledge, transfer and otherwise easily transact with them,"" wrote Uma Shashikant, chairperson of the Centre for Investment Education and Learning, in a recent column.


Opening a demat accountDemat accounts can be opened with any depository participant (DP) in India. A DP is a financial services firm that ties up with a depository and becomes a participant. Shares dematerialised with a particular DP are held in demat account of the client and allotted unique Client IDs. 

The securities in the demat account are held by the depositary participant (DP) with any one of two depositories in India. There are two Depositories - National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and the Central Depository Services India Ltd (CDSL). The Depository where your shares will be held in demat form will depend on which one your financial services firm has tied up with. The address of your demat account therefore would include the client ID and the DP-ID after that.

Some of the DPs operating in India include Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank etc.


Charges: As with any financial service, the fees and transaction charges play an important role while selecting a DP. In addition to the account opening fees (which the DP some times waive off) and the annual maintenance fee, , the transaction charges are important. So, base your decision on whether you are going to trade very often or buy and stay invested for a longer duration. (As a retail investor, it is advisable to invest rather than to trade.) DPs have various kinds of pricing plans on offer for demat accounts. For example, it can be 0.50 percent or minimum of Rs 25, on both buy and sell transaction values."

86,2019-03-29,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Private power producers have urged the government to consider extending the trade receivables discounting system (TReDS) applicable for MSMEs to them to help resolve their payment woes, which are to the tune Rs 41,240 crore.

In a letter to power secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the Association of Power Producers Friday said delay in recovery of receivables, especially regulatory receivables, has created stress on their finances as it impacts their ability to service debt and severely restricts working capital liquidity.

According to the letter, as of end January 2019, the amount of receivables due from discoms is to the tune of Rs 41,240 crore, of which dues from sale of power are around Rs 17,246 crore, while dues stuck in litigation are worth Rs 17,128 crore and nearly Rs 6,865 crore of receivables are pending despite adjudication.

""We urge the Union power ministry to take expeditious action on this issue to help avoid create more NPAs and to ensure the availability of adequate power during the summer which is also the election season,"" APP director-general Ashok Khurana said in the letter.

He further said since the government has taken measures to address the receivables situation for MSMEs through the TReDS, extending the same to them will be of immense help. Moreover, the RBI has also issued guidelines for implementing the system.

""We believe a similar system would greatly ease current stress on private power producers and we request the ministry to consider implementing the same for us as well,"" Khurana said.

It may be recalled that the power ministry had suggested a similar system to the empowered committee, which had proposed formulation of a proposal for tri-partite agreement for discounting bills of power producers.

A senior official at a private producer said if the discoms are unable to make timely payments, it will severely impact the sector in the long-run.

""Nearly 25,000-mw capacity has receivables of over Rs 41,000 crore. Also, nearly Rs 3 lakh crore of bank funds are stuck in these projects.

""On top of it, discoms, due to mostly political reasons, have not been able to raise tariffs or improve recoveries. Unless the government takes prompt steps, there will be a situation when there will be no power as generators will not be able to produce due to liquidity crisis,"" he said.

He said IPPs have to make advance payments for to Coal India for fuel as well as to the Railways for shipment.

""Coal India's production has increased significantly this month, but if we don't have money how will we procure coal and if we dont procure coal, how will we run our plants? So it is important that payments are on time,"" he added.

The Reserve Bank has identified as many as 34 financially stressed power projects with loans of over Rs 1.8 lakh crore at risk of becoming NPAs. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court."

6,2019-04-02,Coal India,"It will be a win-win for both discoms as well as generators, said Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Power Secretary, in an 
  
  
  interview with ETNOW. Edited excerpts: 

What is your broad-based assessment of the final tariff structure for power companies? Would you say a win-win situation has been maintained?
Broadly the stability in the tariff regime has been maintained and certain improvements have been made in the normative parameters. Whatever has been the experience in the recent years on certain issues of storage of coal at the power end points and flexibilisation of the plants to accommodate renewable energy, all these aspects have been attempted to be addressed by this regulation. I feel it is quite a win-win situation for all. Like reduction in payment period, the working capital will definitely reflect on the cost of power. It will come down a bit. I am sure it will be win-win for both discoms as well as generators.


Would NTPC benefit because it is a regulated entity and they have got fixed ROEs.
ROE has been maintained. Actually, looking at the construction time etc, the effective ROE comes down and at reasonable ROE, NTPC has been able to raise resources at much lesser rate of interest. It achieves a balance. We need not worry too much about this ROE. Of course, there was an issue that after 25 years why should that much return be given. That has also been addressed in this regulation.


The other aspect which nobody is talking about is the coal availability which is a challenge for the power sector. It seems coal imports are back and they are not far away from its peak. Why is that?
Only yesterday, Coal India CMD has announced that they have crossed 600 million tonnes target. There has been growth in dispatch of more than 7.3%, 7.4% but yes the power demand has also been increasing. We have been on conventional. There has been about 3.5% growth and overall 5.1%. This year there has been some import of coal for blending purposes because the imported coal-based plants like in Mundra -- both Tata and Adani plants generated less due to certain tariff-related regulatory issues, and naturally that much quantum of power had to be met. 

I do not see it as a very serious issue. Coal India has a plan. A few years back, one billion tonne production plan was made and in early 2017, certain coal-based plants took less coal for about six months and some of these plants perhaps got delayed but the production last fiscal shows that Coal India has brought the production plans back on the table. 

There would be issues of land acquisition and clearances and resettlement issues in open-cast mining. We have displaced some people. But the plans are definitely there and we regularly review them especially on transportation, connectivity and clearances and they should be able to meet the requirement.


What about PLF (plant load factor), currently and also going forward?
Yes 61% is an average figure. But as capacities are getting added -- even this financial year some coal capacities have been added -- growth on conventional asset was only 3.5% plus. I feel PLF of different plants could be different depending on lack of PPAs or lack of coal availability for certain IIPs. This is the overall PLF. 

If you look at NTPC, PLF is always 70% plus and some of the patented plants generate working 90% PLF. This will improve once the demand grows but we always compare it with four-five years back when the PLF was high because the coal capacities were low. The plants were running at full capacity. So, it is not that those plants are generating at lower PLF now. New capacities have been added, which have not been able to reach full capacities and we are working separately for getting some medium-term power purchase agreements for these plants.


How big a relief could be relaxation for power norms and the way NPAs are calculated for private players?
There is stress in power sector. Each case is different and we cannot generalise too much but there were certain sectoral issues. There was cancellation of coal blocks. There was lack of PPAs. Some of the PPAs were in dispute and then there were some equity issues by the promoters themselves and some of them had bid very aggressive tariffs. 

Now all the solutions cannot be found by the government but we tried to address some of these sectoral issues especially payments, coal and PPAs in an innovative manner. We went to a high- level empowered committee and we have issued orders and the Shakti Policy has been amended by the ministry of coal to permit short-term sale of power from coal linkage. 

So, it is a matter of time before issues are solved. The RBI circular has put some tight guidelines on the bankers who are worried. They may lose money in one-time settlement or in the bidding but then some of the capacities which are still under construction without any EPS and all may end up in NCLT and they are already in the process of either admission or in hearing in NCLT. Whatever could be resolved has also been attempted to be resolved. It is a balanced approach. We are trying to bring the commission capacities with coal linkages to PPAs. 

In case of commissioned capacities without coal linkages, we are trying to get some coal through Shakti modification. Capacities which are under construction and at a stage where small investments cannot turn them around and bring them in commissioning, perhaps have to be dealt in NCLT.


Talk about the post merger benefits of PFC and REC. Would you say that the combined entity is much better off than the two standalone entities?
At present, government shares in REC have been acuired by PFC. The process of merger is yet to kick in, We will examine that side also. The share market indicates that both the companies are doing well. There were apprehensions on the ratings, they were under watch. All those things have over and now both the companies are there. They are complementary in their functioning. 

PFC had invested more on the generation assets and REC on transmission and distribution assets, now they can sort of coordinate well. they were together funding some stressed assets so the decision making becomes easier now if those assets are getting resolved. In any case for raising resources in the international markets, both the companies together will be in a better position.


What is the situation with discoms?
I very much appreciate the concern. The position during FY19 have deteriorated. The discoms audit is delayed and the correct figures take some time to reach us. I was trying to collect some data from some of the states, we got about 50-60% data of the nine month period which shows that the billing efficiency has gone up, the collection efficiency has gone up and AT&C losses also have come down marginally in the nine months and compared to 20% plus last year, stand at 19 plus percent this year. But the losses in the balance sheets have gone up and the power purchase cost has also gone up. There have been increase in coal prices and railway freight and that has impacted the power purchase cost.

All that has led to ACS ARR gap increasing, though efficiency factors are kicking in. If there is increase in power purchase cost of 21 paisa, the ACS ARR gap has got affected by only eight paisa. That shows that the whole thing has not impacted the discoms badly. We have to look at all the factors and not only the discoms. Their balance sheets from Rs 50,000 crore plus has come down to Rs 15,000 crore in the last fiscal. In FY19, maybe it would be more than Rs 15,000 crore but not much, though improvements are there. The tariff applications have started moving in. The discoms have been approaching the regulators for revising the tariff. That culture has set in and the efficiency has also been brought in. We are looking at improvement of their O&M norms. 

We are pushing metering, we are increasing the reach so their billing efficiency and quantum energy billed and all have shown definitely positive trends. I am hopeful that despite the ups and downs in different discoms, different issues of subsidies getting released and all, things would improve. Sometimes the subsidies get released in March which affects the balance sheets and will show positive by next three months, when we get the results for the whole financial year. It is a mixed bag at this moment.


Power companies are telling us that the private sector is still not very convinced about starting capex. ABB, BHEL, Alsthom are harbingers of which way the power demand and power capex is moving. When do you think the real power capex will start?
There seems to be a lull at this moment but when we look at the projections of the future, we need to add capacities and if we start working on a project today, the capacity comes into commissioning after five to six years. There definitely would be need to add capacities. We have made a projection plan, CA does it very regularly but we are looking at a proper energy mix by 2030, wherein we will integrate how much maximum renewables we can integrate and what is the balance requirement. 

Presently, the balancing is coming from hydro to some extent and to flexible operations of the coal plants, The regulator in its tariff regulation has also incentivised the part that if your ramp up rate is 1%, you get incentivised in your returns. 

We expect that more capacities will have to be added. Some brown-field expansions of NTPC have taken place. Recently two new plants have also been cleared by government for about 1,320 MW each in Buxar in Bihar and Khurja in UP. Definitely some planning is there in the pipeline and once the relevant approvals take place, those definitely will come into construction and the order books of BHEL and other suppliers would start looking up.


What would be your message to investors who have languished in terms of return expectations in power sector? 
Power companies are bound to do well. Without power, there is no development. Government has invested in the distribution infrastructure through Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana as well as Saubhagya and now we are working on smart meters and metering of the whole system and bringing in smart grids to check losses to tell discoms to become more professional, because that is the paying end of the power sector. 

Demand is there, per capita consumption is one-third of the world average and within the country, we have so much of variation starting from Gujarat to Bihar and all. There is a scope for use of power and we are a developing country. If GDP grows at 7-8%, definitely power is one of the important factors. We need to grow at 6% plus. From where this growth will come? 

The renewables will grow definitely but we need to balance this energy and shareholders should not be worried about their investment. Any industrial activity always has ups and downs. There was a glut of capacity which has led to certain stress but gradually, these capacities are getting addressed. 

Demand from the state is coming up. Long PPAs may not have come but we are hearing that some states are interested in that also. So, Shakti policy applications are now coming up for even long-term purchase agreements.

It will take some more time to fructify but nothing is looking dark in future rather it is looking very bright as far as power sector is concerned."
5,2019-04-02,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government has raised India's coal production by over 144 million tonne (mt) in the five years it has been in power, overshooting by 5% the 138mt added to the country's output in the 10 years of UPA rule between 2004 and 2014.

Production by Coal India (CIL), the state-run miner accounting for nearly 90% of domestic supplies, stood at a little over 462mt when the Modi government took over in May 2014. Five years since then, production by the country's largest coal miner stands at 607mt in 2018-19, coal ministry data shows.



In contrast, CIL's production stood at 324mt in 2004-05 when the UPA-1 government came to power and rose to 404mt by 2008-09, indicating an addition of 80mt in the five-year period. In the subsequent five years, the UPA-2 government added 79mt to take the total production to 607mt.

Data shows coal offtake too largely keeping pace with production, indicating improved evacuation and transportation due to greater synergy between the coal and railway ministries. Quick decisions and clearances for mine expansions have also contributed to the sharp rise in production.

""There is a clear vision and direction from the leadership. The railway and coal ministries are working as a team with the power and other consumer ministries. Improved coordination with forest and environment ministry has ensured speedy clearances for mine expansion and evacuation projects,"" a coal ministry official said.

But at the end, it is people who execute plans and can make or mar them. Here too, the ministry has taken care to motivate miners and executives by settling the wage issues and clearing gratuity payment, totalling several thousands of crores in employee welfare.

The result of this coordinated approach is showing on the ground as none of the coal-fired power stations monitored by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is starving for fuel, though several still show stocks of less than a week. But still, it is a far cry from 2014 when 66% of the units were doddering due to critical coal inventories."
3,2019-04-02,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Coal has always been identified as the primary source of energy in India, fuelling 55% of power generation. But thanks to a series of policy initiatives by the Narendra Modi government, the Black Diamond industry is now also quenching thirst of nearly seven lakh beneficiaries in 498 villages across six coal-bearing states.

According to coal ministry data, some 6,100 lakh cubic metre, or 16,700 litres per day, of water is pumped out annually from the mines of India's biggest coal producer, Coal India.



Until a few years ago , coal mines utilised only a small portion of this water for sprinkling and coal washing etc. Some of the remaining water was stored in ponds created within mine areas and the rest was pumped out on to neighbouring land.

But things began to change since 2015-16 after coal minister Piyush Goyal asked miners to put mine water to good use. Packaged drinking water under the 'Coal Neer' brand was the first step. Since then, the initiative has grown into a civic service, with the ministry data showing CIL mines supplying some 484 lakh cubic metres of water for domestic use and 599 lakh cubic metres of water for irrigating over 2,060 hectares of land during 2017-18."

Board meetings
 Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained its buy recommendation on SRF with a target price of ₹2,315 as pick up in specialty chemical business was a strong earnings kicker for the company. In the long run, the company’s leadership in refrigerant gas and significant capital expenditure in specialty chemicals will drive return ratios and other segments like technical textiles and packaging film to continue to generate strong cash flows, said the brokerage. 

• Emkay has initiated coverage on Capacite Infraprojects with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹288 citing strong growth path with attractive valuation. Besides government reforms such as real estate regulatory authority, the company is well-positioned to gain traction driven by impressive execution track with stable margins, lean balance sheet with healthy return ratios, strong management pedigree and asset-light business model said the brokerage. 

• Elara Capital has maintained its buy rating on TCS with a target price of ₹2,400 as the 19.8% PE premium assigned for TCS based on consensus estimates is inadequate. The brokerage expects the margin gap to widen further over FY20 as it expect TCS to improve operating profit margin by 180 bps year-onyear to 28.8%, even as Infosys sees operating profit margin erode by 100 bps year-on-year to 24.2%, said the brokerage. 

• Axis Securities has initiated coverage on Chalet Hotels with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹410. Chalet stems from its unique positioning and efficient asset management strategy such as the industry is coming out of a 10-year lull and we find it prudent to back asset owners in an upcycle – superior operating profit case in point, said the brokerage. 

• Edelweiss has maintained its buy rating on DLF with a target price of ₹237. DLF has successfully completed a qualified institutional placement of ₹3,170 crore involving an issuance of 173 mn shares at ₹183.4 apiece. This paves the way for the balance fund infusion of ₹2,250 crore by promoters as well as conversion of debentures/warrants worth the entire ₹11,250 crore into equity shares, said the brokerage.

Analyst calls
• Edelweiss has maintained its hold rating on Coal India with a target price of Rs 243 as e-auction premium will dip given the inventory buildup in the upcoming summer months. Coal India’s shipments in FY19 surpassed the 600MT mark for the first time ever; the 4.7% YoY increase was broadly in line with our expectation, says brokerage. 

• Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on Godrej Agrovet with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹610 as the company is riding on the back of crop protection and the palm oil business. The diverse nature of of the company’s various businesses de-risks its operations, enabling it to focus on growth, optimise capital efficiency and to maintain its competitive advantage, said the brokerage. 

 • IIFL has maintained its reduce rating on United Spirits with a target price of ₹540 citing moderate sales growth in January-march 2014 quarter. Our industry checks suggest that United Spirits would witness 5% sales growth in 4Q, as the key markets of Maharashtra, Karnataka and UP face demand headwinds, said the brokerage. 

 • ICICI Securities has maintained its buy rating on Kaveri with a target price of ₹598. We note Kaveri has created strong value over the past decade and we remain positive on the medium-term growth outlook, said the brokerage. It expects the company to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 7.6% and 9.4%, respectively over FY18-FY21. 

 • Emkay has maintained its buy rating on Kajaria Ceramics with a target price of ₹628. We expect 12% volume CAGR in FY18-21E and expect OPM to improve to 16.7%/17.2% in FY20/21E vs. 15.4% in FY19E, said the brokerage. Gas prices have come down by 12% in Q4FY19, which should help in margin expansion, it added. 

 • Kotak Securities has initiated coverage on Welspun Corp with a buy rating and set a target price of ₹161, valuing stock at 4.5 times FY21 estimated EV/EBITDA. Given its strong manufacturing and execution capabilities, strong order backlog coupled with robust bids in the pipeline, we believe, Welspun is better placed compared to its peers, to take advantage of renewed pipe demand globally and in the domestic market, said the brokerage.

8,2019-04-04,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Metal shares were trading in the negative zone in Thursday's morning session.

Shares of Hindalco Industries (down 2.45 per cent) , Jindal Stainless (Hisar) (down 1.56 per cent) , Steel Authority of India (SAIL) (down 1.39 per cent) and JSW Steel (down 1.35 per cent) were trading with losses.

Tata Steel (down 1.13 per cent) , Vedanta (down 1.00 per cent) , Hindustan Copper (down 0.91 per cent) and Coal India (down 0.15 per cent) too were trading lower. 

The Nifty Metal index was trading 0.94 per cent down at 3055.90 around 10:49 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was down 23.25 points at 11,620.70 while the BSE Sensex was 78.31 points down at 38,798.81.

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 21 were trading in the green, while 28 were in the red. 

Shares of Vodafone Idea, YES Bank, Tata Motors, SAIL, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Zee Ent., Bank of Baroda, Ashok Leyland, Bharti Airtel, SBI, BPCL, ONGC, Ambuja Cements, BEL and DLF were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
9,2019-04-05,Coal India,"Notwithstanding the soaring benchmark indices, analysts are slashing target prices for stocks. In the past six months, price targets for Nifty 50 components have been slashed by 6.5 per cent on average, the second-highest in Asia after Japan. The behaviour of analysts, this time around, contradicts their historical stance wherein they would raise stock target prices during market rallies.

Out of the 50 companies in the Nifty 50 index, 34 have seen a reduction in target prices in the past six months. In addition, 21 companies faced a reduction of more than 10 per cent while only six recorded more than 10 per cent increase in target prices.

Automobiles, metals and oil marketing companies reported target price cuts of 15-40 per cent. Tata Motors, Indiabulls Housing, Vedanta, Yes Bank and Maruti Suzuki recorded biggest cuts in that order.


The prime reason for the price cuts was earnings downgrade of 6-20 per cent. For instance, the earnings growth of auto companies has been dwindling following volume contraction in the second-half of FY19. India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki had guided for a double-digit growth at the beginning of the fiscal, but could deliver only 6 per cent volume growth at the end of the fiscal.

Based on the current target prices, companies such as Hindalco, ONGC, M&M, Coal India and Tata Motors offer the highest upside in the range of 19-28 per cent from their respective current market prices."
10,2019-04-06,Coal India,"Mumbai: Bajaj Energy, a thermal power generation company based in Uttar Pradesh, has filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the capital market regulator Sebi on Friday to raise about Rs 5,450 crore.

This would be the second biggest initial public offer (IPO) since November 2017 when HDFC Life Insurance raised Rs 8,695 crore.

The IPO will comprise fresh shares of up to Rs 5,150 crore by the Kushagra Bajaj-controlled company. Bajaj Power Ventures will also sell shares worth Rs 300 crore.


 So far in 2019, seven companies including Embassy REIT have raised Rs 7,860 crore from the primary market.

The Rs 4,750-crore Embassy REIT issue was subscribed 1.7 times while the Rs 1,200 crore Metropolis IPO, which ended on Friday, was subscribed 5.7 times.

The net proceeds from the fresh share issue could be utilised to purchase 6.99 crore shares of Lalitpur Power Generation Company from Bajaj Power Ventures and Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar.

Bajaj Energy has a total gross installed capacity of 2,430 MW, comprising 450 MW from five operational plants of 90 MW each, owned and managed by BEL and 1,980 MW from the power plant owned and managed by Lalitpur Power.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2018, the company has reported a total revenue of Rs 722 crore, up 10% over the previous year. The company’s net profit grew at 32.42% to Rs 35.94 crore during this period. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the company reported a turnover of Rs 898 crore with a loss of Rs 34 crore.

Edelweiss, IIFL Holdings and SBI Capital Markets are the lead managers to the issue. IDBI Capital is the co-book running lead managers to the issue Both Bajaj Energy and Lalitpur Power Generation Company have also entered into long-term fuel supply agreements with Coal India for the supply of coal to their power plants."
11,2019-04-07,Coal India,"British oil firm Cairn Energy plc has seen its cost of fighting an arbitration against the Indian government imposing retrospective tax nearly tripling in 2018 even as it lost investments and tax refunds pending final award.

Cairn in its latest annual report said administrative expense towards Indian tax arbitration has risen to $ 22.9 million (about Rs 158.4 crore) in 2018 from $ 8.1 million (about Rs 56 crore) in 2017.

The company which gave the country its biggest oil discovery received a notice from the Income Tax Department in January 2014, requesting information relating to the group re-organisation done in 2006. Alongside, the Income Tax Department attached the company's near 10 per cent shareholding in its erstwhile subsidiary, Cairn India. In March 2015, the tax department sought Rs 10,247 crore in taxes on alleged capital gains made by the company in the internal reorganisation.

""In January 2014, Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL), a direct subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC, received notification from the Indian Income Tax Department (IITD) that it was restricted from selling its shareholding in Cairn India Ltd (CIL); at that time the shareholding was approximately 10 per cent and had a market valuation of Rs 6,000 crore,"" the annual report said. ""The notification made reference to retrospective Indian tax legislation enacted in 2012, which the IITD was seeking to apply to the 2006 Transactions,"" it added.

Cairn had in 2010-11 sold Cairn India to Vedanta Ltd. Following the merger in April 2017 of CIL and Vedanta Ltd, CUHL's shareholding in CIL was replaced by a shareholding of about 5 per cent in Vedanta Ltd issued together with preference shares.

""In addition to attaching CUHL's shares in Vedanta Ltd, the IITD seized dividends due to CUHL from those shareholdings totalling Rs 1,140 crore ( $ 164.2 million). The IITD has also notified Cairn that a tax refund of Rs 1,590 crore ( $ 249.0 million) due to CUHL as a result of overpayment of capital gains tax on a separate matter in 2011 has been applied as partial payment of the tax assessment of the 2006 Transactions,"" the annual report said.

Cairn in 2015 initiated an international arbitration to challenge the retrospective taxation.

Pending final award, the tax department sold Cairn's shares in Vedanta to recover part of the tax demand.

""To date 99 per cent of CUHL's shareholding has been liquidated by the IITD,"" it said adding the principal tax due, according to the tax department on the 2006 transactions is Rs 10,247 crore plus applicable interest and penalties.

Interest is currently being charged on the principal at a rate of 12 per cent per annum from February 2017, although this is potentially subject to the IITD's Indian court appeal that interest should be back-dated to 2007.

Penalties are currently assessed as 100 per cent of the principal tax due, although this is subject to appeal by CUHL that penalties should not be charged given the retrospective nature of the tax levied.

""The Group has legal advice confirming that the maximum amount that could ultimately be recovered from Cairn by the IITD, in excess of the assets already seized, is limited to the value of CUHL's assets, principally the remaining ordinary shares in Vedanta Ltd,"" the report said.

In March 2015 Cairn filed a Notice of Dispute under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty, seeking restitution of the value effectively seized by the IITD in and since January 2014.

""Cairn's principal claims are that the assurance of fair and equitable treatment and protections against expropriation afforded by the Treaty have been breached by the actions of the IITD, which is seeking to apply retrospective taxes to historical transactions already closely scrutinised and approved by the Government of India. The IITD has attached and seized assets to try to enforce such taxation,"" it said.

It wants the effects of the tax assessment be nullified and that Cairn should receive recompense from India for the loss of value resulting from the 2014 attachment of CUHL's shares in CIL and the withholding of the tax refund, which together total $ 1.4 billion.

The arbitration formally commenced in January 2016 following agreement between Cairn and India on the appointment of a panel of three international arbitrators under the terms of the treaty. ""All formal hearings and submissions have now been made and the tribunal is in the process of drafting its award,"" the annual report said."
12,2019-04-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The coal ministry plans to give special attention to private captive coal block operators to help increase output, which has frequently failed to meet targets.

This has put tremendous pressure on Coal India, which has been struggling to meet the nation’s demand for coal.

“This year, the focus among other things would be on private captive block operators,” said a coal ministry official. “They have been facing a host of issues in terms of operationalising their blocks and we need to help them expedite the process, so that production from this segment rises at a faster pace.”

Captive blocks have suffered because of delay in land acquisition and various clearances as well as issues such as rehabilitation and resettlement.

In 2018-19, captive mines produced an estimated 33 million tonnes. In the previous years, they produced about 36 million tonnes, including 18 million tonnes by Sasan Power Ltd and 6.2 million tonnes by Tata Steel.

The official said some blocks that were not operational should start production. “This is expected to bring down pressure on Coal India as coal demand from these companies would reduce and ease coal stock position at power plants,” he said."
13,2019-04-09,Coal India,"HDFC Asset Management, the country’s largest mutual fund house by assets, picked shares of select banking, power, hotels, infrastructure and mining players with both hands in March, as domestic stocks rallied to give benchmark Nifty a 7 per cent lift.

In the auto and auto ancillary space, HDFC AMC added some shares of Gabriel India, Maruti Suzuki and M&M. It also picked 93,031 shares of SpiceJet.

Aditya Birla Nuvo, Astra Microwave, Bharat Forge, CESC Ventures, Matrimoney.com, Reliance Capital, Spencers Retail and V-Guard Industries were among the stocks the fund house exited completely in March.

NSE’s Nifty added 831 points to trade at 11,623 on March 29 from 10,792 on February 28. Expectations of the Modi-led government returning to power amid sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors supported the rally. 

Foreign institutional investors poured nearly Rs 34,000 crore in Indian equities in March against Rs 17,219.62 crore inflow in February. They have bought additional shares of worth Rs 8,989 crore in April so far.

HDFC AMC’s average asset under management (AUM) stood at Rs 3,42,524 crore as of March 31. It was followed by Rs 3,21,281 crore of ICICI Prudential AMC and Rs 2,84,123 crore of SBI Funds Management."

16,2019-04-09,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Private bank stocks and blue chip Reliance Industries lifted key benchmark indices by over half a per cent on Tuesday, helping recoup the previous session's losses. 

The market for the most part meandered through gains and losses, but a recovery in European shares along with rupee's rise against the dollar gave investors some confidence. 

Driven by banking and auto shares, the BSE benchmark Sensex rose 239 points, or 0.62 per cent to 38,939 while its NSE counterpart Nifty ended at 11,672, up 67 points or 0.58 per cent. 

The advance-decline ratio, however, leaned more towards the sellers side, indicating underlying bearishness in market.


How did the market look like today?

Of the Sensex scrips, 25 settled on the higher side while five slipped. YES Bank with gains of 4.08 per cent topped the chart. Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, Coal India and HCL Tech trailed, rising up to 3 per cent. 

Meanwhile, Asian Paints lost big by 3.54 per cent after CLSA downgraded the stock to 'Sell' from 'Outperform' while reducing the target price to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,565. The brokerage has cut the EPS estimate by 2-5 per cent led by revenue cuts. 

Sectorally, barring telecom and consumer durables, all other indices ended in the green. Realty, auto and bankex were the best performing sectors, rising over a per cent each. 

The day was not as rosy for midcap and smallcap indices. Though BSE Midcap managed to end on a positive note, up 0.15 per cent, the Smallcap index declined by 0.10 per cent. 


What made the stocks come alive? 


Rupee rebounds
The rupee surged by as much as 39 paise against the dollar on Tuesday even as oil prices topped a 5-month high. The domestic currency hit intra-day high of 69.28 against the greenback. It looked to snap its four-day losing streak. 


European shares march ahead
Bank stocks helped European shares shrug off early weakness on Tuesday, but gains were kept in check by a drop in shares of Airbus and its suppliers after the US ratcheted up a trade dispute with the European Union over aircraft subsidies. A rise in bank shares following two days of losses helped the pan-region STOXX 600 index up 0.4 per cent in thin trade. Most European bourses posted small gains.

The positive sentiment in global peers rubbed off on Indian equities, too.


Expert Take

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services

Market gained after a range-bound movement on expectations of a turnaround in earnings growth led by Q4 FY19 results starting this week while positive global peers aided the market. Banks outperformed as outlook improved led by reduction in stressed assets, repo rate and pick-up in credit growth. But valuation is at a premium level while start of the first phase of polling may bring volatility to the market."

22,2019-04-11,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: The current reading of India VIX, a gauge for market perceived risk, reflects that market participants are yet to factor in a major change in market volatility due to ensuing general elections.

India VIX is currently at 21.1 per cent, trading below the 10-year average of 21.4 per cent. In addition, the 30-day historical volatility of the Nifty has been consistently coming down from the November 2018 peak. It is currently at 10.1 per cent against the 10- year average of 16.2 per cent. The reading indicates how much an index may fluctuate on an annualised basis.

Contrary to the general expectation of a spike in the volatility during elections, historical data show that four of the last six elections did not see any meaningful rise in volatility.



Another indicator of the market’s current lower risk perception is the pricing of straddles. A straddle is a derivative strategy involving simultaneously purchasing options to buy and sell a security. It is used to take advantage of volatility. The pricing of the straddle on Nifty 50 at Wednesday’s close denoted an expectation of just over 3.5 per cent volatility in either direction (gain or loss in the Nifty).

The volatility has historically increased after the election. Also, stocks show more volatility than the benchmark indices such as Nifty. According to Credit Suisse, in case of 11 of the Nifty stocks, volatility more than doubled in the month after election results in 2014 than it was in the prior month and most of these were public sector stocks including ONGC, Coal India, NMDC, GAIL, PGCIL, NTPC, SBI and PNB."
21,2019-04-11,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Mumbai stocks fell on Wednesday as investors hit the pause button ahead of the first phase of India’s mammoth sevenstage elections with polling in 91 seats on Thursday. The International Monetary Fund’s decision to cut outlook for global and Indian growth also weighed on Street’s sentiment. Experts said stocks could struggle to hold onto gains after a sharp pre-vote rally in the past few weeks.

The Sensex slipped 353.8 points, or 0.9 per cent, to close at 38,585.3 and the Nifty ended down 87.6 points, or 0.75 per cent, at 11,584.3. Decliners outnumbered the advances on the Nifty with 29 of the 50 constituents ending in the red. Stock indices in Asia were mixed as concerns emerged over the global growth outlook.

The Sensex has gained 9.3 per cent from the calendar year 2019 low of 35,287.1 on February 19, while the Nifty has climbed 9.4 per cent on the back of opinion polls indicating the BJP-led coalition returning to power on May 23.



The national polls will be held between Thursday and May 19.

Index heavyweight HDFC Bank was one of the biggest laggards. The stock fell 2 per cent after a block deal where private equity giant KKR sold a portion of its stake. Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, Tata Consultancy Services and Housing Development Finance Corporation also fell 2 per cent to 3 per cent. Tata Motors was the top gainer on the Sensex climbing 4.7 per cent. Hindustan Unilever, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Auto and Coal India all rose 0.5-0.8 per cent.



“Fatigue is setting in. Market has more or less factored in the possibility of the NDA returning to power,” said Piyush Garg, Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Securities. Garg added that it could be difficult for the index to rally from current levels. Yogesh Mehta, vice president-retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities, believes that lack of participation from retail investors is making high net-worth investors cautious.

“Mid-caps are not participating and large-cap valuations look stretched for the near term,” said Mehta.

The volatility index, India VIX, also known as the fear gauge, is also pointing towards caution as it is firmly trading above 20 level. India VIX ended up 4 per cent at 21.09 level and analysts expect it to touch 22-23 in the near term.

Oil prices hovering above $70 per barrel is also a near-term headwind for domestic equities, experts said.

Kotak Institutional Equities believes stocks are “getting a bit hot for comfort”.

""The Indian market has largely ignored the recent (1) economic growth deceleration, (2) rebound in crude prices and (3) deterioration in India’s fiscal position,” the brokerage said. “Valuations are largely unattractive for most parts of the market and we note potential downside risks to earnings in the event of a further slowdown in the economy,” it added."
23,2019-04-12,Coal India,"S. K. Sadangi, has taken over as chief vigilance officer of Coal India on Wednesday.

He was also associated with the Justice M.B.Shah Commission of Enquiry, constituted by the centre to probe illegal mining of iron ore and manganese in large parts of the country."
24,2019-04-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government is considering a proposal to allow gas-based power plants to sell electricity in the spot market under a subsidy scheme.

“We are contemplating if we can work out a mechanism where these gas-based power plants can also sell on power exchanges without depending on the power purchase agreements,” a government official said.

The proposed e-RLNG (re-gasified liquefied natural gas) scheme, being drafted by power and oil ministries as per the recommendations of a high-level empowered committee headed by cabinet secretary PK Sinha, is likely to require lesser than earlier projected subsidy due to softened global crude oil prices, the official said.

As per the proposal, the government is considering gas auction mechanism for the electricity generating units by pooling any domestic gas with LNG and subsidising the tariffs to revive about 25,000 mw projects, the official said.

The scheme is proposed to be run for two years beginning the current fiscal. It will be similar to the e-RLNG scheme run between 2015-16 and 2016-17 based on financial support from the Power System Development Fund.

The government had recently allowed power plants to use coal supplied by Coal India Ltd to supply electricity in short-term market. Industry experts said RLNG price is hovering around $8 per mmbtu (metric million British thermal unit).

 In the previous rounds, the government had subsidised the tariffs at Rs 5.50 per unit. The ministry, however, this time might stick to Rs 4.24 per unit tariff that was discovered through its PPA auctions last year. Earlier the government was considering pooling ONGC deep sea gas with LNG.

The government had launched an e-RLNG scheme in March 2015. The scheme was discontinued after two bidding rounds after the power ministry received aggressive bids from companies. Power companies have been demanding the government to restart the scheme as about 7,500-mw capacity is completely stranded while the rest is stressed.

Presently, the country has nearly 25,000-mw of operational gas-based capacity, all of which is stressed because of gas unavailability. Against total requirement of 117 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metres per day), total gas supply in 2017 was 30 mmscmd."

38,2019-04-16,Coal India,"Multiple choice question: If Narendra Modi were to be voted out, what would happen to India? (a) The Deluge, (b) economic collapse, (c) a wave of terror strikes, (d) armed forces drained of the will to fight, and (e) all of the above. If you chose (e), you are the type who would fend off pressure from friends to vote some party other than BJP with the despairing query, if not Modi, who?

It is a reality check: you probably confuse the sales pitch for the real thing and love superheroes who do all the heavy lifting when it comes to saving the world, leaving little for the man in the street to do except when it’s time to cheer.


Missing Political Courage 
Modi oozes leadership and people tend to think he is a strong, courageous leader. But his performance shows extreme timidity. One jibe — suit-boot ki Sarkar — was all it took for Modi to wind up his reform of land acquisition and labour laws.

In the sphere of economics, Modi brought about exactly two new changes. One, he did away with state monopoly in coal. Two, he brought in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The rest of all the schemes and initiatives that he parades are re-packaged, rebranded schemes of the predecessor UPA government, including goods and services tax (GST), albeit given greater political commitment and visibility. State monopoly in coal was done away with in 2015. India has some of the world’s largest deposits of thermal coal but the inefficiency and incapacity of the state-owned monopoly, Coal India, has meant that the country has been importing coal, adding tens of billions of dollars to India’s current account deficit, incurring huge costs in transporting coal inland, diversion of rail resources for it, delaying the transport of other bulk goods and overall rise in costs.

Yet, four years after acquiring the legal freedom to commence merchant mining, the Modi government has not been able to open the country’s coal to professional mining. Essentially because Modi lacked the political will to take on Coal India unions.

Consider the wreck that is the Indian power sector. The country’s power generation capacity is 350,000 MW. But at peak summer, when people face blackouts, India hardly runs 160,000 MW of that capacity. This is because most state utilities are too broke to pay for the power they buy from generators. The problem is political. The utilities are broke because politicians believe they have to give power away for free and patronise large-scale power theft. Courage means telling people they have to pay for the power they consume.

Estimates of how much of the power that is generated is not paid for vary from 30% to 40% (as in many other areas, the government is shy about publishing data on state utility losses). Can any business survive if 40% of its output is not paid for? The net result is the perversity that in India, with desperately low levels of per-capita power consumption, power capacity is deemed surplus, even as tier 2 towns run diesel generators for up to 12 hours a day for their power needs.

About Rs 1,80,000 crore is the debt load of 34 power plants that are deemed stressed. This is or is becoming part of the banks’ bad loan portfolio. This is not a natural calamity but a result of political wimpishness. India has a stock of bad loans instead of electricity powering machinery, offices and jobs.


Democracy, Not Saviours
So, where exactly does the image of Modi as a courageous leader meet reality? In first condemning the employment guarantee scheme as the Congress’ monument to failure and later taking credit for increasing its outlay? In rebranding ongoing government schemes? In announcing handouts for farmers? In seeking extradition of economic fugitives?

The capacity to gamble is different from courage. Demonetisation was a gamble, that class antagonism is strong enough for people to swallow hardship in the hope that the illicit rich would suffer. It paid off, initially. Now, every thief who makes off with a cash hoard mocks the claim that demonetisation killed black money.

Balakot was another successful gamble. Using air power to strike within Pakistan called Pakistan’s nuclear bluff while sending out the message that India would retaliate against aggression using non-state actors. It gambled that global outrage over Pulwama, widespread recognition of Pakistan’s sponsorship of terror and its dire economic conditions would inhibit war. The domestic political payoff was immense. It was a tempting gamble, and paid off.

Dokalam, in contrast, was a display of courage, born, perhaps, out of compulsion that did not leave much room for another response, but courage, nevertheless. India’s past leaders have shown greater courage under more trying conditions when India was a much weaker power.

The point about democracy is that it throws up bold leaders and policy from within the totality of available resources in most unexpected ways. Cometh the hour, cometh the man — or woman. No one expected Shastri or Goongi Gudiya (Dumb Doll) Indira Gandhi to shape up as leaders.

India needs democracy, not saviours. Modi harms democracy, not strengthens it."

Factors:
MonsoonIndia Meteorological Department with its prediction of a near-normal monsoon offered some relief to Dalal Street after private weather forecaster Skymet last month predicted below-normal monsoon. IMD on Monday said that the country is likely to have ‘near normal’ monsoon this year with well-distributed rainfall, which could be beneficial for the agriculture sector. 


Firm foreign inflowsSustained inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued to support market mood. FIIs have poured over Rs 65,000 crore in the domestic equity markets so far this year till April 15.


EarningsA first start to the earnings season further strengthened market sentiment. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys gave a smart start to the earnings season on Friday. While Infosys reported a 10.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,078 crore and guided for 7.5-9.5 per cent revenue growth in FY 2019-20, TCS posted 17.7 per cent growth in March quarter profit at Rs 8,162 crore.


Global cuesStocks inched higher on Tuesday as reassuring data about the health of China's economy helped investors shrug off disappointing bank earnings in the United States, while volatility in European markets took another leg lower. European shares followed their Asian counterparts and opened marginally higher, leaving the Euro STOXX 600 within a whisker of eight-month highs. Germany's DAX gained half a percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 also strengthened. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged up 0.1 percent in early European trade.


Expert Take
Market rallied to a new high supported by optimism over quarter earnings and positive global market. A better monsoon outlook from IMD provided relief to investors, who are keen on earnings outcome to accumulate quality stocks despite election led volatility

Comments from the Indian Met Department, which has forecasted a near normal monsoon this year, came as a positive surprise for Dalal Street. The Met department has forecast Southwest monsoon to be 96 per cent of Long Period Average.

Benchmark equity indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty scaled fresh life-time close highs on Tuesday, as sentiment remained upbeat for the fourth session in a row on “near-normal” monsoon forecast and optimism over firm corporate earnings.

Asian share markets got off to a guarded start on Wednesday as investors waited anxiously for a raft of Chinese data that might show policy stimulus is finally gaining traction in the world's second-largest economy.

A better monsoon outlook from IMD provided relief to investors, who are keen on earnings outcome to accumulate quality stocks despite election led volatility.”

Meanwhile, the rupee lost another 18 paise to close at 69.60 against the US dollar on Tuesday, marking third straight session of decline owing to sustained demand for the greenback from importers and rising global crude oil prices.

Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking said, “We remain cautiously optimistic on the Indian markets and expect consolidation in the near term given the recent rally. Further, earnings outcome of Nifty heavyweights (Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank) this week may provide further direction to the markets.”

On the global front, China GDP data, US-China trade talks as well as corporate earnings will provide cues to the investors. In addition, INR vs USD and oil price movement are the other key factors."
40,2019-04-18,Coal India,"Flows did improve from retail individuals in the month of March but managers did not really over allocate into
  
  
  equities in March, said 
Kaustubh Belapurkar
, Director, Fund Research, Morningstar Investment Adviser, in an interview with ETNOW.


Edited excerpts:


We have made it to all-time highs from the last time that we have met but there is that massive missed-out feeling with the market. What has been the broad trend that you have seen across funds?
In the previous couple of months, we have seen domestic institutions taking a back seat which have been driving the markets over the last year and a half or two. The FIIs took a forward step and it seems significant amount of flows have come in. Flows did improve from retail individuals in the month of March but managers did not really over allocate into equities in March.

If you look at it, the money has been largely allocated through the CPSE ETF offering into the PSU names like NTPC, ONGC, Coal India and IOC. That is largely where a huge amount of the allocation has gone. 

The other interesting trend is that financials which has been such a huge play for such a long time, have taken a pause. In fact, given the run up in some of these banking counters, there have been some marginal trimming of positions. I do not think fundamentally anything has changed but just the valuations. Some pause has occurred across the managers.


 It is a bit strange with that with the banks but what has been going on with stocks from the broader universe, what has been the key trend there?
I would say one interesting trend that we notice is the emergence of some buying into insurance. Mainly life insurance. Obviously, there were some offers to sale or stake sale happening from the likes of ICICI Pru Life and SBI Life. They have garnered some flows but the likes of HDFC Life have seen interest coming back from buyers, given that the stocks have been trading at lows for quite some time now.

Otherwise, if we look at it, financials are tepid, healthcare not really going anywhere, technologies have paused a bit, cyclicals have not really moved on the auto side. But in other consumer names, especially on the midcap side, you can see some interest building up. The likes of Sheela Foam, Relaxo Footwear, Jubilant Foodworks has seen some interest.


Consumer names…
The consumer names and travel and tourism industry. Travel is not working but the hotel space is…


Tourism is…
Tourism is. In fact, Indian Hotels has seen a fair bit of buying. The likes of Lemon Tree are seeing buying. So, there is interest in that space. Unfortunately, the other leg is not really playing out.


Typically, when you see some traction build into the hotel names, is it long lasting money or is it a very short-term money which just gets in and gets out during the peak season?
Hotels is one trend that we have been seeing building up for a while now. The quantum of flows is not huge given that these are much smaller counters . But you can see that money has been trickling in month on month. So, it is not like it has come in and gone out in a flash. It has definitely been adding up positions over probably in a 12-18 months. 


How would you classify some of these top buys? Would you classify them as PSUs or as energy plays? What is going on in NTPC, ONGC, Coal India, IOC?
So largely the PSU names because of that Rs 10,000 crore flow into the CPSE offering in the month of March. But NTPC is actually one of those names. It is not only CPSE money there has also been a fair bit of active management buying coming in largely because we have had some positive news around the regulatory tariffs and they are getting some capacity online. As a stock, the industry has been very positive.


We have been talking a lot on whether auto is going to make a comeback. What is the logic there?
Maruti price has really corrected and it had almost reached Rs 6550 levels. But the position adding is not very large. If you look at other auto names -- Eicher has been sold, Bajaj is being sold, some of the auto ancillaries like Bosch, Motherson Sumi, the tyre companies Apollo, MRF are all seen selling. I think there is a definite pause or trimming of positions in auto. More than trimming, it is actually selling of positions.


Even Maruti has risen consistently from its lows?
We have seen a fair bit of selling on Maruti this month. There is a bit of a flip, but from what we hear on the street, people have not turned extremely gung-ho yet on that counter. There is still fairly large positions and managers hold on Maruti. It is not like we have completely gone out of that but they have been trimming positions.


When you are saying trimming, is it also simply profit booking in Eicher or Motherson or some of the others or would you say that is a bearish tone on auto?
I think it still is a bit of a bearish tone. It is not a one-off that has happened especially on the likes of Eicher which has been under pressure for a while now."
41,2019-04-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: India's coal import increased by 8.8 per cent to 233.56 million tonnes in 2018-19, according to a report.

Coal imports were at 214.61 MT in 2017-18, according to provisional data by mjunction services, based on monitoring of vessels' positions and data received from shipping companies.

mjunction, a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL, is a B2B e-commerce company that also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.

""India's coal and coke imports during 2018-19 through 31 major and non-major ports are estimated to have increased by 8.83 per cent to 233.56 million tonnes (MT) (provisional) as compared to 214.61 MT (revised) imported in 2017-18,"" it said.

Non-coking coal imports were at 164.21 MT in FY2018-19, about 13.25 per cent increase over 144.99 MT recorded in FY2017-18.

Coking coal import was almost flat at 47.73 MT compared to 47.22 MT in 2017-18.

""The double-digit growth in thermal coal imports during 2018-19 was on expected lines and caused by the coal shortage at power plants until recently. In contrast, the bearish trend in steel consumption and prices, especially during the fourth quarter, restricted coking coal import,"" mjunction MD and CEO Vinaya Varma said.

""Thermal coal import is likely to remain subdued in the near term, but may rebound if PLF (plant load factor) in thermal power plants goes up post-monsoon,"" Varma added.

Coal imports during March 2019 were at 19.93 MT (provisional), against 18.02 MT in the corresponding month of 2017-18.

Coal Minister Piyush Goyal had earlier urged state-run Coal India to pledge self-sufficiency in production to eliminate import of the dry fuel.

The government has set a target of 1 billion tonne of coal production by 2019-20 for the mining major, but is considering relaxing the timeline."

Analyst calls 
• IDBI Capital has maintained buy rating on DCB Bank and increased target price to ₹250 from ₹220. DCB Bank’s FY19 guidance given 3 years back on operational efficiency is largely met, said IDBI Capital. Cost-to-income, ROA and ROE is at 53.7%, 1.1% and 13.7% against its guidance of 55%, 1% and 14% respectively, it said. 

• IIFL has maintained buy rating on Coal India with a target price of ₹323. The brokerage has cut FY20-21 EBITDA estimates by 5%, to factor-in the lower e-auction realisations. Coal India faces near-term volume headwinds, given normalised 18-day inventory at power plants with expected seasonal uptick in TPP generation, said IIFL. 

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has retained sell rating on RBL Bank and increased fair value to ₹560 from ₹550. RBL reported another solid quarter with earnings growth of 40% YoY on the back of 40% YoY revenue growth, the brokerage said. 

 • CLSA has retained buy rating on Reliance Industries and raised target price to ₹1,665 from ₹1,500 to included value from broadband, IMO and listed investments. Benefits from petcoke gasification, clarity on ecommerce plans, further asset monetisation and a pick-up in broadband are near-term trigger, said CLSA.

 • Centrum Broking has downgraded CRISIL to add from buy and cut target price to ₹1,600 from ₹1,980. The brokerage sees growth headwinds across the non-ratings businesses, and this, along with little room for cost rationalisation would keep earnings under pressure.

46,2019-04-24,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Power index was down with its components trading mixed in Wednesday's session.

Shares of Adani Transmission (up 2.26 per cent), Adani Power (up 1.37 per cent) and Suzlon Energy (up 0.98 per cent) were the top gainers in the index.

Torrent Power (down 1.59 per cent), Thermax (down 1.14 per cent), Power Grid Corporation of India (down 0.88 per cent) and ABB India (down 0.84 per cent) were trading lower. 

The S&P BSE Power index was trading 0.41 per cent down at 1998.64 around 11:43 am. 

Benchmark NSE Nifty50 index was up 29.60 points at 11,605.55 while the BSE Sensex was up 100.43 points at 38,665.31. 

Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 29 were trading in the green, while 21 were in the red. 

Shares of Reliance Communications, Reliance Power, Indiabulls RE, Suzlon Energy, PC Jeweller, Vodafone Idea, Tata Motors, YES Bank, SAIL, Reliance Capital, Jet Airways, Adani Power, Sterlite Tech, ONGC, JP Associates, IFCI and Coal India were among the most traded shares on the NSE."
45,2019-04-24,Coal India,"Majority of initial share sales, or IPOs, that opened in the past ten years have given negative returns despite a dramatic improvement in market sentiment and one of the biggest bull runs in the history of the Indian stock market this decade.

Data analysed by ET shows that 100 out of 164 IPOs since 2008 are trading below their issue price. Of the remaining stocks that have given positive returns, only 44 companies have given double-digit returns. The benchmark Sensex, on the other hand, has doubled during this period.

Market participants say while IPOs offer some upside to investors post listing, the rally usually fizzles out in most of the scrips. Hence, investors who tend to hold these stocks for a longer period have greater probability of making loss. Further, investment bankers are increasing pitching expensive valuations for the companies due to ample liquidity. This leaves little money on the table for IPO investors.



“Many companies which present a rosy picture of fundamental performance prior to the IPO do not live up to the pre-IPO fundamentals and so tend to underperform post the IPO,” said Ravi Muthukrishnan, head of institutional Research at Elara Capital. “Since most companies fail to live up to the pre-listing price, investing in any IPOs may not be the right strategy. Investors should spend time to understand the present and future prospects of the company and invest only if such companies are reasonably priced,” Muthukrishnan added.

Infrastructure and real estate stocks lead the list of wealth destroyers with companies such as Gammon Infra, Shriram EPC, DB Realty, Reliance Power, Jaypee Infratech losing more than 90% of their share value since the IPO. Most of these companies listed during 2008 — the bull-market prior to Lehman crisis that eventually snowballed into a global recession. There was a strong demand for infrastructure companies before 2008 since the sector was witnessing strong growth amid foreign investment rush into India. However, after the recession the demand shrunk swiftly impacting the profitability of the infra and real estate companies.

The list also comprises some of the prominent share sales that have happened during the 2017-18 bull market. For instance stocks like CL Educate, S Chand, General Insurance Corporation (GIC), Precision Camshafts and ICICI Securities have all lost over half of their value from their IPO issue prices, data showed.

Majority of the public sector undertaking (PSU) IPOs have disappointed investors during the period. Coal India’s shares are still hovering around its issue price even nine years after the IPO. The Coal India IPO was among the biggest capital offering in recent years Similarly, Hindustan Aeronautics, Cochin Shipyard and New India Assurance are all trading below the IPO price.

“Some IPOs may have been priced aggressively, but the share performance also depends on various other parameters including industry outlook, quality of business and management. For example, the real estate and infrastructure sectors have been through a tough phase in the last 10 years, so many smaller companies’ IPOs may not have done as well in these sectors,” said Pratik Gupta, MD, Deutsche Equities India. “In the case of PSU IPOs, there have been many company-specific issues and overall sentiment for PSUs has not been great in a market environment that has favoured growth and quality over value,” said Gupta."
43,2019-04-24,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has handed over Rs 1,131 crore to Life Insurance Corporation of India for managing a recently introduced pension scheme that covers 16,000-odd working and retired executives of the stateowned coal mining firm.

A trust has been created by the company to handle the Coal India Executive Defined Contribution Pension Scheme, 2007, and LIC has been appointed as its fund manager.

The fund remitted to LIC is for 12,388 executives currently on the rolls of Coal India and 3,800 people retired after January 2007, a senior company executive told ET.

The pension scheme was envisaged several years ago, but was implemented only recently mainly due to delay in clearances from the government.

As part of the scheme, Coal India management will contribute 9.84% of basic pay and dearness allowance minus central government’s contribution towards coal mines pension scheme.

The scheme will run with contribution from the management only, but executives can contribute to the fund on a voluntary basis.

This scheme is in addition to the regular pension scheme for Coal India employees which is managed by the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO). However, as CMPFO was facing asset liability mismatch, the government decided to allow an additional scheme for its executive which would be contributed by the company.

Since the scheme was effected this year with retrospective effect from 2007, a lump sum has been remitted to the public sector insurance major who would provide immediate annuity returns to retired executives and create a corpus for executives on roll. They have the option of choosing annuities from an approved list of pension fund managers."

Analyst calls

 • HSBC has maintained buy rating on Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and revised target price to ₹,500 from ₹1,600.

 • IIFL has maintained buy rating on Essel Propack with a target price of ₹160 after Essel Propack's promoters sold 90% of their stake to the Blackstone Group at ₹134 per share. Essel Propack could benefit from Blackstone’s management talent, and systems and processes.

48,2019-04-29,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal import by state government-run power producers in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu last fiscal was 1.4 times higher than in previous year, which some companies said was in part due to quality and logistics related issues in Coal India’s import substitution scheme.

NTPC’s import rose threefold to 960,000 tonnes. Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Andhra Pradesh Power Development Company Ltd, Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation and West Bengal Power Development Corporation imported a total of 6.9 million tonnes of coal in 2018-19 against 2.9 million tonnes in the previous year.

Coal India has promised fuel to power producers under a scheme to meet the shortfall in annual contracted quantity, provided they give an undertaking that coal import has stopped or will not continue. “It is learnt that some of the power plants holding fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with Coal India have not utilised this opportunity and are importing coal.

Therefore, it is requested that these power plants may apply to the marketing division of Coal India for sourcing of domestic coal as substitute of import by road mode from the sources where coal is available with Coal India,” Coal India said in a letter to power producers.

A senior Coal India executive said power producers have agreed.

Coal India has stocks of about 55 million tonnes, which would be used for power producers opting for the scheme. Regular production, targeted at 650 million tonnes this year, would be used for committed supplies to customers. However, if the demand from power sector increases substantially, Coal India may not be able to meet every customers’ requirement under this scheme."

50,2019-04-30,Coal India,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh

Losses by India’s power retailers are set to rise, reversing two years of declines they enjoyed since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government unveiled a plan to make the ailing utilities profitable.

Combined losses by state distributors that signed up for the federal government’s reform plan in the first nine months of the fiscal year rose to about 240 billion rupees ($3.4 billion), a 62 percent jump from a year earlier, amid an increase in coal & power costs, according to Ajay Kumar Bhalla, India’s power secretary.

“We may not have achieved targets, but we feel we have done well,” Bhalla said, pointing to success installing new meters and improving billing and payment collections. “Structural issues have been addressed, and we expect them to yield positive results.”

Full-year earnings by the companies, known as discoms, could improve as most states are scheduled to make subsidy payments during the last quarter of the fiscal year, which ended in March, he said.

As part of Modi’s power industry revival plan, called UDAY, states took over 75 percent of the debt of their distribution utilities to help ease their debt burdens. The discoms were then given operational targets to reduce losses, while the federal government contributed with energy efficiency schemes, such as expanding the use of energy-saving of LED lights and deploying solar irrigation pumps. All but two of India’s 29 states have signed up.

The stalled recovery will sustain discoms as the weakest link in India’s electricity supply chain. Many are saddled with large debts from selling power below cost or from poor billing and collections. The financial mess impedes their efforts to serve low-paying consumers, such as rural homes and farmers, while also stifling their power purchases and ability to make timely payments to electricity generators.


Coal Costs
State-run Coal India Ltd., the country’s biggest supplier of the fuel used for power generation, said average coal prices during the nine month period rose 11.6 percent. Power costs also increased as some generators had to import coal to bridge a domestic supply shortfall. Average spot electricity prices rose 28 percent from a year earlier to 4.08 rupees per kilowatt hour during the nine-month period, data from Indian Energy Exchange show.

The discoms’ inability to pass on such cost increases remains a key hurdle for revival of the electricity distribution sector, according to Debasish Mishra, a partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in Mumbai.

Distributors also continue to lose money on every unit of electricity sales. The UDAY reform plan aimed to eliminate these losses by closing the gap between the cost of power supplied and realized revenues. In the first nine months of the last fiscal year, the difference was 0.34 rupees per kilowatt hour, according to Bhalla. That’s a 21 percent rebound from the same period a year ago.


Power Losses
The industry has shown some improvement on the amount of power that’s lost through theft or poor metering. That share, known officially as aggregate technical and commercial losses, has narrowed to 19.7 percent, Bhalla said. That’s down from 21.4 percent in the same period last year. However, that’s still above the 15 percent target set under the UDAY plan.

The power losses in large electricity consuming states -- including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh -- have increased from levels seen five years ago, according to data from the ministry’s website tracking the progress of the plan. Some states have shown improvement, such as Rajasthan, Haryana and Bihar, but are still lagging targets. On an average, distributors continue to lose revenues on about a fifth of the electricity they provide.

“The plan was a well-designed carrot so many discoms bought into it, but there was no stick,” said Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman of infrastructure services firm Feedback Infrastructure Service. States fell behind in enforcing measures to check thefts, improve billing and collections and root out systemic corruption, he said."
51,2019-04-30,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Gains in HDFC twins and IT stocks helped BSE Sensex stage a 280-point recovery on Tuesday, even as the index closed marginally lower. The 30-stock pack settled 36 points down at 39,032.

NSE barometer Nifty ended the day a tad below the 11,750-mark at 11,748, down 7 points.

A sharp rise in the rupee against the dollar on easing crude oil prices lent support to domestic indices. The domestic unit gained over 30 paise against the greenback to hit intraday high of 69.70. Oil prices hovered around $72 a barrel, off its recent high of $75.

""Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 11,550 to 11,860. Broader market weakness is seen as midcap index trades with a negative bias. We expect this consolidation to continue for a few more sessions before a breakout is witnessed on the higher side,"" said Sahaj Agrawal, Head of Derivatives, Kotak securities.

Stock markets will remain shut on Wednesday on account of Maharashtra Day.

Even though Dalal Street staged late recovery, the advance-decline ratio leaned heavily in the favour of the sellers with 1,789 stocks falling, 725 scrips in the green and 172 unchanged. 


Market at a glance:Shares of YES Bank single-handedly knocked over 126 points off Sensex, as the stock closed at Rs 168, down 29.23 per cent, following poor March quarter numbers. The bank posted a shock loss of Rs 1,507 crore for January-March quarter. This was the worst decline for the stock since its listing in 2005.

IndusInd Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and Power Grid were among other stocks that witnessed sharp declines of up to 5 per cent. 

However, shares of HCL Tech, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank, Infosys and Coal India managed to log gains. 

The recovery that hit Sensex eluded midcap and smallcap stocks. The BSE Midcap index declined 1.16 per cent while the BSE Smallcap fell 1.27 per cent. 

Sectorally, five of 19 stocks ended in the green with consumer durables, IT and Teck ending over 1 per cent higher. 

BSE Telecom and Realty were the worst hit sector, shedding over 2 per cent, each. 


Expert Take
Investors resorted to profit booking, as weak results from banks and auto dragged market sentiment. However, late recovery in IT and metal stocks helped to minimise losses. Global cues were weak due to ongoing FOMC policy meet. The US economic data was mixed with better-than-expected GDP and weak inflation, which may influence policymakers to adopt a wait and watch approach until they have a clearer perspective on job data, inflation and GDP- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services"
0,2019-05-01,Coal India,"Coal India Ltd (CIL) Wednesday said its coal production in April 2019 rose by 1 per cent to 45.29 million tonne as compared with 44.86 million tonne year ago.

Board meetings (Full link)


Analyst calls• Investec Securities has maintained buy rating on Exide Industries and revised target price to ₹295 from ₹270. Exide’s fourth quarter performance is encouraging, especially in the backdrop of subdued OEM production, likely increased participation from unorganised sector and restricted offtake from subdealers due to NBFC liquidity squeeze, said Investec. Resilient performance, coupled with expected margin expansion should help Exide deliver EPS CAGR of 20% over FY19-21, said Investec. 

• Jefferies has initiated coverage on Kajaria Ceramics with a target price of ₹730. Kajaria is the leader in Indian ceramic tiles and has bounced from its September 2018 lows, aided by improving profit, said Jefferies. The brokerage believes that the company is poised to benefit the most from a fillip to organised volumes, courtesy tightening complianceand the recent ban on coal gasifiers in Gujarat, which should shrink the price differential with unbranded players. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on Carborundum Universal and lowered fair value to ₹310 from ₹315. The fourth quarter result suggests challenges on demand, pricing and costing, which are dictated by market forces, the brokerage said. Improved market access in EMD and GST-driven support to operating price in abrasives are key to boosting growth prospects. 

• Nomura has maintained buy rating on Torrent Pharmaceuticals with a target price of ₹2,144. Recent developments related to the USFDA inspection at the company’s Indrad facility and Losartan recall have emerged as areas of concern, said Nomura. If the recent inspection is classified as an Official Action Indicated, it could result in a delay in product approvals, it added.

• IndiaNivesh has retained its sell rating on TVS Motors and reduce their target price from ₹460 to ₹420 as the company disappoint in its March 2019 numbers. The firm had already given a pass to its timeline of achieving its margin guidance of 10% EBITDA. With lower demand growth, rising input cost pressures and higher discounts, the brokerage expect revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGRs over FY19-21of, respectively 11%, 15% and 19%.

2,2019-05-06,Coal India,"Railways minister Piyush Goyal said he would urge the EC to take a fresh look at electoral bonds. In an interview to 
Rakesh Mohan Chaturvedi, he said he was sure the EC, which had opposed the scheme, would find it a very robust mechanism. The senior BJP leader, who also presented the interim budget for 2019-20, said BJP appears to be getting more donations than other political parties only because other parties don’t take all donations through cheques and are opposing electoral bonds brought in by the NDA government. Edited excerpts:


The Congress is making a big promise through Nyay (offering Rs 72,000 a year through Nyuntam Aay Yojana or minimum income scheme). Does the amount of Rs 6,000 that the NDA government is giving not pale in comparison?
A fake promise that has no source of funding has no relevance. You are comparing an apple with a Sheikh Chilli ki kahaani, a bird in hand to something that is never going to be delivered.


In the context of the Modi government’s promise of fight against black money, how do you see electoral funding in this election?
You should ask this to the Congress because they do all sorts of black money financing and they oppose the electoral bonds that we have brought in to clean-up use of black money. Our government has not allowed any donation above Rs 2,000 to be given in cash. At some stage we should make it zero cash donation. Electoral bonds is a very good way to ensure no black money comes in. (BSP chief) Mayawati takes it, NCP’s Sharad Pawar takes it — it is for them to take a call. We don’t take it… It is Congress practice. We have seen this during the Emergency, when those making donations to Jana Sangh faced problems.

Ignorant people who have not studied the proposal are asking questions. SBI does proper KYC (follow know-your-customer norms). The need for electoral bonds arose because — I have been in opposition for several years — people were hesitant to donate.


But the EC has opposed the scheme…
(It’s) some old letter of the EC... when the scheme had just been introduced. I suspect they have not been able to apply their minds on the full scheme two years on. I would urge EC to once again look at the whole experiment after two years of implementation. I am sure they will find it a very robust mechanism.


The donations are heavily skewed in favour of the BJP at present…
You have to look at fresh data. ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) data is old. I would allege that this (difference in donations) is because other parties do not take all donations through cheques. Unfortunately, Mayawati, Congress, Samajwadi Party, Sharad Pawar’s party have looked at black money to fund their elections. We will not allow individual leaders to skim money from electoral funds.


How do you view unemployment in India reaching a 45-year high?
I think you all know the way the world and India has changed. A person may say he has work but not a job with Coal India or NTPC or government. The concept of job over the years has got restricted to very few professions or types of work. Today you have a million people working with Uber and Ola. They are all working but do not have a job. The whole concept has to be relooked. It is a fake data that the CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) has come out with and we completely reject it. We are trying to come up with a robust data mechanism just as we corrected the railway punctuality data. Teams are working on making it more contemporary.


As the BJP in-charge of Tamil Nadu, how do you see NDA’s partners doing in this election vis-a-vis DMK?
We have created the strongest alliance in Tamil Nadu. We are fairly confident that the election results will show a good support for our allies. We have had a challenge from (TTV) Dhinakaran’s party (AMMK) cutting into our votes, but I think the popularity of Narendra Modi and the overall size of the alliance being much larger, we are confident of getting good seats.


Did you find it odd that (Reliance Industries chairman) Mukesh Ambani publicly endorsed Milind Deora (Congress candidate from the Mumbai South constituency?
It only shows “Congress ka haath, ameeron ke saath (Congress support to the rich)” and that it is the BJP that works for the poor, the farmers, the middle class, the marginalised class. I think Rahul Gandhi should comment on whether this is the kind of support base his party is looking for. I did not see any endorsement of the poor people (by the Congress).


How do you see the challenge to the BJP from the opposition alliance in Uttar Pradesh?
Where is the opposition? The unity is all gone. Mayawati is already talking of withdrawing support to the Kamal Nath government in MP. She is day in and day out cursing the Congress and criticising Rahul Gandhi. Of course, they can go and meet snake charmers. But this is about real politics, development. The people of UP and Varanasi have never before seen such law and order and development.


You say BJP will get more seats than it did in 2014. Why, in that case, did the BJP have to give away so many seats to allies such as the JDU and Shiv Sena?
Because we respect our allies. JDU was not our ally in 2014. Now they are our alliance partner and we gave them their fair share, unlike Congress which keeps fighting with its allies. We looked at the JDU’s assembly share. We got an absolute majority in 2014 but did not disrespect our allies.


In the Northeast, will the citizenship bill affect BJP’s chances?
It will have a positive impact. We will sweep."

The country's top dry-fuel miner had allocated 55.17 million tonnes (MT) of coal in FY 2018, according to government data.

However, the coal allocated by the PSU under the scheme in March increased by 10.2 per cent to 4.18 MT, compared to 3.79 MT in the corresponding month of FY 2018, it said.

Coal distribution through e-auction was introduced with a view to provide access to coal for such buyers who are not able to source the dry fuel through the available institutional mechanism, as per the information available on CIL website.

The purpose of e-auction is to provide equal opportunity to purchase coal online through single window service to all intending buyers.

Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output.

The company reported a growth of 7 per cent in coal production to 606.9 million tonnes in 2018-19, a shade below the MoU target of 610 million tonnes with the coal ministry.

13,2019-05-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) plans to ramp up auction offerings by 14% during the current fiscal against the previous year when similar supplies declined 5%. 

It is expected to bring down premiums in the auctions market and offer respite to independent power, cement, sponge iron companies among others that depend on coal available through auction.

“This year CIL has decided to auction 137 million tonnes of coal which would include longterm supply contract auctions, spot e-auctions and forward eauctions,” a senior Coal India executive told ET.

Last year, the dry fuel supplier offered 120 million tonnes through similar auctions which was a 5% drop compared to the previous year (2017-18). Increased offerings this year is expected to bring down premiums that touched 92% in the spot market last year as availability through spot e-auctions had dwindled 38% among other reasons like higher international coal prices and rupee depreciation.

“Cost of imports shot up during the year due to higher international coal prices and rupee depreciation during first half of 2018-19. Higher e-auction prices reflected partial value extraction by domestic producers by managing volumes put to auction. However, premiums over notified prices has come down since then and could remain modest in coming months,” said Kameswara Rao, leader at PWC India.

“Almost 20% of the coal sold would be through various eauctions mechanisms. Last year it was 19.7% while during 2017-18 it was almost 22%,” the CIL executive said. Last year, unforeseen demand from power generators forced Coal India to send them additional coal as the sector was grappling with dwindling inventory and many power plants were stranded with critical coal stocks."

15,2019-05-11,Coal India,"Coal is dirty. Really dirty. There is no getting around that fact.

It is responsible for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. Mining coal wreaks havoc on the environment and on the people who live there. Besides CO2, burning coal produces pollutants like mercury, sulfur dioxide, which is linked to acid rain, and particulate matter, which causes respiratory illnesses.

Tackling climate change is impossible without reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, especially coal. The problem is, coal is cheap and developing economies like India prefer low-cost fuel sources.

Coal is the largest source of electricity in the world. Coal-fired plants generate 72% of India’s electricity. This, combined with the growth of coal-consuming industrial sectors like steel, is why the solid fuel source will continue to be integral to India’s economy in the next couple of decades. This is despite the government’s ambitious plans to increase generation of renewable energy.

According to BP Energy Outlook 2019, coal’s share in India’s primary energy consumption will decline from 56% in 2017 to 48% in 2040. But that is still nearly half of the total energy mix and way ahead of any other source of energy. Oil’s share, the second largest, will decline from 29% to 23%, and the contribution of renewables will rise fivefold to 16%. Even the NITI Aayog, which replaced the Planning Commission, in a 2017 report estimated the share of coal in the energy mix in 2040 to be at least 44%. “There are scenarios where the share of coal can even increase,” says Rahul Tongia, a fellow with Brookings India, a think tank. One such scenario is if India falls well short of its ambitious targets in renewable energy.



India wants to increase its installed renewable energy capacity from 78 GW to 175 GW (1 GW = 1,000 MW) by March 2022. Of that 175 GW, 100 GW is supposed to be solar power. Moreover, India wants to nearly double the share of renewable power in its total installed capacity to 40% by 2030.

However, issues related to land acquisition, funding and policy continue to come in the way of these plans. Experts have said that it was unlikely that India would achieve these targets. Hence, the reliance on coal is not going to go down soon.



India was the world’s second largest producer of coal in 2017, the latest year for which data is available, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The country produced a tenth of the world’s coal, while China topped the list with 45% of global production. India was also the second largest coal importer, with a 16% share. China accounts for nearly half of global coal consumption, with India’s share at 13%.

Electricity generation is responsible for two-thirds of India’s coal consumption, steel and washery industries 7% and cement 1%, according to data from the ministry of coal. While the power sector uses non-coking or thermal coal, steel manufacturers use coking or metallurgical coal in the iron ore smelting process. Non-coking coal is also used by cement manufacturers as an energy source.



Around 87% of India’s proven coal reserves of nearly 150 billion tonnes is noncoking coal. That means India has to turn to imports to meet four-fifths of its coking coal requirements. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, says with India’s coking coal requirement more than tripling to 180 million tonnes (MT) by 2030, our reliance on imports will continue. Indian coking coal is of poorer quality than the imported variety, forcing certain industries to import a better quality of the commodity.

Even a fifth of our thermal coal requirement is imported. Union governmentowned Coal India, the world’s largest coal miner, accounted for 84% of India’s coal production of 675 MT in 2017-18. Coal demand outstrips domestic supply and will continue to do so, though the share of imports is expected to decline, according to rating agency CRISIL. Coal India aims to have an annual production of 1 billion tonnes in five years, a target it was originally expected to meet in 2019-20. This would be a key step to pare down our import dependence. But land acquisition, environmental and forest clearances stand in the way of reaching that milestone.



Questions sent to Coal India went unanswered. Coal-fired plants generated 72% of India’s electricity in 2018-19, according to the Central Electricity Authority. The thermal power sector, which includes coal- and gas-based plants, has had a difficult few years, especially in the private sector.

Lack of assured fuel supply and agreements to sell the power they generate, among other reasons, plunged the sector into a seemingly insurmountable crisis. The Union government last year identified 34 “stressed” coal-based projects with a total capacity of over 40 GW (India’s installed coal-fired capacity is 194 GW). These projects had outstanding loans of Rs 1.7 lakh crore.

Less than half the capacity has power purchase agreements and three-fourths have coal linkages. The government is looking to resolve the issues in the projects to keep the loans from turning bad. It has its task cut out. This mess has made industry wary of the sector as a whole. Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL, says most of the capacity addition in thermal power will be in the public sector.



A spokesperson at state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation, India’s largest thermal power producer, says while coal will remain the mainstay of the power sector for at least a decade, the focus will be on “competitive, environmentally complanit and flexible power generation from coal plants.”

There is an effort to make coal-fired plants more efficient by bringing down the amount of coal required to generate 1 MW and to make old coal-fired plants compliant with environment norms. JSW’s Rao says the company’s requirement of coking coal will not go up in proportion to the increase in steel production capacity due to the use of bigger and more efficient blast furnaces.

Aluminum is another sector that uses coal for its energy needs; 40% of its production cost goes into generating power. Rahul Sharma, CEO of Vedanta’s alumina business, says aluminium manufacturers should ideally be able to meet half their coal needs with captive coal blocks, with the rest being assured through linkages. Currently, the group has just one captive coal block with a capacity of 1.6 MT per annum, while its requirement is 25 MT. The block was awarded to Balco, a subsidiary of Vedanta.



CRISIL expects the plant load factor (PLF) of thermal power plants to increase from 61% in 2017-18 to 72% in 2022-2023 in response to demand for electricity growing at around 6.5% annually. PLF is the actual average power produced as a percentage of the maximum power that could have been generated in that period. India’s per capita electricity demand of 1,150 kilowatt hours is only a third of the global average. India’s peak electricity demand in 2018-19 (up to February) was 177 GW, most of which was met. India’s peak deficit has declined from 12.7% in 2009-10 to 0.8% in 2018-19.

Till battery technologies to store solar power improve and become cost-effective, the country’s peak electricity demand will have to be met by thermal power, especially as the outlook for hydel and nuclear power is not all that rosy. Ashok Khurana, director general of the Association of Power Producers, says if the government has to provide 24X7 power for all, around 25 GW of capacity will have to be added.



One of the key reasons for the woes of the thermal power sector was the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision to cancel 204 coal blocks allocated since 1993, calling the allocations illegal and arbitrary. In 2015, the Union government passed a bill to award these blocks through auctions and allotments. The government has so far awarded 85 coal mines, including 24 captive blocks to the private sector, under the Coal Mines (Special Provision) Act, 2015. But CRISIL’s Prithiani sounds a note of caution: “For private companies that have won mines in auctions, their weak financial position and lack of PPAs is a bigger challenge than environmental issues.” In February 2018, the government decided to end the monopoly of Coal India.

Private companies could now bid for mines not just for their use, but also to sell the coal to others, which only Coal India could do till now. This was the biggest step in freeing up the sector since coal mines were nationalised in the early 1970s.



Though it has been more than a year since the announcement, there has been no auction yet for commercial mining and the terms of the auction are not yet clear. “For commercial mining to work, there should be no cap on prices. If there is a cap, there will be less competition,” says Vinay Prakash Goel, CEO for coal and mining businesses at Adani Enterprises, which operates nine coal blocks given to PSUs under the mining developer and operator model.

A Coal India official, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media, says commercial mining by the private sector will make the miner more competitive. “But we have seen what has happened with mines auctioned to the private sector. Getting things moving on the ground is very difficult.”

Even with its continued reliance on coal, India is expected to meet its commitment made under the Paris Agreement on climate change to cut emissions relative to the GDP by a third by 2030 from 2005 levels. India is the third largest CO2 emitter among countries but per capita, its emissions are only 40% of the global average, according to the IEA.



If the Indian economy is to continue to grow at 7%, the rise in electricity demand from industry and households cannot be met by wishing away coal-fired power, especially not till renewable energy becomes a reliable and affordable alternative to thermal power."

17,2019-05-15,Coal India,"HDFC Securities has given a buy recommendation on Capacite Infraprojects (CIL) with a target price of Rs 351.

Shares of CIL closed at Rs 224.3 on 14 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.


March quarter highlights:



CIL reported Q4FY19 revenue at Rs 500 crore. Ebitda margins were weak at 13.5 per cent as new projects like Piramal Mahalaxmi, MCGM, BSNL, Oberoi (Goregaon) etc. are large size and yet to reach the profit booking threshold.
Order booking continued to be robust with CIL adding Rs 480 crore in Q4FY19 (nearly Rs 3,630 crore in FY19).
Order book stood at Rs 7,180 crore. During the March quarter, two major orders (from Radius – Sumer and Puravankara; nearly Rs 100 crore each) got foreclosed due to project specific challenges.
Gross debt increased Rs 30 crore YoY to Rs 270 crore while net D/E deteriorated marginally. CIL’s NWC increased marginally from 66 to 71-days YoY. 


Investment rationale:

The brokerage believes the recent influx of orders from Raymond, Oberoi, Raheja demonstrates CIL’s growing presence, especially in Mumbai, at a time when developers are emphasizing on timely completion of projects post- RERA. 

""While we appreciate its constant endeavor to expand the non-residential portfolio, we continue to closely monitor its projects for any signs of stress especially among the non marquee clients. We believe the backlog is healthy and have built in 22 per cent revenue CAGR (FY19-21E),"" said the brokerage.

The brokerage has cut its FY20E and FY21E EPS by 8.4 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, to factor in higher competitive intensity in private residential segment as peers chase quality developers to gain new orders."

24,2019-05-16,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Power regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has allowed compensation to GMR Group for running its power plant on imported coal in the event of coal shortage. 

The order issued late on Thursday evening will have significant impact on the power generation industry that is grappling with stressed assets. Power plants will now be able to run their plants on imported coal if Coal India is not able to meet its commitments and claim the extra costs in electricity tariffs. The dispensation was available to power companies till March 2017.

Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said, “We welcome CERC decision of allowing the additional cost of coal to meet the deficit of annual contracted quantity (ACQ) under contract with Coal India, as Change in law. This decision will resolve the issue impacting 15 GW, facing huge cash deficit on this account. CERC has correctly interpreted the shortfall in coal beyond March 2017 under SHAKTI Scheme as 'change in law' under the PPA.”

This order of CERC sets the precedence for all generators who were unable to recover the full costs of coal to be compensated, he said.

Law firm J Sagar Associates, which represented GMR Warora Energy Limited before CERC said this is first such order where compensation for shortfall in coal from Coal India has been allowed for a period beyond March 2017 recognising that shortfall in supply of coal is a continuous cause of action.

On earlier occasions, relief had been limited to 31.03.2017 necessitating generators to again approach regulatory for seeking relief. In some cases, generating companies are yet to receive compensation beyond March 2017 despite Supreme Court having allowed the same by way of its judgment in Energy Watchdog vs CERC in April 2017.

In the order, CERC said, the monthly change in law compensation payment shall be effective immediately. At the end of the year, the power companies shall reconcile the actual payment made towards change in law with the books of accounts duly audited and certified by statutory auditor. The reconciliation statement duly certified by the auditor shall be kept in possession by the petitioner so that same could be produced on demand from discomson in July 2012."

26,2019-05-17,Coal India,"ICICI Prudential Asset Management, the country’s second-largest money manager by assets, was busy all through April lapping up beaten down stocks, when the BSE benchmark Sensex advanced around 1 per cent.

The fund house increased exposure to select stocks such as Vodafone Idea, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Avanti Feeds, Bharat Electronics and NBCC, that have plunged 45-72 per cent since January 2018. 

S Naren, ED and CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The market currently is fairly priced. The strategy in such market condition is to adopt a stock-specific approach. There are several pockets of opportunities across sectors and market capitalisations, where scrips are available at attractive valuations.”

Power, auto ancillaries, metal and telecom looks attractive to Naren.

Vodafone Idea recently concluded a Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, which was oversubscribed nearly 1.08 times. Ace Mutual Fund data base showed ICICI Prudential was holding 46 crore Vodafone Idea shares as of April 30 against 8.77 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house subscribed to the rights issue.



Besides, the fund house bought additional shares of IT majors Infosys (1.30 crore) and Tata Consultancy Services (4 lakh). Infosys last month posted a 10.5 per cent rise in consolidated profit for March quarter at Rs 4,078 crore, and gave a guidance for 7.5-9.5 per cent revenue growth in FY 2019-20. 

TCS reported 17.7 per cent year-on-year growth in March quarter net income at Rs 8,126 crore and Rs 6,904 crore profit. The IT major last Friday once again became India’s most valued firm by market valuation, surpassing Reliance Industries. 

Brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has an ‘accumulate’ rating on Infosys with a price target of Rs 782 and a ‘buy’ call on TCS with a price target of Rs 2,312.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added shares of auto players Eicher Motors (5,484 shares), TVS Motor (13 lakh) and Mahindra & Mahindra (4.15 lakh). Financial majors Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank also manage to draw the fund house. 

In the power sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 2.83 crore shares of NTPC, followed by Power Finance Corporation (40 lakh), REC (36 lakh) and Adani Power (1.34 lakh). Antique Stock Broking has ‘buy’ rating on NTPC with a price target of Rs 161.

“With improvement in commissioning and commercialisation, NTPC should see an uptick in operational performance. Further, capacity addition in the next five years will sustain the momentum. We foresee 5-6 per cent capacity addition CAGR,” the brokerage said.

The fund manager also bought auto ancillary shares like Apollo Tyre, Exide Batteries, Motherson Sumi Systems and Amara Raja Batteries.

“I will be a little contrarian on auto and auto ancillaries at this point. Although lead indicators suggest a bit of consumption slowdown, two-wheelers should start looking better. I would probably be a buyer on dips starting with two-wheelers and also in some of the auto components and auto ancillaries. There has been a reasonable price correction because of the overall slowdown,” Gurmeet Chadha, Co-founder, Complete Circle Consultants, told ETNOW.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 111 companies, and sold in 116 across sectors. The fund house held 552 stocks as of April 30.

Yes Bank, Axis Bank, Rain Industries, Coal India, ONGC, Bharti Airtel, Federal Bank, SBI, ITC, Suzlon Energy, SpiceJet, ICICI Prudential, Wipro, HDFC, Power Grid, Bank of Baroda, Ambuja Cement, Axis Bank and Zee Entertainment were among the stocks the fund house offloaded during the month.

Zee Entertainment shares declined nearly 10 per cent last week amid concerns over stake sale by its promoters.



Total asset under management (AUM) of ICICI Prudential AMC stood at Rs 3.30 lakh crore as of April 30, 2019. It was followed by SBI Funds Management (Rs 2.97 lakh crore) and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC (Rs 2.50 lakh crore) in terms of AUM. HDFC Asset Management stood market leader with total AUM of Rs 3.47 lakh crore."
25,2019-05-17,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Domestic markets kicked off Friday's session on a firm note, tracking positive cues from Asian markets and overnight gains in US stocks. 

Asian shares traded mildly higher as upbeat US economic news and solid company earnings offered a respite from the interminable Sino-US trade saga, Reuters reported. Japan's Nikkei bounced 0.7 per cent in early trade, while the main Australian index added 0.5 per cent. 

In overnight trade US stocks jumped as positive US housing data added to the global optimism. 

Moreover, buying in banking, IT and FMCG stocks propelled markets upwards nearly half a per cent. 

At around 9:30 am, Sensex was trading 193 points or 0.52 per cent higher at 37,587, while its NSE barometer Nifty was up 43 points, 0.39 per cent at 11,300.

""We expect Nifty to resolve out of last four session’s consolidation (11,300–11,100). This would lead to a conclusion of the corrective phase, in turn paving the way to extend ongoing pullback towards 11,500 in coming weeks. In the process, we expect volatility to remain elevated owing to expectations of General Election outcome. However, we do not foresee the Nifty breaching the key support of 11,000 ahead of the election outcome,"" said ICICI Securities in a note.

The markets would keep an eye on stocks such as Dr Reddy’s Labs, Bajaj Auto, IOC, UPL, Bajaj Holdings, Balkrishna Industries, CESC, PI Industries and Zee Learn which will report their March quarter results today. 

In the 30 pack Sensex, 22 stocks were in the green while eight were in the red.

YES Bank was the biggest gainer, jumping nearly 6 per cent amid value buying. The stock suffered hefty losses in the past two trading session. Other gainers were Bajaj Finance (up 2.64 per cent), Coal India (up 1.76 per cent), Hero MotoCorp (up 1.27 per cent), and HDFC (up 1.21 per cent).

On the other hand, Tata Motos was the biggest loser, falling over 1 per cent. Among other losers were -- NTPC (down 0.79 per cent), Infosys (down 0.73 per cent), Tata Steel (down 0.72 per cent), ONGC (down 0.51 per cent) and Vedanta (down 0.28 per cent).

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap traded in line with benchmark Sensex, gaining 0.35 per cent and 0.43 per cent respectively.

BSE sectoral space appeared mixed with BSE realty topping the gainer chart, up 1.07 percent lead by realty heavyweight DLF."
28,2019-05-20,Coal India,"Vedanta had a tough 2018-19. However, as expectations were quite low, the market reacted positively to its fourth quarter results. The company’s year-on-year revenue and net profit growth fell 15% and 43%, respectively. Better-than-expected performance of its domestic zinc, aluminium and steel businesses helped Vedanta shore-up its numbers. Good performance of its international zinc business—Ebitda rose 90% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), due to 32% increase in volumes and lower costs—also stood out in the fourth quarter.

More importantly, the outlook for Vedanta is beginning to look positive, say analysts. Its domestic zinc, aluminium and steel businesses will improve their performance further in 2019-20. This is because cost of coal is expected to come down in 2019-20, mostly because of its increased availability. Capacity of Vedanta’s Chotia mines is expected reach 1 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) from 0.45 MTPA in the fourth quarter of 2018-19.

Coal linkages with Coal India will also increase. The steel plant acquired from Electrosteel has also started reporting healthy performance and its Ebitda in the fourth quarter increased by 37%, q-o-q. This improvement was primarily led by higher volumes and improved operational efficiency. The domestic copper business may also improve once Vedanta is able to reopen the smelter unit in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu.

Its international zinc business is also expected to improve further. Volumes from Gamsberg mine in South Africa are expected to grow 40% in 2019-20. The production from Skorpion mine in Namibia is also expected to go up by 60%. With a flat production, the oil and gas subsidiary was a drag on the company’s consolidated performance. However, there has been some improvement in its output and it is expected to continue for the next 3-4 quarters. Vedanta’s crude is heavy and waxy and used to go at huge discount to the Brent crude. However, this discount has narrowed now due to the fall in global oil production and will benefit. So, Vedanta should get better price realisation in 2019-20.

A 41% fall in stock price compared to 24% fall in the ET Metals Index and a modest gain of 6% in Sensex, is another reason why analysts are getting bullish on Vedanta. However, investors should note that Vedanta’s earnings remain sensitive to the movement in base metal prices, and they may crash further in the short term, if the ongoing trade war between US and China goes out of hand. So only investors who can stay invested for the longterm should enter now.




Selection Methodology

We pick up the stock that has shown maximum increase in “consensus analyst rating” during the last 1 month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (ie 5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks with at least 10 analysts covering it. You can see similar consensus analyst rating changes during the last one week in ETW 50 table."
29,2019-05-21,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Riding on the optimism of exit poll outcomes, which predicted a victory for the BJP-led NDA, Nifty logged fresh highs at the open. Sensex too followed suit and hit an all-time high level of 39,571.73.

The 50-pack index hit a new high of 11,883.55. After Monday's breakneck rally, traders are betting on Nifty surging as much as 3 per cent before the general election results are out on Thursday. Bank Nifty also hit a new record.

However, the market pared its morning gains on the back of profit booking at higher levels. The investors judged the recent strong rally as unwarranted.

Meanwhile, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat in early trade but stayed close to a four-month low touched on Friday. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5 per cent."
31,2019-05-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Riding on the back of gains in financials and bank stocks, flagship equity indices recorded a firm close to an otherwise volatile session ahead of the general elections outcome on Thursday.

Hopes of a second term for the incumbent BJP government, kept market sentiment bullish. However, analysts have been quick to point out that exit poll outcomes must be taken with a pinch of salt, as they have proved to be wrong on many occasions.

Steady FII inflows along with gains in domestic currency lent support to the upbeat mood.

BSE Sensex ended 140 points or 0.36 per cent higher at 39,110 while NSE Nifty settled at 11,738, up 29 points or 0.25 per cent.

However, India VIX spiked 7 per cent to 27.54. The volatility index hit the 30 level during the day for the first time since September 2015.

On the other hand, FMCG, IT, Consumer Goods and Teck were among the worst hit.


Factors that supported the market:


Optimism over BJP's returnWith election outcome due tomorrow, stock market investors turned buyers ahead of the D-Day amid optimism that the BJP led by Narendra Modi government would return to power as reflected in the exit polls.


Rupee edges higher 
The domestic currency edged higher by 10 paise against the dollar amid weakness in the greenback and easing crude oil prices. Strong FIIs inflows also improved sentiments for the rupee. The dometic unit hit an intraday high of 69.62.


Crude prices cools a bit
Oil prices fell on Wednesday after industry data showed an increase in US crude inventories and on demand concerns linked to a protracted trade war between China and the US. However, analysts said oil market remained tight amid supply cuts led by producer group Opec and as political tension escalates in the Middle East. Brent crude futures were down 70 cents at $71.48 a barrel and are set for their biggest daily fall in eleven days.


Expert Take

“We remain structurally positive on the market and expect a positive bias post elections. Any dip or correction is expected to act as a strong buying opportunity. We expect Nifty to test 12,200-12,500 on the higher side, while meaningful support is seen at 11,400.

Of the total imports during April 2019, non-coking coal or thermal coal shipments were at 15.08 MT, according to provisional data by mjunction services.

Imports of coking coal, used in iron and steel making, were 3.52 MT in April while metallurgical coke imports during the month were at 0.22 MT.

Commenting on the import trend, mjunction MD and CEO Vinaya Varma said, ""The flat trend in non-coking coal import in April was in line with expectations, as the power plants continued to have sufficient stock of coal.""

""This scenario may continue in the current month,"" he added.

The Centre had earlier urged state-run Coal India to pledge self-sufficiency in production to eliminate import of thermal coal.

The government has set a target of 1 billion tonne of coal production by 2019-20 for the mining major, but is considering relaxing the timeline."
34,2019-05-26,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Despite strong volatility, domestic equities logged solid gains during the week gone by as a majority verdict for the Narendra Modi-led NDA infused bullish sentiment in the market. 

Analysts said investors, who were staying away from the market due to uncertainty in the runup to the general election, are coming to the market now.

For the week gone by, headline indices Sensex and Nifty jumped 4 per cent.

The coming week may see more volatility due to the expiry of May series futures & options contracts. Analysts are advising investors to go for contrarian bets as the market may now start reacting to macroeconomic numbers, corporate earnings and global cues.

“When corporate or election results are as per market expectations, it is pointless to act on information that is already known to all. Everything has been already discounted for and, therefore, taking a contrarian bet could be far more profitable than going with the consensus,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote.

Let's take a look at that factors that will influence market mood during the coming week:


F&O contracts expire on Thursday
The market may experience bouts of volatility as the May series futures & options contracts expire on Thursday and participants will roll over their positions to the June series. 


Buzz around Cabinet formation

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have remained net buyers in the market, putting in Rs 2,026.33 crore on Friday, NSE data showed. So far in May, FPIs pulled out Rs 2,093 crore, data available with NSDL showed.

36,2019-05-27,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Increased fuel supplies to power plants by Coal India may halve imports to 11 million tonnes this year, the power ministry has estimated. 

Power utilities that blend high energy coal from overseas market with low grade domestic variety, are being urged to substitute the imported part with high quality coal supplied by Coal India. 

In a late evening statement, Coal India said it is urging power generators to buy high grade coal from it's mines instead of sourcing it overseas. 

The dry fuel supplier is offering state gencos of Tamil Nadu, a major coal importers, around 4.5 million tonnes of high energy content fuel from Eastern Coalfields Ltd. 

Actions are also on way for granting more long term supply contact through auctions. CIL is also making efforts to boost supplies to the power sector to reduce their dependence on imports for meeting increased generation demand. 

Projected requirement of ministry of power for domestic coal based power plants for 2019-20 is 651 million tonnes. CIL’s share is 530 million tonnes. With CIL ensuring its share of coal supply at 530 million tonnes, the power ministry estimates import in 2019-20 to come down to around 11 million tonnes in 2019-20 from 21 million tonnes during 2018-19."
37,2019-05-28,Coal India,"New Delhi: The government has readied a scheme to auction power purchase agreements (PPAs) with attached coal supplies from Coal India. The auction of short-term PPAs with coal supplies is expected to help some of the about 10GW power plants idling due to lack of fuel and power contracts.

A senior government official said the auction framework has been prepared with likely allocation of about 12 million tonnes in annual commitment from Coal India Ltd (CIL). “In the proposed auction scheme, the bidders will be informed about the availability of coal supply from the various CIL subsidiaries and mines. Tariff-based competitive bids will be invited from companies based on these inputs,"" he said.

The official said bids will be invited for 2,500-MW power supply capacity for three years. The proposal is third in a row of such schemes auctioning power purchase agreements. However, the previous two rounds did not have attached coal supplies.

The power ministry kicked off the scheme to salvage stressed assets idling due to lack of PPA opportunities.

In April last year, the government launched a pilot round of the scheme where 1900-MW of stressed power capacity was tied up to states at a price of 4.24 per unit. Seven plants won the power contracts in the pilot round. These include RKM Powergen, Jhabua Power Ltd, MB Power Ltd, SKS Power, Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd, IL&FS Energy and JP Nigrie.

The second round of bidding was concluded in April last year with power plants quoting a higher tariff of 4.41per kWh. The auctions were on reverse e-bid format under which the power producers have to lower tariffs in the online auctions. The tariffs were linked to inflation, unlike in the last round under which they were fixed for three years.

Fifteen power plants of companies like JSW Energy, Jaiprakash Associates, Jindal Power, Sembcorp Gayatri and Essar Power bid for the agreements with states. NHPC, the PPA aggregator for the second round, is in talks with states to purchase power from qualified bidders, the official said. Sources said Jindal Power bid for supplying the highest quantity of 515-mw from its two plants in Chhattisgarh at 4.41 per unit. Adani Power’s Korba West plant has bid for 295-MW while JSW Energy has committed 290-MW."
38,2019-05-28,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO) has invited portfolio managers to handle its investible corpus, estimated at Rs 1.06 lakh crore, the commission for which is expected to be at least Rs 100 crore annually.

It is one of the largest funds of its kind and the money belongs to coal workers. CMPFO is the custodian of this fund. Consultancy firm Brickwork India was recently appointed to guide the organisation through the selection process.

“To ensure optimum returns on the corpus through investment in securities, CMPFO has decided to select portfolio managers to manage its investible funds. This fund, under Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme 1948, Coal Mines Pension Scheme 1998, Coal Mines Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme 1976 and Coal Mines Administrative Charges Fund, will be allocated to selected portfolio managers for investment management,” said Animesh Bharti, commissioner, CMPFO.

Bharti said, “Selected set of fund managers will also get to reinvest and manage the returns from this corpus which is around Rs 6,000 crore annually.

Commission for managing it will be around 0.001%. However, given the size of the corpus, which will be growing annually, its commission is likely to be substantial.” Provident fund and pension fund of coal workers are deposited with the CMPFO, which pays out pensions to coal workers.

According to CMPFO’s website, employees of Coal India and its subsidiaries, Singareni Collieries, mining division of DVC, coal mining workers of Sail, Jindal Steel & Power, Jindal Power, Usha Coal Mine, Jayaswal Neco Industries, Monnet Ispat & Energy and Sarda Energy & Minerals are covered by the organisation."
44,2019-05-28,Coal India,"Kolkata: Analysis firm Care Ratings expects coal production to grow between 6% and 7% and imports to grow between 8% and 10% during 2019-20.

“Coal production would improve on account of miners focusing on surface mining of coal instead of underground mining which would also help them in containing costs and improve productivity. Imports of both steam and coking coal are expected to grow during the year as demand from power sector as well as power intensive industries like cement and metals is expected to sustain during the year,” Care Ratings said in a research report.

Domestic coal production grew by 7.3% to 739.4 million tonne during FY19 versus 2.6% in FY18. Coal imports stood at 240.2 million tonnes and grew at a sharper pace of 12.9% in FY19 versus 8.9% recorded in FY18. Higher coal imports was triggered by shortage in domestic coal supply to captive and non-power coal consumers like cement, metals and other power intensive industries. Coal imports continued to grow at a healthy pace during the year. Power and manufacturing industries like cement and metals were major importers of thermal coal. Cement production clocked a multi-year high of 13.3% volume growth in FY19.

Steam coal which is used by both captive and non-captive thermal power plants grew by 14.4% during April-Feb 2019 vs 6.2% in the corresponding period of the previous year. Coking coal which is key raw material for manufacturing steel is imported due to limited availability of good quality coking coal in India. Coking coal imports grew by 12.3% during April-Feb 2019 vs 10.8% in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Overall coal offtake from the state-run miners continued to be higher than the annual production for the second year in a row. Offtake in FY18 was 2.5% more than production and in FY19 it is was marginally higher (0.7%). State miners like Coal India and Singareni Collieries continued to account for nearly 91% of the coal produced in the country. Rest of the coal is produced by captive coal mines of power plants.

Dispatch to power sector has grown at 7% in FY19 versus 6.4% in FY18. The supply of coal to thermal power plants in the country has improved in FY19 vs FY18 but supply-chain constraints persist.

E-auctions continued to fall which in turn was substituted by imported coal by power intensive industries like steel, cement, chemicals etc. Spot E-auctions recorded the highest drop of 38.7% during FY19 and e-auction for the power sector too dropped by 6.2%. E-auction for non-power consumers increased marginally to 2.7%.

Global coal prices have declined during H2FY19 after having peaking in the first half of the financial year. A host of factors including global decline in coal-power projects and increase in production of coal in China- which is the largest coal consumer globally has led to steady decline in coal prices across key coal producing markets. The fall in global coal prices augurs well for the power sector as well as other power intensive industries like cement."

50,2019-05-30,Coal India,"Coal India will offer 60-70 million tonnes (MT) of coal in spot and forward auction markets this year. Despite being a little lower than last year’s offerings, premiums on auctions are expected to remain soft as the company has decided to increase contracted supplies and international coal prices have started to soften.

The dry fuel supplier has also decided to offer an additional 70-80 MT of long-term supply contracts through auctions to the non-power sector. This may additionally help soften demand in the auction market and reduce pressure on spot auctions, bringing down premiums.

Last year, the company auctioned 76.42 MT through the spot and forward auctions. It included 49.28 MT through spot auctions and another 27.14 MT through the forward auction market. During the year, premiums fetched by Coal India on spot auctions were as high as 92% on an average, while premiums fetched for forward e-auctions for the power sector were 72% on an average.

“Cost of imports shot up during last year due to higher coal prices and rupee depreciation during first half of 2018-19,” said Kameswara Rao, leader at PWC India.

“Higher e-auction prices reflected partial value extraction by domestic producers by managing volumes put to auction. However, premiums over notified prices have come down since then and could remain modest in coming months.”

International coal prices have fallen 17% to 20% since September last year. According to the World Bank, Australian coal declined from $117 per tonne during the July-September quarter last year to $95.7 per tonne during the January-March 2019 quarter. South African coal fell from $102.2 per tonne to $84.8 per tonne during the same period. The fall is expected to reflect on domestic auction premiums.

Coal India’s total sales target has been set at 660 MT, of which 530 MT would go to the power sector. If achieved, this would be an 8.6% growth in contracted coal supplies to the power sector. According to the power ministry, power generation growth from conventional sources is expected to nearly double at 6.5% during the current fiscal year. This, analysts said, is likely to help soften power prices and substitute imports and reduce demand for auctions.

“More domestic coal availability for the power sector is certainly a positive for independent power producers, as it alleviates concerns on account of cost pressures for plants in case of dependence of costlier sources of imported coal,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head at ratings firm ICRA.

“Further, entities with shortterm power purchase agreements will also be in position to secure domestic coal supply as it has been recently allowed by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.”

CIL has decided to offer an additional 70-80 MT of long-term supply contracts via auctions to non-power sector."
51,2019-05-30,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India reported a 3.6 times and 1.48 times rise in profit after tax during the quarter and the year ended March 31, 2019 respectively, on the back of improved realisation from coal sales, lesser outgo on account of employee benefit and improved operational cost control.

The world’s largest coal producer’s total income crossed Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time since inception 44 years ago. Total income for the year was Rs 1,05,420 crore against Rs 91,625 crore in the previous corresponding period. Gross sales for the year was Rs1,40,603 crores while net sales was Rs 92,896.08 crore for the year.

The company recorded a Rs 6,024.23 crore profit after tax for the January-March 2019 quarter, while PAT for 2018-19 was Rs 17,462.18 crore.

“Better average realization in both contracted sales and e-auction sales coupled with operational cost control propelled the company to its best ever financial performance. Coal quality variance was under control and we have been able to arrest the grade slippage to large extent,” the executive said.

“During 2017-18, Coal India had to spend almost Rs 5,000 crore on account on increased outgo for gratuity. Salaries for workers and executives were also raised during the same year. During 2018-19, we did not witness any such rise in expenses on account of employee benefits resulting in steep increase in profits,” the executive said."

52,2019-05-31,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Strong volume growth, supported by higher prices, helped Coal India register multiple quarterly records — production, profits and sales — in the three months to March.

Net revenue climbed 7.5 per cent on-year to Rs 28,546 crore. Net profit was Rs 6,024 crore against Rs 1,303 crore in the previous March quarter.

Net profit in the year-ago period was dented by a one-time wage-related expense. Still, the performance beat estimates.


Operating profit or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was Rs 8,212 crore against expectations of Rs 7,200 crore. EBIDTA margin was at 28.8 per cent Analysts remain bullish due to stable power demand and thermalpower capacity addition, which should increase sales of the solid fuel. Strong performance, positive demand outlook and history of strong dividend payments make Coal India an attractive bet.

At the current price of Rs 253, its stock is trading at more than 8 per cent expected dividend yield. In the last five years, Coal India has already paid Rs 114 per share as dividend. The stock is trading at 9 times earnings.

“Coal demand, in our view, should continue to grow at 7 per cent for the next 2-3 years. Given stable power demand growth, coupled with new plant additions, we envisage strong off-take growth for Coal India from FY19 to FY21,” said a report by JM Financial.

In FY19, Coal India produced 607 million tonnes, a 7 per cent growth on year. Its production has risen at 6 per cent CAGR for the past three years. In the March quarter, production volumes grew 6 per cent and offtake 3 per cent. However, higher realisation helped register a growth of 7.5 per cent.

Realisations were higher for both fuel supply agreement and e-auction sales.

“Better average realisation in both FSA and e-auction sales coupled with operational cost control propelled the company to its best ever financial performance. Importantly, coal quality variance was under control and we have been able to arrest grade slippage to a large extent,” the company said in a statement.

E-auction, where the company enjoys more than 100 per cent premium over FSA sales, accounted for 12 per cent of total volumes.

In April, Coal India registered a production growth of 1 per cent and offtake growth of 2.6 per cent. Analysts expect the realisation to remain strong, suggesting another steady quarter for the largest coal producer in the world."
53,2019-05-31,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were trading 9 points, or 0.08 per cent, higher at 11,985, indicating a flat start for the Nifty50. Here are a few stocks which may buzz the most in today’s trade:

56,2019-05-31,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Coal India jumped over 4 per cent to Rs 263.30 in Friday's session, buoyed by its strong performance during the March quarter of FY19.

On Thursday, the company reported 3.6 times and 1.48 times rise in profit after tax for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2019, respectively, on the back of improved realisation from coal sales, lesser outgo on account of employee benefit and improved operational cost control. 

The world’s largest coal producer’s total income crossed Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time since its inception 44 years ago. Total income for the year was Rs 1,05,420 crore against Rs 91,625 crore in the previous corresponding period. Gross sales for the year was Rs 1,40,603 crores while net sales was Rs 92,896.08 crore for the year. 

The numbers were lauded by the Street, with brokerages showing faith in the stock.

CLSA has maintained a buy recommendation on Coal India and hiked the target price to Rs 290 from Rs 275. However, the brokerage highlighted that the company's earnings outlook looks muted and it sees a flattish earnings per share (EPS) over FY19-21. 

Citi also retained its buy recommendation on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 320 from Rs 300, underscoring that the company offers an attractive dividend yield. The financial firm said it values Coal India at a premium given its resource base and limited exposure to the global volatility.

Motilal Oswal Securities has also maintained a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 307.

""We raise our adjusted PAT estimate by nearly 1 per cent to Rs 18,010 crore for FY20 and 4 per cent to Rs 19,200 crore for FY21, given higher FSA realization and lower CoP. The stock trades attractively at nearly 4 times FY20E EV/adjusted Ebitda (against a historical average of 7 times), P/E of nearly 8 times (against average of nearly 14 times) and offers a dividend yield of nearly 7-8 per cent. We value the stock on 5 times FY20E EV/Ebitda at Rs 307,"" said the brokerage. 

The shares of the company closed 0.18 per cent higher at Rs 253.35 on BSE."
58,2019-05-31,Coal India,"Yes Securities has given a buy recommendation on Coal India with a target price of Rs 302.

Shares of Coal India traded at Rs 254.95 around 1:10 pm on 31 May, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price.

Coal India reported strong earnings growth led by improvement in FSA realisations and increase in year end incentives. Revenue of Rs 28,500 crore was quite higher than street estimate of Rs 27,500 crore, the brokerage said. 

FSA realisation during the quarter increased 6.8 per cent QoQ to Rs 1,425 per tonne against an expectation of marginal increase. 

E-auction prices declined 3.3 per cent QoQ led by improvement in domestic coal availability and a decline in global coal prices. 

Production and sales volume during the quarter were higher by 6 per cent and 2.9 per cent YoY, respectively. Ebidta per tonne stood at Rs 502 per tonne, higher by 15.3 per cent QoQ and was also above street estimates. 

Costs per ton was increased by 6.1 per cent QOQ to Rs 1,244 per tonne largely due to an increase in employee costs and overburden removal charges. 

Volumes growth picked up in Q4 FY19 led by improvement in rake availability and the government’s focus on improving power plant inventory. 

As per the brokerage, with inventory levels at power plants improving, sales to non-power producers and e-auction improved in Q4 and is expected to improve further in Q1. 

""Valuations appear attractive at 5.2 times FY21 EV/Ebidta. Recommend Buy with target price of Rs 302. E-auction volumes during the quarter remained weak YoY as the company has been mandated to give preference to power producers over non-power players,"" said the brokerage."

BOARD MEETINGS
 


ANALYST CALLS
 • Citi has a sell rating on Glenmark Pharmaceuticals with a target price of ₹615. Notwithstanding the recent weakness in the stock, Citi said it is looking for signs of meaningful traction in the US business to turn constructive — as this is key for margin improvement as well as cash generation and meaningful reduction in debt. 

 • IIFL has an add rating on Bharat Electronics with a target price of ₹149. While gross margins are likely to moderate in FY20/21 due to sales mix, benign employee expenses and other fixed overheads will help operating profit margins sustain at 20-21% levels, with 13-15% sales growth, said IIFL.

 • Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained add rating on Ujjivan Financial Services with a target price of ₹375. The brokerage believes that FY20 should start seeing normalisation of the cost-income ratio, a key concern. The valuations are inexpensive with gradual recovery in return on equity towards normalised levels and addressing the issue on listing of the bank should aid valuation expansion from current levels, the brokerage said. 

 • IDBI Capital Markets has maintained buy rating on Nava Bharat Ventures and trimmed target price to ₹125 from ₹127. The company’s EBITDA in the March quarter was lower than estimated due to weaker-than-expected profitability in the power segment, said IDBI Capital Markets. The stock trades at an attractive valuation, the brokerage added. 

 • CLSA has maintained buy rating on J Kumar Infraprojects with a target price of ₹315. The key message from J Kumar Infra’s fourth quarter result was its pick-up in new orders despite election-led, slow-down fears and robust execution, said CLSA. The brokerage expects J Kumar’s EPS to see an 18% CAGR over FY19-FY22 and highlighted that the stock looks cheap at 4.6 times FY20 estimated EPS.

Edelweiss Alternative Research"
2,2019-06-04,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India recorded a 44% rise in 2018-19 e-auction prices, up from 20% a year ago, thanks to a spurt in demand and higher international rates.

In 2018-19, the state-run miner got premiums of 58-92% in forward and spot markets over the notified price and the average price per tonne of coal hit Rs 2,653 from Rs 1,841. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, the average realisation was up 30% to Rs 2,754 a tonne from the year-ago period.

Jayanta Roy, head of corporate sector ratings at ICRA, said spot e-auction volume fell because Coal India had to meet its obligations to long-term customers having fuel-supply agreements.

Coal India had 76.42 million tonnes of coal, or 12.56% of its total sales, at auctions in 2018-19. The offer was 20% less from the previous year.

Niladri Bhattacharjee, partner – mining and metals at KPMG in India, said premiums rose because of lower supply. He said increased capacity utilisation of thermal plants contributed to higher supplies to customers. “The second and perhaps more important factor was the experience of early FY18 when many power plants were running on critical stocks. Due to higher dispatch against supply contracts, very few power plants today have critically low stocks compared to the situation last year,” he said.

Coal India’s average price from coal sold through fuel supply agreements rose 8.45% to Rs 1,348 per tonne during the year. For the March quarter, it was Rs 1,460 per tonne — a 4.06% rise over the previous corresponding period.

This year, Coal India will offer 60-70 million tonnes in spot and forward auctions. This is a little lower than last year, but premiums are expected to remain soft as the company has decided to increase contracted supplies and international coal prices have started to soften.

It has also decided to offer an additional 70-80 million tonnes of long-term supply contracts through auctions to the non-power sector. This may additionally help soften demand in the auction market and reduce pressure on spot auctions, bringing down premiums."
1,2019-06-04,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Stress faced by coal-based power projects in India has eased significantly with an increase in electricity demand, improved coal availability and government initiatives, experts said. However, delayed payments by distribution companies continue to pose challenges to power producers.

With continuity of RK Singh as the minister for power and renewable energy, the industry hopes faster implementation of many pending proposals from the last government, including a payment security mechanism for private power producers as recommended by a cabinet secretary-led committee. Of the 40 GW capacity from 34 coal-based power that had been identified under the ‘stressed assets’ category by the government, about 16 GW are yet to be resolved while the remaining projects are able to fully or partly meet their debt obligations, Association of Power Producers director-generator Ashok Khurana said.

Low coal supply, weak power demand, delay in payments by discoms and financial and regulatory issues have been identified as the problem areas for power producers. The provision for allotting coal to plants having power purchase agreements (PPAs) and clarity over the payment to power companies for additional cost to meet shortage in committed supplies from Coal India have helped stem underrecoveries, alleviating the stress, Khurana said. “However, the delayed payment problem with receivables of around Rs 40,000 crore is negating all the steps taken by the central government.”

A senior NTPC official said the demand for electricity was constantly increasing with many states asking for allocation of power surrendered by other states. The state-run power producer has received requests from Telangana, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh seeking about 1400 MW of electricity surrendered by other states.

Of the 40 GW identified stressed assets, 24 GW are commissioned capacity while 16 GW are underconstruction projects. As much as 22 GW did not have PPAs and 11GW did not have coal.




The government’s coal supply auction scheme, Shakti in May 2017, had helped ease the stress in five plants of 8,490 MW. Then in April last year, PPAs for 1900 MW were won by power plants in the pilot round of auction. Results of the second round of PPA auction concluded in April this year are yet to be finalised.

Other measures to reduce logistics costs and clarity on passthrough of government duties and levies in tariffs have also helped a few projects. Power regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s recent order to allow passthrough of the costs of imported coal in case of supply shortages from Coal India is also likely to help ease the stress in the sector.

Low spot power prices despite good demand due to warm weather and elections indicate better coal availability. Last year, power prices in September and October had peaked to Rs 18 per unit as coal stocks plummeted at power stations. Currently, prices at power exchange are averaging at Rs 2.7 per unit with a minimum price at Rs 1.10. Khurana said: “We are very happy that there is continuity in power sector leadership. We are sure that the sector will be back to a sustainable growth path.”

While taking charge of the power and renewable energy ministries on Friday, RK Singh said the government’s next agenda would be 24×7 power supply. Priority would also be given to bring change in the sector with respect to international commitments and environment.

The previous NDA government had started deliberating on a mechanism for fast recovery of outstanding dues from discoms. Revival of 24,000 MW of gas-based stressed power plants idling or underutilised due to lack of gas and auction of aggregated power pacts with coal supply are expected to be on priority basis for NDA II as well."
3,2019-06-04,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Sensex and Nifty took a breather on Tuesday after scaling record high levels in the previous session as investors took profits off the table ahead of a market holiday. When markets open on Thursday, market participants will keep an eye on the RBI policy decision.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) at the second bimonthly policy review of this financial year.

Stocks, bonds, currency and commodities markets will remain closed on Wednesday on account of Eid al-Fitr.

For the day, BSE barometer Sensex fell 184 points or 0.46 per cent to 40,084. Its NSE counterpart Nifty settled at 12,022, down 67 points or 0.55 per cent. 

Technology stocks came forth as the biggest drags.


Markets at a glance:
In the Sensex kitty of stocks, 13 ended in the green and 17 in the red. Hero MotoCorp, HCL Technologies, TCS, Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Auto were among the top drags.

YES Bank, NTPC, Vedanta, Axis Bank and Coal India were among the main leaders.

The minnows too succumbed to profit taking, but still fared better than benchmark Sensex. BSE Midcap ended 0.22 per cent lower and BSE Smallcap 0.19 per cent.

Sectorally, teck and IT were the worst hit, shedding over 1.50 per cent each. Only six of 19 sectors on BSE ended in the green. Capital Goods index was the top gainer, followed by telecom but the gains were less than 1 per cent.


Factors that weighed on the market:


Global tensions persistStock markets remained under pressure on Tuesday as worries about a clampdown on the world's internet and social media giants compounded mounting global trade and recession jitters. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended down 0.3 per cent. China's blue-chip CSI300 dropped 0.9 per cent and the Hang Seng lost 0.66 per cent in Hong Kong.


Tech stocks under pressureTech stocks were the worst performers all across the globe and India was no exception. 

Not only did IT and teck were the worst losers on BSE sectoral space, but top IT stocks like TCS and Infosys dragged the benchmark indices lower. Reports the US government was gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google misused their market power, sent tech stocks falling across the globe.


Expert Take:
Intensified trade tensions and prediction of further delay of the onset of monsoon pushed investors to book profit. However, expectation of further cut in interest rate by RBI, falling oil prices and higher spending will improve earnings outlook. The sentiment remain buoyant despite premium valuation since FIIs are pumping liquidity to India as a chosen long-term equity in the emerging market in this ongoing uncertainty in the global market.- Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial ServicesTrade remained choppy and market closed at intraday low level with the loss of 0.5% as investors booked profits across the counters. IT, media and pharma remained on the selling radar. Meanwhile selling in the broader indices remained capped. For the next session, market participants will keep a close eye on RBI monetary policy verdict as well as its commentary on liquidity scenarioRajnath Yadav, Senior Research Analyst, Choice Broking"

9,2019-06-08,Coal India,"Domestic equity investors took money off the table for the week ended June 7, sending benchmark equity indices down for the first time in four weeks. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty kicked off the truncated week on a positive note after Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched Rs 1 lakh crore in May 2019 as compared to Rs 94,016 crore in the year-ago period.

Markets participants ignored CSO data which showed that economic growth slowed to a 5-year low of 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, pushing India behind China, due to a poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

However, sentiments got dampened after a private weather forecaster Skymet Weather said the pre-monsoon rainfall in the country was the second lowest in 65 years. Also, lack of a comment from RBI on the on-going NBFC crisis overshadowed the 25 bps rate cut and change in stance.

However, some buying on Friday capped the downside.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Markets started the holiday trimmed week on a positive note. The momentum was triggered by weakness in crude oil prices and hopes of RBI cutting rates in the bi-monthly policy. But the momentum was short-lived and markets traded lower after RBI cut repo rates by 25 bps and changed stance to accommodative from neutral that came mostly in expected lines. No further comments by RBI regarding the on-going NBFC funding crisis was taken as a surprise by the market that added to the negativity.”

As a result, the BSE Sensex closed 98.30 points, or 0.25 per cent down at 39,615.90 on June 7 against 39714.20 on May 31. Likewise, the NSE Nifty index closed 52.15 points, or 0.44 per cent, lower at 11,870.65.

10,2019-06-09,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Coal India will hire merchant bankers to carry out financial due diligence for acquiring equity stakes in identified mines and companies in Australia as part of its plan to meet the growing dry fuel demand in the country. The state-run miner has identified coal assets in Australia for acquiring equity stakes along with offtake rights in an asset or a company, Coal India said in a notice inviting proposals from investment bankers. 

 ""CIL intends to avail the services of internationally reputed merchant banker/investment banker to carry out financial due diligence and render transaction advisory services with respect acquisition of stakes along with offtake rights in a coal asset in Australia held by a company for the purpose for arriving at an enterprise valuation of the company and framing of a non-binding Offer initially and followed by a final and binding offer,"" the world's largest coal miner said. 

 ""A tender is being floated for engagement of merchant banker/ investment banker for assisting CIL in acquiring coal assets in Australia,"" it said. 

 Coal India looks to acquire assets abroad as it expects that domestic production would not be sufficient to meet coking coal and high-grade fuel demand from various sectors. The demand-supply gap in India is high due to enhanced requirements from various sectors, including power and steel. 

 To meet the projected gap between demand and supply, while the efforts are on to enhance coal production from the indigenous sources, it will not be possible to bridge the entire gap of demand of coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal. 

 ""In light of the above background Coal India Ltd...intends to set up coking coal and/or high-grade low ash thermal coal mining business overseas with a view to acquire coal resources, produce coal and import the produces to India by way of either opening new mines or equity participation in working mines on production sharing Participation Interest basis,"" Coal India said. 

 Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output. 

 The state-run miner produced around 607 million tonnes of coal in 2018-19 against the target of 610 million tonnes (MT). 

 Coal supplies to the consuming sectors rose by 4.8 per cent to touch a new high at 608 MTs in 2018-19 but lower than the target of 610 MT. 

 India's coal import increased by 8.8 per cent to 233.56 million tonnes in 2018-19, according to a report. Non-coking coal imports were at 164.21 MT in 2018-19, about 13.25 per cent increase over 144.99 MT recorded in 2017-18. Coking coal import was almost flat at 47.73 MT last fiscal compared to 47.22 MT in 2017-18. 

 Coal India is targeting more than 8 per cent growth in production at 660 million tonnes in 2019-20."

14,2019-06-11,Coal India,"Top domestic fund houses took note of the political stability post-election results and lapped up shares in many perceptibly contrarian bets in May, hoping for a recovery in the battered sectors such as telecom, power, pharma and metals.

Select auto ancillary and bank stocks also attracted institutional money during month. 

Total assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry stood at Rs 25.43 lakh crore at the end of May, up from Rs 25.27 lakh crore in April end. 

“As the new government came in with a thumping majority, this along with other positive factors such as low inflation, reasonable balance of payments and good forex reserve will continue to increase inflows,” said NS Venkatesh, Chief Executive Officer at Amfi.

The same optimism is visible also in the way top fund houses bought and sold shares all through the past month.


HDFC Mutual Fund India’s largest money manager held Rs 1.51 lakh crore in equities, with maximum allocations to financials, utilities and industries. 

The fund house added 3 crore shares of government-owned capital goods firm BHEL in a clear bet on public sector capex. Its other top picks included Federal Bank (1 crore shares), Bank of Baroda (94 lakh), DCB Bank (86 lakh) and Power Finance Corporation (70 lakh) – a play on banking revival.

The fund house also added over 10 lakh shares of BPCL, Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Karur Vysya Bank, Hindalco, Lupin and Adani Power. 

Meanwhile, it sold over 1 crore shares each in public sector firms NPTC, SBI and PowerGrid and between 40-90 lakh shares of Orient Cement, HSIL, Petronet LNG, Ambuja Cement, NBCC and ICICI Bank.

The fund house completely exited Havells, ICICI Bank, South Indian Bank and Vodafone Idea.


ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund With equity assets in excess of Rs 1.32 lakh crore as of May 31, the fund house wagered on a potential telecom revival, buying 6.12 crore shares of Vodafone Idea and 3.90 crore of Bharti Airtel.

The two telecom operators introduced a ‘minimum recharge’ regimes last month, weeding out low-paying users and increasing average revenue per users (Arpu) in early signs of return of pricing power.

The fund house also bought shares of NTPC (1.52 crore), Motherson Sumi (1.36 crore), Hindalco (87 lakh), HDFC Life (68 lakh), Union Bank (61 lakh), Neyveli Lignite (46 lakh) and Infosys (44 lakh). 

It sold over 75 lakh shares each in public sector companies Coal India, SBI and ONGC.

CIO S Naren told ETMarkets.com last month said he is positive on power, metals, auto ancillaries and telecom. 

He said there is an opportunity to own healthy power franchises, which are pricing in the worries of the sector more than adequately. In the auto ancillary space, valuations have corrected amid concerns over global growth, trade wars and change in emission norms.

He said telecom as the sector is at the bottom of the cycle, while valuations in the metals space look reasonable owing to uncertainties around US-China trade wars and slowdown in China. From a counter-cyclical viewpoint, the sector seems to be at the start of an upward move after a long period of poor returns, he said.


SBI Funds Management The fund house had about Rs 1.62 lakh crore invested in about 318 stocks. It also gambled on telecom, buying over 1 crore shares each in Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The find house’s other top picks of May included Motherson Sumi (88.77 lakh shares), SBI (78 lakh), Bank of Baroda (78 lakh), ICICI Bank (47.99 lakh) and Tata Power (43 lakh).

The fund house offloaded over 25 lakh shares each in Exide Industries, M&M Financial Services, Havells India, ITD Cementation, Voltas, Redington and Muthoot Finance.


Aditya Birla Sun Life AMCThe fund house had about Rs 87,300 crore invested in 376 stocks as of May 31, 2019. During the month, it added 22 lakh shares of SpiceJet for the first time.

CEAT, Canara Bank, IIFL Securities, IIFL Wealth Management, Indian Bank, Oriental Bank and Tata Elxsi were some of the other stocks on its May shopping list.

The fund house completely exited DHFL, J Kumar Infraproject, JTEKT India, Mindtree, Reliance Infra, Sonata Software and Syndicate Bank.

With the addition of between 50-85 lakh shares, IDFC First, Sun Pharma, Bank of Baroda, DishTV and Bharti Airtel were among its top buys during the month. It offloaded over 20 lakh shares each in SBI Life, PNB, Hindalco, Tata Motors, MRPL and Vodafone. 


Reliance Nippon Life AMCGujarat Alkalies, Somany Ceramics, Tata Elxsi and Time Technoplast were among some of the new additions to the portfolio of this AMC in May.

It exited Adani Enterprises, CPCL, IFCI, Jain Irrigation, NIIT Technologies and Ujjivan Financial.

The fund house added nearly 1 crore shares of Ashok Leyland and 97 lakh of ICICI Bank and 50-72 lakh shares in Bharti Airtel, SAIL and Tata Global Beverages.

However, it sold over 1 crore shares each in Coal India, IndianOil, ONGC and NTPC.

“We are a bit more value-centric but a lot of the stuff are bottoms-up. We like to include corporate banks, which are a bit of a consensus now, but broadly where you have a mix of two businesses, the retail and corporate, the retail business obviously is doing fine and for the corporate business, the pain is getting over. We think in the next two-three years, earnings will normalise. On normalised earnings two or three years down the line, large banks look quite cheap,” Manish Gunwani, CIO-Equity, Reliance Mutual Fund, told ETNOW."
15,2019-06-12,Coal India,"Mumbai: At a time when most multinationals and some startups are offering substantive paternity leave to employees, major Indian companies are yet to proactively embrace this progressive HR policy. 

Under the law, though, organisations are not required to provide paternity leave. Among the home-grown private companies that do not offer paternity leave are India’s biggest private-sector employer TCS, tobacco-to-hotels giant ITC, FMCG player Emami, ICICI Bank and L&T. 

The $44-billion Aditya Birla Group recently introduced the benefit for its male employees. Paternity leave is a concept pioneered by Western companies, and tech firms have been at the forefront in providing the most generous paid leaves to new fathers. Paternity leave helps in attracting talent and is seen as an incentive for sharing child-rearing duties between the two parents, enabling women to get back to work after availing the requisite maternity leave.


Agencies

Some HR heads of private companies argue that it is not necessary to have separate such leave. According to them, a generous privilege leave could double up as paternity leave. Others feel that companies rooted in age-old traditions are slow to adopt new-age HR policies. 

TCS said it has a comprehensive leave policy specific to every country, catering to the local needs of its people, including compliance with local laws. TCS, which has 4.24 lakh employees in 46 countries, has the bulk of them based in India. The IT services major added that it has an agile policy development process as “we continuously evolve the policies based on the ever-changing requirements”. 

The $13-billion JSW Group said it offers paternity leave, but it is part of the privilege leave. ICICI Bank didn’t respond to TOI’s mail.

At Indian private sector companies, which do offer paternity leave, it’s generally restricted to 7-10 days. On the other hand, the Indian arms of foreign companies offer paternity leave ranging from a few weeks to months. Deutsche Bank India offers “parental leave” of 26 weeks to the primary caregiver, irrespective of the gender. Zomato, which had sacked 300 people in 2015, recently announced a 26-week paternity leave — similar to the mandated maternity leave in the country. 

Two years ago, there was a proposal to introduce the Paternity Benefit Bill, under which new fathers working in the private sector would get at least 15 days of paternity leave that could be extended to three months. Government provisions allow public sector units to offer 15 days of paternity leave. PSU majors like LIC, ONGC and Coal India offer paternity leave. 

Even though there is no legislation on paternity leave, the Delhi high court in the case of Chander Mohan Jain versus N K Bagrodia Public School had ruled that private sector male teachers are entitled to paternity leave. The law, however, mandates companies to provide 26 weeks or six months of maternity leave."
16,2019-06-13,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Seven fund management firms have shown interest in managing the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation’s Rs 1.06 lakh crore investible corpus, the commission for which is expected to be at least Rs 100 crore annually.

Investment management arms of HSBC, ICICI, HDFC, UTI and State Bank of India, along with Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and Centrum Wealth Management, recently attended a pre-bid meeting for managing the fund, and more are expected to participate, CMPFO commissioner Animesh Bharti told ET.

“Selected set of fund managers will also get to reinvest and manage the returns from this corpus, which is around Rs 6000 crore annually,” said Bharti. “Commission for managing it will be around 0.001%, however, given the size of the corpus, which will be growing annually. Its commission is likely to be substantial.”

Provident fund and pension fund of coal workers are deposited with the CMPFO, which pays them pensions. Employees of Coal India and its subsidiary Singareni Collieries, coal mining divisions of DVC, coal mining workers of Sail, Jindal Steel & Power, Jindal Power, Usha Coal Mine, Jayaswal Neco Industries, Monnet Ispat & Energy and Sarda Energy & Minerals are covered by the CMPFO.

Consultancy Brickwork India was recently appointed to guide the organisation through the selection process.

The CMPFO decided to appoint portfolio managers to ensure good returns. This fund will be allocated under the Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme 1948, Coal Mines Pension Scheme 1998, Coal Mines Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme 1976 and Coal Mines Administrative Charges Fund to selected portfolio managers for investment management, said a senior executive, who did not wish to be identified.

The fund manager will have to invest the funds either with the State Bank of India or with scheduled banks approved by the Centre from time to time. A portion of the money can also be invested in select set of securities allowed by the Indian Trusts Act, 1882.

At the end of March this year, investible funds administered by the CMPFO amounted to Rs 1,06,000 crore, including Rs 16,500 crore from the Special Deposit Scheme, 1975. Till March 31, the fund was being managed by fund management arms of SBI (PMS Division), ICICI Securities Primary Dealership and Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (formerly Reliance Capital Asset Management).

Fund managers used to be appointed for three years, which expired on March 31. Until fund managers are selected through a tender, the existing ones will continue. However, it has now been decided to hand over the fund to selected portfolio managers for five years.

“Brickwork, along with the CMPFO, recently prepared the tender documents for selecting fund managers for the corpus,” said Bharti. “Tender documents were sent to Coal India as well as the coal ministry for a final look. Having received their green signal to CMPFO, we recently started the process of appointing fund managers.”"
17,2019-06-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty registered muted opening on Friday, in continuation of Thursday's trend, amid elevated crude oil prices and weak rupee.

Subdued Asian peers offered no relief. Asian stocks were down as investors awaited key Chinese data to get more clarity on how the US-Sino trade war is weighing on the economy. 

Oil prices retreated slightly but still were in the green, supported by supply concerns after attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

Brent crude was trading 0.73 per cent up at $61.76 per barrel at around 9.05 am (IST).

The rupee on Friday opened 6 paise down at 69.57 against the US dollar following a rise in crude oil prices in the international markets.

Around 9:30 am, the BSE Sensex was 0.19 per cent down at 39,668 while the NSE Nifty was 0.24 per cent down at 11,886.

BSE Midcap index was 0.49 per cent down while the smallcap index was 0.22 per cent down around that time.

18,2019-06-14,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-run Coal India has decided to offer 21.5% additional coal this fiscal to power generators through forward e-auctions, while it will reduce offerings in the spot auction market from 2018-19 level by almost 4%.

A senior executive at the coal behemoth said the company will offer 33 million tonnes of coal through forward e-auctions in 2019-20 compared with 27.14 million tonnes in 2018-19. About the same quantity will be offered through the spot auctions market during the year compared with 34.34 million tonnes in 2018-19.

For the non-power sector, Coal India will offer about 64 million tonnes of additional coal for long-term supply contracts through an auction mechanism, the executive said, adding that the rest of the coal, estimated at about 530 million tonnes, will go to power producers with long-term supply contracts.

Successful bidders in the forward auctions will have the option of lifting their allotted quantities in portions over at least two years, offering power houses a secured source of coal for the period. While only power houses are eligible to participate in forward e-auctions, the spot auction market will be open to all.

According to a special forward auction calendar for 2019-20 prepared by Coal India, the highest quantity of 8.5 million tonnes will be offered by Coal India subsidiary South Eastern Coalfields, followed by Mahanadi Coalfields at 8 million tonnes. Northern Coalfields plans to offer about 5 million tonnes while Central Coalfields will be offering 3.85 million tonnes. Western Coalfields plans to offer 2.9 million tonnes.

In September this year, Coal India plans to offer 6.3 million tonnes of coal– the highest in any month during the year.

Spot and forward auctions offer Coal India better realisation on the coal it sells. In 2018-19, it managed to command premiums that were 92% more than the notified prices of coal in the spot auction market, since it sold 38% less coal than the previous corresponding period. Premiums were 72% more than the notified price in the special forward auction market for power during 2018-19. Prices at exclusive e-auctions for the non-power sector were on an average 58% higher than their notified rates.

Analysts attributed the reason for rising premiums last year to reduced auction supplies, increased demand, higher international prices for coal, and depreciation in the rupee.

Kameswara Rao, leader-energy, coal and mining, at PWC India, had earlier told ET that cost of imports shot up in 2018-19 due to higher coal prices and rupee depreciation in the first half of 2018-19. Higher e-auction prices reflected partial value extraction by domestic producers by managing volumes put to auction. However, premiums over notified prices have come down since then, and could remain modest in the coming months, he had said."
19,2019-06-16,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government will push central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) to either merge subsidiaries or list them. A senior government official said this may be kickstarted by coal sector behemoth Coal India (CIL) which has eight subsidiaries, of which five are profit-making.

“Unless there is a strategic need, either because the subsidiary is working in a different geography or is required for reasons of regulations or avoiding potential risks, the subsidiary should either be merged or listed,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.

CIL has a mine planning subsidiary, besides eight others.



“All companies should unlock the value from their subsidiaries,” said the official. Another govt official said CIL, through its administrative ministry, had resisted a similar proposal last year. “CIL believes all of its subsidiaries are strategic, and it flagged risks such as labour issues,” said the official. He said the government may be able to push some CPSEs to merge or close their loss-making subsidiaries, he said.

As per the latest data there are around 120 subsidiaries of 169 CPSEs and most of them are loss-making enterprises.

Some experts say the move may benefit all companies, including government-owned. “Listing will help raise resources for the holding firm, find better valuation for the subsidiary and also fetch better dividends to the government,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Concor.

“There could be a possibility that the government may identify subsidiaries as non-core assets, leaving little room for CPSEs to either merge or list,” said Shorawala."

24,2019-06-19,Coal India,"Edelweiss Securities has given a 'hold' recommendation on Coal India with a target price of Rs 263.

Shares of Coal India traded at Rs 257.4 around 12:15 pm on 19 June, 2019. The brokerage has set a one-year horizon for the stock to hit the target price. 

""In light of the flat YTD May production growth, we believe achieving 8.9 per cent year-on-year (YoY) production growth could be challenging as four of seven subsidiaries, including the biggest SECL, are lagging and evacuation infrastructure in key subsidiaries—SECL, MCL and CCL (contributing nearly 70 per cent of incremental production)—is still ramping up,"" said the brokerage. 

Further, the target of 1btpa production has also been delayed by another two years to FY25. In our view, completion of evacuation infrastructure and sustained production growth at MCL and SECL are key for CIL to achieve the same.

The brokerage thinks CIL is still likely to report earnings per share (EPS) of Rs 26-27 over the next two years as cost of production is expected to remain stable at Rs 1,225-1,250 on average and due to nearly 120mt import substitution potential. 

Despite capex commitment of Rs 100-150bn each for the next two years, the brokerage believes dividend yield of 5 per cent is feasible.

""While we believe FY20 volume growth of 8.9 per cent is challenging, CIL will benefit from stable realisation as demand uptick in power and non-power sectors is expected to stay firm,"" said the brokerage.

With adequate balance sheet strength to fund capex and maintain dividend yield of 5 per cent over the next two years, we believe risk-reward is balanced. We maintain ‘hold/SP’ with a target price of Rs 263 per share. The stock is currently trading at 9.7 times FY21E EPS, the brokerage added."
25,2019-06-20,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Benchmark indices got off to a quiet start Thursday morning but soon recovered losses as the US Fed's rate cut signal sent a dollar and the US bond yields falling and equities bounced globally. 

A gauge of global stock markets edged near this year's peak. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.5 per cent. 

However, an over 1 per cent rise in crude oil prices remained a concern. Brent crude futures rose 82 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $62.64 as official data showed US crude stocks fell more than expected and as OPEC and other producers finally agreed a date for a meeting to discuss output cuts.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 97 crore worth of domestic stocks on Wednesday, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs sold stocks worth Rs 105 crore.

At around 9:40, the BSE Sensex was up 50 points or 0.15 per cent higher at 39,170. Meanwhile, NSE Nifty was at 11,703, up 12 points or 0.10 per cent at around the same time. 



The expiry of weekly options could infuse volatility in today's trade. The options data show an unclear picture as highest Put open interest was at the 11,700 strike while Nifty ended on Wednesday a few points below it, said Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services.

Jet Airways shares continued to be in pain and slipped 17 per cent in the opening trade.

In the 30-pack Sensex, 10 stocks gained while 20 fell. Coal India was the biggest gainer, up 0.64 per cent as the management expressed confidence on its FY20 production target of 660mt. Kotak Bank, RIL, ONGC, Bharti Airtel were among other gainers rising over half a per cent.

On the other hand, Yes bank declined the most, down 2.47 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, TCS, Asian Paints, Tata Motors and Maruti. All of these stocks were down 2 per cent each.

BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap dropped 0.31 per cent and 0.71 per cent respectively.

29,2019-06-23,Coal India,"Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has for the last 15 months refused to recognise its majority shareholder ONGC as its promoter but the government has now for all practical purposes started giving the company its due recognition.

Government headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17 called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL, a move seen as a stamp of approval for ONGC being the parent of HPCL, sources in know of the development said.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. HPCL thereafter became its subsidiary but HPCL management has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

In regulatory filings for five consecutive quarters, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 per cent"" shareholding of the company.

Sources said the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director and that would in a way end all the wrangling over the promoter issue.

HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28 and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.

For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake, a PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.

The Department of Personnel guidelines state that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding Company is invited to assist the Board.""

Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance). HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana, who till now used to sit on the interview panels to select directors of the company, was not called.

They said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.

Coal India Ltd is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited.

Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it get full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price sensitive information.

ONGC, which had to borrow Rs 24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, first raised the issue of being formally recognised as a promoter of HPCL in August last year.

When the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.

ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.

According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).

HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana has retained the title of CMD despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.

ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board."
30,2019-06-24,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is looking for minority stakes in operational coking coal mines in Russia, Canada and Australia.

Based on its experience it may gradually increase stakes, following which it may buy them out, and then look for new blocks in these countries, a senior Coal India executive said.

The company has renewed its effort to acquire foreign coking coal assets as the fuel is getting unpopular in many countries, which can help the Indian company get a good price. Large banks in these countries have backed out from financing coal mines and thermal power plants. Many bankers have stayed away from such deals. Coal India wants to grab this opportunity by using internal accruals to finance such acquisitions.

A delegation of senior executives including Coal India Chairman A K Jha met Russian deputy prime minister Yury Trutnev in Russia last week. This will be followed by a team of Coal India executives examining proposals of acquisition, the executive said.

For Australia, Coal India has already floated a tender for appointing merchant bankers to scout for assets and advice the company in acquiring stakes. After merchant bankers are appointed the company will finalise the assets, in which Coal India may buy a minority stake to begin with. Many bankers such as Goldman Sachs and Merill Lynch stayed away from the tender as the asset is considered dirty but ANZ, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan and some others have shown interest.

Coal India’s past experience in acquiring foreign assets is not a happy one. It had acquired a exploratory block in Mozambique in August 2009. It gave away the block as preliminary exploration showed that the block did not have good quality reserves."

35,2019-06-27,Coal India,"There is a stark divergence between Nifty constituents on both performance and valuations with one segment trading at a substantial premium and the other at a huge discount to the long-term average, said domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, adding that there is limited headroom for valuation re-rating at index level given the continued downside risks.

Some of the stocks where valuations are at a substantial discount to long period average are Eicher Motors, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coal India and ONGC, said the brokerage.

Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, Titan Company, Asian Paints, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever and UltraTech Cement are trading at a substantial premium to their respective five or ten-year average price-to-earnings or price-tobook multiples, said Motilal Oswal.

Predicting the timing of fortune reversal for these names is always fraught with risks, more so in the current underlying economic scenario, the brokerage said.

“This polarisation on performance and valuations clearly underscores two things: one, investors taking continued refuge in the quality/earnings predictability theme in an environment of economic slowdown and two, there is a lack of pick-up in broader market’s earnings growth,” said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage said that the revival in Nifty earnings in FY20 is predicated on normalisation of credit costs in the banking sector. The banking, financial services and insurance space is expected to account for 70% of incremental earnings for the Nifty in FY20, the brokerage said.

“At 19.5x FY20E P/E, we do not see material room for further valuation re-rate,” said Motilal Oswal.

ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Titan, L&T, Coal India, Infosys, Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki India are top large-cap ideas of Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage’s mid-cap picks include Federal Bank, DCB Bank, Indian Hotels, Crompton Consumer, KEC International, Ashoka Buildcon, Aditya Birla Fashion and Zensar."

38,2019-06-27,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Thermal plants with a capacity of 37,700 MW are left with coal stocks enough to generate power for barely 1-5 days because of higher demand for electricity.

These power stations are not being regarded as plants with “critical” stocks because Coal India has supplied almost their full quota. There are a few plants which have received more than their contracted quantity for the period.

Plants are marked critical when Coal India or the railways have issues in sending coal to these plants. They receive special attention from the government, which tries to send additional quantities to these plants to replenish stock positions.

According to fuel supply agreements, a set of plants are to receive at least 90% of their annual contracted quantity and the rest would receive 75% of the contracted quantity. Almost all plants with low stocks have received between 63% and 124% of their annual contracted quantities.

Data compiled by the National Load Despatch Centre shows demand for power has risen 6-7% this year and is hovering around 170 Gw each day of this month. During June, supplies from wind power generators declined around 15% against May this year, while supplies from solar and hydel increased 52% and 5% respectively, requiring coal-fired power generators to increase supplies by 9% during the month, prompting them to use up stocks.

Rajesh K Mediratta, director of business development at Indian Energy Exchange, said power offered at the Exchange in the evening peak and night hours was less than the demand, which raises prices. Currently, average prices during evening peak are around Rs 5.24 per unit while those for night supplies are around Rs 4.40 per unit. For rest of the day, supply exceeds demand, which has bought down average price to Rs 4 per unit. Average price during May this year was Rs 3.34 per unit.

He said power demand is rising due to increased consumption by urban and rural households. Urban residences are using more electricity to run air conditioners while those in rural India have started using gadgets."

40,2019-06-30,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Supply of coal to the power sector by state-owned CIL declined by 2.6 per cent to 80.9 million tonnes in the first two months of the ongoing fiscal, government data showed.

This comes amid coal imports rising 12.9 per cent to 235.2 million tonnes (MT) in FY'19 over 208.2 MT imported in FY'18.

The country's top dry-fuel miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) had supplied 83.1 MT of coal in April-May period of FY'18, according to government data.

In May, coal dispatch by CIL dropped 4.9 per cent to 40.6 million tonnes from 42.7 MT in May 2017-18.

Coal supply by SCCL also dropped by 2 per cent to 9.4 MT in April-May 2018-19, from 9.6 MT supplied in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

The Centre had earlier said that no power plant was facing fuel shortages, adding that none of the thermal power plants have reported any loss of generation due to supply constraints.

5,2019-07-03,Coal India,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court slapped a Rs 100 crore fine on the Meghalaya government, for failing in its constitutional obligation to provide the citizenry with clean air and water, and allowing illegal mining to pollute rivers and air. The court, however, allowed mining to resume.

The National Green Tribunal had on January 4 banned rat-hole mining Meghalaya, after a flooding in a mine led to several deaths, bringing all mining to a virtual halt in the state. On Wednesday, a bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and KM Joseph allowed mining to resume as per leases.

The court also said that the tribal people who owned the land would also own the minerals therein. They would be entitled under the law to sign leases allowing others to extract the minerals and the state government would give consent to this, it said. In case of coal, the Centre’s prior permission will be required. The court said mining in the state cannot go beyond the law in the rest of the country.

The Mining and Minerals Act and the Mineral Concessions Act will also be applicable in the state, it said. It cited an earlier Kerala ruling to argue that the process of granting a lease in case of an individual would be different from that of land owned by the state.

A mining lease would be mandatory for mining, it said. Rat-hole mining or traditional mining mostly involved private owners mining their own lands without any leases or proper safety measures.

As a result, accidents were frequent, but no compensation was forthcoming for the victims.

The court ordered the state to deposit the penalty amount of Rs 100 crore with the Central Pollution Control Board. It will be utilised to restore the affected rivers and help improve the air quality in the state.

The NGT had earlier directed setting up of a green fund, which has now crossed Rs 433 crore.

The top court did not agree with the NGT ruling that the ownership of all illegally extracted minerals so far would automatically vest with the government.

Instead, the court directed that these be disposed of by Coal India and shared by all parties— the state which deserves royalty and the landowners."

6,2019-07-04,Coal India,"By Vrishti Beniwal and Ronojoy Mazumdar
Narendra Modi has his first chance since a decisive election win to spur an economy that’s quickly lost its status as the world’s fastest-growing major one.

Newly appointed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to boost spending and provide tax relief to consumers in her maiden budget on Friday. That will probably widen the budget gap to 3.5% of gross domestic product in the year started April 1 from 3.4% targeted in February’s interim spending plan, according to a Bloomberg News survey.


Growth slowed to a five-year low of 5.8% in the first three months of 2019 -- well below China’s 6.4% expansion -- putting pressure on Modi to deliver on a stimulus plan to kickstart consumption, a bedrock of the economy. With the global outlook turning gloomy amid heightened trade tensions, and the Reserve Bank of India already cutting interest rates three times this year, the focus is shifting to the government to play its part.


Bloomberg
“For the next budget exercise, the development goal might supersede the rigid objective of fiscal austerity,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India in Mumbai. “Sticking to a particular fiscal number is not that important in the current scenario.”

Sitharaman will need to balance allowing the budget deficit to widen without risking a credit-rating downgrade and rattling bond markets. Key to that will be finding additional revenue to finance higher spending and keeping borrowing under control.


Here are other key things to watch for in the budget:


TaxesRevenue from consumption taxes and customs levies undershot targets last year, and Sitharaman will need to find additional resources to fund welfare programs without increasing the tax burden on individuals. She’s expected to give consumers relief by increasing the personal income tax threshold for some individuals in the budget, according to people familiar with the matter.


Bloomberg
Analysts at Kotak Mahindra Bank led by Suvodeep Rakshit estimate that tax revenue will probably be 1.4 trillion rupees ($20 billion) lower than was forecast in the interim budget. “This will be the most significant threat to the fiscal math,” the analysts said in a note.


Asset Sales
The government may sell stakes in state-run companies to help boost revenue. Last year it raised 850 billion rupees from selling assets such as Coal India Ltd. and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Expect the disinvestment target to be pegged at 1 trillion rupees, higher than the 900 billion rupees penciled-in in the interim budget, according to Yes Bank analysts led by Shubhada Rao.


Bloomberg

Shadow BanksThe market will look for any mention of measures by Sitharaman to tide over a crisis in the financial sector, especially shadow lenders. A liquidity crunch faced by non-banking finance companies was a major drag on growth, as it curbed their ability to lend, which in turned crimped consumption. As India’s shadow banks have the biggest exposure to the real estate sector, any measure to lower tax rate on property transactions could benefit the sector, said SBI’s Ghosh.


Excess ReservesThe government is seeking to extract higher dividends from the RBI to help boost its revenue and finance the deficit, and the budget may give a provisional figure on how much will be transferred for the remainder of the fiscal year. The central bank gives dividends to the state every year and made an interim payout of 280 billion rupees in February. The government has been pushing for the RBI to boost its contribution, with Finance Ministry officials estimating the central bank has surplus capital of 3.6 trillion rupees. A panel led by former central bank Governor Bimal Jalan was set up to study the RBI’s capital framework, and is yet to finalize its report.


Bloomberg Expenditure
One of the key election pledges of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party was to spend $1.44 trillion to build roads, railways and other infrastructure in the next five years. Sitharaman is expected to outline details of this plan as well as investment in agriculture and other sectors that can be drivers of growth. Markets will also be looking for how much capital the government will inject into state-owned banks after a massive 1.06 trillion rupees plan last year.

“Now that elections are over and the country has given an unambiguous verdict, this budget should take some hard decisions towards initiating a host of structural reforms that would trigger off corporate investment,” said Partha Ray, a professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata."
14,2019-07-05,Coal India,"Railway Minister Piyush Goyal Friday asserted that the national transporter has no plans to sell government assets and people will not lose jobs due to corporatisation, allaying fears among its production unit workers that the factories will be given to private parties.

The minister rather showed confidence in the railways manufacturing units, which have produced state-of-the-art coaches like in Train 18 and are in the process of making Train 20, by indicating that the railways will invest in creating metro coaches and stock.

""We are not selling off government assets. Everybody's jobs will be protected. Like we have IRCON, RITES - they are all corporatised government companies,"" he told PTI in an interview amidst disquiet in its production units about the railways proposal to hive them off as one corporate entity.

In fact, the allocation for rolling stock has increased from Rs 3,724.93 crore in 2018-2019 to Rs 6,114.82 crore in 2019-2020. It was announced in the interim budget prepared by Goyal in February this year. Goyal held the finance portfolio at that time.

This will include investment for state-of-the-art coaches, train sets and even metro coaches.

""Our role will be more in creating metro coaches and metro stock,"" Goyal told PTI.

As of now, only the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai produces such coaches for the Kolkata Metro.

The term 'rolling stock' in rail transport refers to any vehicle that moves on tracks. It includes coaches, wagons and train sets.

Railways has got a budgetary allocation of Rs 65,837 crore and the highest ever outlay for capital expenditure amounting to Rs 1.60 lakh crore in the Union Budget 2019-20.

Presenting the Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said railway infrastructure would need an investment of Rs 50 lakh crore between 2018 and 2030.

Goyal said the Rs 50 lakh core investment mentioned by the finance minister will be needed to modernise stations and build passenger amenities.

""We have drawn up the whole programme. Some of the old projects like 100 per cent electrification, advanced signalling and station development were already there. Now, we have to work out how to create additional capacities so that our modal share of freight can go up, cost of logistics come down and our passengers along with good amenities get more avenues to travel by trains to reach their preferred destination,"" he said.

""All this will entail more doubling, tripling, new dedicated freight corridors, some semi high speed freight corridors, very large gamut of investments in different sectors, regional connectivity and connectivity to aspirational districts. We have worked this out both through government expenditure and public-private partnership,"" Goyal added.

Sitharaman in her address had said given the capital expenditure outlays of railways at around Rs 1.5 to Rs 1.6 lakh crore per annum, completing all sanctioned projects will take decades. She proposed to use public-private partnership to unleash faster development and completion of tracks, rolling stock manufacturing and delivery of passenger freight services.

Goyal said the country should have an open mind about such investments, adding if there were viable projects that could generate additional revenue, he was open to them.

""Wherever there are opportunities and viability of attracting more investments and better services for the passengers, we will keep an open mind. The passengers have a right to better services,"" he said.

""If there are economically viable projects and people are willing to invest in them, why not? For example, if Coal India opened a new mine and they need a railway line and a siding, why should railways invest in it? Coal India need it to move their coal, so they can invest in it. We can co-invest in them. Whenever there are opportunities which are viable we should have an open mind,"" he said.

The railways minister also said increase in diesel prices would not affect the national transporter as it was moving swiftly towards electrification of all its routes.

""We are moving so rapidly on electrification that I do not see any significant impact. Railways is carrying almost half of its freight and passengers on electrified routes now. The speed of electrification is so fast that in the next three or four years, we will not have any need for diesel. So, I am not worried,"" he said.

Railways has set a target of electrifying 7,000 route kilometers in 2019-20."
10,2019-07-05,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her maiden Budget speech on Friday urged Sebi to consider increasing the minimum public shareholding in listed firms to 35 per cent from 25 per cent.

If the Sebi goes ahead with the proposal, shares of many MNCs and companies with high promoter shareholding could see some negative action.

At present, there are over 1,400 listed companies where promoters have over 65 per cent stake, as of latest regulatory disclosures.

“Proposal to increase minimum public shareholding from 25 per cent to 35 per cent is a potential negative for MNCs and companies with high promoter holding,” said Sanjeev Hota of Sharekhan.

There are 14 MNC constituents of the Nifty MNC index, Hindustan Unilever included, which may need to pare 2-10 per cent stake sale if the proposal is implemented. 3M India, ABB India , Glaxosmithkline Pharmaceuticals, Honeywell Automation India, Siemens, Whirlpool Of India and Kansai Nerolac Paints may need to pare stakes by 10 per cent each. If these 14 MNCs were to cut their stakes to 65 per cent today, the share sale may be worth over Rs 39,000 crore. 


Amar Ambani of YES Securities said 
many MNCs listed on Indian bourses may consider delisting, if increase public shareholding is implemented.

In case of many midcap and smallcap stocks it was better to have more promoter skin in the game since India's capital market is in a developing phase, Ambani said.

Vinay Pandit, Head - Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh Securities said: ""One may expect the float of several more companies to increase in the next 2 years, leading to several INs and OUTs of the Nifty, which is currently based on Free Float methodology. A lot of MNCs, Insurance companies and Consumer companies like DMart will stay in focus because of it. The Index will become more BFSI and Consumption heavy unless sectoral caps are brought in. This will also offer greater float in the market for institutional participation.""

A study by KRChoksey Research suggests 167 companies in the BSE 500 have 35 per cent or less public share holdings. These companies have a comined m-cap of Rs 41.31 lakh crore. Diluting stake in these companies to meet the proposal would require dilution of Rs 3.69 lakh crore, it said. 

 The brokerage said that if the proposal is implemented it will result in higher LTCG tax. 

""Fine print of the budget should be read the credit taken under LTCG and also the timeline to bring it down. Overall it should result in selling of stocks. Watch out the richly valued MNC stocks, whose valuations may come under check if they have to part with their holdings,"" KRChoksey Research said.

Among the Nifty50 companies, five companies, Wipro (73.90 per cent), TCS (72.10 per cent), Coal India (71 per cent) and Hindustan Unilever (67.2 per cent) and Bharti Airtel (67.1 per cent) have promoter holding in excess of 65 per cent as of March 31. Rough estimates suggest that if these firms were to meet the 35 per cent public shareholding, they may need to sell shares worth Rs 1 lakh crore. 


On the other hand, there are 40 PSUs with public holding lower than 35 per cent. Of them 28 still needs to pare down promoter stake to meet earlier guidelines. 

Last year, the government extended the timeline for PSUs to maintain minimum shareholding norm of 25 per cent to August 2020. They were earlier allowed to have a minimum public holding of 10 per cent. 

Sebi had earlier in 2013 set a deadline for all listed companies to adhere to minimum shareholding norms. It was later decided the PSUs should also maintain a minimum public shareholding of 25 per cent in line with private companies.

""For bringing better public ownership of the PSUs and also bring greater commercial and market orientation of the listed PSUs, the Government will take all necessary steps to meet public shareholding norms of 25 per cent for all listed PSUs and raise the foreign shareholding limits to maximum permissible sector limits for all PSU companies which are part of Emerging Market Index,"" Sitharaman said."

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. are among at least 100 Indian companies that may need to sell shares worth billions of dollars after the government proposed to raise the minimum public shareholding.

Companies must increase shares held by the public to a minimum 35% from 25% at present, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her maiden budget, asking the market regulator to “mull” the proposal.

The rule may result in equity sales of about Rs 3.9 lakh crore ($57 billion), creating a supply overhang on the market that’s trading near a life-time high, according to analysts including Centrum Broking Pvt. The proposal may have another side-effect: it could prompt domestic units of multinationals, who don’t rely on local funding, to delist from exchanges.

“The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,” said Rajiv Singh, who heads broking at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “This will mostly impact multinationals and state companies, but in the long term, it will help get more retail money in equities.” There are at least 40 state companies with public holding lower than 35%, he said.


Adequate Liquidity
This isn’t the first time the government has forced founders to reduce their holdings to boost liquidity. In June 2010, the regulator gave companies three years to a ensure a minimum public float of at least 25%. That spurred share sales of at least $1 billion in June 2013 alone from companies including property developer DLF Ltd. and JSW Energy Ltd.

Exchanges globally have also introduced free-float rules to ensure liquidity for investors in a publicly traded stock. And index compilers such as MSCI Inc. take into account the percentage of shares available to investors when determining a stock’s representation in stock gauges.

Here’s a table showing some of the large companies that may have to sell shares when the proposal gets implemented.

“Timing and applicability need to be closely evaluated -- we don’t want this to be another forced sale,"" said Vivek Gupta, partner and national head at KPMG in India.

Shares in Wipro Ltd. slumped 4.2%, the most since March 8. Coal India Ltd. slipped 3.7% and TCS ended 3.6% lower on Friday.

Here is what the analysts are saying about Sitharaman’s proposal.


Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Centrum Broking 

25% of the total companies listed on Indian exchanges will have to offload stake to meet the new requirement
The overhang of the proposal can have significant impact and thus regulator needs to provide sufficient time to meet the requirement

The proposal if implemented can cause several changes in Nifty Index over the course of two years
A lot of insurance and consumer companies will get investors attention due to the proposal

11,2019-07-05,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India could contribute at least 9% to the government’s Rs 1,05,000 crore revised divestment receipt target if it has to adhere to the revised proposal for minimum public shareholding of 35% for a listed company.

The present minimum shareholding for a listed company is 25% and the budget proposes to increase it to 35%. At present public holding in the dry fuel company is 29.04% while the government holds 70.96%. To adhere to the new norm the centre has to reduce its stake by another 5.96% in the company. This would require offloading 36.73 crore shares of the company to the general public. At today’s opening price, of Rs 253.55 per share at the Bombay Stock Exchange, this could easily fetch the government at least Rs 9,312 crore. 

Last year, the centre reduced its holding in Coal India by 7.59% from 78.55% during March 2018 to 70.96% as of March 2019 through five divestment instruments that fetched the company Rs 11,030 crore. Additionally it gave the government Rs 8,105 crore through dividends. In all Coal India fetched the government Rs 19,135 crore during 2018-19.

12,2019-07-05,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is streamlining a business blueprint for implementation of Phase I of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) - christened ‘Project Passion’. This is being pursued under the 100 days programme.

The business blueprint is awaiting board for its clearance. Once the board clears the decks the blueprint will become a standard operating procedure at Coal India and all its subsidiaries covering seven modules under ERP. These modules include production & planning, marketing & sales, plant maintenance, materials management including goods, works & services; finance & control, HR and project monitoring.

Last year, CIL’s board green flagged the implementation of ERP in two phases. Phase I of the ERP implementation is being taken up in Mahanadi Coalfields, Western Coalfields, Coal India and North Eastern Coalfields and is expected to go live in September 2020. This includes integrating 21 major hospitals with the ERP through implementation of hospital management system.

For implementation of Phase I, CIL joined hands with Tech Mahindra. Phase II will be rolled out subsequently covering the rest of six subsidiaries of CIL by floating a separate tender and its implementation will start once Phase I goes live.

The ERP is in line with the Five Year Vision Document of Ministry of Coal. The project activities like project preparation, commissioning of CIL ERP Centre, setting up of development and training environment on rental cloud structure, core team training for blue printing engagement of SAP consultants for blueprinting and audit are ticking on time.

The IT Initiatives and implementations of CIL include e-platforms, web applications, IT work domains, digitization and importantly surveillance and monitoring."
15,2019-07-07,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India subsidiary, Northern Coalfields, headquartered some 195 kilometres from the historic city of Varanasi at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh is all set to play an important role in giving new shape to the development of Varanasi.

It has recently built a statue of Lal Bahadur Shastri at the Varanasi International Airport, named after the country’s second Prime Minister, and unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Varanasi, also popularly known as Kashi happens to be Prime Minister’s Parliamentary Constituency. 

The Coal India arm which crossed 100 million tonnes production mark last year contributing to nearly 17% of total production, has recently undertaken many development work at Benaras, a major religious hub by the river Ganges. It has now decided to beautify the statue premises with gardens and fountains.

The 18 feet high metal alloy statue designed by renowned sculptor Ram V. Sutar is made of 85 per cent copper and other metals. The pedestal of the statue built 8.8 feet high took about six months to construct and install. The world's tallest statue of Iron Man Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, popularly known as the Statue of Unity, was also designed by Sutar.

As part of its corporate social responsibility, Northern Coalfields has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Railways under which a grand Eco Park will be constructed near the Manduadih railway station of Varanasi and a reservoir will be restored near this place. The company has signed MoU with local district administration for solid waste management in 13 urbanized village panchayats of Varanasi.

In addition, the company has donated an oxygen generator to the Ramakrishna Mission Hospital in Varanasi. It is also planning to beautify Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi as Swachh Iconic Place launched under Swachh Bharat Mission."

: The government has asked Coal India Limited (CIL) and the railways to prioritize fuel supply to pithead power plants irrespective of their quota or contracted quantity to help them run at full capacity and meet peak demand.

CIL normally supplies a maximum of 90% of the requirement for running a plant at 85% capacity. In peak season, higher demand for coal congests the railways, making it easier to stock up pithead plants.
Not all coalfields have enough production to meet the demand of a pithead plant while some mines also cater to other customers.

Seventeen plants are located near coal mines. They have a total capacity of 33.18 GW comprising 21% of the total thermal capacity. In April-May this year, 13 out of them ran at 82-100% capacity. Their fuel stocks are sufficient for 12 days on average.

Demand has risen with rapid electrification of all villages and the Centre’s Saubhagya scheme, which offers connections to all willing households. The demand is likely to increase further as the government aims to supply uninterrupted power to all, although farmers would get seven-eight hours a day.

As part of the plan, central and state-owned plants are to be given additional responsibility and facilitated to step up generation to provide uninterrupted power at appropriate price to consumers during the peak demand period. These plants have been asked to maintain plant availability and adequate coal stocks as per the norms. In May, power demand breached last year’s record three months before the demand usually peaks."

24,2019-07-11,Coal India,"KOLKATA:The government has rejected the demand of 20,000 Coal India executives that the company’s pay scale should be the same as that of some other state firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). The government has said that current salaries are in line with guidelines of the department of public enterprises (DPE).

It has also asked Coal India to ensure that salaries of workmen do not exceed that of executives. Many senior workers are getting paid more than some executives because the company revises the salaries of workmen more frequently.

The Centre has told Coal India the salary demand has been rejected after consultation with the DPE, which prescribes pay scales for executives on the basis of recommendations of the Committee of Secretaries on the report of the 3rd Pay Revision Committee, which has been notified after Cabinet approval.

“Hence, Coal India’s proposal being not in line with extant department of public enterprise guidelines on pay revision does not allow any deviation in the number and structure of pay scales,” the Centre said in a letter to Coal India.

Last December, Coal India hiked executive salaries, which resulted in an additional Rs 800 crore outgo every year. This raised the pay scale for entry-level executives from Rs 16,400 - Rs 40,500 to Rs 40,000 – Rs 1,40,000 per month. The dearness allowance of 117% was merged with the basic salary after the hike.

The DPE told Coal India’s management that they can negotiate wages with unions and executives within the norms laid out by the department; they have also called for corrective action to remove any deviation from wage guidelines."
25,2019-07-12,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Amid the current volatility in the markets, NTPC could offer a top defensive bet given its better earnings visibility. Analysts expect the company to deliver a double-digit earnings growth in the next two years.

The company’s cheaper valuation and consistent dividend paying record are further seen as contributing factors. At Thursday’s closing price of Rs 129, the stock was traded at 1.2 times the book value which is on a lower side and offers a dividend yield of 5 per cent.

The state-owned NTPC reported 91.4 per cent plant availability factor in the June 2019 quarter — 540 basis points higher than the previous year and the highest in the last eight quarters. This will make the country’s largest power producer eligible for more incentives from the buyers which will help reduce the extent of under-recoveries.


In the previous fiscal, under-recoveries were nearly 7 per cent of the company’s net profit. The company’s management expects to eliminate under-recoveries this fiscal. This along with 5 per cent rise in capacity addition may lead to a double-digit earnings growth for the next two years.

Plant availability factor (PAF) is the amount of time the plant is available to generate electricity. It is different from plant load factor (PLF) which represents capacity utilisation of a power plant. Higher PAF allows NTPC to earn incentives even if the buyers don’t buy more electricity. NTPC’s PAF has been on the rise, thanks to higher coal availability and better inventory management. The average coal inventory at NTPC plants is now at comfortable 30 days as compared to 15 days in the past.

NTPC is working with Coal India and the Indian Railways to ensure seamless availability of coal. It gave Rs 5,000 crore advance to the railways in FY19, which led to reduction in transport bottlenecks. To further improve the logistics it has agreed to pay Rs 10,000 crore in FY20. It is also working towards increasing coal import and has issued tenders to purchase three million tonnes of coal.

In addition, its captive coal mines are ramping up fast. in FY19, the two coal mines produced 6.8 million tonnes coal, which should accelerate by 80-100 per cent by FY21."
28,2019-07-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: There are at least 13 stocks where foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been increasing stakes for four consecutive quarters now.

They included marquee names like ONGC, Coal India, SBI Life Insurance, Muthoot Finance and The Karnataka Bank. Many of these stocks have also been showing strength fundamentally, making a few brokerages turn positive in their outlook.

Among these stocks, FPIs owned 19.4 per cent in SBI Life Insurance at the end of June quarter against 14.1 per cent at the end of March quarter and 4.3 per cent in the year-ago quarter.

ICICIdirect in a note said the life insurer maintained its growth trajectory well in last three years, besides focusing on profitability. It expects the insurer to clock a 17 per cent growth in embedded value (EV) compounded annually in FY19-21, driven by a 25 per cent CAGR growth in the value of new business (VNB).

“Operating RoEV (Return on embedded value used in case of life insurers) is seen at 18 per cent by FY21. The stock traded at 2.3 times FY21 EV. Given the strong distribution network and continued cost control, we remain positive on the fundamental strength of this stock,” it said.

FPI holding in Coal India climbed to 9 per cent at the end of June quarter from 7.1 per cent at the end of March and 5.4 per cent in the year-ago quarter. 

“Coal India has had a much-improved year with financial year FY2019 delivering 149 per cent YoY growth in earnings on the back of a 14 per cent YoY growth in revenue. Valuations remain attractive at 7 times P/E and 5 times EV/Ebitda on adjusted earnings for FY2021E coupled with 10 per cent dividend yield on FY2020 earnings,” said Kotak Securities, which has a target of Rs290 on the stock. 

Emkay Global sees the stock at Rs 296.

FPIs now own 13.9 per cent stake in Muthoot Finance against 12.3 per cent at the end of March and below 10 per cent in the same quarter last year. 

One of the major concerns impacting re-rating of gold loan companies is weak asset growth, said analysts. This was due to various reasons such as abrupt regulatory changes, fall in gold prices, one off events like demonetisation and implementation of GST, said JM Financial.

“With these events behind, the company has seen a revival in gold loan traction. We expect the company to maintain its leadership position with its strong business model and revival in asset growth. This would help maintain strong RoEs of over 20 per cent & RoAs of 5.4 per cent by FY21, the brokerage said while recommending a buy on the stock with a target of Rs 700.

In the case of ONGC, 16 analysts have ‘buy’ ratings, 10 ‘outperform’, six ‘hold’ and just one analyst have ‘underperform’ calls, data available publicly with Reuters suggests. In ONGC, FPI holding stood at 7.6 per cent against 5.4 per cent YoY.

For the study, only those stocks were picked where FPI holding stood at least above 5 per cent as of June 30.

These stocks included The Karnataka Bank, Granules India, Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals (GSFC), TCNS Clothing, Endurance Technologies and Aarti Industries.

Centrum Broking has a ‘buy’ rating on Karnataka Bank with a price target of Rs 142. It expects the bank to report a sequential improvement in NIM in June quarter. It believes the lender may report a 61.5 per cent jump in March quarter profit amid an abnormal spurt in operating expenses.

In the case of Endurance, Axis Capital believes it is the best way to play India’s two-wheeler story. “Its outperformance over the industry will be driven by a clear trend of market/wallet share gains coupled with a structural rise in content. We expect FY19-21 earnings growth of 17 per cent (highest in our coverage),” it said. 

Equirus has initiated coverage of TCNS Clothing with an ‘add’ rating. “TCNS trades at 38 times/33 times FY20E/FY21 EPS, which we feel is expensive when compared to peers and given the near-term uncertainties.

30,2019-07-17,Coal India,"With every tranche of CPSE ETF coming into the market, the investor base is widening and more people are accepting this particular ETF as a way of investing, says Vishal Jain, Head-ETFs, Reliance Nippon Life AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

A lot is riding on your strategy as far as the CPSE ETF goes. A lot of this is going to matter with the government wanting to meet its disinvestment target, the fiscal deficit target. Why is this ETF still an attractive proposition?The CPSE ETF is a good basket of 10 securities which are blue chip public sector companies -- Maharatnas, Navratnas and Miniratnas. There are companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, NTPC and Coal India -- all large blue chip companies which are on the index.

Public sector companies trade at far lower valuations as compared to the market. If you look at the valuation of the CPSE ETF, it trades at about 8-8.5 PE or so as compared to the Nifty which trades at about 15 PE. But if you look at the return on equity, that is very similar and also the dividend yield of these companies are substantial. If you look at the dividend yield of these companies, that means you are looking at the dividend yield of the entire CPSE basket -- 5% as compared to just 1.25% for the Nifty.

The government also gives a discount in every tranche. In the current tranche which is opening tomorrow, the government is offering a discount of 3%. Overall, in terms of valuation, these companies are coming at a good valuation. They have a high dividend yield. You are getting these stocks at a discount and so has everything in it for investors.


This is of course the sixth such offer from the government. If you could bring out the ETF, the intraday chart is trading at the low point of the day. When you talk about 3% discount to new buyers, how do you juxtapose this with another event that the government intends to do and that is to increase the number of shares out in the market? More shares of all of these CPSEs wil be coming into the market .Sure, I agree with what you are saying but every decision has a positive and a negative impact. In the short term, it is a negative because floating stock means more liquidity is going to get pushed into the market but when you look at it from a longer term perspective, the increase in float only leads to greater liquidity.

That means many more different sets of investors coming into that particular share or in that sense an ETF. From a longer term perspective, people always look at fundamentals. In the short term, there will be a liquidity overhang and that could be a problem, but in the long term, people look at the fundamentals. 


What sort of a response do you expect from anchor investor and from retail investors? Do you think the tranche will go through quite easily and get oversubscribed?Yes, we are quite confident. The first NFO was launched in March 2014 and post that came all the subsequent issues. We have just increased the investor base and people know now what the CPSE ETF is. Let me give you a simple example. We had a tranche which was FFO three in November last year where we had got retail subscription of about Rs 2,600-2,700 crore. In the subsequent tranche which was there in March 2019 this year, we had a retail subscription of Rs 3,400 crore. So with every tranche that is coming into the market, the investor base is widening and that more people are accepting this particular ETF as a way of investing.


Do you think ETFs as a product and not only for the CPSE tranche, but overall, are gaining more traction? Are they becoming much more popular for investors versus what you have seen them earlier?Definitely. The total AUMs of ETFs across the mutual funds industry have crossed Rs 1.5 lakh crore and it is just gaining ground. Every year, we find a large set of new investors coming into various products. We are seeing a lot of traction is now gaining ground. I would add that institutional investors are catching on to it much faster at this point of time as compared to retail investors, because on the retail side, no distribution commission is paid on an ETF unlike normal mutual funds.


Just a word on the CPSE ETF, do you expect more such tranches to come in in the future?I am sure the government will have further issues of the CPSE ETF during the year. I am quite happy that the government is using this ETF route more and more every year for their divestment needs. The best part about an ETF is that at one shot you are divesting in 10 companies in a very simple and a frictionless manner. I am happy that the government is using this more and more and that as we go ahead, we feel that a large portion of the disinvestment will happen through the various ETFs that the government has and is planning to launch.


How can you invest in CPSE ETF to save tax under Section 80C?In the Budget, it has been mentioned that the CPSE ETF will be eligible for 80C benefits. As the Finance Bill has not been passed till now, it has not yet got implemented and once the Finance Bill is passed, there will be a bit of operational work that will need to be done from the exchanges. My belief is that in the next two to three months that should be up and running and we will see a larger amount of retail interest in ETFs."

43,2019-07-22,Coal India,"New Delhi: One-and-a-half-years after ONGC bought a majority stake in it, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) continues not to recognise the company as its promoter saying it will follow the government advise to list ONGC as a promoter only after receiving clarifications from necessary agencies.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. Following which, HPCL became ONGC's subsidiary.

HPCL management, however, has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

In a regulatory filing HPCL made to stock exchanges on July 21, in the shareholding for the quarter ending June 30, 2019, HPCL again listed ONGC as ""public shareholder"" and not as its promoter.

Just like the previous five quarterly filings, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 per cent"" shareholding of the company.

Sources close to ONGC said, IT company Mindtree recognised Larsen and Toubro as its promoter within a day of the engineering giant acquiring a majority stake, but HPCL has steadfastly refused to acknowledge its new promoter, ONGC.

Reached for comments, a HPCL spokesperson said: ""An advice (was) received some time back from Government of India stating that 'President of India' continues to be the Promoter of HPCL and ONGC is also to be shown as Promoter of HPCL below President of India. HPCL being a listed CPSE, clarifications /details were required from multiple agencies/ authorities to ensure compliance to various stipulations applicable to listed companies including Companies Act, SEBI Regulations etc.""

""As soon as all the clarifications/details are received from concerned agencies /authorities, necessary amendments as required will be made in the regulatory filings after following due process. Till such time, status quo is being maintained in the regulatory filings,"" the spokesperson said in an email response.

While HPCL management has been unrelenting, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in written replies to questions in Parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ONGC.

The government too has been treating HPCL as ONGC subsidiary and its headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17, called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL.

Sources said the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director.

Till now, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh K Surana would sit on the PESB interview panels for selecting directors.

HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28, and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.

For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake, PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.

The Department of Personnel guidelines states that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding company is invited to assist the Board.""

Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance).

""It is clarified that both HPCL and ONGC are listed companies independently managed by their respective Boards and the above issue does not have any impact on the functioning or the coordination between the companies. Synergy groups of the two companies are working to identify synergy areas, some of which are acted upon and some are work in progress.

""Efforts are directed to ensure that no value is lost for the stakeholders and further value is created by leveraging synergies. HPCL has always followed high standards of corporate governance and will continue to do so in future also,"" HPCL spokesperson added.

Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price-sensitive information.

According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

Sources said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited to allow Surana retain the Chairman and Managing Director designation, even though there cannot be two Chairmen within a group, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.

Coal India is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited."

47,2019-07-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India’s five subsidiaries are facing Rs 53,331 crore of penalties slapped by states as at least 60 of their mines exceeded production limits set by environmental authorities, the state-run company’s auditor has noted in its annual report.

The company has included the figure in its annual report for 2018-19 under the head ‘contingent liability’, meaning it is a potential liability and may have to be paid depending on the outcome of each of these cases.

If Coal India needs to pay the levies, its finances will be critically hit. Its reserves, which stood at Rs 38,000 crore as on April 1, will fall short by Rs 15,000 crore.

Although the demand notices were sent to Coal India subsidiaries in the last two years, Coal India executives are not perturbed since they believe that the levies/penalties relate to a period when environment clearances used to be delayed by several months. In fact, relevant authorities have issued temporary stay orders for some of these penal levies while others are being challenged.

“Being the only commercial coal producer, Coal India’s responsibility of meeting the nation’s demand for coal had to be fulfilled and we were obligated to meet the country’s demand for coal on behest of the government,” a senior Coal India executive said. “Nevertheless, environment clearances for each of these cases were later received for the patches for which states have levied penalty on us. We do not believe the fines would be a major concern.”

The company’s annual report said district mining officers of Jharkhand raised a demand of Rs 13,389.38 crore for mining in excess of the environmental clearances limit in 41 mines of Central Coalfields. The company filed a revision petition before the Coal Tribunal under the coal ministry. It has stayed execution of the penalty in an interim order.

In case of ECL, a demand notice of Rs 2,178.14 crore was sent by the Jharkhand government for producing coal in excess of the maximum production capacity in Rajmahal, Mugma and S P Mines areas. The coal ministry has also issued an interim stay order.

Mahanadi Coalfields received a Rs 10,289.83 crore compensation notice from the office of Deputy Director of Mines in Odisha for producing coal beyond approved environment clearance limit. MCL has filed a revision applications against the claim with the coal ministry, which is under process.

In case of South Eastern Coalfields, a penalty of Rs 10,129.31 crore in respect of 13 mines for illegal mining was imposed by the Chhattisgarh government last year. Appeals by the company before the competent authority are under process.

Bharat Coking Coal received a demand notice of Rs 17,344.46 crore with respect to 47 mines from the Jharkhand government for producing coal without environmental clearance and/or forest clearances.

“The execution of the demand notice has been stayed till further order,” the company said in its annual report."

48,2019-07-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is raising supplies to customers other than power stations after almost two years, bringing relief to cement producers, sponge iron makers, brick kilns and other sectors.

As power plants are adequately stocked, Coal India is now clearing the backlog for other customers. Backlogs for nonpower customers in terms of number of goods trains or rakes, which were to be delivered, stood at 5,100 rakes on April 1 this year. Additional supplies have reduced this backlog by 2,300 rakes now.

During the first quarter of the current fiscal, Coal India increased supplies to non-power sector by 12% to 34 million tonnes compared to the previous period. Its share of total dispatches rose to 22% from 19%.

A Coal India executive said power plants have enough coal for 14 days. “With sufficient coal in the system, we can focus on non-power consumers,” he said. In 2016-17, demand from thermal plants fell, prompting a shift of fuel supply to other sectors. However, a subsequent rise in demand from power plants forced Coal India to raise supply to the priority sector at the cost of other customers."

4,2019-08-03,Coal India,"Four central unions at Coal India subsidiary, Mahanadi Coalfields have urged its chairman to restore normalcy at Talcher Coalfield which is facing work stoppage for the last 10 days. They fear working condition at the mines will deteriorate at a fast pace and it may lead to further accidents if left unattended for long following the strike.

Work at all eight open cast and one underground mine at Talcher coalfields in Odisha, came to a halt on July 24, after various political parties started demanding increased compensation for victims’ families after an accident at Bharatpur Open Cast Project.

A section of political parties demanded compensation of Rs 50 lakh each for the families of the victims, while another has recently demanded Rs 3 crore for each families which Coal India has not yet agreed to pay.

In a letter to the MCL chairman, four unions, INTUC, HMS, BMS and AITUC said: “Seeing the gravity and seriousness of the situation, you are requested to intervene into the matter immediately to restore the normalcy in the entire Talcher Coalfield to avoid further discontentment and law and order situation.”

They apprehend deterioration of mining conditions at these mines following the work stoppage as open cast mines require thorough inspection with respect to inundation and in particular slope sliding of over burden dumps and benches.

Following the prolonged strike all its workers and staff including contractual workers have not yet received their salaries. According to the letter, while Coal India employees are being forced to forgo salaries due to work stoppage, those indirectly connected with mining activities like sub-contractors, contractor workers, truck owners, business men are also losing daily earnings."

6,2019-08-05,Coal India,"Mumbai: India’s stock market capitalisation fell below the $2 trillion mark for the first time in six months, triggered by the selloff on Dalal Street in July that led to an 8.8 per cent erosion in investor wealth during the month. The country’s total value of all listed stocks dropped to $1.97 trillion on Friday, slipping below Europe’s biggest economy Germany as foreign investor sentiment has soured following the increase in tax surcharge on many of them and a slowdown in the economy.

India first entered the $2 trillion market cap club of eight countries in May 2017. After slipping briefly in February, market value rebounded to an all-time high of $2.24 trillion on June 4 on hopes that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government with a strong majority in Parliament would unleash measures to revive the economy and end the malaise that has gripped nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs).


The country’s stock market, which overtook Germany’s to become the seventh largest in the world in December last year, slipped to ninth amid foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) selling equities worth ?15,000 crore since the July 5 budget because of concerns over higher taxation. State Bank of India, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Axis Bank, Coal India and Larsen & Toubro contributed the most to the erosion in market capitalisation in July.

Canada and Germany, with 19 per cent and 4 per cent respective gains, in market cap are currently commanding the seventh and eighth positions. India had overtaken Canada to become the world’s eighthbiggest stock market in November 2017 after almost a decade.

The total market capitalisation of all the listed Indian firms had first crossed the $1 trillion mark on May 28, 2007.

India and South Korea are the only countries, among the top 15 by market capitalisation, that have lost market value in 2019. China’s market cap has risen by 22 per cent to $6.58 trillion so far this year while that of the US has gained 19.2 per cent to $32.037 trillion so far this year.

ET reported on August 3 that the government has begun to look at providing some quick relief to foreign portfolio investors from the super-rich surcharge, worried over the exit of foreign investors from the capital market and overall sentiment turning negative."

10,2019-08-05,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The domestic equity market had a zigzag show on Monday amid signs of further escalation in the trade war, a steep fall in the yuan, uncertainty over a major law change on Kashmir and weakness in the rupee. 

China’s yuan hit its lowest level in almost 11 years, triggering a sharp drop in emerging market currencies. At the time of writing of this report, the rupee traded 90 paise down at 70.49 against the US dollar.

“Weak global sentiment was the top trigger behind Monday’s market fall. It seems the trade war is not going to end anytime soon,” said Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICIdirect.

Losses in heavyweights from bank, NBFC, energy, auto and metal sectors dragged Sensex by 418 points, or 1.13 per cent, to 36,699. Nifty finished at 10,862, down 135 points or 1.23 per cent.

“The ongoing turmoil in Kashmir may further induce volatility in the market. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China will keep market participants on the edge and cause weakness in oil prices as well as the currency,” said Ajit Mishra, VP- Research, Religare Broking.

16,2019-08-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: RBI’s unconventional 35 bps rate cut failed to give any boost to investor sentiment and equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended Wednesday’s session with strong losses.

The market was hoping for some measures to address liquidity concerns for the shadow banks.

“The NBFC crisis is still plaguing the market, and there is a need to fix it. Developments in the global economy are also not favourable for growth,” said Deepthi Mathews, Economist at Geojit Financial Services. 

Global sentiment remained fragile while investors back home sought clues as to when and how the economy will start a bounceback and what measures the government may take to check FII exits from domestic stocks. 

“A downside risk to the lowered GDP forecast at 6.9 per cent in FY20 due to global growth headwinds and slowdown in domestic consumption hurt investor sentiment,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 

The 30-share Sensex ended the day 286 points, or 0.77 per cent, lower at 36,690, with 22 stocks ending in the red. Nifty closed the day at 10,855, down 93 points, or 0.85 per cent.

21,2019-08-08,Coal India,"Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has agreed to rectify the shareholding pattern to include ONGC as a ""promoter"" after it got a reprimand from capital markets regulator Sebi for refusing to recognise its majority shareholder. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) asked HPCL to re-file shareholding pattern to stock exchanges by August 13 for all quarters since Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) acquired government's entire stake in the refiner in January 2018. 

""HPCL intends to rectify the shareholding pattern and classification of promoters by the stipulated date as per the direction from SEBI,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing, attaching a copy of the letter it received from the regulator on the subject. 

Sebi, in the August 6 letter, asked HPCL to disseminate its letter to the stock exchanges. 

ONGC in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore but continued to be mentioned under ""public shareholder"" in the filings by the oil marketing company. President of India, in six shareholding pattern filings HPCL made since then, remained as ""promoter"" without any stake in the company. 

Sebi in the letter said it had in a letter dated September 10, 2018 ""advised HPCL to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges revising the status of ONGC as 'promoter'."" 

""Further, as informed by HPCL vide its email dated June 27, 2019, Government of India has also advised HPCL that 'President of India' will continue to be the promoter of HPCL and ONGC to be added as a Promoter below 'President of India. However, HPCL has not abided by the aforesaid direction to revise the status of ONGC as 'promoter' till now,"" the regulator said. 

The regulator said its response to the informal guidance request was ""clear and self-explanatory"". 

""Hence any further request for clarification on the issue does not arise,"" it said. ""Accordingly, you are once again advised to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges for all quarters since the acquisition of shares by ONGC, while revising the status of ONGC as a 'promoter' by August 13, 2019, failing which appropriate action will be initiated as per SEBI Act."" 

Sebi asked HPCL to place its letter before the board of directors in its next meeting and disseminate the letter to the stock exchanges. 

Replying to the Sebi letter, HPCL on August 7 had sought ""specific clarifications from Sebi pertaining to procedures and approvals related"" to the issue. 

HPCL said it has not received ""the necessary clarifications"" from Sebi and ""in order to give effect"" to its August 6 direction, ""we have no choice but to infer that no further approvals whatsoever is required to be obtained by HPCL from any stakeholder/agency in this regard"". 

The company said the Sebi's letter was placed before HPCL board on August 7. 

HPCL has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoters and hasn't list any specific reason for not doing so. 

Sources close to ONGC said IT company Mindtree recognised Larsen and Toubro as its promoter within a day after the engineering giant acquired a majority stake. 

Last month, an HPCL spokesperson had stated that the company needed ""clarifications /details"" from ""multiple agencies/ authorities to ensure compliance to various stipulations applicable to listed companies including Companies Act, SEBI Regulations, etc"" before doing so. 

""As soon as all the clarifications/details are received from concerned agencies /authorities, necessary amendments as required will be made in the regulatory filings after following due process. Till such time, the status quo is being maintained in the regulatory filings,"" the spokesperson had said. 

While HPCL management has been unrelenting, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in written replies to questions in Parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ONGC. 

The government too has been treating HPCL as ONGC subsidiary and its headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17, called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL. 

As of now, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh K Surana would sit on the PESB interview panels for selecting directors. 

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of the tag, keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price-sensitive information. 

According to the Sebi's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company. 

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL). 

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board. 

Sources said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited to allow Surana retain the Chairman and Managing Director designation, even though there cannot be two Chairmen within a group, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies. 

Coal India is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited."

17,2019-08-08,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India (CIL) and its large pithead consumers are planning a 10,000 crore investment in conveyor belts to transport coal directly from mines in a cheaper and cleaner way without using trucks. Customers will make the investment while CIL will provide land and facilities for the belts, which will be installed in mines that produce 4 million tonnes of ore, a senior company executive said on condition of anonymity. This will drastically reduce the number of trucks and reduce diesel consumption and emissions. 

Besides reducing accidents and increasing the turnaround time for coal supply as conveyors can function throughout the day. It will also cut down theft as well as diversion of coal and help maintain quality.

CIL is in talks with Hindalco, Vedanta, Balco and Jindal Group, among others, for setting up such infrastructure at coal mines. The executive cited earlier said that Maharashtra government-owned Mahagenco, a large power producer, is in the process of setting up a conveyor system in Nagpur area."

20,2019-08-08,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India managed to fetch premiums ranging between 33 per cent and 66 per cent over its notified price for different categories of auction sale during the quarter ended June 2019. E-auction offerings are currently being regulated to stock power plants with adequate fuel, which analysts say, may increase spot e-auction prices in the near future.

Going forward, if Coal India diverts more coal to power plants, then possibility of a rise in spot e-auction premiums cannot be ruled out, but international coal prices would continue to influence prices in the spot e-auction market said Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president, and group head - corporate sector ratings at ICRA.

Increased e-auction price raises the fuel producers’ profitability since it is the most lucrative avenue for sale vis-a-vis regular supplies to power and non-power sector where prices are fixed. During Q4 FY2019, 10 per cent of raw coal sold through e-auctions fetched 18 per cent of its net sales.

This year, Coal India decided to sell 33 million tonnes of coal each in the spot and forward auction market. However, the Centre has recently asked the company to ensure higher dispatch to power plants prompting it to reduce auction offering to push additional coal to pit head power generators.

Supporting the centres directive Roy said: “After growing at a healthy 7 per cent YoY during FY2019, Coal India's production remained flat, growing by 0.1 per cent only YoY in the first quarter of the current fiscal. In fact, dispatch data from the miner indicates that supplies to the power sector declined 3.2 per cent YoY during June 2019 quarter.”

Roy said, coal based power generation in the country grew 4.8 per cent YoY. Not surprisingly therefore, coal stocks at power plants declined to around 26 million tonnes on July 15, 2019 end, against 31 million tonnes in March 2019 end.

This was despite liquidation of 19 million tonnes of pit head stocks which now stands around 36 million tonnes.

Currently, none of Coal India subsidiaries have lined up any auction and the auction platform of MSTC has no information on upcoming auctions.

During the first quarter of the current fiscal, Coal India reduced offerings in the spot auction market by almost 29 per cent to 7.42 million tonnes fetching premiums that was on an average 61 per cent over notified prices. In June, it offered 42 per cent less coal at 3.07 million tonnes while premiums were on an average 55 per cent more than average notified price for the grades of coal on offer.

Under special forward e-auction for power, Coal India offered 6.65 million tonnes in the quarter. It was less than half, last year’s quantity. However, average premium for the quarter was 33 per cent more than its notified price.

Through exclusive e-auctions for non-power, Coal India offered almost 35 per cent less coal at 2.2 million tonnes during the first quarter of the current fiscal. It fetched average premium of 33 per cent over notified price.

According to ICRA’s Roy, prices in the auction market remained low despite reduced offerings for e-auction because supplies to the non-regulated sector, increased 12.3 per cent YoY in Q1 FY2020. Weak seaborne coal prices resulted in a drop in average spot e-auction premiums to around 60 per cent in Q1 FY2020 against 85 per cent in Q1 FY2019 and 88 per cent in Q4 FY2019.

E-auction prices, despite lower supplies in the future, will continue to be a factor of subdued Chinese and European coal demand which pulled down South African and Australian thermal coal prices by 10 per cent and 4 per cent respectively during the April-June 2019 quarter."

25,2019-08-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The Centre wants public sector companies to take up commercial coal production like Coal India or Singareni Collieries and has lined up nine coal blocks, the entire produce from which can be sold in the open market. In contrast, private entities can sell only about 25% of the produce from the blocks on offer for them.

This is the first time the government is offering blocks to public sector companies for selling their entire production in the open market.

Coal India, which can also bid for these blocks, however, is not open to applying since it feels it has enough reserves under its command area to produce its targeted numbers over the next several years, a senior Coal India executive said.

Enabling notification from the Centre for government companies to sell their entire produce in the open market was made in February 2018 after it was passed by the Cabinet. These blocks on offer relate to the 204 blocks included under the Coal Mines Special Provision Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015.

Additionally, the Centre has also offered six blocks to public sector entities for captive power generation and steel production. However, they are also open to selling 25% of the annual production in the open market.

The blocks on offer are under sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth tranche of allotment. According to the notification for allotment, sixth tranche is offering five coal mines to PSUs for captive power generation, eight tranche of allotment is for one block meant for captive consumption in steel production.

The seventh and ninth tranche of allotment for eight and one coal mines respectively are for coal sales in the open market.

Mines on offer from which entire production can be sold in the open market are Sayang, Panchbahani and Morga III from Chhattisgarh, Tokisud North, Patratu, Rauta Closed Mine, Sugia Closed Mine from Jharkhand, Dahegaon/Makard Hokra-IV from Maharashtra and Anesttipali from Telangana.

These blocks hold a total reserve of around 839 million tonnes. Patratu is the largest with geological reserves of about 450 million tonnes, followed by Sayang at 150 million tonnes and Tokisud North holding around 92 million tonnes of geological reserves. Morga III and Anesttipali hold reserves of 35 million tonnes and 27 million tonnes respectively. 

Rest of the blocks like Panchbahani, Sugia Closed Mines and Rauta Closed Mines hold small reserves of 11 million tonnes, 2 million tonnes and 1 million tonnes respectively.

Mines would be allotted to public sector companies on the basis of selection parameters set by the government."

Soaring temperatures due to climate change, smaller size arable land holdings, scarce water resources, as well as low grade and spurious products jostling for space next to branded varieties in the local market. Every now and again, fly-by-night sellers and advisers make an appearance. These are only some ills that have beset Indian agriculture.

Our farmlands have reduced to just a little over a hectare per household. The soil is depleted of its nutrients by overusing chemicals, and also wrong products. The farmer seeks the less expensive versions of agrochemical substances, which are also of low quality. Since he cannot read, he cannot differentiate between them. However, when he uses the right products he will earn Rs 5 for every Re 1 that he spends on pesticides alone, according to one estimate. Farmers know even little that they are over tilling the land, destroying its cover, and hurting its natural ecosystem. When shorn of its cover, the eroded land expels into the atmosphere carbon and other green house gases that it had contained within it for centuries, causing climate change.


Putting the Spotlight on Farmers
The farmers require as much nurturing as the land they till, says RG Agarwal, member of The Economic Times India Leadership Council, ETILC’s core group on Agrochemicals, and chairman, Sub-Committee (Crop Protection Chemicals) & chairman, Dhanuka Agritech. Agarwal is a leading voice in the industry, and feels that policymakers may need to focus more on rewards and incentives ‘to scale up’ both farmers and industry. Further, farmers need to do a lot more work on their farmlands so as to ‘double their incomes’, as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi has spoken of a national policy on agriculture as against the existing regional legislation, he adds.


Commitment to Sustainable Farming
Agriculture stakeholders including farmers, agrochemicals and seeds companies, agricultural experts, researchers and academicians; and ministers and politicians are anxious to promote sustainable farming and the use of agrochemicals. The farmers are concerned that their children are opting for jobs in other industries and services, and are willing to give up their own lands. Prominent among the stakeholders who have voiced their commitment to sustainable farming are General VK Singh, MoS, Road Transport and Highways; Chandra Prakash Joshi, BJP MP; Parvesh Verma, BJP MP; Sudhir Ramachandra Gupta, BJP MP; Dr CD Mayee, Chairman Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board, Former Agriculture Commissioner, and Former VC, Marathwada Agriculture University; RG Agarwal, Chairman, Sub-Committee (Crop Protection Chemicals) & Chairman, Dhanuka Agritech Ltd; Rajan Gajaria, Executive VP (Business Platforms), Corteva Agriscience; and Dr D Kanungo, Former DDG, Ministry of Health & Chairman, FSSAI Committee on Residue Network. Among the guests were Kiyoshi Masuda San, Managing Director, ISK Biosciences India; CK Sabharwal, Director, ISK Biosciences India; Dr Vasant L Patil, Director, Science & Regulatory Affairs, CropLife Asia, Singapore; and Puneet Singh Thind, National Director, Vegetable Grower Association of India, Ambala.


Greening Lands Judiciously
The stakeholders pointed to the very real possibility of poor quality inputs and agrochemical substances being used, in agriculture. These have a negative impact on the economy and the food chain.

Crop protection requires the judicious use of pesticides and agrochemical substances. Overusing branded products is one problem, but using low quality and spurious products makes the farming activity a non-starter. The stakeholders feel a legislation to address this issue is a big imperative. Among the policy suggestions is Sama Dama Danda Bheda, the ancient Indian philosopher Kautilya’s statecraft policy to use conciliation as the first step; giving gifts or compensation in the second; force and trickery in the third and fourth as the only way to eradicate this evil.


Empower and Reward
For farmers to now pursue sustainable farming we must find new ways of using technology that is tailor made to suit the smaller landholdings, say the stakeholders. Micro and drip irrigation must replace the current method of flooding which is also eroding the land of its nutrients.

New farm policies must be drafted so as to empower farmers to improve their yields and double their incomes, while maintaining the natural habitat of their land. Their partner stakeholder, the agrochemicals and seeds industry must feel incentivised so as to offer world class, products. Ratings on products will infuse competition among companies.

They will also carry out farmer sensitisation and assistance programmes related to their products, which will include directions on usage, and the right, judicious mix of substances, keeping in mind crop and soil varieties. Agarwal feels that local leaders among the farmers may be chosen on merit and empowered to use new technology and farming techniques. They, in turn, will become the change agents in their areas.


Seeking Data Pprotection
Agrochemical products have a long gestation period. In addition, new molecules currently take about five to seven years to be registered. The bureaucratic delay in the molecules reaching the farmers leaves them with no option but to buy the cheaper, low quality products.

It is suggested that the government look into this issue at the earliest. Also, while Indian formulations are mostly generic products, because R&D is very expensive, foreign companies usually diversify their portfolio and are keen to invest in India on product R&D and marketing. However, the data protection law needs to be strengthened for them to continue engaging with the Indian market, the stakeholders feel.


Farm Friendly Policies
The new laws must be passed at the earliest so Indian agriculture can start anew with the latest technology and new scientific methods, feel the stakeholders. One pending legislation is the draft bill on Pesticides Management. The Bill seeks to address two vexatious provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968. The first is that it seeks to make the Inspector accountable and liable for carrying out repeated search and seizures, and spot checks on a few big companies without reasonable grounds.

The second pertains to the private sector being allowed to set up testing laboratories and conducting its work independently of the Central Insecticide Laboratory, CIL. It is also suggested that new testing laboratories may be set up, with the government and industry, in public private partnerships, PPPs.


ESMA and APMC are Outdated
Some stakeholders also feel that farm incomes are currently regulated due to the Essential Services and Maintenance Act, ESMA, and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC).

The first seeks to bring to market all farm produce to stop any hoarding activity. The second ensures that government mandis are the preferred markets for farm produce. Both the APMC and ESMA are outdated and revoking these legislations will spur a new beginning for Indian agriculture, they add.


Conclusion
While several amendments and new legislations are awaited, India must put in place a data-matching system where estimated farm produce may be compared against the actual produce, say the stakeholders. They also suggests that an inter-ministerial committee on food safety standards be set up, right from the farm to various stages in the supply chain, to ensure that the farm produce is sustainable."

34,2019-08-14,Coal India,"Asset under management of the mutual fund industry inched higher to Rs 24.53 lakh crore in July despite a harsh selloff in the domestic equity market, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed. Total AUM stood at Rs 24.25 lakh crore in June. 

Investors’ mutual fund portfolios suffered a dent after the Union Budget 2019 slapped a surcharge in the high income-tax bracket that hit foreign portfolio investors (FPI). In response, FPIs, who had poured in around Rs 80,000 crore during February-June, offloaded stocks worth more than Rs 12,000 crore in July itself.

Even the bluest of blue chips like Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank cracked up to 8 per cent during the month. The BSE Sensex dipped around 5 per cent, while BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declined 8 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Money managers of top fund houses used this crisis as an opportunity to lap up low hanging fruits.


Here’s a look at what top five asset managers bought and sold during the month:

HDFC Mutual Fund
The country’s largest money manager held Rs 1.43 lakh crore in equities, with maximum exposure to financials, power and industrial stocks. The fund house added 5.71 crore shares of GAIL last month, while other names on its shopping list included ITC (3.10 crore), Power Grid (2.08 crore), Bharat Electronics (1.81 crore), Coal India (1.29 lakh) and YES Bank (1.11 crore). It also added 53 lakh shares of Reliance Industries and 16 lakh of Axis Bank. On the other hand, the asset management company sold over 10 lakh shares each in Vedanta, Shriram Transport Finance, ICICI Bank, SBI and UPL.


ICICI Prudential Mutual FundThe fund house held equity assets of Rs 1.25 lakh crore as of July 31. During the month, it completely exited Aarti Industries, Bharat Financial Inclusion, Easun Reyrolle and Greenply Industries. At the same time, the fund house added 1.71 crore shares of ONGC, 1.42 crore shares of BHEL, 82 lakh of Federal Bank, 78.89 lakh of Axis Bank, 56.82 lakh of Tata Power, 56 lakh of Bank of Baroda, 49 lakh of Motherson Sumi and 46 lakh of Oil India. The fund sold more than 1 crore shares each in Infosys, Vodafone Idea and IndianOil and 17 lakh shares in YES Bank.


SBI Mutual Fund The fund house had about Rs 1.57 lakh crore invested in about 306 stocks. It bought more than 1 crore shares each in Power Grid, ICICI Bank, DLF, ITC, NTPC and Torrent Power. This was followed by SBI (76 lakh shares), SJVN (66 lakh), Axis Bank (61) and YES Bank (42 lakh). On the other hand, it sold 2.31 crore share of Vodafone Idea, 98 lakh of Tata Power, 64 lakh of UPL, 45 lakh of Hindalco and 42 lakh shares of InterGlobe Aviation.


Reliance Nippon Life AMCAffle (India), Arti Surfactants, Credit Access Grameen, Dhampur Sugar and Greenpanel Industries were among the new entrants in the portfolio of this fund house last month. However, it exited stocks like Bharat Financial Inclusion, HT Media, JK Lakshmi Cement, Max India, Precision Camshafts and Tata Elxsi.

Data with Ace Mutual Fund showed the fund house added over 14 crore shares each in NTPC and IndianOil last month and added large volume shares ranging from 1 to 13 crore in ONGC, Coal India, Bharat Electronics, Power Finance, NBCC, SJVN, Oil India and Neyveli Lignite. It sold stakes in REC, BHEL, SBI, HPCL and Adani Power. In the banking space, the fund house added up to 82 lakh shares of YES Bank, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank.


Aditya Birla Sun Life AMCThe fund house had about Rs 79,126 crore invested in 358 stocks as of July 31. During the month, it added 10-40 lakh shares of Tata Power, IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, NTPC, Reliance Industries, L&T, Lupin, BPCL, NCC, ONGC and Exide Industries among others. At the same time, it reduced holdings in Vodafone Idea, IDFC First Bank, YES Bank, Bharat Electronics, ITC, Power Grid, Jindal Steel, NMDC and Welspun India."
35,2019-08-15,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-owned CIL's 54 coal mining projects are facing delay due to various reasons such as contractual issues and delay in green clearances among others, the world's largest coal miner said. ""A total of 120 coal projects costing Rs 20 crore and above are in different stages of implementation. Out of which 66 projects are on schedule and 54 projects are delayed,"" Coal India Ltd (CIL) said in its annual report. 

 The major reasons for delay in implementation of these projects are delays in obtaining environment clearance (EC), forest clearance (FC), possessions of land and issues related to resettlement and rehabilitation, contractual issues and evacuation facilities among others. 

 The company said that five coal mining projects with a sanctioned capital of Rs 989.43 crore were completed during 2018-19, while two coal projects with a sanctioned capital of Rs 1,502.65 crore were started during the year. 

 The public sector undertaking further said that 20 projects with a total investment of Rs 11,807.78 crore were approved in 2018-19. 

 Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output. 

 Based on the demand projection in 'Vision 2030' for coal sector in the country and subsequent demand projection on CIL, a perspective plan has been prepared to project production plan in medium and long-term basis up to 2030-31 wherein the company is envisaged to grow at the rate of about 7.6 per cent till 2024-25 to meet the coal demand of the country. 

 To achieve projected growth in production, CIL has identified major projects and assessed their related issues, it said."
37,2019-08-16,Coal India,"By David Fickling
If India is such a bright hope for global coal demand, why can’t investors see it?

The country will experience the largest increase in coal burning through 2023, according to the International Energy Agency, with a 3.9% annual pace of growth that should be enough to offset falling consumption in developed countries. BloombergNEF, whose forecasts tend to be less bullish than the IEA’s on fossil fuel demand, is not far behind: Coal-fired generation will increase about 48% by 2030 to hit 1,512 terawatt-hours, more than all of Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

The curious thing is that when you look at the Indian power sector, there are few signs it’s on the brink of a boom. Quite the opposite: As many as 65 gigawatts of the 90GW of private-sector generators connected in India are under financial stress, according to a parliamentary report last year. As my colleague Andy Mukherjee has written, the resulting 1.8 trillion rupees ($26 billion) in bad loans is contributing to a nonperforming asset crisis that risks undermining the Indian financial system.


Bloomberg
Furthermore, activity to increase coal-fired generation is overwhelmingly dependent on state support. Out of 48GW of coal generators planned to be built by 2027 under the country’s current electricity plan, just 14% is being developed by the private sector; a matching 48GW of generation is already slated for retirement by the same date. 


Bloomberg
Even that modest level of private investment appears to be retreating now, according to a report published Friday by the Centre for Financial Accountability, a Delhi-based group pushing for better standards of development finance. Lending to coal-fired power fell 90% in 2018, to 60 billion rupees from 608 billion rupees the previous year, the CFA said. The vast majority of that total was refinancing of existing plants: Just 12 billion rupees was dedicated to new generation, all of it to just one state-backed plant in Uttar Pradesh. 

If you still think wind and solar are the energy sectors most dependent on state support, you’ve not been paying attention to how the landscape has changed. In India, 65% of funding to coal-fired projects in 2018 came from government-controlled institutions, whereas three-quarters of loans to renewables came from the private sector, according to the CFA. Even a sixfold increase in renewables subsidies to 150 billion rupees in 2018 left that sector shy of the 160 billion rupees directly supporting the coal mining and generation sector, according to a separate report last year.


Bloomberg
There are several reasons that India’s coal sector is struggling. The vast expansion of generation over the past decade has left the country oversupplied with electricity capacity. Making matters worse, the slump in the price of renewables means that even existing coal plants struggle to compete on cost, let alone newly built ones. The average power tariff for state-owned NTPC Ltd. in the June quarter was 3.63 rupees per kilowatt-hour, or around $51 per megawatt-hour. New wind can currently be built for around $43/MWh in India and solar comes in at $37/MWh, according to BloombergNEF.

On top of that, generators are struggling to be paid because of the finances of the electricity distribution companies owned by India’s states, while shortages of water and coal itself mean plants often have to switch off even at times when they can make money. State-owned mining giant Coal India Ltd. may miss full-year production targets if output doesn't pick up from rates seen in the June quarter, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michelle Leung wrote Friday.

The bullish argument for Indian coal over the next decade is that the government bails out the distribution companies who will in turn bail out the generators; and that the grid simply won’t be able to integrate the 175GW of wind and solar that the government is targeting to be built by 2022, let alone the 500GW envisioned by 2030. As a result, state support will continue to prop up expensive, polluting soot as the only technology capable of keeping up with growing electricity demand.


Bloomberg
An alternative scenario is that India meets most of its renewables expansion targets and lifts the efficiency of wind and solar plants closer to those seen elsewhere in the world. In that future, coal-fired electricity may already be within a few percentage points of its peak. With renewable power growing, fossil-fired plants would gradually be reduced to back-up generation to supply electricity after the sun has set, rather than providing the bulk of power through the day. 

In truth, there’s not enough investment in either form of generation at the moment to make a sure-fire bet. Still, as we’ve argued, the collapse of financing for fossil fuels should give pause to anyone making bullish predictions for the future of carbon-intensive electricity, including the governments that are increasingly its main backers. Coal-fired power has long failed in terms of human health and climate impacts, but its raw economics are now collapsing, too. Even the might of the state can’t keep flogging this dead horse much longer.

38,2019-08-17,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India arm, Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Ltd (CMPDIL), prepared 24 geological reports on coal blocks and added additional coal resources of about 6.6 billion tonnes to the ‘proven category’ during 2018-19.

Addition to proven reserves last year was considerably higher than the average rate reported in the last few years the company said in a statement. During FY 2018-19 CMPDI reported a Rs 1274 crore turnover with growth of about 10% over the previous year.

During 2018-19, CMPDI through departmental drills carried out 5 lakh meter of drilling with productivity of 619 per drill per meter, which is the highest in the history of CMPDI with a growth of about 11 % over previous year. This was achieved by adopting modern technology.

CMPDI was upgraded from category-II Mini-Ratna to category-I Mini Ratna company. The company has been actively involved in reclassification of coking coal to account for unclassified low volatile medium coking (Ash > 35%) coal resources available in Bharat Coking Coal Ltd and Central Coalfields Ltd. This resulted in addition of washery grade-V (exceeding 35% and up to 42% ash) & washery grade-VI (exceeding 42% and up to 49% ash) which will result in considerable financial benefit to related subsidiaries and foreign exchange saving through reduction in coking coal imports.

CMPDI has prepared a total 287 report, including 24 geological reports, 31 project reports and 84 Form-I/EMP. Draft project report of Mandar Parvat was prepared. This will be the first coal mine of Bihar.

CMPDIL chairman and managing director, S Saran said in a statement that it is necessary to start new work after searching for potential in sectors other than coal so that revenue and experience can be widened."

42,2019-08-19,Coal India,"Elara Capital has reiterated a buy for BEML with a 3% upward revision in target price to Rs 1,180, as rail and metro propelled revenue growth. The stock traded 0.99% lower at 759.25 as the Sensex was over 50 points up at 37400 plus.


Company FinancialsBEML revenue rises by 28% YoY to Rs 5.8bn in Q1FY20, well above brokerage estimates of Rs 5.1bn. The revenue growth in Q1FY20 was on low base as Q1FY19 revenue fell by 27%. The revenue was driven by strong growth in the rail & metro segment with the execution of Bangalore and Kolkata metro orders while mining & construction and defense segments may have declined on lower demand and delay in obtaining clearances.

Order inflows fell by 25% YoY to Rs 3.7bn in Q1FY19. Recently, the company received an order worth Rs 8.3bn towards additional supply of 21 train sets (102 coaches) for Mumbai Metro lines 2 & 7. Order book stood at high of Rs 89bn, with a book-to-bill ratio of 2.3x FY20E sales. Order inflow pipeline remains robust in metros with Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi tenders expected in FY20 along with development orders from Coal India for large size trucks.

EBITDA loss margin fell by 60bp to 18.5% in Q4FY19. A 300bp fall in RM-sales ratio to 61.3% in Q1FY20 was due to decline in commodity costs and rise in vendor base. Employee costs was slightly up by 3% YoY to Rs 2bn. Other operating costs was lower by 3% to Rs 993 mn owing to various cost control measures and lower provisions. Accordingly, EBITDA losses were reduced by 44% to Rs 762mn in Q1FY20. As other income almost doubled, net loss plunged by 40% to Rs 969 mn vs loss estimates of Rs 1.1 bn. 


Investment RationaleThe brokerage raises earnings estimate by 5% in FY20E on healthy performance in Q1FY20. Accordingly, the target price has been raised by 3% to Rs 1,180 as we roll forward by a quarter to 27x (unchanged) June 2021E P/E.

The domestic stock market on Monday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 24 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

Phillip Capital has maintained buy rating on Repco Home Finance and revised target price to Rs 400 from Rs 485. Repco faced multiple headwinds like lack of growth in home market, liquidity crisis in NBFC industry and rising delinquencies in non-salaried segment, the brokerage said. As a consequence, the company underwent massive de-rating with 1-year forward price-to-book multiple contracting to 1.1 times from a peak of 4 times during FY17, the brokerage said. The liquidity crisis had a minimum impact on availability of fund for Repco, said Phillip Capital. The stock ended up 2.3 per cent at Rs 310.55 on Friday.


HDFC Securities has maintained buy rating on Spice-Jet with a target price of Rs 170. The brokerage said that SpiceJet will benefit from the benign competitive environment in the near term. The airline is gaining market share post Jet Airways closure, said HDFC Securities. However, it has lowered valuation multiples to factor in the grounding of the B737 MAX planes as the resolution of the same is expected to take longer than expected, said HDFC Securities. The stock ended up 3 per cent at Rs 143.50 on Friday.


Citi has a buy rating on Coal India with a target price of Rs 275. Coal India’s production was impacted by the cyclone in Odisha and plan to correct mine geometry post seasonally strong production in the fourth quarter of FY19, said Citi. The stock has corrected 24 per cent in a year due to volume weakness, weak global coal prices and divestment overhang, said Citi. While the overhang is here to stay, we reckon at 7.4 times 1-year forward PE on consensus the risk reward is favourable together with an attractive dividend yield, said Citi. The stock ended up 0.7 per cent at Rs 201.85 on Friday.

Jefferies has maintained hold rating on Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and revised target price to Rs 1,300 from Rs 1,250. While Jefferies expects improvement in margins going forward, the brokerage believes that competitive risks are still high and that the valuations leave no room for upside. The brokerage expects mature-hospital margin improvement to be gradual as competitive intensity from Fortis and others increases. Jefferies expects EBITDA CAGR of 17 per cent over FY19-21 led by 80 bps margin improvement. The stock ended up 8.3 per cent at Rs 1,471.25 on Friday.

CLSA has maintained buy rating on Maruti Suzuki India and lowered target price to Rs 7,200 from Rs 7,400. While there are few catalysts for any big demand pick-up in the nearterm, Maruti is the best way to play a potential recovery given higher likelihood of a rebound in PVs. The continued earnings cuts is a drag, but stock has been bottoming at higher multiples and has seen support at 20 times PE, said CLSA. The stock ended up 2.74 per cent at Rs 5,975.15 on Friday."

44,2019-08-20,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Foreign insurers are reducing their exposure to coal assets, which may have an impact on the 27 blocks being offered to companies.

Coal India is not affected as it outsources its risk to equipment suppliers. Private firms may face a challenge in the future although currently they easily get insurance cover for equipment from state-run firms, industry executives say.

Foreign insurers and lenders are lukewarm to the coal business as the fuel is dirty and adds to the greenhouse effect. Scientists say coal should be left underground as its use accelerates climate change. The first insurer to shun coal was AXA. Others that have already announced to stay away or reduce exposure in coal are Allianz, Swiss Re, Munich Re, Generali, XL Catlin, AXA, Zurich, Suncorp, QBE and Chubb.

Some of these firms like Allianz, Generali and AXA are present in India via joint ventures, while reinsurers like Swiss Re and Munch Re have been offering covers to Indian insurers for several years now. Reinsurers offer insurance covers to the risk insurance firms pick up from their clients."

46,2019-08-21,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India Chairman Anil Kumar Jha on Wednesday said renewables are unlikely to surpass coal as the major source for power generation in the near future and asserted that India's energy migration scenario will be different compared to many other countries. State-owned Coal India accounts for nearly 83 per cent of the country's coal production. 

 ""The question is can renewables take over coal completely in our country? Not in the near future at least. It would not be an exaggeration to state that Coal India Ltd (CIL) is synonymous with India's energy scenario,"" Jha told shareholders at the company's 45th annual general meeting here. 

 His remarks also come against the backdrop of increasing focus on renewable energy sources for generation of power in different parts of the world. 

 Jha said the energy migration scenario in India would be ""different"", compared to many other countries which have been switching to renewable sources. 

 According to him, nine mining projects having a total capacity of 69.88 million tonnes per year have been sanctioned and the estimated cost is Rs 9,093 crore. 

 Besides, two rail projects with an outlay of Rs 6,656 crore have been approved. 

 For the first time, Coal India had breached the 600 million tonnes-mark in production as well as off-take of coal. 

 The miner produced 606.89 million tonnes of coal and supplied 608.14 million tonnes of the dry fuel, representing growth of 6.97 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively, compared to the previous fiscal. 

 During the meeting, a shareholder, however, said he was disappointed watching stock price heading towards a lifetime low of Rs 200 a piece, since the initial public offer nine years ago when the price was Rs 235 per scrip. 

 In late afternoon trade, shares of the company was down nearly three per cent at Rs 189.35 on the BSE. 

 There was chaos at the venue as security personnel prevented entry of media persons during early part of the meeting and they were later allowed after intervention of a senior official.

“If block operators under the current round of auction fares well in terms of achieving milestones, operationalise their blocks and reaching their peak rated capacity, the Centre may allow more than 25% of production to be sold in the open market in subsequent rounds of coal block auctions,” Chaudhuri said.

In an effort to make sure operators can operationalise their blocks in the least possible time, the Centre is amending the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation), or MMDR, Act to scrap redundant approval requirement by states and is looking at increasing the number of coal exploration agencies through accreditation and empanelment. It is also focusing on coal evacuation infrastructure.

Currently, the Centre has offered to auction 27 coal blocks to private operators who would be allowed to sell 25% of their production in the open market. In case they cannot consume the rest 75% of their rated production, they are allowed to sell it to Coal India at notified prices.

In addition, it has offered nine blocks for public sector companies that can sell its entire produce in the open market.

“We will add four more blocks with total reserves of around 80 million tonnes for allotment to public sector companies,” said Ashish Upadhyaya, joint secretary at the coal ministry. Total peak rated capacity of all 46 blocks on offer will be 100 million tonne"

52,2019-08-23,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India, which is tasked with meeting the bulk of national coal demand, is looking at supply shortfall for five successive years even if it manages to meet production target every year, the coal ministry has estimated. This shortfall is likely to be reversed once the company achieves 1 billion tonnes in production in 2025-26.

Coal India's production target of 660 million tonnes (mt) for the year is 168 mt short of its total supply requirement, which considers meeting the entire requirement of existing consumers. However, if additional potential demand is considered, the shortfall may touch 262 mt.

According to data compiled by the ministry, commitment to power utility is 574.88 mt this year. Supply commitment for the non-regulated sector, like sponge iron, cement and steel, is pegged at 114.86 mt.

The company plans to auction 99 mt, and its temporary supply commitment is 35.2 mt. As part of its import substitution effort, some 4.5 mt is to be supplied. These add up to 828.45 mt.

However, if additional demand comes up, the figure is expected to touch 922 mt.

During 2022-23, production target is 822 mt and supply shortfall is estimated at 71.25 mt. If additional supply commitments are considered, it would be 185 mt.

Production target for 2023-24 is pegged at 880 mt and supply deficit is estimated at 1.24 m t. If additional supply commitments are considered, deficit is likely to be 115 mt.

In 2025-26, when the company achieves 1 billion tonnes, Coal India will have produced 71 mt of excess coal, however, if additional commitments are considered, it would turn into a deficit of 53 mt.

According to former Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya, the country may be looking at an additional deficit of 425 mt a year if the entire quantity of imported thermal coal for non-coastal power plants is to be replaced by domestic coal, capacity utilisation of power plants rise by 10% from existing levels, and if 40GW of stranded thermal assets are operationalised.

""Import substitution of noncoastal power plants would require some 125 mt of coal. Increased power demand is expected to result in a 10% rise in capacity utilisation of power plants, requiring an additional 100 mt of additional coal,"" he said. ""Operationalising 40 GW of stranded thermal assets may happen as a consequence of structural/ownership changes brought in through NCLT proceedings or bilaterally. This can potentially add 200 mt per year to coal demand over the medium term."""
53,2019-08-23,Coal India,"KOLKATA: If law & order situations are conducive and land acquisitions go as targeted, Coal India, may be able to substitute 120 million tonnes of imports with domestically coal in the next three years.

It is planning to ramp up production by 50-55 million tonnes annually over the next three years to achieve the target for import substitution.

“In an effort to increase production it will spend Rs 10,500 crore in ordering new equipment this year and the next,” said Coal India chairman, A K Jha.

“This will be possible if land acquisition for new projects and law & order conditions in certain states with heavy mining operations improve,” Jha said.

Coal India is looking at substituting imports of coal used in non-costal power plants only since it is not possible to substitute coal consumed by coastal power plants as it would not be economically viable for them to transport coal from domestic mines.

Jha said: “Last year the country produced 730 million tonnes of coal and consumed 965 million tonnes. The rest 235 million tons was imported. Out of this 115 million tonne of imports is inevitable since it is coking coal not abundantly available in the country. The rest, around 120 million tonnes can be replaced by Coal India’s production,” said Jha.

He was speaking at the media briefing for 8th Asian Mining Congress and IME Exhibition."
54,2019-08-23,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India on Friday said it is optimistic about the company's financial performance despite softening international prices.

E-auction price realisation for Coal India was Rs 2155 a tonne, a slump of nearly Rs 600 per tonne in the first quarter ended June 2019, compared to the preceding quarter (Jan-Mar 2019) average realisation of Rs 2754 a tonne.

""Our price is still 40 per cent lower than international prices,"" Coal India chairman A K Jha said when asked about easing coal prices.

The profit for 2018-19 was Rs 17462.18 crore, up from Rs 7038.44 crore in the previous year.

Coal India was planning to produce 660 million tonne in the current fiscal, an incremental production of 53 million tonne over 2018-19.

However, law and order issues will hold the key for production performance in some of its subsidiaries.

Mahanadi Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coalfields were facing issues related to law and order.

""Issues pertaining to South Eastern Coalfields had been resolved,"" Jha said.

SECL is the largest coal producing subsidiary of the company.

He expected coal production will increase but monsoon may have some disruptions.

Coal India has also started pushing higher supply to non-power.

Meanwhile, Australia's Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Matthew Canavan, will visit India from 26 -29 August beginning from Kolkata.

He will meet state Finance and Industry Minister Amit Mitra."

56,2019-08-27,Coal India,"In Q4 of FY2018-2019, the growth was phenomenal and to make the mines safer and more productive, we have taken some time in the first quarter of 2019-2020. But now we are geared up and production will start peaking again, says Anil Kumar Jha, Chairman, Coal India. Excerpts from an investment with ETNOW.

Looks like FY20 has kickstarted on a positive note for Coal India, especially on the pricing front. What was the realisation on account of market movement and conscious effort by Coal India to improve the mix?Cost reduction and quality improvement are the two major factors that helped us post good first quarter results irrespective of the fact that progress in production front was almost flat. In Q4 of FY2018-2019, the growth was phenomenal and to make the mines safer and more productive, we have taken some time in the first quarter of 2019-2020. But now we are geared up and production will start peaking again.


While FSA did well, e-auction premium struggled. Do you think the prices will stay capped?International prices have started falling and we have injected more coal to the market. Also, when supply is more, naturally the prices get slightly reduced and that is why we could not realise the e-auction price we used to get earlier because earlier the supply was always less than the demand. 


 Coal India has seen some struggles on the output front. For FY20, the output target is at 660 million tons. Would that be an achievable target?Yes, yes, we are very confident that we will meet the target.


Currently, how much coal is supplied to power and how much to non-power sectors? Would this ratio change going forward?Last year, we supplied 491 million tons of coal to power sector and it registered a growth of 8.2%. You will appreciate that in 2017-18 and 2018-19, a number of power plants were under super critical position. We have made a concerted effort that no power plant should suffer for want of coal. That is why on 1st April 2019, not a single power plant was in critical or sub critical position. 

The supply of coal to the power sector was definitely more. In the first and the second quarter of financial year 2019-20, we are supplying more coal to non-power as we have taken care of the requirements of the power sector. It will further improve and we will try to make up for the arrears. 


For FSA, what is the differential in pricing for supply to power versus non-power clients?There is a difference of around 20%.


Coal imports have been increasing. To what extent will Coal India be able to replace that going forward?Last year, this country produced 730 million tonnes of coal and total consumption was more than 965 million tonnes. So, there was a gap of around 235 million tonnes of coal. Out of that 235 million tonnes, around 50-55 million tonnes is coking coal and the rest around 190 million tonnes is non-coking coal. As far as coking coal is concerned, India does not have that quality and quantity of coking coal. So, coking coal will continue to be imported and every year this quantity will improve. 

The 50 million tonne is irreplaceable but as far as non-coking coal is concerned, we are still importing around 190 million tonnes of non-coking coal.


How will the planned Rs 10,000-crore capex be utilised for FY20 towards for increasing production and productivity?It will be reflected every year. This year, we are going to order heavy earth moving equipment worth around Rs 6,000 crore. When these fleets of equipment are added to the mine, their performance will definitely improve. We are adding around 50 to 55 million tonnes of coal every year by the addition of these equipment.


The coal ministry had once set an ambitious output target of about a billion tonnes. Do you think that Coal India has the capability to touch that level any time in the near future?I do not have even an aorta of doubt. This will definitely reach one billion tonne by 2025-26. It would have reached earlier but for certain conditions beyond our control like problem with acquisition of land, an iffy law and order situation in certain areas are pulling us back. Otherwise this target would have been reached much earlier but yes, I am very sure that by 2025-26, the $1 billion tonne target will be achieved."
57,2019-08-27,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) has selected Pramod Agarwal, a 1991 batch IAS from Madhya Pradesh cadre as the next chairman of Coal India. He will take over after the present chairman A K Jha retires in January 2020. Agarwal is currently principal secretary for urban development and housing department in Madhya Pradesh.

Coal India has had two IAS officers as its chairman in entire history. The first being, S. Narsing Rao, who took over in April 2012. He was succeeded by Sutirtha Bhattacharya, also an IAS officer, who retired in August 2017. The company also has a history of being run by government and defence officials. Its first chairman was Lieutenant General K S Garewal while there has been numerous chairman from public sector companies in the past.

According to the selection criteria external candidates were to have three years of residual service while internal candidates needed to have two years of service left.

The present chairman, Anil Kumar Jha, took over in May 2018, eight months after his predecessor, Bhattacharya, retired in August 2017. For the interim eight months, Coal India was steered by government officials and a chairman of a subsidiary company holding additional posts as the company’s chairman.

This time the centre wanted to select Jha’s successor well in advance so that Coal India does not have to run headless at a time when the company is pursing a target of producing one billion tonnes by 2025-26. The future of the company is also facing uncertainty as coal as a fuel is losing popularity globally.

PESB had shortlisted five candidates including two IAS officers, two Coal India executives and a managing director of an engineering PSU for the post.

Candidates in the race were Jyoti Kalash a 1990 batch IAS officer from Nagaland cadre. His seniority is that of an additional chief secretary and he is currently the resident commissioner for Nagaland in New Delhi.

Executives shortlisted by PESB from Coal India are Binoy Dayal, director technical at Coal India and P S Mishra, chairman and managing director at Coal India subsidiary, Eastern Coalfields.

59,2019-08-29,Coal India,"Global companies such as BHP, Peabody Energy and Glencore can now own coal mines and carry out related operations in India, with the cabinet approving 100% foreign direct investment under the automatic route in mining, processing and sale.

Wednesday’s move to fully open up coal mining to foreign players could help get latest technologies, reduce fuel shortages that have crippled the power sector, and boost economic growth by attracting fresh investment. It follows an earlier decision allowing commercial coal mining by private operators, ending Coal India’s monopoly.

""There is a little slowing down of FDI worldwide so we have taken some significant decisions; 100% FDI for coal mining and all related processing activities will be allowed under the automatic route,"" commerce and railways minister Piyush Goyal said at a media briefing.

“The FDI has been allowed for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to provisions of Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 as amended from time to time, and other relevant acts on the subject,” a statement issued after a cabinet meeting said. Associated processing infrastructure would include washery and facilities for crushing and coal handling, it said.

Currently, 100% FDI under the automatic route is allowed for coal and lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects as well as iron and steel and cement units. FDI is also permitted for setting up processing plants like washeries subject to the condition that the company shall not do coal mining or sell the washed or sized coal in the open market. They must, under the existing rules, supply the processed coal to those who are supplying raw coal to them.

Coal India’s director-finance Sanjiv Soni said the decision would lead to increased competition. ""Foreign direct investment will result in increased competition after a couple of years when foreign players start investing, as coal mining has a long gestation period,” Soni told ET. “Competition will result in additional supplies in the market and we feel prices should stabilise once these players start producing in India.""

Kameswara Rao, leader-energy, utilities and mining at PricewaterhouseCoopers India, called it a welcome step. Power companies are really the beneficiaries of this, “as they can now attract larger global operators with lower cost of capital to undertake endto-end coal mining of their allocated blocks to reduce the fuel costs”, he added.

The Coal Mines Special Provision Act 2015 provides for opening up commercial coal mining to private and public entities. The government had laid out the guidelines for commercial coal mining, but has yet to auction coal blocks for the purpose."

0,2019-09-01,Coal India,"Coal India (CIL) Sunday said its production in August fell by 10.3 per cent to 34.77 million tonnes. CIL's production in the same month a year ago stood at 38.78 million tonnes. 

Coal offtake during August too contracted by 10.4 per cent to 40.47 million tonnes as compared with 45.15 million tonnes in the year-ago month, CIL said in a regulatory filing to the BSE. 

The production and offtake figures are provisional, the company said. 

During the April-August period of this fiscal, coal output reported a dip of 2.8 per cent to 210.23 million tonnes, as against 216.21 million tonnes in the year-ago period. 

The coal offtake during the five-month period too contracted by 2.5 per cent to 240.57 million tonnes. RR MKJ"
2,2019-09-02,Coal India,"The Coal India counter has been going downhill for several years now and its price is quoting close to all-time lows. On an absolute basis, its share price crashed 48% over the past five years, compared to the Sensex gaining 39% during the same time. Uncontrolled stock supply by the government, in the form of divestments, is the main reason for this disaster.

The recent deep cut, however, was because of the government’s decision to allow 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in coal mining and related activities. As of now, FDI coal mining is allowed only for captive mining for power projects and Coal India is the only commercial coal miner. That means this increased competition will have a long-term negative impact on Coal India. Analysts, however, say its impact will be limited on Coal India due to several reasons. First, there will be a three to five years gestation period before coal production starts because of the lengthy procedures involved for coal licence allocation, land acquisition, environment clearances, etc. Second, it will aim to restrict coal imports, which jumped by 40% during the past one year.

While Coal India continues to report good numbers in other parameters, it disappointed on volumes. For example, its sales volume during the first quarter of 2019-20 remained nearly flat y-o-y and was down 6% q-o-q. However, Coal India is taking steps to improve coal production and analysts are expecting a small annualised volume growth of around 4% between 2018-19 and 2020-21. Despite the stagnant volume growth, its Ebitda and net profit were higher than street expectations due to better realisations in coal price and its net profit during the quarter zoomed by 22% y-o-y. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisations. Coal India’s efforts of keeping costs under control by shutting down old mines and increasing productivity at mines that are under operations are also yielding results.

Analysts are getting bullish on this counter now mostly because of its attractive valuations. For example, its enterprise value / Ebitda ratio is now placed around 3 times, significantly lower than its historical average of around 7 times. Similarly, other valuation ratios like PE, PB etc are also lower than its averages. More importantly, its dividend yield of around 7% is comparable to that of interest offered by many bank fixed deposits. With a cash pile of around Rs 31,000 crore—around 25% of its market capitalisation, Coal India is also maintaining high dividend rates.

1,2019-09-02,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government should allow only large companies — with a proven track record of developing big mines — to commercially mine coal, Vedanta Resources chairman Anil Agarwal said, even as the government is in the process of setting eligibility criteria for pilot auctions.

“The government should not be revenue-minded, it should be production-minded. I am confident that the government will auction very large coal blocks in commercial mining,” Agarwal said in an exclusive interview to ET. “Keep it simple and make sure only the right people come in. Allow only companies that have the background of developing large mines. Only large miners should be allowed to participate so that internationally people know that no one can fiddle around.”

ET on August 30 reported that the government was likely to auction large coal blocks for commercial mining to Indian and overseas miners by November-end.

A senior government official said the government would finalise coal blocks and the eligibility conditions for firms for participation in the auction of mines for commercial purposes. Global miners such as BHP, Peabody and Glencore have evinced interest in coal mining and carrying out related operations in the country, the official added.

Agarwal said the move to allow 100% FDI in commercial mining will make coal affordable and easily available, adding, some countries do not want India to produce and be self-sufficient in coal production.

“The world does not want us to produce… they will bring obstacles. But this move (allowing FDI) will bring higher environmental practices to India,” Agarwal said.

It is unfortunate that Coal India is the only company supplying coal to India, and there should be 5-10 such sources for affordable coal and competitive power costs, he said.

The Union Cabinet on August 29 approved 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in mining, sales and associated infrastructure. The Coal Mines Special Provision Act, 2015 paved the way for opening up commercial coal mining to private and public entities.

The Act, however, allowed 100% FDI under the automatic route for coal and lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects as well as iron and steel, and cement units. Overseas companies required a registered Indian company to participate in coal block auctions. The FDI was also permitted for setting up processing plants like washeries, subject to the condition that the company could not do coal mining or sell the washed or sized coal in the open market."
6,2019-09-04,Coal India,"Edelweiss Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Coal India with a price target of Rs 235.


Coal India reported a 10% YoY decline each in August production and sales volume, now down to their lowest levels in the past three years.


Key highlights:


·
Larger subsidiaries MCL and SECL accounted for the bulk of the decline.


·
Continued low rake availability – down to 178/day in August from 205/day in July – dampened offtake.


·
Production volume was hit by fatalities at MCL and SECL and higher-than-normal rainfall.




That said, we expect an uptick in production/offtake Q3 onwards as:


·
weather-related issues subside;


·
rake availability improves; and


·
production normalises at MCL and SECL.


“Hence, we do not believe our FY20E volume growth of 4.6% is at risk, but note that CIL’s target of 8.5% is daunting. That said, a healthy dividend yield and free cash flow are positives. We maintain a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 235 (8.6 times FY21E EPS),” the brokerage said."

7,2019-09-04,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India signed MOUs with two Russian entities in the areas of coking coal mining in the Russian Far East and the Arctic Region.

Coal India signed the first MoU with Far Eastern Agency for Attracting Investments and Supporting Exports (FEAAISE), an autonomous non-profit organization in Russia, for cooperating in their activities for mining coking coal in the Russian Far East and Arctic Region.

The second MoU was signed between Coal India and Eastern Mining Company (FEMC) of Russian Federation for exploring, identifying, sourcing, negotiating and consummating mutually beneficial investment opportunities in the mining sector in the Russian Far East.

The MoUs were signed by Coal India chairman, A K Jha and Leonid Gennadievich Petukhov, director general of FEAAISE and a senior executive at FEMC.

For the last several months Coal India is also looking at acquiring coking coal assets in Russia, Canada and Australia. In fact, it has recently, identified four potential coking and semi-coking coal assets, two each in Australia and Canada, for due diligence. It may acquire minority stake in each of these assets to start with, which may be gradually increased, based on its experience.

The assets identified in Australia are working mines where Coal India is looking at acquiring stakes while the assets identified in Canada are ready to produce blocks where explorations are complete, land acquired and environmental clearances received.

The final decision on the quantum of stake in each of these projects would be based on due-diligence reports. At present, it is in the process of inviting global tenders for appointing merchant bankers for undertaking due-diligence for the two identified assets in Australia. They will render financial due diligence and transaction advisory services for framing asset-specific investment proposal.

Coal India believes it may not be possible to bridge the entire demand gap of coking coal and high-grade low ash thermal coal, primarily because of limited availability of techno-commercially recoverable coking coal reserves and near absence of high-grade low ash thermal coal reserves in the country. This has necessitated overseas acquisitions.

The plan is to set up coking coal and high-grade thermal coal mining business overseas with a view to acquire coal resources, produce coal and import it either by opening new mines or through acquisition of equity participation in working mines on production sharing participation interest basis.

In the past, Coal India had acquired an exploratory block in Mozambique during August 2009. Following preliminary rounds of exploration, it discovered the block did not have good quality reserves and was subsequently forced to give it away."
5,2019-09-04,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: India has set up its own pavilion called the India Lounge with the support of the Roscongress Foundation at the 5th Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok where PM Narendra Modi is the Chief Guest to facilitate long-term big-ticket investments. 

The lounge will serve as a platform to demonstrate investment opportunities in the Far East, promote Indian investments in the region, and attract Russian investors to the growing economy of India. 

India's GDP will exceed $3 trillion this year as the country becomes one of the five largest economies in the world. Due to initiatives carried out by the Indian government to facilitate business, India has become the only nation in the world to be included in the list of the top ten leading countries in the World Bank's ease of doing business index two years in a row. 

India has the status of a guest country at the EEF 2019. At the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the main guest of the EEF 2019 and will head the Indian delegation at the forum. An agreement was previously reached during a business delegation's visit to Vladivostok to triple trade turnover between the two countries and increase it to $30 billion by 2025. The key to achieving this goal is to identify new opportunities to increase trade, which, in particular, will be facilitated by the India Lounge. 

The Kolmar company from Russia may open a new perspective for Indian metallurgists, the company has established convenient logistics, and a deep-water port is under construction, which will be launched in early 2020. At the EEF Russian-Indian panel discussion and the Russia-India business dialogue with the participation of leading entrepreneurs of the two countries will be devoted to issues of cooperation between Russia and India, in which Kolmar will take part.

The participants of the event, representatives of the official delegation of India, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as heads of major Russian and Indian companies, will discuss prospects for expanding bilateral economic ties and areas of interaction, outline steps to deepen industrial and technical cooperation between the economies of Russia and India, and they will also appreciate the prospects for inter-regional cooperation and joint investment projects.

In July and August Kolmar group held meetings with the largest Indian energy companies Tata Power and Coal India for the purpose of cooperation on investment projects in the Far East, the Coal India visited the Kolmar company in Yakutia.

“Today, regular deliveries of Russian anthracite are going to India, but the coking coal market has not yet been affected. The company may open a new opportunity for India to diversify the supply of metallurgical raw materials from Australia,” said Anna Tsivileva, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Kolmar Group."
4,2019-09-04,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal stocks have fallen at as many as 47 thermal power plants, with total installed capacity of 67,000 mw, to be barely enough for up to six days. These include a dozen plants which have just two days’ stocks, eight that have one day’s stocks and six that don’t have stocks for even one day. However, barring three plants, the situation is not considered ‘critical’ or ‘super critical’ in terms of coal stocks because they have used more coal than they were to be supplied between April and now.

Every power plant has a fixed quantity of coal that is to be supplied by Coal India Limited (CIL) every year. CIL strives to give some plants at least 90% of the allocated amount of coal and 75% in other cases. If the plants consume more than the quantity they are meant to be supplied during a certain period, calculated on a pro rata basis, the shortage of coal at these plants is not considered critical or super critical. Plants with payment issues are also not marked critical.

Nevertheless, a pithead plant with less than five days’ stock is considered critical while a plant with coal stock less than three days is considered super critical. A nonpithead plant which receives supplies through railways is considered critical if its coal stock is less than seven days. If stocks fall below four days it is considered super critical.

Plants marked critical or super critical receive special attention from the coal ministry, railways and CIL for replenishing stocks.

According to data compiled by the Central Electricity Authority, four of these 47 plants have been running at more than 90% capacity utilisation while nine have been running at 80-90% capacity utilisation. Eight plants ran at 70-80% capacity utilisation. A dozen power plants ran at 60-70% capacity utilisation.

However, coal supplied by CIL to power plants between April and August declined 4% year-on-year to 190 million tonnes. This included coal supplied to power plants and coal booked through forward e-auction for the power sector.

Between April and August, CIL produced 216 million tonnes of coal, down 2.6% year-on-year."

16,2019-09-05,Coal India,"BHUBANESWAR: A high-level committee of secretaries has recommended amending a section of mining laws that led to a fine of about Rs 19,000 crore levied on Odisha’s iron ore miners to spare a similar burden on state-owned companies and other miners elsewhere.

The committee — chaired by Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar and consisting of the cabinet secretary and secretaries of mines, steel, coal, revenue and finance — has concluded that if the reasoning applied to penalise mines in Odisha was applied to others, it would lead to “huge financial burdens on mining companies, including PSUs and would adversely impact their economic viability”.

If executed, the proposal could save Coal India alone a contingent liability of nearly Rs 53,331 core, the panel said in its report. ET has seen a copy of the report.

In August 2017, the Supreme Court had ruled that a mining operation conducted in violation of environment and pollution laws would also count as illegal and unlawful mining.

Under Section 21 (5) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act 1957, states are empowered to recover the entire value of illegally mined mineral or metal irrespective of the royalty, tax and duty paid. Since that ruling, the Naveen Patnaik-led Odisha government has collected more than Rs 15,000 crore in penalties for environment violations from various miners and initiated coercive action against those that haven’t paid.

The committee’s recommendation is also in contradiction to the stand taken by the Narendra Modi government during the course of hearings. In an affidavit dated January 20, 2017, it had made a submission before the Supreme Court that “all forms of mining without lawful authority, including that in breach of the limits imposed by the EC, carried out within the lease area would also invite penalties” under the MMDR Act.

The dilemma now is holding public sector undertakings and mines in other states to the same standards.

The committee, in its report, makes the same argument Odisha’s iron ore mines had made to the top court: that violations in the nature of mining in excess of environmental caps or without forest clearances not be punished by provisions dealing with illegal mining under the MMDR Act.
 It pointed out that the judgement had led to raising of huge demand on leaseholders in Odisha and Jharkhand. Other state may also impose similar penalties. “The fact does remain that compliance above judicial pronouncement is likely to create huge financial burden on mining companies including PSUs and will adversely impact their economic viability,” the report said. 

 Industry insiders said that in case the Act is amended then miners already penalised should also get the benefit.

“Why should Odisha’s iron ore miners alone have to be fined for exceeding the environment clearances?” said B Prabhakaran, owner of Thriveni Earthmovers that is the mining contractor to some of the largest iron mines in the country. “If such an amendment is under consideration, then Odisha's iron ore sector should be judged by the same yardstick, at par with other minerals, other states and irrespective of the organisation,” he told ET. “Captive mines had other resources, large firms could raise funds, it is the small private miner who suffered from this interpretation of the law, and is struggling to comply,” he added. 

Odisha’s mines director Deepak Mohanty, however, said any amendment will have to be perspective and won’t affect their demands. “I can’t comment on how other states chose to act; we have scrupulously followed the SC’s orders, adopting legal procedures even against government agencies,” he told ET.

Odisha and Jharkhand have slapped demand notices on Coal India subsidiaries since the landmark ruling in 2017. While Odisha demanded Rs 20,169 crore from Mahanadi Coalfield, since reduced to Rs 10,289 crore, Jharkhand asked for Rs 33,714 crore from Central Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal.

Jharkhand has also sent claims totalling Rs 3,273 crore to iron ore miners, including around Rs 1400 crore from state-owned Steel Authority of India. Its mines, unlike those in Odisha, have continued to operate with part, or no payment, under orders from the High Court of Jharkhand.

Hearing a petition from Hindalco against a demand of Rs 103 crore on excess mining of bauxite, for example, the HC weighed in on the fact that “the lessee was among the country’s largest aluminium producers and wasn’t being accused of illegal mining”.

Similarly, Coal India’s subsidiaries have received relief from the central mines ministry’s revisional authority (RA). Odisha’s demands from bauxite mines, to, have been stayed by RA.

 “We have written to the RA to vacate the stay and for speedy disposal of the matter,” said Aboobacker Siddique P, mines secretary of Jharkhand. “Some iron ore miners have paid 30%, some 15% and are operating under HC orders, asking us to issue transport challans.”

Against total demand of Rs 39,399 crore, Jharkhand only received Rs 615 crore until now. Meanwhile, the Telangana and Goa governments have argued the 2 August 2017 order is only applicable to mines in Odisha.


Amendment Sought in MMDR Act
Section 21(5) of the MMDR Act says: Whenever a person raises without any lawful authority any mineral from any land, the state government may recover from such person the mineral so raised or where any such minerals have already been disposed of the price thereof and may also recover from such a person rent, royalty, or tax, as the case may be, for the period during which the land was occupied by such a person without any lawful authority.

The high-level committee has suggested replacing “without any lawful authority” with “in contravention of the provisions of this Act and rules made thereunder”. This would help revise penalties for violation of rules related to environment, pollution and other issues."

18,2019-09-06,Coal India,"Any changes in divestment or dividend policies would benefit undervalued public sector undertakings (PSUs) such as Indian Oil, BPCL, Bharat Electronics, ONGC, NTPC, Powergrid Corporation, NMDC and Petronet LNG, among others, which could offer good value to the investors, analysts said. Stocks such as Coal India, Hindustan Copper, ONGC, BPCL, National Aluminium and Indian Oil rallied up to 10 per cent intraday on Thursday over news the government is likely to sell stake in state-owned companies through strategic divestments instead of an offer-for-sale or exchange traded funds (ETFs).

The multiple offerings of CPSE ETF over the past one year has acted as a key overhang for some PSU stocks, which remained flattish during this period. BSE PSU plunged 18 per cent in the last one year against 3.5 per cent decline of the Sensex.

“The news of a possible rethink on selling of government stake at the present low valuations have come as a relief to public sector companies that are anyway trading at attractive valuations,” said Gaurav Dua, senior VP, head, capital market strategy, Sharekhan. “Within the PSU basket, we prefer Bharat Electronics, ONGC, NTPC, Powergrid Corporation and Petronet LNG.”



In the past, public sector companies have grossly underperformed due to the hangover of additional supply of paper by the government to raise resources. Lately, the government also resorted to transfer of its holdings to cash-rich companies or via regular cash transfer by way of dividend payouts.

Stocks such as Steel Authority of India, National Aluminium, BHEL, Gail and Coal India have declined between 20 per cent and 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.

“The government’s current stance of not willing to sell at distress valuations is a significant positive and that has been the reason for the interest in state-run stocks,” said Naveen Kulkarni, head of research, Reliance Securities. “PSU companies have seen consistent declines because of lots of supply from the government.” Stocks such as Ircon International, REC, Hindustan Aeronautics, NTPC and Engineers India currently offer an attractive dividend yield between 4 per cent and 10 per cent. A few of them like NMDC, ONGC, BHEL, National Aluminium and Oil India are trading at their book value.

“Some of the PSUs with sound fundamentals can offer good trading opportunities for the midterm if government changes its divestment and dividend policies,” said Asutosh Mishra, head of research, institutions, Ashika Stock Broking. “Stocks such as HPCL, BPCL, Indian Oil, NMDC, among others, with clear earnings visibility are currently available at discounted valuations.”

In her budget speech on July 5, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would continue with strategic disinvestment of select central public sector enterprises. The government has raised the divestment target for financial year 2020 to Rs 1.05 lakh crore from Rs 90,000 crore earlier."

Last week, the centre allowed 100% FDI in coal which the unions think is detrimental to their interest in India.

Unions that jointly served the strike notice are INTUC, AITUC, HMS and CITU. The notice includes four-point charter of demands to the Centre after a convention in Ranchi on Thursday and have threatened indefinite strike if their demands are not met.

""All trade unions except BMS under BJP has joined the strike call on September 24,"" All India Coal Workers Federation general secretary DD Ramanandan said.

The unions have also demanded that all subsidiaries of CIL such as ECL, BCCL, CCL, CMPDL, SECL, MCL be merged into CIL. The demand comes after alleged government plan to separate all subsidiaries from Coal India Ltd. It also urged the Centre to lift ban on appointments."
27,2019-09-06,Coal India,"We do not expect the current consumption slowdown phase in the economy to persist forever. So this is the time to pick stocks in this space for the next three to five years, says Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Currently, markets are most concerned with the outlook on earnings growth. How soon do you see that improving? Is it a while away?From an earnings point of view, we are in for a long grind ahead, given the weak underlying economic momentum and various sectors which are facing stress right now. In any case, for FY20, the earnings recovery or rather the projected earnings recovery was built on the thesis of banking earnings recovering. Even after the first quarter of FY20, where we have cut our Nifty EPS estimate by 4% and have around 13% profit growth estimate for FY20, the fact remains that if we take out the corporate banks, the Nifty earnings are expected to grow just 3%. 

So a lot rests on what happens to the banks and what happens to the asset quality if there is a delay in the resolution of NCLT cases. With the guidance of the various banks from the first quarter earnings season as well as the ones who attended our 15th Annual Global Conference a fortnight back, more cases of stress are emerging and that is clouding the outlook for banks earnings for this year. So to that extent, the earnings recovery or rather the risk to the earnings downgrade have become elevated.

Secondly, consumption slowdown is here which is the big takeaway from the first quarter GDP print. Along with auto, more sectors are facing problems and that is getting reflected in the FY20 earnings. We can see another 3-4% downgrades from here. We might end up FY20 with 7% earnings growth like in FY19 and FY18. We had hoped for 15% earnings growth for FY20 but those hopes are getting bashed in the first half itself.


This year IT space was dealt a blow with a tax on share buyback, that was announced in the budget. What are you expecting from IT and which stocks do you like here?We are positive on IT for sometime now. It remains the most sensible defensive in India right now. Consumer is a defensive but very exorbitantly priced and pharma has ceased to be a defensive long back, even though earnings as well as valuations have corrected.

In that context, IT remains one of the best defensives in India. Earnings growth is reasonable at 8%-10%, very high quality balance sheets and managements plus 80-100% payouts . From an investor’s perspective, it should be immaterial whether you are getting the cash back in the form of dividends or buybacks. Obviously, some taxation impact will be there but even then the payout ratios are very high. 

Therefore we like tier one IT right now. Even in the last three-four quarters, the growth differential between the tier one and tier two has extinguished completely and that is why you are seeing tier two stocks are now trading at a discount. 

One or two years back, tier two stocks were trading at a premium. The commentaries from the first quarter has been pretty good; deal sizes, deal wins are pretty solid. Tech Mahindra already has about a billion-dollar-deal from AT&T. Clearly, IT stands out and at the margin in the last 20-30 days you have seen currency depreciation also coming to its help.

We like Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech and one should have a positive view on IT at this stage given the way the currency has behaved in the last 20-30 days. Nifty IT should do well relatively in this kind of an environment.


Among individual sectors, consumption and utilities are looking attractive. Where do you see opportunity?In case of utilities, the biggest thing in their favour right now is the interest rate. Interest rates are coming down and the outlook for interest rates remains very soft. We should not be surprised if there is another 40-50 bps rate cut by RBI. Valuations are at its lowest in a decade at sub one time price to book to 1.2 times price to book even for largecap companies. Dividend yields are very attractive at 4-5%. We are more positive on utilities than we were a year or six months back. We like NTPC and Coal India in this space. 

There is a distinct slowdown in consumption which is manifested in the first quarter numbers. The slowdown is more apparent in the discretionary side than on the staple side because most of the staple companies are yet to report volume decline. 

Now consumption still remains very expensive despite the time correction that we have seen in many stocks over the last one year. But this is a very long-term story and we do not expect the current consumption slowdown phase in the economy to persist forever. So this is the time to pick stocks in this space for the next three to five years. From that view point, we have been very positive on Titan, Hindustan Lever, Pidilite, Britannia as well as Marico. This is a very good opportunity for people to accumulate these stocks knowing fully well that they may not do much over the next couple of quarters, because of the way the slowdown has played out so far.


What makes you optimistic on Bharti Airtel? We have a very simple view on Bharti Airtel. We think the ARPUs have bottomed out and can be expected to improve gradually from here. Secondly, from a balance sheet perspective, they have raised some capital and are in the process of deleveraging plus the announcements on Jio yesterday have not been so disruptive. 

There was the fear a couple of weeks back but given that the lowest ARPU is around Rs 699, it does not seem as disruptive. At the same time, their main competitor continues to be in trouble as far as the balance sheet is concerned. Their debt is quite high and all of these factors have combined with the fact that valuations have also come off and the stock has been absolutely flattish for the last four or five years. 

We believe that it offers a reasonable margin of safety and if there is a decent pick up that we can see in ARPU over the next couple of quarters, then it also offers a reasonable upside as well."

Company Financials

For the quarter ended 30-06-2019, the company has reported consolidated sales of Rs 23223.00 crore, down -13.04% from last quarter sales of Rs 26704.27 crore and up 3.64% from last year same quarter sales of Rs 22407.73 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 4630.63 crore in the latest quarter. 

Investment Rationale

The company’s ability to hike Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) prices and increase evacuation charges reflect its dominant position in the industry, said the brokerage. Decline in Coal India’s valuation coincides with a fall in valuations of coal mining companies globally and the recent announcement by mining companies to exit coal production have raised questions on the sustainability of coal, and continued government divestment may be an overhang in the near-term, added the brokerage."
30,2019-09-11,Coal India,"HDFC Asset Management, India’s largest money manager by assets, was busy buying select banks, PSU and infrastructure stocks all through August, even as BSE Sensex slid marginally by 0.40 per cent.

The fund house increased exposure to YES Bank, ITC, NHPC, Coal India and SBI; stocks that have plunged between 7 per cent and 65 per cent since January 2019. It added 1.59 crore shares of Bharat Electronics whose share price has rallied nearly 25 per cent so far this calendar. BSE benchmark Sensex is up just 2.46 per cent year to date.

“Indian equities are offering good value,” Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC Asset Management, told ETNow. “When largecaps start offering good value, you are unlikely to get it wrong, because these are big businesses with low leverage. Corporate leverage in India has come down,” he said.

Ace Mutual Fund database showed HDFC AMC held 6.02 crore shares of YES Bank as of August 31 against 2.57 crore a month earlier, hinting that the fund house sees value in the private sector lender.

“Most of the businesses, which were in deep pain have either been sold or are in a state where they do not really matter. They are doing reasonably well and things are okay,” he said.

The fund house bought 71.50 lakh additional shares in oil-to-telecom behemoth Reliance Industries.

Analysts have turned upbeat on the prospects of RIL stock after its telecom arm Reliance Jio this past week rolled out its broadband offering JioFiber across 1,600 cities.

“This is disruptive. The consumers targeted use data in a big way,” said Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director at KR Choksey Investment Managers. He expects the stock to double in three years.

HDFC AMC also added shares of banking majors ICICI Bank (30 lakh shares), Axis Bank (21.67 lakh) and HDFC Bank (17.51 lakh) besides doing a fair bit of buying on the counters of DCB Bank (16.61 lakh), RBL Bank (7.50 lakh) and Federal Bank (7.59 lakh).

Saravana Kumar, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund, says retail-focused private lenders with strong balance sheets should do well going forward. “These banks will also corner some market shares from NBFCs and PSUs,” he said.

Jain’s team at HDFC Mutual Fund also bought over 10 lakh shares each in Avenue Supermarts, Tata Steel, Delta Corp, BPCL, Bajaj Electricals and Indian Hotels.

Inox Fluorochemicals, Pidilite Industries, Piramal Enterprises, SRF and Sterling and Wilson were among the fund house’s fresh buys, while it completely exited Havells India and Shree Cement.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 122 companies and offloaded shares of 33 across sectors. It held 314 stocks as of August 31, 2019.

Among the stocks in which the fund house offloaded between 1 lakh to 2.50 crore shares during the month were BHEL, SAIL, Reliance Nippon Life Asset, NIIT Technologies, Tata Chemicals, Shriram Transport Finance, Just Dial, Bharti Airtel, Ambuja Cement, Elecon Engineering, Zee Entertainment, Rites, Wonderla Holidays, Solar Industries, S Chand and IndiaMART InterMESH.

It also sold more than 1 lakh shares of auto majors including Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp. India this August recorded the steepest drop in auto sales ever since the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) had started collating monthly wholesale vehicle sales data in 1997-98.

Jain of HDFC Asset Management said he sold auto stocks mainly due to valuations. “The prices have come down, but multiples have not come down because earnings will also de-grow sharply. First investment has to revive, salaries have to go up and only then can we make a case for a sustained revival in consumer discretionary,” he said."
29,2019-09-11,Coal India,"MUMBAI: Even as the government pushes the ‘Make in India’ initiative to develop manufacturing in the country, IT & financial services have turned out to be the biggest employers — both account for half of the jobs among all listed companies. Incidentally, these two sectors are also the biggest hirers of women.

A study of the top 250 listed companies by investment bank CLSA has shown that of the total 45 lakh jobs generated by them, more than half were in just the two sectors, with financials employing 28% of the total workforce, or 13 lakh people, and IT another 26%. Within financials, the public sector employs 60% of the workforce.

Private firms continue to be the main source of job-creation, as public-sector headcount declined 2.6% in FY19. Private-sector headcount, on the other hand, increased by 9.2%. The decline in public-sector jobs was the sharpest seen in recent years. The two biggest listed public-sector employers — Coal India and State Bank of India (SBI) — on a net basis, cut their workforces year-on-year (YoY) by 4.4% and 2.6% respectively.

In the report ‘Boardroom nectar — Distilling the essence of India’s annual reports’ by Mahesh Nandurkar and Abhinav Sinha, job growth among listed companies in FY19 was 4.1% YoY for a comparable set of 238 companies, rising from 1.4% growth in FY18. This was a three-year high. “If we add the three large outsourcing job service providers, then the growth rises to 6%. In absolute terms, nearly 0.25 million net jobs were created during the year,” the report said.



At almost 420,000 employees, Tata Consultancy Services has the largest workforce of all the listed companies in India. TCS has employed the largest number of women — at 152,114 female employees — accounting for 36% of their workforce. Infosys has the highest proportion of women in their workforce, at 37%. The biggest hiring increase was by Quess Corp, which hired 56,300 employees in the last year.

Public sector companies have shrunk their workforce for the second consecutive year, which is largely through attrition as there has not been any major separation scheme. One outcome of this attrition is that the average age is coming down. “Punjab National Bank (PNB) has been working to bring down the average age of the organisation. Over FY14-19, PNB’s average employee age fell from 46 to 40, which should help deal with digitalisation of the financial industry,” the report said

Meanwhile, leading IT company Infosys has seen an ongoing decline in its share of employees below the age of 30. This is partly on account of weaker top line growth and partly as a result of hiring more experienced staff."

31,2019-09-12,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Successful bidders of the current round of coal block auctions can use extracted coal at any of their plants including those at subsidiaries, provided the end-use plant is similar to the one specified during the auction. Earlier, operators were tied to the plant specified during the auction.

The Centre, however, has rejected prospective bidders’ request of selling coal to Coal India at notified prices for the non-regulated sector, which is almost 20% higher than notified. They asked for a higher price as this round of auction was for the non-regulated sector — for which Coal India charges higher.

Initially, the Centre had said that sale to Coal India will be at a discount of 15% on the notified price for sectors other than power utilities. Subsequently, they clarified that such a sale will be at a discount of 15% over the notified price for the power sector as well, offering Coal India over 20% margin for selling this coal in the open market. A block operator can sell up to 50% of their produce to Coal India in a year.

Utilisation of coal at any other plant by the bidder would, however, be subject to the ministry’s scrutiny and prior approval from the Centre. “The block operator needs to inform the government at least 30 working days before it starts to divert coal to any other plants,” a senior executive from a prospective company said.

Under the current round of auction, the government has offered to auction 27 blocks under three tranches — 8th, 9th and 10th — and successful bidders can sell 25% of the produce in the open market.



Three dozen companies, including Reliance Cement, UltraTech Cement, Balco, Ambuja Cements, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, Birla Corporation, ACC Cement and Vedanta are prospective bidders for the current round.

Out of the 27 blocks on offer, 20 mines are estimated to hold an extractable reserve of 1 billion tonnes. According to mining plans, these blocks can produce a total of 36 million tonnes a year, of which 9 million can be sold in the open market.

Financial biddings are to be held between October 10 and November 8. Final allotments are likely to happen by November 11."

33,2019-09-13,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: A high level committee, comprising cabinet secretary, Department of Economic Affairs secretary, revenue secretary, coal secretary and Niti Aayog vice-chairman, has recommended some sweeping policy changes to reform the coal sector, ET NOW reported.

Govt sources told the channel that a high-level panel has recommended reforms to privatise the coal sector. One of the biggest recommendations is to move away from any allocation of captive coal mines. A one-year roadmap has been recommended to shift all concessions to commercial mining.

All new auctions or allotments of coal mines has been recommended for commercial purpose only.

The committee also recommend removal of private sector’s disadvantageous position by doing away with the direct coal allotment to PSUs. 

Other recommendations included privatising Coal India’s washeries to reduce India’s 80 per cent import dependency on coking coal for steel, in addition to incentivise the private sector by auctioning coking coal linkages for 20 years.

Coal India should auction 222 non-operational, loss making mines on production sharing basis, the committee recommended."
35,2019-09-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI | KOLKATA: Staterun firms are enforcing austerity measures such as ending leave encashment and penalising non-performers with salary cuts, particularly in loss-making companies, in a slowing economy that has hurt consumer demand.

In some cases, extreme steps such as an across-the-board 25% salary cut for senior executives in a poorly performing Coal India subsidiary was discussed, although finally rejected. But former landline phone monopoly Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, whose wage bill absorbs 75% of its revenue, has decided to cut salaries to the extent staffers failed to meet targets.

The oil sector is also abuzz with expectations of austerity measures, but company executives say they have not received any such communication. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) recently suspended leave encashment to improve cash flow, while several others including Steel Authority of India stopped leave encashment in the last 2-3 years.

Bhel has told its employees that it needs to judiciously utilise cash for buying raw material, manufacturing operations and execution of projects and is making efforts to realise locked up cash.

“In the recent times, the company has been facing strain over the availability of funds for running its operations. Business sectors/units are taking special efforts to realise the cash locked up with customers due to various reasons. This financial condition thus demands that cash outflow on various accounts are regulated to survive in the current situation and cash availability is prioritised for meeting the working capital requirements for purchase of raw materials, manufacturing/operations and project execution. Under these compelling circumstances, it has been decided to suspend in-service encashment of earned leave,” the company said in its circular issued to its employees.

Encashment of earned leave will, however, be allowed for meeting financial requirements for higher education or marriage of children and in case of resignation, superannuation, death, or accumulation of more than 300 leaves, Bhel told its employees. It did not respond to an emailed query from ET.

Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has also suspended leave encashment. “HAL has stopped leave encashment for employees who are in service as part of austerity measure. However, those retiring are given the full benefits including the leave encashment,” company spokesman Gopal Sutar said in response to ET’s query.

However, the company is promptly paying all perks and allowances included in salaries. “We are hopeful of improvement in our financial position in near future,” he said.

Analysts said HAL has receivables of over Rs 20,000 crore from the government, which has squeezed its cash flow and forced it to take advances from banks to pay salaries. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) has penalised staff that failed to meet landline and broadband expansion targets in August, by way of deductions in their September salary.

An internal BSNL memo, dated September 9, said a review of the achievements for August 2019 shows that many field units had failed to meet landline and broadband targets for which “penalty in the form of recovery from salary in proportion to non-achievement of targets is hereby imposed”. The memo, however, said that the salary deductions “would be rolled back,” for employees who achieve their pending as well as September targets. A BSNL spokesman declined to comment.




In July, BSNL set aggressive sales targets in a bid to rein in operational losses. Its landline team was asked to retain the fixed-line user base as on March 2019, and at least double the fibre-to-the-home connections provided in FY19.

BSNL, which has 164,000 employees, had delayed salary payments for March, July and August this year. Its average monthly salary bill is Rs 800 crore.

The state-run telco, which operates in 20 circles barring Mumbai and Delhi, has accumulated losses of over Rs 57,500 crore since FY10 in the face of private competition. Losses in FY19 are likely to be another Rs 14,000 crore.

Another company where severe austerity was considered is South Eastern Coalfields Ltd, a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd. whose board took note of its audit committee’s recommendation that all executives from the level of deputy general manager and above should lose 25% of their salary from August this year in view of the poor performance in the June quarter. The recommendation was rejected because Coal India adopts a uniform HR approach across subsidiaries."
36,2019-09-14,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The centre has decided to meet three central workmen unions out of the five that served a one-day strike notice on 24
th September protesting foreign direct investment in coal. A sixth union, Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) served a five-day strike notice from 23
rd to 27
th September on the same issue.

Five unions that served one-day strike notice are Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers’ Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers’ Federation (CITU) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU).

The centre has scheduled a meeting with AITUC, HMS and CITU leaving out INTUC, AICCTU and BMS.

“The agenda of the meeting, among other things, include our demand for rollback of FDI in coal. However, as the centre has invited only three out of the six trade unions that served strike notice, we don’t see any solution to come up during the meeting which has been scheduled on Sunday,” said D D Ramanandan, general secretary, All India Coal Workers Federation.

The unions had earlier said that they would not enter into dialogues with anyone other than the coal ministry to discuss their demand and has already refused to accept meeting invitations from the Chief Labour Commissioners and the Coal India management.

These workmen unions represent almost 5.2-odd lakh employees of Coal India, Singaraini Collieries and contract workers at coal mines.

Coal fuels bulk of India’s power generation and the development comes at a time when power demand is growing at around 6%. A large number of plants are in requirement of additional coal for keeping up their generation pace and it is estimated that a day’s production disruption may lead to losses between Rs 110 crore and Rs 130 crore for Coal India.

Other demands made by the unions include merger of all subsidiaries of Coal India into Coal India so that they cannot be spun into separate companies, offering permanent employment to contract coal workers and reintroduction of norms for employment of family members.

Earlier Coal India used to offer permanent job at Coal India to a member of an employee’s family in case of accidental or natural death during service period. Workmen’s family members were also offered job at Coal India in case they turned unfit for work due to unhealthy working conditions in mines. Landowners giving away their holding to Coal India for mining were also offered jobs. These, the unions' claims are being discontinued and they want the practices to be resumed."
37,2019-09-16,Coal India,"Coal India has abandoned its move to cut supplies to inefficient power plants following resistance from customers. It had planned to cut the yearly quota by 80 million tonnes.

A government panel had suggested introduction of an upper limit of coal supply for each megawatt of installed capacity, which reduces supply to old, inefficient plants on the basis of a formula it suggested. “We were first asked to revise the annual contracted quantities for each plant based on the recommendations by the panel,” a Coal India executive said. “However, following calculation for revised quantities, a number of plants were to receive less coal, which was not taken lightly by the power companies and we were later asked by the power ministry to abandon the initiative.”

On the basis of recommended efficiency parameter, the quota of NTPC would fall to 131 million tonnes a year from 163 million tonnes. Damodar Valley Corporation was to receive 5 million tonnes less than its yearly quota of 26 million tonnes, while Mahagenco was to receive 13 million tonnes less than its yearly quota.

Coal India was to supply 560 million tonnes to these power companies going by their consumption norms. According to the new calculation, they were to receive 477 million tonnes, almost 83 million tonnes less.

A senior power company executive said the move would have reduced supply in the sector that is growing at 6% per annum. It would have reduced capacity utilisation, which is already down to around 60%, and increased losses apart from disrupting electricity supply."
44,2019-09-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA: India needs a coal regulator in the line of TRAI or CEA especially since the sector is being opened up to foreign investment and commercial mining is being allowed, M K Singh, technical secretary to Coal India chairman, said at mjunction organised 13th Coal Conference in Kolkata on Tuesday.

""One thing we are missing is the National coal regulator for industry of such a size and such diversity. This is the time we should plan for a very strong coal regulator combining nitty-grities of all stakeholders,"" Singh said.

The world’s largest coal producer is closely observing interests from overseas and private sector following government announcement of allowing 100% foreign direct investment in Coal he said.

In wake of opening up of coal sector for foreign direct investment and allowing commercial mining the coal ministry is framing a National Coal Index Singh said.

A high-powered panel in 2018 had recommended developing a Coal Index for determining the value of blocks and a revenue-sharing model with the states. Currently, the valuation is on the basis of the notified price of Coal India Ltd.

“CIL’s growth plan for the future is in synergy with the ambitious plan of the government for 24X7 power supply to all homes in the country for which a roadmap to achieve 880 million tonnes of coal production by 2024-25 has been finalised,” said Singh.

Giving details of Coal India projects waiting for central approval that are crucial for ramping up its production, Singh said, ""Coal India has submitted 85 proposals with annual production capacity of 493 million tonnes for environmental clearances. Some 89 proposals involving 26,000 hectares of forest land diversion has also been submitted . Expeditious clearances of proposals and consent of communities are important."""
43,2019-09-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Talcher Fertilizers Ltd (TFL) has awarded its project on a lump sum term key (LSTK) contract basis to Wuhuan Engineering Co. Ltd of China. The Chinese company will will implement coal gasification and ammonia/urea packages for the project. The project is expected to be commissioned by the third quarter of 2023.

In order to augment domestic urea capacity, the government had taken up revival of closed fertilizer units of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. Accordingly, the centre mandated TFL, a joint venture company of nominated PSUs RCF, CIL, FCIL and GAIL, to revive the Talcher unit of FCIL.

With an estimated investment of Rs 13,277 crore the project will have a production capacity of 1.27 MMTPA of Neem coated urea through gasification of a mixed feedstock comprising of high ash Indian coal and petcoke.

TFL has been allotted northern part of North Arkhapal mine as the captive mine for meeting its coal requirements and petcoke shall be sourced from Paradip refinery of IOCL.

TFL has been executing many of the pre project activities at site which are essential before actual project work commences. Activities like site development, provision of construction water and power and guest house are currently underway at the Talcher site and shall be completed soon.

Tendering process for other major packages is also underway and it is expected that majority of the tenders shall be awarded before end of this fiscal.

This project is expected to improve India's self-sufficiency in urea and promote agriculture growth thereby reducing the import of urea in the country which shall in turn is expected to have a significant effect on the LNG imports besides providing employment opportunities to the local populace and also flipping the ancillary industries in the region.

Further success of this technology shall open up new areas in the Indian energy context leading to alternative use of high ash Indian coal in the areas other than conventional thermal power production."

The tribunal has allowed the compensation due to the shortage of domestic coal, the company said in a regulatory filing.

""Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) has issued a judgement, allowing the claim of compensation for non-availability/shortage in linkage coal supply from Coal India Ltd, and use of alternate coal by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, APRL in respect of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) of 1200 MW signed with Distribution Companies of Rajasthan,"" a BSE filing said.

APTEL has allowed compensation for domestic coal shortfall arising from change in law pertaining to the New Coal Distribution Policy, 2007 (NCDP), and the Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India policy of the Government of India (SHAKTI Policy).

In addition to this, the company said that the APTEL has also granted carrying cost pertaining to the above.

The APTEL has further directed the discoms to pay to APRL, the balance amount of change in law compensation pertaining to NCDP along with carrying cost within two months from the date of Judgement and the claim pertaining to the period after the grant of coal linkage under the SHAKTI Policy, along with carrying cost within three months of submission of claim along with requisite documents by APRL."
41,2019-09-17,Coal India,"India Ratings & Research expects capacity utilisation to improve as power demand is expected to hover between 6-7% during the remaining part of the fiscal despite general slowdown of demand. However, it has maintained a stable-to-negative outlook on the sector for the remaining part of the current fiscal.

In a ratings statement Ind-Ra said the stable-to-negative outlook reflects mounting receivables by state distribution companies (discoms) due to inadequate improvement in operational parameters, uncertainty as exhibited by some discoms to honour existing power purchase agreements and continued dependence on imported coal due to lower domestic production.

Ind-Ra notes that the growth in power demand from main manufacturing hubs like Haryana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, has been lower than all-India power demand growth of 6.7% in April-July 2019. However, the growth at all-India level was supported by addition of around 26.4 million new electricity consumers under the Saubhagya scheme.

Ind-Ra believes while power demand would continue to increase, the overhang of the stressed capacity and increase in excess thermal capacity over FY15-FY19 would continue to prevent fresh private thermal capacity addition. Further, given the negative coal production growth reported by Coal India during April-July 2019, reliance on imported coal, which increased during the same period, is likely to remain high for rest of FY20.

Ind-Ra expects credit profile of public and private sector entities to improve in FY20 due to capitalisation of capital work in progress of few public players, likelihood of successful implementation of resolution of the coastal-based capacity for all coastal-based Ultra Mega Power Projects.

The agency believes central players would be able to manage liquidity even when discoms dues rise, on account of strong cash balances, access to the banking system and long-dated debt. However, liquidity profile of few state players remains contingent on timely receipt of state governments’ support. Further, renewable holding companies may face liquidity issues in case of unresolved issues of receivables from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana discoms."
39,2019-09-17,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Workmen at Coal India (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company (SCCL) are likely to go on a one-day strike on September 24 after the Centre and staff unions failed to reach common ground during talks held over the weekend. Staff members want industrial action against the government’s move late August allowing total foreign ownership of coal mines.

Five unions working together have refused to hold further discussions with the government before October. It is estimated that Coal India, the near-monopoly miner of the solid fuel, may lose up to Rs 130 crore a day due to industrial action.

“As the centre invited only three out of the six trade unions that served a strike notice, we refused to discuss the issue … We will not participate in any further discussions before October and the strike will be on as scheduled,” said D D Ramanandan, general secretary, All India Coal Workers Federation.



Unions that served strike notices are Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers’ Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers’ Federation (CITU) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU). A sixth union, Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), served a five-day strike notice from September 23 to 27."
38,2019-09-17,Coal India,"Coal India needs to step up production to meet India’s coal import requirements of 235 million tonnes. The state-run miner must do this, overcoming its own constraints and increasingly erratic and taxing climatic conditions. In an interview, Coal India CMD Anil Kumar Jha addresses some pressing and some recurrent issues.


Coal India unions have called for a strike against government’s decision to allow 100% FDI in mining. How are you reassuring them?
Yes, the unions have called for a strike on September 24. We are in constant dialogue with them, and even had a meeting. This is government of India’s decision.


What’s your view?
Competition is welcome, we are ready for it.


What are your concerns on economic slowdown. Will it affect capital expenditure and targets of Coal India?
As far as Coal India is concerned, there is absolutely no slowdown. We are not in a position to meet country’s coal demand. Last year, CIL produced 607 million tonnes of coal and the country, as a whole, produced 730 MT. So 83% was from Coal India Ltd. But consumption was 965 MT, so we had to import 235 MT of coal. Demand is increasing and we are trying to bridge the demand-supply gap as much as possible.


How much of India’s needs will you be able to meet?
India imported 235 million tonnes of coal. Out of this, we will have to import 120 million tonnes — 50 million tonnes of coking coal and 70 MT for power plants in the coastal region, where logic supports coal import. But 150 million tonnes of non-coking coal imports can be reduced by enhancing our own production. Coal’s contribution to electricity generation is 70%, this will reduce with renewable energy’s share growing. But in absolute terms, the quantity of coal won’t reduce because India has a huge requirement of electricity, which will rise from 360 GW to 500 GW.


Is the state-run miner behind the target this year?
In the last six months, we have fallen behind our target. We are behind by around 20 MT. We are trying to make up for it in the coming six months. It is due to a host of reasons. In case of MCL (Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd), we suffered a lot due to cyclone Fani in Odisha. In August and September, the same coalfields were hit by excessive rains. We also had some law and order issues in some other subsidiaries.


How much has this law and order issue, particularly the strike at MCL post the accident cost you?
It is difficult to quantify... law and order issues have cost us some production. With each tonne of coal production lost, Coal India loses Rs 400-500 from our profit. From a country’s perspective, the selling price of coal is Rs 1,200-1300 per tonne, so each tonne of coal not produced is a loss of Rs 1,200 -1300.


Are you being able to meet your clients’ requirements? How much is coal stock at plants currently?
Presently, there is an average of 13 days’ stock at power plant and 13 days at pitheads. By March-end, we are trying to make it to a stock of 22 days.


Any disinvestment plans?
I will not be able to answer that. This is not my company. You can ask coal minister about that. I am only the custodian of Coal India.


You have signed MoU to acquire coal deposits in far-east Russia. India had in the past looked at these coking coal assets, is it feasible to import coal from these regions?
Yes, there is a 2000 km rail network that connects to a port which is operational nine months in a year. During winter, only for three months because of the snow, the port cannot operate.


By when do you expect to operationalise these deposits, what are they like?
We were interested in some brownfield mines that area already in operation. We have identified a few but have signed nondisclosure agreements and I cannot divulge more about that, until something fructifies.


With regards coking coal, we hear of a revival plan for Jharia every few years and then it dies down. I believe a steel lobby has pitched a new proposal. Can coking coal be produced from Jharia?
We are trying our level best but there are huge problems, first of all the entire the coal field is under fire, secondly it is a thickly populated are - people are not willing to shift. The Jharia masterplan has been discussed since last ten years but progress is very, very slow. We hope for a breakthrough because only in Jharia coking coal is available. But I must admit progress is not as it was expected. Not aware of any new plan, but if the Government of India can't handle the Jharia problem for anyone else to tackle it will be very difficult.


So what are the challenges on the ground, the law and order problems, the logistics, since we are in Odisha and whats in the pipeline to address these?
Mining is work against nature, all sorts of problems will be encountered. I cannot tell you you when these problems will be over. At least not in our lifetime. These are recurring problems, we have to solve them and progress. You know, getting someone to leave a land where his father and grandfather were born, where is child was born, is an emotional and sentimental issue can’t only be seen as an economic one. Land acquisition - there is a shortage of land (available for rehabilitation) — and environmental clearances are being given a lot of attention, We are proactively trying to solve problems when they arise and fulfil the country’s coal requirements.


The government’s turned down the demand of Coal India executives for pay parity with ONGC and IOC, disappointed? 
We are big organisation, there will always be some discontentment, every one can't be kept happy. In case of a family too you can’t always make all your children happy, if you try and please someone, someone else will be unhappy. We are trying to harmonise these interests as much as possible."

45,2019-09-18,Coal India,"KOLKATA: At a time when the slowing economy has prompted companies across sectors to weigh manpower reduction, Coal India is planning to hire 9,000 people, 4,000 of them in executive cadre, to fill up vacancies.

This will be the biggest recruitment drive by the state-run miner and its subsidiaries in a decade. While the executives are picked up by the holding company, the workers and technical employees are recruited by its eight subsidiaries.

“Coal India is recruiting so many executives in a single year in almost a decade in an effort to fill up all the vacancies that have been pending for several years. Last year, we recruited only about 1,200 people,” a senior Coal India executive told ET.

The world’s largest coal producer is also India’s biggest public-sector employer after the Indian Railways with a staff strength of around 280,000. Close to 18,000 of them are executives.

“Of the 4,000 executives Coal India plans to recruit, 900 would be through advertisements and interview-based in the junior category, another 400 would be recruited from campuses and some 100 would be miscellaneous like medical officers, etc. We have already recruited 400 executives and most of whom are doctors. Another 75 have been recruited and would be joining soon. The company will recruit around 2,200 additional executives through competitive examinations,” the executive said.

Its seven coal-producing subsidiaries will recruit 5,000 workers and technical hands. Around 2,300 will be recruited as part of the company’s policy to offer jobs to the families of people whose land was taken up for setting up projects. Some 2,350 will be hired as part of the company’s policy to offer a job to a family member of a staff who died before retirement. Around 400 would be hired in non-technical posts.

Coal India was set up in 1975 and a large number of people have reached their retirement age. Over the last three years, about 12,300 employees have been retiring from the company every year. This has led to a number of positions falling vacant. While not all will be filled up, the company needs large-scale recruitment over the next few years to make sure its workforce position is adequate.

The company is also clearing all backlogs of promotions for non-executives which were pending since 2013. It has completed the task till 2017 and has promoted some 3,000 people in non-technical posts, while another 3,000 will be promoted in due course."

51,2019-09-20,Coal India,"Workmen unions that served one-day strike notice on September 24, declined to attend a meeting with the coal minister, Prahlad Joshi to discuss their demands of withdrawing 100% foreign direct investment in coal.

""Although the government wanted to discuss our demands on withdrawal of FDI, it has recently notified its decision to liberalise foreign direct investment in coal mining which is against our demands. This prompted us to refrain from attending the meeting scheduled with the coal minister on Thursday,"" said D D Ramanandan, general secretary, All India Coal Workers Federation affiliated to CITU.

The unions had earlier said that they would not enter into dialogues with anyone other than the coal ministry to discuss their demand. They represent almost 5.2-odd lakh employees of Coal India, Singaraini Collieries and contract workers at coal mines.

""The one-day strike will be observed and may be followed either by disruption of coal production and loading, or a three-day strike, or if need be, an indefinite strike if the centre does not pay heed to our demand of withdrawing FDI on coal,"" said S Q Zama, secretary general at Indian National Mine Workers' Federation under INTUC.

Unions that served strike notice are Indian National Mineworkers' Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers' Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers' Federation (CITU) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU). A sixth union, Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) served a five-day strike notice from 23rd to 27th September.

In the recent past the unions have stayed away from meetings called by the Chief Labour Commissioner but attended a meeting called by the coal secretary where issues with respect to FDI was not discussed since the government had invited three out of the six unions that served strike notice. The coal secretary centre wanted to discuss the issue with AITUC, HMS and CITU leaving out INTUC, AICCTU and BMS.

Coal fuels bulk of India's power generation and the development comes at a time when power demand is growing at around 6%. A large number of plants are in requirement of additional coal for keeping up their generation pace and it is estimated that a day’s production disruption may lead to losses between Rs 110 crore and Rs 130 crore for Coal India."

Five federations representing over half-a-million workers of Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries, called for the strike on September 24, seeking withdrawal of the central government's decision regarding the foreign direct investment in coal mining.

""All five federations except BMS are going to observe the strike on Tuesday,"" All India Coal Workers' Federation General Secretary DD Ramanandan told PTI.

Coal India produces around 2 million tonne of coal a day and the state-run miner accounts for over 80 per cent of the country's coal production.

52,2019-09-23,Coal India,"The capital goods sector has underperformed during the past few years, which is evident from the difference in the returns of the BSE Capital Goods index and the Sensex. The BSE Capital Goods has underperformed the Sensex by 2.9% in the past one year, by 12.4% in past three years and by 20.5% in past five years.

The reasons for this underperformance include lack of demand for the large scale equipment, increase in stalled or abandoned projects that were in implementation, very few new projects, and weak capex cycle of both government and the private sector. In addition, weak consumption activity in the economy and liquidity pressures have also negatively affected the prospects of the sector.

The capital goods sector plays a significant role in employment generation and economic growth. Due to the reluctance of the private sector, government capex is necessary to kickstart the investment activity. Such government expenditure fell 28% in the first quarter of 2019-20. However, recent data on the government capex has ignited hope for the revival of the capital goods sector.

According to a report by SBI Cap Securities, the capital expenditure of the government has significantly picked up in the month of July 2019 and stood at approximately Rs 45,000 crore. This translates into a year-on-year growth rate of 83%, bolstered mainly by a pickup in road and defence sectors. The report also highlights the strong order books of some players which will cushion them from a decline in earnings in the near term. The management guidance for some of these players expects 10-15% order inflow growth in 2019-20.

Another report by Elara Capital has expressed confidence in the electrical equipment (EEI) sub-segment of the capital goods sector. The volumes of the segment are growing in double digits for the past two years and the ongoing electrification programme and T&D capex (Central & State) along with growth in infrastructure and metros will continue to fuel growth for the EEI. On the other hand, a report by ICICI Direct expects that there will be a pick-up in order inflows in the capital goods sector from the third quarter onwards. Increased order inflows will be due to the expected stronger tendering pipeline across infrastructure, T&D and power segments. Also, the revenue and profitability growth of the established players are expected to remain steady for 2019-20 due to the strong present order backlog.

Even after the recent bounceback, some capital good players are available at compelling valuations in terms of their PE multiples. We have selected seven companies whose PE multiples, based on their future 12-month blended forward earnings, are at a reasonable discount relative to their past five-year and 10-year historical averages. These seven companies reported an year-on-year growth of 11% in aggregate consolidated sales and 25% growth in operating profits in the June 2019 quarter. Comparatively, the BSE Capital Goods index aggregate sales and operating profit grew at -1.7% and -9.3% respectively during the same period. Let us look at the inancial of these seven companies in detail:


1. KEC International
 
Current PE: 11.4
10-year average PE: 23.8
Current price (Rs ): 250
1-year target price (Rs ): 354 
Potential upside: 41.8%

An infrastructure EPC player with a presence across the power transmission and distribution, railways, smart infrastructure, cables and solar segments. Its strong diversified order book across segments and geographies, steady operating performance, better execution capacity and growth recovery in T&D segment are key growth catalysts. Moreover, orders from the railways for track laying, signalling, OHE and station building are likely to see traction in 2019-20. Also, the government’s long term capex targets will help the company to improve its sales and margins going forward.

10-year average PE: 28.3
Current price (Rs ): 1,314
1-year target price (Rs ): 1,661
Potential upside: 26.4%

A conglomerate with a presence in over 30 countries, it addresses critical needs of key sectors, including infrastructure, construction, defence, hydrocarbons, heavy engineering, power and shipbuilding among others. JP Morgan is bullish on the stock due to the company’s strong earnings growth track record, efficient and profitable execution capabilities, improvement in working capital management and RoE enhancement. The research house feels that guidance for 2019-20 appears achievable in terms of revenue growth and EBITDA margins. The profitability is likely to improve due to the sale proceeds from real estate monetisation (e.g. Hyderabad metro real estate). Even in a tough macro environment, L&T has won a larger share in the limited big order opportunities. Sebi’s nod to the share buyback proposal could be a near term catalyst.

Current PE: 12.2
10-year average PE: 17.7

1-year target price (Rs ): 488
Potential upside: 32.5%

A manufacturer of electrical and telecommunication cables, lighting products, electrical accessories, switchgear, fans and water heaters, Finolex Cables is in a sweet spot. A report by Firstcall Research says its electrical cables segment is likely to get a boost from the government’s rural and infrastructure push.

Current PE: 15.5
10-year average PE: 19.8
Current price (Rs ): 108

Potential upside: 16.6%

A navratna PSU, it is engaged in the design, manufacture and supply of electronics products & systems for the defense requirements. Operational excellence, superior R&D, improved order execution, higher cash flows, and better working capital management are the key positives for the company. In addition, the focus on technological innovation which involves upgradation of machinery and infrastructure provides the much needed competitive advantage. It reported good numbers in the June 2019 quarter, with 16.9% year-on-year growth in operating profit and 13.9% growth in net profit. Analysts say the company will be the main beneficiary of the government’s reforms in the defence sector and its healthy order book provide strong revenue visibility going forward.

5. Kei Industries
 
Current PE: 15.8
10-year average PE: 43.3 
Current price (Rs ): 467
1-year target price (Rs ): 552 
Potential upside: 18.2%

A wires and cables manufacturer, Kei Industries offers a wide range of cabling solutions. AnandRathi is bullish on the company due to its leading position in institutional cables, strong earnings growth and improved balance sheet. Strong order book of Rs 4,530 crore offers robust revenue assurance in 2019-20. The brokerage house expects that the cables segment mix of EHV cables, retail and exports will aid margin expansion in the future and its ability to generate free cash flows will help in the stock’s re-rating.

6. BEML
 
Current PE: 22.7
10-year average PE: 54.5 
Current price (Rs ): 814
1-year target price (Rs ): 1,107 
Potential upside: 35.9%

This miniratna category-1 PSU has three major business verticals: mining & construction, defence and rail and metro. According to a report by Antique Stock Broking, the metro rail projects will continue to provide large scale opportunities to the company as both the Centre and the states have stepped up their efforts towards increasing the metro network not just in big cities but also in tier II and tier III cities. In addition, BEML’s mining and construction business is expected to remain steady given robust Coal India capex outlook for 2019-20. The company expects to drive margin expansion through operating leverage, cost cutting measures and other operational excellence initiatives.


Analysts’ recommendations-
Buy: 4
Hold: 0
Sell: 0


7. Kalpataru Power Transmission
 
Current PE: 13.6
10-year average PE: 29.2 
Current price (Rs ): 453
1-year target price (Rs ): 548 
Potential upside: 21.1%

A diversified conglomerate, Kalpataru is engaged in the global power transmission and infrastructure EPC space. ICICI Direct believes that the strong order book with good traction in non-T&D business (railways, pipeline), improved subsidiary performance and operating leverage gains are likely to support consistent growth. Moreover, diversification in international T&D markets would provide good opportunities. The returns ratios are expected to improve because of the company’s strategy to monetise non-core assets and sales proceeds from the transmission assets.

54,2019-09-23,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government’s move to lower corporate tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent is likely to ensure Rs 72,000 crore savings for about 300-odd companies in the BSE500 basket. This would improve cash flows and earnings, and may help a few companies boost demand by passing on the tax benefits to end users.

In value terms, banks and financials, oil & gas, metals and mining, consumption and capital goods companies would gain the most, analysts said. Sectors such as IT, pharmaceuticals and electric utilities may see only limited gains, they said.

Stocks such as HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finserv and State Bank of India, among others, may lead the BFSI space with Rs 27,994 crore in savings in FY21, suggests a study by KR Choksey Investment Managers.

Stocks like ONGC, IOC and Reliance Industries could add Rs 12,459 crore to profits. Metals and mining firms such as Vedanta, Coal India and Tata Steel may add Rs 8,820 crore to aggregate bottom line. Consumption stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints and Nestle India, among others, and capital goods companies L&T, Siemens and others may together see over Rs 11,000 crore addition to their profits.



Having said that, the stocks may not go on a relentless rally. Edelweiss Securities said after Friday’s big rally, upsides may be more modest from here on.

The brokerage projects Nifty at 11,600 by September, 2020. That said, the brokerage sees more opportunities to take on risk at stock as well as portfolio levels.

Goldman Sachs on Friday reasserted its positive view on India, and raised its 12-month Nifty target to 13,200 from 12,500 earlier, saying recent pro-growth measures, a boost to already the highest earnings growth in the region and a likely revival in sentiment further strengthen the positive investment case for India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said companies currently availing exemptions can opt for paying the new tax rates, only once the exemption periods get over. On the other hand, companies which will avail the lower tax rate will not be able to avail any of the exemptions.

Domestic equity indices saw their second-biggest intraday rally of the year on Friday, as the Rs 1.45 lakh crore tax relief brought down effective tax rate for domestic companies to 25.6 per cent from 34.9 per cent. Sensex galloped 1,921 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 38,014, while Nifty zoomed 569 points, or 5.32 per cent, to 11,274.

Meanwhile, MAT or minimum alternate 
tax which applies to ‘zero 
tax companies’ has been reduced to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent earlier.

“Looking at the PAT boost due to lower taxes and keeping the current Street expectations and valuations in mind, we could see a 23 per cent upside in the overall market in next 2- 3 years,” KR Choksey said in a note.


Guest contributor and other agenciesSource: KR Choksey Investment Managers
For benchmark Nifty, analysts now expect a profit growth of 24-26 per cent compared with 13-15 per cent earlier.

Morgan Stanley has upgraded its estimated Sensex earnings growth to 25 per cent for FY20 from 13 per cent earlier. Kotak Securities expects net profits of Nifty firms to grow at 25 per cent for FY2020 against 15 per cent projected earlier.

This assumes that companies will retain bulk of the tax cuts. In reality, some of them will pass on some of the benefits to consumers. If this happens, it would be the highest earnings growth for India Inc since 2006.

Among Nifty stocks, 20 companies with tax rates higher than 25 per cent have a cumulative weightage of 39 per cent in the index.

Prominent beneficiaries of the tax cut would include Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Asian Paints and Hero MotoCorp. The tax outgo of these companies was more than 30 per cent in FY19 relative to the profit before tax (PBT).

Nestle India, which will be a part of the Nifty50 soon, will be another big beneficiary, considering it had a tax rate of 34 per cent in FY19.

Meanwhile, apart from recurring earnings benefit, there will also be one-time gains on deferred tax liabilities for companies such as RIL, Ultratech, among others, and one-time loss on deferred tax assets for corporate banks, Edelweiss Securities said."

57,2019-09-24,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The planned strike at Coal India on Tuesday is likely to hit power supply as plants with thousands of megawatts of generation capacity have fuel stocks only for a day or less.

Worker at the coal behemoth are going on a tool-down strike on September 24 to protest against the government’s decision last month to allow 100% foreign direct investment in coal mining under the automatic route.

According to a Coal India executive, while five unions have said it will be a one-day strike, one union has called for a five-day strike from September 23, which prompted its affiliated members to start disrupting production and dispatches at Talcher coalfields, which produce more than 100,000 tonnes a day.

On Monday, attendance at Mahanadi Coalfields was almost half, while production at Eastern Coalfields’ Rajmahal was affected, the executive said.

Eight power plants with a generation capacity of 13,280 MW are left with stocks that won’t last a day, while another 14 plants, with a total generation capacity of 18,850 MW, are left with a day’s stock, according to data provided by the Central Electricity Authority. These include plants that have payment issues or have already received more than the committed quota or are not lifting coal.

An executive of NTPC, the country’s largest power producer, said the plants at Talcher (3,000 MW), Sipat (2,980 MW), Korba (2,600 MW) and Kahalgaon (2,340 MW) are likely to be affected by the strike as their coal stocks are low.

Coal fuels the bulk of India’s power generation, and it is estimated that disruption of a day’s production may lead to losses between Rs 110 crore and Rs 130 crore for Coal India.

The unions have adopted a hard line. They did not attend a meeting with the Union coal minister last week because the government notified liberal foreign investment norms last month, said DD Ramanandan, general secretary, All India Coal Workers Federation, which is affiliated to CITU.

SQ Zama, secretary-general at Indian National Mine Workers' Federation, which is under INTUC, said workers would follow up the strike with more protests, which may include an indefinite strike if the government does not revoke its decision."

59,2019-09-24,Coal India,"Trade unions on Tuesday claimed that production and dispatch came to a ""complete halt"" at the mines of Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd, owing to the one-day strike against the Centre's decision to allow 100 per cent FDI in coal mining.

Over half-a-million workers including contract labourers of state-run Coal India and Singareni Collieries observed the strike on Tuesday seeking withdrawal of the central government's move.

""All unions except BMS will be meeting shortly to intensify their movement. The strike was total with a complete halt in production, transportation and dispatch of coal from all mines -- Assam to Singareni,"" All India Coal Workers' Federation General Secretary D D Ramanandan told PTI.

Ramendra Kumar, former MP and central committee president of the AITUC said that coal workers of all the subsidiaries of Coal India participated in the strike.

""The strike was successful. Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham union of SCCL has also supported the strike,"" Indian National Mineworkers' Federation (INMF) Secretary General SQ Zama said.

The coal behemoth accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the total output of the dry fuel in the country.

Coal India officials said the estimated production loss due to the cease work could be ""less than 1.5 million tonne though final data is not available"".

""In Coal India, the attendance of workers in the first shift including that of administrative and executive employees was 30 per cent,"" a CIL official said.

Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said the government was trying to negotiate with workmen unions to normalise the situation.

""We are trying to have negotiations with them (workers). Government is quite open and the major impact is today, he told reporters reacting to the strike.

Last week, the trade unions had declined to attend a meeting with Joshi to discuss their demand of withdrawing 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment in coal mining.

In Jharkhand, normal operation at collieries in Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) was also affected due to the strike, though the miner's subsidiary said the outsourcing of coal production remained unaffected.

CCL Director (Personnel & Administration) R S Mahapatra said that the loss due to the strike would be compensated with additional hours of work.

""So, the CCL will not face any loss due to strike,"" he said, adding that essential services, including water and power supply, security and medical services were not affected.

Unions that served one-day strike notice are Indian National Mineworkers' Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers' Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers' Federation (CITU) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU).

Meanwhile, RSS-affiliated labour union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), which is not a signatory with other federations to the one-day strike notice, is observing a five-day ceasework from Monday till September 27 on the same issue."
60,2019-09-24,Coal India,"Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi has said efforts were on to hold talks with Coal India and SCCL workers who are on strike and the government was hopeful that things will normalise by Wednesday. Coal India (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) workers are on a day-long token strike on Tuesday protesting the Centre's decision to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the two PSUs through automatic route.

The strike call has been given by five central trade unions namely INTUC, HMS, AITUC, CITU and AICCTU. ""We are trying to have negotiations with them (workers). Government is quite open and the major impact is today,"" Joshi told reporters on the sidelines of an event by Indian Energy Forum here. The minister expressed hope that operations in Coal India mines would normalise on Wednesday.

Last week, the trade unions had declined to attend a meeting with Joshi to discuss their demand of withdrawing 100 per cent FDI in coal mining. The five trade unions had served notice for the strike on September 5. ""The five trade unions have called for one-day token strike today against 100 per cent FDI in CIL and SCCL. It is successful. The strike has support from the Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham union of SCCL too, affiliated to TRS party,"" Indian National Mineworkers' Federation (INMF) Secretary General SQ Zama said.

The strike is total with complete stop in production, transportation and dispatch of coal from all mines -- Assam to Singareni -- All India Coal Workers' Federation General Secretary D D Ramanandan told PTI. CIL produces around 2 million tonne of coal a day and accounts for over 80 per cent of the country's coal production.

RSS-affiliated labour union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), which is not a participant in the one-day strike, is however observing a five-day strike from September 23-27 on the same issue. On Tuesday, Coal India officials said there was no adverse impact on production on Monday despite the strike called by BMS. However, BMS leader B K Rai had said the response to the strike was ""good."""
61,2019-09-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: A one-day strike at Coal India led to around 35% loss in production with only half of the workforce turning up for duty on Tuesday.

Executives did not join the strike called by the workers to oppose liberalisation of coal mining. A senior Coal India executive said employees in charge of essential services like doctors, nurses and electricians were present on Tuesday.

“The total loss of production is estimated at 30-35% on Tuesday,” the executive said. “Heavy rain and strike severely affected all mines of Coal India subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields, one of the largest coal producers in the group. Production and dispatches at mines of Central Coalfields, Eastern Coalfields and Western Coalfields were also heavily affected. Production at other subsidiaries was also affected by various degrees.”

Employees work at mines in three eight-hour shifts beginning 6 am. Although final production figures were not available, according to estimates by executives, the strike may have halved the output on Tuesday."

63,2019-09-25,Coal India,"If earnings show green shoots, then confidence will be back and participation level should start going up, says Sameer Narayan, Market Expert. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

Everybody is contemplating whether, this market will hit a new high and stay there or is the best behind us in the short term and markets will consolidate or fall? What is your view?What happened last week was definitely tectonic.This was the hard bullet that nobody expected the government to bite! It was done so quickly, going even against the DTC recommendations of 25%, we have actually brought it down to 22%. So it is a great move. 

Now, in the last three days, the so-called animal spirits were definitely unleashed. Today corporate India thinks that yes the government will act and the government is serious about ensuring that the economy is back on the growth track. So those are very big positives. But having said that, we do not see that there is a lot of commitment on part of the FIIs. Even in terms of recent stock movements, wherever the effective tax rate differential has been large, even within sectors like auto. For example, Eicher Motors was at 35% tax rate whereas M&M was at 25%. Therefore, the pronounced move that you have seen in the last three days in both these stocks has been very different

The market has clearly made a differential that once the tax rate has come down, it is for good and hence there has been stock-wise movements within sectors. Now does this lead to increase in capex? That is a function of what is my current capacity and the estimation of demand that I see here on. The monsoon has definitely been good. In fact, India has probably seen an excess monsoon for the first time after almost six years. 

So even though the rainfall distribution may not be great and you may not get a very big kharif output, at least the outlook on rabi crop is positive and that is a big sentiment booster. But look at it this way. In July, after the first quarter numbers were out, everybody bought the earnings down to 8-10%; today because of that tax cut, you are back to the expectation of 25% for FY20 on Nifty earnings. That is why the market is back where it is. But from here onwards, the big mover is the September quarter is earnings. If somehow this shows green shoots, then confidence will be back and participation level should start going up.


Are you betting on the consumption theme then? Given that some of those factors will see a revival in growth, will that positively impact these companies?Apart from consumption which is fairly well owned and well valued, the government is the big mover here. Today when you see the bills that were pending for long have started getting cleared, money is back into the system and orders are being given out. You will probably see the domestic cyclicals more in favour than perhaps consumption or FMCG. Apart from that, even where there has been a massive drawdown in terms of prices like in cases of PSU banks or where the tax rate was very high, those themes are likely to play out far better.


Are you betting on the consumption theme then or being positive on the outlook that given some of those factors we will see a revival in growth and that will positively impact these companies?Apart from consumption, which is fairly well-owned and well-valued, the government is the big mover here. So today when you see the bills that were pending for long have been starting to get cleared, money is back into the system and orders are being given out, I think you will probably see the economy facing, the domestic cyclicals probably more in favour than perhaps the consumption or the FMCG and I think apart from that even where there has been a massive draw down in terms of prices like some of the state owned banks or where the tax rate was very high -- those themes are likely to play out far better.


We saw IT, pharma the defensive plays so to speak, completely lag when the markets were on fire. Yesterday they were back in play. What does one make of it?Most of the tech space has been at 25% effective tax rate and to that extent, there will not be any immediate benefit because of the change in taxation. Also, they have not seen any upgrades and that is where the positive news is not forthcoming. Therefore, the optimism was not there on Friday and Monday. Yesterday, there were some sort of tempering and people realised a lot of catch-up has to be done. 

In case of a demand revival, it is likely to show up in these sectors as well because IT is a large employment generator. The other thing that plays out is that tax cut will definitely give some sort of positive sentiment on a capex outline which is a larger long term decision for a corporate. The next thing that probably needs to be looked at in terms of a followup is personal tax reduction, which will lead to a direct demand stimulus.

If you do both of these, then there is likely to be some amount of fiscal strain and because of that, one should definitely hear some positive action on the divestment front. Since only a few months are left for the fiscal to get over, the space for piecemeal steps like CPSE ETF probably will not move the needle much. One needs to look at real strategic divestments to get in big money. In case the government moves on that, it will set the market on the right track.


Do you believe that one is safer sticking to private corporate names?From here onwards, one has to look at the improvement in margins. Private banks have been fairly valued and so the asset improvement is likely to be visible in case the economy picks up in banks which have not been priced. Public sector banks would be a larger beneficiary of the incremental flow and the improvement in business due to a revival in economy.


Within consumption where is the opportunity to buy afresh? From Titan to D-Mart to Asian Paints, all are trading at exuberant valuations?The incremental flow will perhaps be not that high. Bigger returns are likely to be made where ownership is low and the delta is likely to be bigger. 


Why do you say that? Sometimes you need to buy simple compounding stories; over ownership, under ownership are important factors but they cannot be the only factor. Just because HDFC Bank is owned, why should you not buy it?You have a point there. But HDFC Bank, Titan, all these are franchise companies. Now franchise value is a very different connotation from the classic valuations that an investor would look at. You can make a SIP on them on a monthly basis.. Even on an individual case, you can keep buying them and these will compound because demand will be there. They will be able to run an efficient business model and there will be returns for the investors to make. 

But I thought the question was where will be the larger flow from here onwards for investors to look at in terms of allocating capital? I think one should make a case of allocation to these franchise companies which will continue on their growth path but don’t expect a large change in them because of the tax cut as perhaps in some other cases where the tax rates were far higher. That is the only limited point I am trying to make because the tax rate reduction is a profit opportunity that is available on a permanent ongoing basis for any corporate. That is where for a company with a 35% effective tax rate coming down to 25% effectively means a 10% secular earnings growth.


Which names would you pick up?Coal India and Eicher Motors are companies where there is some element of franchise value and an element of competitiveness, a monopolistic situation and these are places where one is likely to see a good pick up in revenue if the sentiment and the economy pick up.


Will you buy BPCL with this view or for that matter any PSU, thinking that tomorrow will be better for these PSUs?Our view on OMCs has always been good because they are fantastically run businesses, available at great value. These are also great assets for somebody to chase them. If BPCL and HPCL see the light of divestment some day, the amount of windfall they can unlock for the government is tremendous. Also, there would be a re-rating. For example, HP is available at 6 times EV EBITDA. These companies are fantastic cash machines. The petrol price deregulation mechanism is seamless. In the recent week also, the prices have been marked up appreciably. There is no reason for somebody not to go in for them especially when the entire auto sector, auto fuel retailing story in India is just about to be unleashed.

There is a strong chance of cash flow and appetite of investors for PSUs as a basket. The chances of a strategic divestment before the financial year runs out is far higher than what it was a month back. These are great stocks available at great value and a trigger of divestment also is a good tailwind. These can be prime stocks for long. 


What is your view on Zee?The business is in good shape. It is just that today there is a short-term overhang over how the promoters settle their debt and the stake sale and the discussions with the MFs etc. If there is clarity, the stock can perhaps retrace earlier levels because at Rs 30,000 crore, it is not a bad business in case the economy was to pick up from here.

Will you buy the Zee stock?At this price, it is a fairly good risk reward equation.


How are you mapping the price? Why is it good, why is it bad? Just because this has fallen or you think it has become cheap? Their OTT platform, Zee5, is losing money.Yes but the fact is it was not expected to make money from day one any way. When businesses and verticals are in investment mode, there is a certain amount of runway that is given them for them to play out in terms of accretion, content creation, etc. There is enough for us to give them some time and this overhang has perhaps seen a very disproportionate amount of price impact on the stock price. That is why I said that Rs 30,000 crore it is not a very bad risk reward equation given the fact that the business does not seem to have completely fallen off the cliff."
68,2019-09-26,Coal India,"The intention of the government to create a $5-trillion economy is very much on the cards and for that, they are ready to start this process of strategic disinvestment, says Sanjiv Bhasin, Executive Vice President, IIFL Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


A couple of days back we were talking about how the government will not just sell PSUs now, they will also ensure that they get better valuation for them. We have seen how Hindustan Zinc has been a successful divestment in the last several years. If they sell the remaining 30% as well, they can get Rs 25,000-26,000 crore. Do you think this is a good model and should this be replicated in other PSUs as well?It is a most powerful reform. The government intention is clear now. It wants to sell the jewels in the crown. I was part of a deal in 1999, when at Rs 9 per share, I bought stocks from UTI India Fund -- an overseas fund. Nine lakh shares went to Mr Anil Agarwal as the net seller. I used to trade in Bombay for institutions. That time, the stock after bonus and spilt was up 6.5 thousand times! So you can imagine what price appreciation the government has seen by holding stake so I think it is a win-win situation. The government is definitely going to see premiums on a lot of the holdings which they have and for the parent, for Anil Agarwal, the times are excellent. He is already two-three times bid for the stake and this will help alleviate the fiscal balance and get out of stocks where they have made excellent returns. 

For both sides, it is a win-win situation which is again the case in strategic disinvestment in BPCL, selling the SUUTI stake. I was also in the selloff with ITC. That stock is up eight times from the price when it went into SUUTI. So you can imagine what returns these stocks have given in the last 18-20 years.


How are you analysing the metal and mining pack or it is a commodity pack among the PSUs? Mr Modi recently met lot of energy companies in Houston and the buzz is big chunks of Coal India could also be up for grabs. Together with Hindustan Zinc, would there be takers from the strategic global metal and mining space or even the current ones like Vedanta? Definitely there are enough people who are going to buy that. Let us not look at only one year when auto and infra sectors have underperformed and hence the metal and mining space globally has been weak. 

We are talking of trade resolutions between China and US happening next week or beyond and that will set the cat amongst the pigeons. This is the best time to invest in commodities and globally there is a lot of money on the sideline which can be used to buy assets. 

Now India specific assets will definitely be lapped up very aggressively. A disclosure, I also own Hindustan Copper which is a small company that has not done much but it has the third largest copper mine. Copper if you know there is a treatment and refining charge which is there by Hindalco and the likes but the real copper is in Hindustan Copper and I think the government is also in the process of selling it lock, stock and barrel. So a lot of unlocking can take place in the next three to six months.

The intention of the government to create a $5-trillion economy is very much on the cards and for that, they are ready to start this process of strategic disinvestment. That will be cheered globally and I feel a re-rating of India is imminent."
67,2019-09-26,Coal India,"The revival of the government plan to disinvest in Hindustan Zinc saw the stock surge. Its majority shareholder, Vedanta, also ended with massive gains. Banking and auto stocks were in focus, as traders adjusted their F&O positions on the expiry of September derivative contracts. 

Automaker M&M rose on news of Ford transferring its India assets to a JV with the company. Gains in the stock helped Nifty Auto index end with substantial gains. 

Positive news about the US-China trade war, softer crude prices and a strong rupee helped sentiments on Dalal Street, as Sensex ended 396 points higher to 38,989. NSE barometer Nifty climbed 133 points to 11,573. The broader market ended the day with gains, as Nifty Midcap index rose 0.86 per cent and Nifty Smallcap index 0.62 per cent.

“Wednesday’s global selloff was based on US political drama, which reversed on Thursday. While the Indian market recovered from profit taking after sharp gains, the momentum was broadbased with auto, bank and metal stocks leading the gains on expectation of better demand during the festive season,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.


Here is a lowdown on the key movers and shakers of Thursday’s session:

Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta surgeShares of Hindustan Zinc climbed 5.6 per cent to Rs 213.15 after reports that the government has revived the plan to private Hindustan Zinc. ETNow reported the government was planning the residual stake sale in the company and seeking legal opinion on the same. Vedanta, which holds majority stake in Hindustan Zinc, also jumped 6.5 per cent to Rs 166.15 on BSE and was the biggest Sensex gainer. India’s largest aluminium maker is also planning to set up an aluminium flat rolled products plant with an estimated capital expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore.


YES Bank cracks 5%Private lender YES Bank fell nearly 5 per cent to Rs 51.05 on BSE even after a statement from the lender that it was awaiting approval from the Reserve Bank of India to raise capital. In a release on Wednesday, the bank said, it “has applied to RBI for approval to increase the bank's authorised share capital. Subsequent to this, the bank will seek shareholder approval.” The bank plans to raise Rs 800 crore through the process. The stock was the biggest index loser in Sensex and Nifty. 


M&M jumps on Ford JV newsShares Mahindra & Mahindra jumped 6 per cent on BSE to Rs 567 after reports that the company would receive most of Ford’s assets in India after the formation of a joint venture. The venture, likely to be announced as early as next week, does not include Ford’s global business services division or an export-focused engine plant in Sanand. Bank, auto stocks in focus

Banking stocks were in great demand. ICICI Bank climbed 4 per cent, IndusInd and Federal Bank each jumped over 2 per cent. Nifty Bank index creeped up 1.5 per cent. Auto stocks saw interest from traders as Nifty Auto index jumped 2.5 per cent. The gains were led by M&M, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland. 


Energy stocks surgeEnergy stocks joined the party, as 16 of 24 BSE Energy index components ended with gains. Shares of Panama Petrochemicals surged 13.6 per cent, followed by Hindustan Petroleum (up 6.8 per cent), Coal India (up 5.3 per cent) and MRPL (up 4.2 per cent). 


Nifty IT sole loserNifty IT index bucked the overall trend for the fifth day on the trot and closed in the red. The index fell 0.8 per cent, dragged by NIIT Tech (down 1 per cent), Infosys (down 1 per cent) and Wipro (down 0.67 per cent). Tata Elxsi (up 2.8 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (up 1 per cent) were the top gainers of the pack. 


Most active stocksBanking stocks were among the most active stocks on NSE in terms of value. SBI grabbed the top spot with transaction value at Rs 2,238 crore. HDFC Bank (Rs 1,916 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,838 crore), HDFC (Rs 1,586 crore) and Infosys (Rs 1,445 crore) completed the top five list. In volume terms, YES Bank was the most traded stock. Vodafone Idea, SBI, PNB and Tata Motors completed the top 5 list. 


93 stocks in overbought zoneOver 90 stocks entered the overbought zone with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossed the 70 mark. They included BPCL, Berger Paints, Titan, Asian Paints, Nestle India and Bata India, among others. RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions of a stock or other asset."

73,2019-09-27,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Average capacity utilisation of thermal power plants dropped to 51% in August 2019 against 55.5% in August last year. The fall was due to a decrease in central, state and private sector capacity utilisations by 700 basis points, 70 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively.

According to a report by rating firm India Ratings, the steep decrease in central sector capacity utilisation was majorly due to decrease in capacity utilisation at NTPC on account of coal shortage at its Talcher plant.

During the month, national power demand and supply decreased 1.6% year-on-year and 1.3% year-on-year in August 2019, respectively, resulting in a decline in power deficit to 0.2% against 0.6% in the previous corresponding year.

Short-term power price at the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) decreased marginally to Rs 3.32 per unit against Rs 3.38 per unit in July on account of fall in demand at the exchanges. The difference in buy and sell bid volumes in August 2019 in the day ahead market increased to negative 2,863 million units (MUs) against a negative 2,545 million units in July 2019.

Electricity generation improved 0.6% year-on-year, despite a 3.5% year-on-year fall in thermal generation on account of higher generation from hydro (6.5% yoy) and nuclear power plants (55.3% yoy). Coal-fired power generation sector witnessed a decrease in generation to 80.5 billion units against 83.4 billion units in August 2018 on account of lower demand, coal shortages and closure of few plants for maintenance.

Coal inventory at thermal power stations rose 46.8% YoY to 21.6 million tonnes in August 2019. It, however, declined 11.1% month-on-month due to lower coal production. Coal India production fell 10.3% YoY in August 2019, owing to lower production at its subsidiaries Western Coalfields Limited (WCL; down 26.4% YoY), Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL; down 26.8% YoY) and South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL; down 17.7% YoY). MCL’s production, which contributes over 20% to CIL production, declined on account of protest at its Talcher mine in Odisha.

SECL’s production declined due to a mine accident and WCL’s production fell due to higher-than-expected rainfall in August 2019. While the number of thermal power plants with critical level of coal decreased to four in August 2019 from 11 in August 2018, coal availability at pithead and non-pithead plants on 31 August 2019 remained low at 9 and 14 days, respectively.

Thermal generation was supported by increased reliance on imported coal with 28.7mt coal imported during April-August 2019 against 22.5mt in the April-August period last year.

Transmission line addition has been lower this financial year with 4,537 circuit kilometres added till August compared to 8,172 circuit kilometres added in the same period last year. Transmission line addition in August 2019 was 803 circuit kilometres (August 2018: 2,993 circuit kilometres) with 62% of addition coming from the state sector."

They now aspire for high-end mobile phones or a computer since living standards of these people and their family members have also improved with time. The spend is spread over a month starting with Durga Puja to Diwali,” he said.

On Tuesday, six central trade unions at Coal India negotiated with the management for several hours to decide on the amount of Puja bonus. Last year the workers received Rs 60,500 per employee and Coal India shelled out Rs 1,600 crore.

“Following several hours of negotiation with the management an amount of Rs 64,700 has been decided,” said S Q Zama, Secretary-General of the Indian National Mine Workers’ Federation under INTUC. “The amount is generally paid a day or two before Durga Puja starts.”

D.D. Ramanandan, president All India Coal Workers Federation said: “Every year we start with a figure that is higher by a few notches and settle at a figure between last years payment and the amount asked for.”

The unions that negotiated with the management are Indian National Mineworkers’ Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers’ Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers’ Federation (CITU), All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) and Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS).

On Monday, MCL suffered a Rs 2.68 crore loss on account of stoppage of coal transportation and despatch work at Jaganath Sidings No. 1 & 2 in Talcher coalfields after a mob led by some people from Chatia Hurtings village created ruckus and protested against killing of a goat in an accident with a coal transportation tipper inside prohibited mining area. 

Coal mines are restricted working zones where only personnel authorised, trained with knowhow of the mines enter to perform their job. Entry to mines areas are totally prohibited for general movement.

Jaganath Sidings 1 & 2 were forcibly stopped by villagers at 11:00 hrs, demanding Rs 60,000 compensation. Operations could be resumed only after 14:30 hrs with the intervention of senior officials and police, and this three-and-a-half-hours illegal stoppage by the villagers caused an estimated loss of Rs 1.4 crore on account of coal transportation to the sidings and Rs 1.28 crore on account of despatch through railways. 

The government exchequer also suffered an estimated loss to the tune of Rs 46 lakh due to this unprecedented stoppage.

On Tuesday, MCL suffered an estimated Rs 2.5 crore loss, following illegal stoppage of coal supply to power plants from the Ananta Railway Sidings No. 5 & 6 by villagers of Kandhaberni at Talcher Coalfields. Kandhaberni is a village located between Bharatpur Area and Hingula Area of MCL.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

. CLSA has maintained sell rating on
 Bharat Petroleum Corporation with a target price of Rs 300. Hopes of privatisation and an ensuing open offer have driven a 40 per cent rally in BPCL, making it the world’s most expensive refining and marketing stock, said CLSA. A generous valuation scenario returns a potential open-offer value of Rs 519/ share, it said. But an open offer may only mean a 55 per cent acceptance ratio, said CLSA. The stock may trade around Rs 445/share based on peer multiples after such an open offer, it added. Shares of BPCL ended up 3.2 per cent at Rs 515.2 on Friday

• CLSA has maintained buy rating on
 Maruti Suzuki India with a target price of Rs 7,950.Maruti has launched an attractively priced mini-SUV, S-Presso, that aims to bring SUV styling to the compact car segment, said CLSA.

18,2019-10-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Coal India Limited’s (CIL) production is likely to fall short of its current year target by around 55-75 million tonnes, Icra Ratings has estimated. 

CIL has registered a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) production de-growth of 23.5% in September 2019, as operations were impacted by flooding of key mines due to heavy rains and labour issues, an official statement said. The firms production target for the current fiscal is 660 million tonnes. 

In the first half of the current fiscal, the central miner’s coal production witnessed a de-growth of 6.0% Y-o-Y, in stark contrast to the healthy production growth of 7.0% achieved in FY2019. 

Thus in order to achieve the targeted annual coal production or come anywhere close to the annual guidance, CIL would have to step-up to an average run-rate of 2.3 mt coal production per day for the rest of the year. This looks an unlikely task, given that in recent times the central miner has been able to briefly sustain at the 2 mt/day average coal production rate only in the months of March 2018 and March 2019, it said. 

Consequently, fully recovering the lost ground during the second half would be extremely challenging.

Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president and group head, corporate sector ratings, Icra, said: “Given CIL’s lacklustre first half performance, coal stocks at domestic thermal power plants have steadily depleted from 33 million tonne in end May 2019 to around 22 million tonne in end September 2019. Since the North-based power plants contributed around 50% of this inventory run-down, they would be more vulnerable if the ongoing production shortage persists. Mirroring the lower coal despatches, generation from coal based thermal power plants fell by 4.0% Y-o-Y in August 2019, and by a steeper 10.6% Y-o-Y in September 2019.”

Not surprisingly, coal users have had to rely on imports to make-up for CIL’s production shortfall in the current fiscal. As per latest official statistics, thermal coal imports have increased to 84.4 mt in the first five months of FY2020, compared to 70.9 mt in the same period of last fiscal, registering a steep 19.1% growth. 

In previous years, bulk of the growth in thermal coal imports were coming from end-users in non-regulated sectors like captive power plants, cement, and steel. However, as per the initial trends seen in the current fiscal, the growth in thermal coal imports has been evenly split between the regulated and non-regulated sectors.

As Coal India attempts to make good the lost volumes in the second half, the power sector is expected to be a much larger beneficiary of the incremental supplies, given that it gets a higher priority over supplies to the non-regulated sector. 

Consequently, imports by the non-regulated sector are expected to remain elevated the remainder of the year as well, and overall thermal coal imports are expected to cross the 200 million tonne mark in FY20201 . 

As regards price trends, ICRA notes that domestic coal prices had been steadily declining between January and June of 2019. 

Average premium for spot e-auctions fell from 131% in December 2018 to 55% in June 2019. 

However, with CIL’s production declining by 5.1% and 10.3% Y-o-Y in July and August of 2019 respectively, spot e-auction premia again started to head north, inching up to 62% and 87% in July and August of 2019 respectively. Spot prices have remained elevated in September 2019 too and are likely to hold firm in October 2019 as well, as CIL’s production remains constrained by the late retreat of the South-West monsoon till mid-October 2019. 

“With generation from hydro and wind power stations waning down post monsoons, and CIL’s pithead stocks running down to just around 19.4 mt in end-September 2019, against a much higher 54.2 mt in end-March 2019, the PSU miner’s ability to quickly ramp up production would remain crucial to avoid a repeat of the acute coal shortage that surfaced during the second half of FY2018,” Mr. Roy added."
19,2019-10-07,Coal India,"JSW Energy led by billionaire industrialist Sajjan Jindal on Monday reported entering into exclusive discussions with GMR Energy Limited for a potential acquisition of its subsidiary GMR Kamalanga Energy.

 ""Both parties intend to conclude these discussions in an expeditious manner,"" it said in a brief statement without giving further details.

 GMR Kamalanga Energy has a 1,050 megawatt (3 x 350 MW) operational coal-based power plant located at Kamalanga Village in Dhenkanal district of Orissa. The plant is strategically located close to the coal belt and has 15 per cent untied capacity to take advantage of the merchant market.

 It has fuel linkages with Mahanadi Coal Fields, a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd, and a long-term power purchase agreement with Grid Corporation of Odisha, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam as well as Bihar State Electricity Board.

 JSW Energy generates 4,541 MW of power per year of which 3140 MW is thermal, 1,391 MW is hydropower and 10 MW is solar. In August, it reported 6.6 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit to Rs 244 crore in the April to June quarter compared to Rs 229 crore in the year-on period.

 The company's consolidated net worth and consolidated net debt as on June 30 were Rs 11,928 crore and Rs 10,221 crore respectively, resulting in a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1:0.86.

 Its board of directors has approved the raising of long-term funds up to Rs 2,500 crore through issuance of redeemable non-convertible debentures by way of a private placement. The finance committee is deciding on matters related to the proposed issuance of the debentures, including finalisation and approval of the detailed terms of issue.

 In July, JSW Energy had terminated a business agreement signed three years ago with Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel and Power to acquire its 1,000 MW thermal power plant in Chhattisgarh."
20,2019-10-07,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The country's overall thermal coal import is likely to cross the 200-million tonnes (MT) mark in the current financial year, according to Icra.

""Thermal coal imports expected to cross 200 MT in FY2020,"" Icra said in a statement on Monday.

Coal India Ltd's (CIL) production might fall short of its 2019-20 target of 660 million tonne (MT) by around 55-75 MT, Icra .

CIL registered a year-on-year (y-o-y) decline of 23.5 per cent in production in September, as operations were impacted by labour issues and flooding of key mines due to heavy rains.

In the first half of the current financial year, CIL's coal production witnessed a fall of 6 per cent y-o-y, in stark contrast to the healthy production growth of 7 per cent achieved in 2018-19.

""Thus, in order to achieve the targeted annual coal production or come anywhere close to the annual guidance of 660 MT and, given the first half slippages, CIL would have to step up to an average run rate of 2.3 MT coal production per day for the rest of the year,"" it said.

This looks an unlikely task, given that in recent times, the central miner has been able to briefly sustain at the two million tonnes per day average coal production rate only in the months of March 2018 and March 2019, it said.

Consequently, fully recovering the lost ground during the second half would be challenging, it added.

As Coal India Ltd attempts to make up for the lost volumes in the second half, the power sector is expected to be a much larger beneficiary of the incremental supplies, given that it gets higher priority over supplies to the non-regulated sector, it said.

Consequently, imports by the non-regulated sector are expected to remain elevated for the year as well.

Since power plants in the northern region contributed around 50 per cent of this inventory run-down, they would be more vulnerable if the ongoing production shortage persists, Roy said

""Mirroring the lower coal despatches, generation from coal-based thermal power plants fell by 4.0 per cent y-o-y in August 2019, and by a steeper 10.6 per cent y-o-y in September 2019,"" Roy added."
21,2019-10-08,Coal India,"New Delhi: Coal India (CIL) will manage to step up production to near its targeted level despite floods hitting mining operations, top executives at the company said after analysts raised the concern that there may be an acute shortage because of disruption by heavy rains.

Ratings agency Icra estimates Coal India’s production is likely to fall short of its current year target by 55-75 million tonnes (mt).

Its target for this year is 660 mt.

Coal secretary Anil Jain said existing coal stocks have helped meet coal demand and production has picked up. A Coal India official said things will not be as bad as projected and the company is taking all possible measures to ramp up production.




Icra said Coal India has registered a year-on-year production fall of 23.5% in September 2019, as operations were impacted by flooding of key mines due to heavy rains and labour issues.

In the first half of the current fiscal, the coal miner’s production fell 6%, in stark contrast to the healthy production growth of 7% achieved in FY19, it said.

Icra said in order to achieve the targeted annual production or come anywhere close to the annual guidance, Coal India would have to step up to an average run-rate of 2.3 mt coal production per day for the rest of the year. This looks un-likely, given that in recent times Rs 35,000 cr the miner has been able to briefly sustain the 2 mt/day average coal production rate only in March 2018 and March 2019, it said.

“Coal production has been impacted by heavy rains both in CIL mines and captive mines of others,” Jain said. “But offtake from old stocks and pre-existing stocks at power plants have helped. Coal production has picked up.”

The Coal India official said the company will start producing 1,500,000 tonnes of coal by the end of October.

“Owing to torrential rainfall that lashed across its subsidiary companies, CIL’s production was dented, especially in September.

A number of high producing mines were flooded as a result of heavy rains but CIL has resilience to bounce back and is trying to regain its production,” an official said, adding there is a 17.3 mt stock at pithead that will last for another 11days.

Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said progressively increasing eauction premium is symbolic of persisting coal shortages. “With the power demand picking up, unless the coal production and despatch position improves significantly, we may have to face widespread power shortages,” he said.

Icra said coal stocks at domestic thermal power plants have depleted from 33 mt in end May 2019 to around 22 mt in end September.

Since the north-based power plants contributed around 50% of this inventory run-down, they would be more vulnerable if the ongoing production shortage persists."
22,2019-10-08,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Coal shipments handled by India's 12 major state-run ports during April-September rose by 15.25 per cent to 29.29 million tonne (MT), according to a ports' body.

The state-run ports had handled 25.41 MT of coking coal cargo in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

Shipments of thermal or steam coal, however, declined by 13.20 per cent to 44.87 million tonne, the Indian Ports Association (IPA) data showed.

The IPA said these ports handled 51.69 MT of thermal coal in the April-September period of the previous fiscal.

Thermal coal is the mainstay of the country's energy programme as 70 per cent of power generation is dependent on the dry fuel, while coking coal is used mainly for steel-making.

According to rating agency ICRA, the country's overall thermal coal import is likely to cross 200-MT mark in 2019-20.

It said that Coal India's production might fall short of its 2019-20 target of 660 MT by around 55-75 MT. Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of the country's domestic coal requirement.

Overall, the 12 major ports recorded a marginal 1.48 per cent upswing in cargo handling at 348.44 MT in April-September this fiscal against 343.37 MT in the year-ago period.

The growth was driven mainly by higher handling of coking coal, fertilisers and iron ore.

These 12 major ports are -- Deendayal (erstwhile Kandla), Mumbai, JNPT, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (earlier Ennore), V.O.Chidambaranar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia).

These ports handle about 60 per cent of the country's total cargo traffic."

As many as 25 stocks crossed above the MACD signal line on Friday to indicate a bullish trend. They included Cipla, Canara Bank, Tech Mahindra, Bharti Infratel, MCX and Nestle India."
29,2019-10-11,Coal India,"All through September, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company went around shopping FMCG, PSU, financials, insurance, power and pharma stocks as the broader market witnessed big ups and downs following a major corporate tax cut.

BSE benchmark Sensex ended the month 4 per cent higher.

India’s second biggest fund house by asset under management bought over 1 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC and PSU hydropower producer NHPC. Shares of these companies are down over 10 per cent each on a year-to-date (YTD) basis till October 9.

The money manager also bought more than 20 lakh shares each of Axis Bank, Equitas Holdings, Cipla, ICICI Bank, Federal Bank, GAIL (India), NTPC, BHEL, Power Grid and Kalpataru Power Transmission.

Barring ICICI Bank (up 20 per cent YTD), Kalpataru Power Transmission (up 16 per cent YTD) and Axis Bank (up 9 per cent YTD), other stocks are down 41 per cent YTD.

Financial stocks are drawing interest again following the recent debt and credit crisis in the market.

 “We are positive on select private banks and insurance counters, including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Lombard,” said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President for Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

Power stocks, which have taken a huge beating for several months, too are buzzing again.

“Traction in power demand could be a tad softer in the ensuing quarters. We look ahead to the new Electricity Act, which is expected to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament. We maintain our preference for NTPC, CESC and Tata Power,” Edelweiss Securities said.



ICICI Prudential also bought additional shares of IT majors HCL Technologies (18 lakh), Wipro (5.88 lakh) and Tata Consultancy Services (4.64 lakh).

Country’s largest IT services firm TCS on Thursday reported a 1.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 8,042 crore for September quarter, which was below Street expectations.

Haitong Securities has cut the target price for TCS to Rs 1,925 (Rs 2,170 earlier) post Q2 numbers. “We were surprised by the quantum of the miss on both revenue and operating profit margin in Q2,” the brokerage said.

ICICI Prudential AMC also added Bank of Baroda (16 lakh shares), Punjab National Bank (15.43 lakh shares), LIC Housing Finance (11.50 lakh shares), YES Bank (7.80 lakh shares), Kotak Mahindra Bank (5.28 lakh shares) and HDFC Bank (4.01 lakh shares) in the financial space.

On the other hand, it added Bharti Airtel (11 lakh shares) and Vodafone Idea (4.77 lakh shares) from the telecom space. Telecom stocks got a lift on Wednesday after Reliance Jio announced plans to levy a call connect charge on customers, easing the price pressure on its rivals.

Swiss brokerage UBS said Jio’s move is “a positive development for the sector, with a potential revenue and Ebitda upside of 10-12 per cent and 35-40 per cent,” since it will result in a higher outgo from the customer.

“If all operators start charging 6 paise per minute for all outgoing calls, the annual sector revenue and Ebitda can increase by Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively, although these numbers would trend downwards with gradually balancing (voice) traffic patterns,” UBS said.

The positive impact on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda), it said, could be 13-15 per cent for Airtel, 55-60 per cent for Vodafone idea, and 32-36 per cent for Jio.

The fund house has also raised bets on the insurers, including SBI Life Insurance, General Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI Lombard General Insurance. These stocks have continued to outperform the broader indices amid the NBFC crisis this year.

Emkay Global Financial Services is overweight on ICICI Prudential (IPRU) and SBI Life Insurance (SBIL). “The volatility in equity markets and higher surrenders are the key downside risks for IPRU. For SBIL, the reduction in promoter stake to meet the minimum public shareholding (MPS) guidelines (needs 2.1 per cent stake sale by September 2020) is a key concern,” it added.

In the auto and auto ancillary sector, ICICI Prudential purchased additional 9.77 lakh shares of Ashok Leyland, followed by Motherson Sumi (6.19 lakh shares), Minda Industries ( 5.49 lakh shares) and Maruti Suzuki (1.34 lakh shares).

The fund house also checked into Balrampur Chini Mills, Dalmia Bharat, Polycab India, Rail Vikas Nigam and Wheels India. On the other hand, it completely exited Asahi India, Hatsun Agro, Jet Airways, Monsanto, Shalby, Tata Communications and Techno Electric.

Overall, the fund house increased stakes in as many as 431 companies, and sold in 89 across sectors. It held 550 stocks as of September 30.

Tata Power, SAIL, Larsen & Toubro, SJVN, Hexaware Tech, ONGC, Spice Jet, JSW Energy, Container Corporation, Infosys, Asian Paints, CESC, Avenue Supermarts, MCX, Coal India, Engineers India and Gujarat State Petronet were among the top stocks the fund house offloaded during the month."

31,2019-10-13,Coal India,"Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish girl who lectured the United Nations on climate change, is being touted as a possible Nobel Prize winner. She believes she and her white Swedish teenage friends have to save the world from us terrible oldies who created the oil and coal industries.

She will be appalled by the plea of India’s coal secretary, Subhash Chandra Garg, that India must urgently expand its coal production from 600 million tonnes a year to a billion tonnes per year to meet basic energy needs. Yet Garg is right. Thunberg made headlines by sailing to the US in a solar-powered-ship to avoid using fuel oil. Does she have any idea of the enormous electricity used to produce the solar cells in her ship?

India is a lower middle income country. Sweden is among the richest. Despite the green sermons, Sweden’s annual per capita carbon emissions are 4.5 metric tonnes, higher than India (1.7 metric tonnes), Pakistan (0.9 metric tonnes) or Bangladesh (0.5 metric tonnes). South Asians can double their carbon emissions without matching Sweden’s prodigality.

Widespread activist attempts to stop all oil and coal production are hypocritical. A total switch to solar and wind energy is impossible since these are produced only intermittently when the sun shines and wind blows, maybe 25% of the year on an average. For the rest of the time, India needs coal-based electricity. Maybe new electric storage technology will ultimately change that, but today India needs massive coal expansion for thermal power.

Current carbon emissions are just the tip of the iceberg. More than 90% of historical carbon emissions since the industrial revolution are the cumulative emissions of rich western countries and Japan. The share of developing countries, including India, is a tiny fraction. Sorry Greta, the problem is not that grown-ups like me have ruined your future but that rich Swedes are still emitting more carbon than coal-using Indians.

Economist Kirit Parikh once framed India’s policy as being “we will never emit more carbon per capita than the West”. This would allow India to raise its emissions six-fold or more without being worse than others. Modi has embraced renewables massively. Even so, for round-the-clock power, India will have to create much more coal-based capacity. If the West develops viable carbon-capture technologies, India will happily adopt those.

The greatest carbon emitters are small oil producers and island economies, led by Qatar (43.9 metric tonnes). Of the industrialised countries, the USA is easily the biggest emitter (16.5 metric tonnes) followed by Australia (15.4 metric tonnes), Canada (15.2 metric tonnes), Russia (11.9 metric tonnes), Japan (9.5 metric tonnes) and Germany (8.9 metric tonnes).

Coal India Ltd is a truly third-rate coal producer. Despite Modi’s rah-rah talk of renewables, imports of thermal coal in 2018 grew at a record 19% to 172 million tonnes. This is insane because India has the third largest coal reserves in the world. For India to be importing coal is like Kuwait to be importing oil. It is crazy.

India nationalised coal in the 1970s in the belief that the public sector would optimise coal production. What a hope! In underground mines, India’s output per man shift (OMS) is a pathetic 0.8 tonnes against no less than 40 tonnes in Australia. In open cast mines, India has improved recently from an OMS of 8.6 tonnes in 2007-08 to 16.6 tonnes in 2017-18, but this is still way behind Australia’s best (75 tonnes). Enough said.

Political parties have over the years slowly and reluctantly, chipped away at Coal India’s monopoly. First private production was allowed but only for captive consumption. Last year, full commercial mining was allowed, but no auctions took place. Earlier, foreign companies were allowed only a 25% stake in coal, but finally in August 100% FDI was allowed by the automatic route.

Is this too late? Globally, coal mining giants are under fire by activist investors and NGOs, and some are selling coal assets. The World Bank and some other financiers will not finance coal mines. But Indian banks will. India is one of the few countries where coal still has a big future for at least a decade or two.

Garg argues, rightly, for auctioning massive world-sized coal blocks, not the small ones of past years. Environmental and tribal clearance, plus railway links, must be obtained in advance, so that projects do not stall halfway. This requires a sea-change in culture that is absolutely necessary. India may one day become the world’s biggest solar energy producer but needs to underpin that with thermal power."
32,2019-10-14,Coal India,"New Delhi: The government plans to keep minimal qualification criteria for companies to participate in the auction of coal blocks for commercial mining, a senior official said. The official said the government has identified 15 large blocks for the pilot round of bidding in December, adding that rules, bid documents and agreements for commercial mining are likely to be finalised soon. 




“We want to keep the entry for commercial coal mining easy for companies,” he told ET. “There will be minimal experience or net worth requirements for eligibility. The companies will be asked to submit upfront payment and bank guarantees like in the case of captive coal mines and this should take care of most of the concerns.”

 Each of the 15 identified coal blocks will have a capacity to produce 4 million tonnes per annum, the official said. The government also plans to cap the upfront payment for some large blocks which might otherwise run into a huge amount, he said. 

The official claimed that many private steel and cement companies did not participate in the latest round of auction for captive coal mines because they wanted to hold on to their cash for commercial coal auctions. However, the companies said the blocks were too far from the end use plants. 

Recent auction of captive coal mines for iron and steel, cement, and captive power plants had received a tepid response with only six blocks out of 27 receiving adequate bids to go under the hammer. The rest will be re-auctioned, the official said. Only companies registered in India can bid for commercial coal mines despite the Cabinet giving its nod to 100% foreign direct investment under automatic route for sale of coal, mining activities and
infrastructure on August 28.

The Coal Mines Nationalisation Act of 1973 mandates that only companies registered in India can participate in auctions. The Coal Mines Special Provision Act 2015, which provides for opening up of commercial coal mining to private and public entities, is an offshoot of the 1973 Act. 

The government last year laid out the guidelines for commercial coal mining. While the government will not regulate prices, marketing or sale of coal, and minimum production from the commercial coal mines will be specified, the official said. Bank guarantees are planned to be linked to it to prevent hoarding and creation of artificial scarcity, he
said. The government will hold parleys with Coal India trade unions opposing 100% FDI in coal and help them understand the impact of coal imports on the economy and employment, the official said.

 “With more coal mining, there will be more jobs in the coal mining sector,” he said. “We will hold meetings with the
coal unions to get them on board before kick-starting the auctions.” Coal India unions have called a strike on September 24 and warned of further agitation if their demands are not met."
33,2019-10-14,Coal India,"Mumbai: Brokerage Equirus initiated coverage on Coal India with an ‘add’ rating and target price of ?205 by September 2021. Tepid earnings outlook and share sales by the government have increased the uncertainty about the stock’s prospects.

“CIL’s earnings growth will remain tepid unless the government allows the company to increase prices,” said the brokerage’s analysts Ashutosh Tiwari and Siddharth Gadekar, in a recent client note. The hazy earnings prospects could take the sheen off the famed dividend story of India’s largest coal producer. The analysts delved into the key concerns for investors:


What is the uncertainty over Coal India’s earnings outlook?

Equirus said the company has been on a capex drive to increase production, but this has not translated into increased output or dispatches. Coal India’s earnings growth, according to the brokerage, would be anaemic over FY19-22 with earnings per share expected to shrink 6.6 per cent on a compounded basis.


What are the challenges for the company?

Coal India is facing multiple headwinds because of a decline in coal-based power share, increasingly cheaper renewable power, failure to ramp-up production in key subsidiaries and rising production in Indonesia, said Equirus.


What does this mean for Coal India’s dividend story?
Massive dividends had enticed investors in the past but with earnings remain under pressure, the dividend story is also fading, said Equirus. While the company can maintain a high dividend of Rs 20 per share in the near term, the future is uncertain, said Equirus. Share sales by the government as part of its disinvestment programme would also be an overhang for the stock, it said."
34,2019-10-15,Coal India,"At a time when overseas investors are not showing much confidence on Indian equities, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have been lapping up stocks selectively in spite of the ongoing slowdown in the economy.

Data shows DIIs bought shares worth Rs 53,820 crore during the second quarter of FY20, when foreign institutional investors offloaded equities worth Rs 22,460 crore. Amfi data shows investment flow through SIPs remained above Rs 8,200 crore a month through the July-September period.

Fund houses bought shares across sectors including insurance, housing finance, shipbuilding, IT, private banks, power, media and retail, data available with Ace Equity showed.

ICICI Lombard General Insurance was one of the companies that drew lot of interest of fund houses. Available data shows fund houses increased stakes in the general insurer by 4 percentage point to 8.37 per cent by the end of Q2FY20 from 4.23 per cent at the end of Q1.

SBI Life Insurance saw mutual fund holding rise to 5.80 per cent from 4.91 per cent. The stock is up nearly 40 per cent on a year-to-date basis (YTD) till October 11.

“The new Motor Vehicles Act could theoretically add Rs 9,800 crore of third-party (TP) premiums for the industry and Rs 2,600 crore for ICICI Lombard, provided there is 100 per cent compliance,” HSBC Global Research estimated in a report.

“Also, the Act is likely to result in lower loss ratios and greater reserving certainty, but lower investment float. With a high TP claims ratio of 90.8 per cent in FY19, ICICI Lombard looks set to benefit. The risk, however, is that, with rising levels of insurance, the annual regulator-set price hikes may decline going forward,” it said.

The global financial services firm has a ‘reduce’ rating on ICICI Lombard with a price target of Rs 940. “We believe the shares are overvalued,” it said.

Axis Securities is bullish on SBI Life with a price target of Rs 936. “SBI Life is a play on the under-penetrated life insurance market, with a strong distribution foot print of its parent SBI. Given the untapped distribution reach, along with tailwinds from financialisation of savings, improving protection share, lowest operating cost ratios, and improving margins, we expect SBI Life to deliver steady performance,” the brokerage said.

Among others, LIC Housing Finance, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, eClerx, Coffee Day Enterprises, Axis Bank, V-Mart Retail, TV Today Network and TVS Motor saw mutual funds increase holdings by at least 2 percentage point during the quarter gone by.

Indiabulls Ventures is bullish on Axis Bank with a 12-month price target of Rs 800. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the stock is up 7.20 per cent to Rs 672.50 on October 11 from Rs 627.50 on January 1.

With a 81 per cent rally YTD, Garden Reach Shipbuilders emerged as top gainer on the list. On the other hand, shares of eClerx and Coffee Day Enterprises have declined more than 60 per cent during this period.

Coal India, Birlasoft, Sonata Software, Unichem Laboratories, Mold-Tek Packaging, Housing Development Finance Corporation, Capacite Infraprojects, Cera Sanitaryware, Indian Oil Corporation and SJVN were other top favourites of mutual fund houses during the quarter.

IIFL Institutional Equities is positive on Coal India with a price target of Rs 270. The brokerage said CIL’s production and offtake in April-Sept FY20 declined 6 per cent and 5.2 per cent YoY, respectively, as heavy rains and multiple work disruptions impacted Q2 production and offtake declined 13 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.

“We expect a gradual recovery in volumes during the second half of FY20 driven by inventory re-stocking cycle and a seasonal uptick in power demand. CIL is attractively valued but the overhang of stake sale remains,” IIFL said.

Meanwhile, many fund houses dumped shares of select chemical, amusement park and pharma players and public sector banks during the quarter. For instance, they reduced holdings in Ujjivan Financial Services to 3.90 per cent from 8.40 per cent and cut stakes in Mindtree, Wonderla Holidays, Adlabs Entertainment and Intellect Design Arena by over 2 percentage point each.

Other stocks that saw offloading of shares by fund houses included Clariant Chemicals, Amara Raja Batteries, Canara Bank, Neuland Laboratories, Tata Power, The Karnataka Bank, PNB Housing Finance and Premier Explosives. MF holdings in each of these stocks fell by over 1 percentage point during the quarter."

40,2019-10-17,Coal India,"A 44 km-long new railway line in Chhattisgarh under East Rail Corridor from Kharsia to Korichapar commenced operations on October 12. This will enable coal evacuation from two large coalfields at Mand-Raigarh and Korba under the largest coal-producing subsidiary of Coal India, South Eastern Coalfields (SECL).

Chattisgarh East Railway (CERL), a special purpose vehicle floated by SECL, the government of Chattisgarh and IRCON International undertook the construction of the 136 km East Rail Corridor at an investment of Rs. 3,055 crore. It will connect Kharsia, Korichapar, Dharamjaygarh and Korba. While SECL holds a 64% stake in this tri-partite SPV, Chattisgarh government and IRCON holds 10% and 26% respectively. ""Synergy between all the parties of the SPV helped the line to go operational in record time,"" said a Coal India statement, issued on Thursday. 

SECL has started loading two rakes of coal per day from Bijari, Baroud and Jampali mines of Mand-Raigarh which will increase further five to six rakes per day pushing up coal supplies to power stations in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Plans include adding more loading points on the track to increase loading quantities.

With Kharsia-Korichapar line opening up, Mand-Raigarh coalfields, endowed with large coal resources will have an evacuation outlet. Availability of transport facility further unlocks the production potential of these coalfields. ""As the work progresses and infrastructure is developed we shall start loading more coal"" said the stated official.

SECL is expected to play a lead role in Coal India's one billion tonne coal production aspiration by 2025-26 with a contribution of around 26% at 262 Million Tonnes. The next leg of the 30 Km line between Korichapar and Dharamjaygarh is likely to come up by the middle of 2020. Later, with Dharamjaygarh finally getting connected to Korba – a stretch of 62 kilometres – CERL will see its conclusion of 136 Km rail line.

All the three important rail lines that Coal India has been persistently pursuing have now materialized. These are Jharsuguda-Sardega under MCL in Odisha, Tori-Shivpur under CCL in Jharkhand and Kharsia-Korichapar under SECL in Chattisgarh. These are coalfields that have large coal reserves and production potential which will contribute to higher coal production of CIL in future."
41,2019-10-17,Coal India,"South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) is expected to produce 262 million tonnes (MT) by 2025 -26, contributing 26 per cent to the one billion tonne coal production target of Coal India, officials said on Thursday.

The subsidiary of the coal behemoth aims at playing a lead role to meet the production goal with its new rail corridor being built at a cost of Rs 3,055 crore, the officials said.

""The 136 km East Rail Corridor from Kharsia-Korichapar -Dharamjaygarh-Korba will play a key role to meet the production goal, Coal India officials said.

The miner had also decided to procure rakes of its own to expedite supplies of the fuel through the mode of railways.

In 2018-19, SECL had produced 153 million tonne of coal and the new railway tracks will help coal evacuation from greenfield and existing mines, the miner said.

In the first phase, the 44-km of new railway line in Chhattisgarh between Kharsia and Korichapar has been made operational from October 12.

""Already, two rakes a day are being loaded but this will be increased, and coal is now supplied to power stations of Maharashtra and Gujarat,"" an official said.

East Rail Corridor is developed by the Chhattisgarh East Railway Limited (CERL), a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) between SECL, Chhattisgarh government and IRCON International at a cost of Rs 3,055 crore for laying down a 136 km rail line from Kharsia-Korichapar-Dharamjaygarh-Korba.

While SECL holds a stake of 64 per cent in this tri- partite SPV, Chhattisgarh government and IRCON have 10 per cent and 26 per cent holding respectively.

The next phase of the 30 km railway line between Korichapar and Dharamjaygarh is likely to come up by middle of 2020 and from Dharamjaygarh to Korba, a stretch of 62 kms, is expected to be linked by end by 2022."

50,2019-10-23,Coal India,"Kolkata: A series of fatal accidents at mines in Coal India has prompted one of its mining subsidiaries to advance mining shift timings by an hour to increase workers’ alertness and reduce mishaps. This will be introduced at all subsidiaries if found effective.

Coal India meets almost 70 per cent of the country’s coal requirement and will produce almost 660 million tonnes of coal this year.

“Analysis of incidents has revealed that physical well being and mental alertness of employees play an important role in preventing accidents,” a senior Coal India executive told ET. “The pattern of recent incidents indicate night shifts to be relatively challenging for safe operations. Employees are prone to lose their mental alertness towards the end of the night shift. This necessitated a relook at the shift timings.”

Following deliberations between unions and executives at Northern Coalfields, which contributes 20% of total production, it was inferred that poor mental alertness towards the end of the night shift was a major contributor to several accidents that occurred in the past.

In 2018, 120 accidents at Coal India mines resulted in 43 fatalities and 96 serious injuries. Out of this, 11 accidents were at Northern Coalfields, resulting in three death and serious injuries to eight others. The highest number of fatal accidents, however, was at South Eastern Coalfields, another large Coal India subsidiary. Thirty accidents led to 15 death and serious injury to 19 employees.

At Northern Coalfields, workers operate in three shifts of an eight-and-half hour each including a half-hour rest time. All shifts have a half-hour overlap, which is unique to this subsidiary since it operates large opencast mines requiring passing on information about the current status of operations.

Earlier morning shifts were from 6 am till 2.30 pm, the afternoon shift used to start from 2 pm and end at 10.30 pm while the night shift used to start at 10 pm and end the following day at 6.30 AM.

Since last week, the morning shift starts at 5 am and ends at 1.30 pm, while the afternoon shift starts at 1 pm and ends at 9.30 pm. Night shift starts at 9 pm and ends at 5.30 pm the following day.

“Considering factors like sleeping habits, mental alertness and supervision, both workers and executives were of the view that if employees in the night shift are allowed to leave at 5 am, there would be better control on the unsafe incidents due to the early commencement of the first shift,” an executive at Northern Coalfields said.

The executive said the company convinced family members of workers before making the change."
54,2019-10-24,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-owned CIL on Thursday said it will switch over to mechanised transportation of coal through piped conveyor belts in its large mines by 2023-24, replacing the existing road movement of the dry fuel.

Piped conveyor belt transportation is a covered system for movement of coal and thus promotes environment safety and prevents possible coal pilferage.

The system is already operational in some of the mines of Coal India Ltd (CIL), the company said in a statement.

This will be implemented in 35 of CIL's coal projects each having production capacity of four million tonne per annum (MTPA) and above.

For necessary infrastructure upgrade at these 35 projects, including railway lines, CIL will invest through its capital expenditure, the statement said.

This initiative involves setting up of Coal Handling Plants (CHPs) with silos having rapid loading systems, which will have benefits like crushing, sizing of coal, quicker and quality coal loading.

Setting up of CHPs apart from efficient loading and reduced manual intervention spur better quality in coal supply.

Presently, coal is transported through road by trucks from the pithead to despatch point which tends to add up to dust and air pollution, the statement said.

CIL loaded 151 MT through silos/rapid loading system during 2018-19.

Additionally, around 420 MT of coal is planned to be loaded through silos and surge bins, which will be set up at 35 projects identified, elevating the total mechanised loading to 571 MT by 2023-24.

CIL aims to produce 880 MT of coal by 2023-24 which means 65 per cent of the total coal produced would be moved through covered pipe conveyor system by then and loaded mechanically.

Infrastructure for 24 silos and 11 surge bin loading systems will be set up in all subsidiaries of CIL by 2023-24 for mechanised loading.

""Improved loading time will bring down the wagon idling. Wagon cycle time will be reduced by few hours thus increasing wagon availability. It is a win-win situation for the company, railways and the consumer,"" a Coal India official said."
53,2019-10-24,Coal India,"Kolkata: Production at almost all underground coal mines of Coal India subsidiary Eastern Coalfields will be suspended on Sundays and holidays following continued financial loses, the company has said in an internal note.
The note, reviewed by ET, said in view of losses in the last three months, it has been decided to curtail wasteful expenditures. 

As part of the drive, underground mines will be allowed to work on Sundays and holidays only if their output per man shift (OMS), that is average production by each worker in the mine, has been at least one tonne in the preceding week. OMS is calculated by dividing total production by the total number of workers in any particular mine in a period.

The company has also decided to curtail Sunday manpower for inspection and maintenance by 25%. This will, however, not be applicable for manpower for statutory obligations. The board of this subsidiary has further decided to curtail overtime engagement by 25% of the present sanctioned limit since the beginning of this month.

“Output per man shift is less than one for almost all 54 underground operational mines at Eastern Coalfields,” said a senior Coal India executive. “Underground mines like Jhanjra and Sarpi where mass production technology has been deployed, including continuous mining, report output per man shift of more than one regularly.”

“Although, we have not yet finalised the financial results for the July-September period, we have realised the company is running in loses due to an increase in production costs including a rise in salaries and wages and hence the cost-cutting measures,” the executive said.

Suspending operations saves expenditure on inputs like diesel and power as well as salaries and wages.

Most of Eastern Coalfields’ underground operations are legacy mines inherited during the nationalisation of the company more than four decades ago.

This subsidiary operates a total of 84 working mines, of which 20 are opencast, 10 mixed mines and the rest 54 are underground. According to executives, the average output per man shift of all mines at Eastern Coalfields including opencast ones was 3.58 tonnes in 2018-19. However, the average output per man shift for underground mines for the subsidiary was 0.78 tonnes only.

Eastern Coalfields has shut mines based on a threshold output per man shift in the past to curtail costs. However, the level has been far less like 0.5 tonnes or less. The rising cost of production due to rise in input costs including manpower bill forced the company to raise this cut-off to one tonne. It is expected to hit production marginally since underground mines contribute around 20% of the total coal production in a year.

During 2018-19, Eastern Coalfields reported a post-tax total comprehensive income of Rs 706.38 crore against a post-tax total comprehensive loss of Rs 824.17 crore in the previous year."

51,2019-10-24,Coal India,"Commerce and industry minister 
Piyush Goyal said that ecommerce companies are cooperating with the government after being sent questionnaires over complaints regarding the alleged violation of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. He also spoke to 
Kirtika Suneja in Stockholm about issues such as India’s redlines in trade negotiations with the US, its position on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) treaty and plans to modernise the Indian Railways. Goyal, who’s also minister for railways, was in Stockholm to attend the Swedish-India Business Leaders Roundtable. 
Edited excerpts:


The government has sent questionnaires to e-commerce companies and told them to comply with the rules. Are they cooperating, and is there a time frame by when they have to reply?I’ve said before also on several occasions that while we welcome e-commerce companies to India we have explained to all of them the importance of running e-commerce as an agnostic marketplace where all suppliers get equal opportunity to offer their products and buyers have a choice to buy certain or any products on that marketplace.

There are well-defined rules that they can’t have ownership or control over the inventory at any stage and can’t be selling their own products on that marketplace, and several other associated conditionalities were attached when we permitted e-commerce. We also have a very clearly laid out policy of not allowing multi-brand retail with foreign ownership more than 49%. E-commerce companies are expected to respect these policies and the law of the land both in letter and spirit.

Certain complaints were made to the ministry that some of the e-commerce companies were engaged in selling products at highly discounted prices, leading to concerns of predatory pricing. There were some complaints about circumvention of the e-commerce policy and our multi-brand retail laws, and in all fairness, it is the government’s duty to verify, validate all such complaints, which is why I believe e-commerce companies may have been asked certain questions and the department will assess the response.

So far, I haven’t received any complaint of non-cooperation and I’ve had several interactions with e-commerce companies, and at different times they have assured me that they will work within the letter and spirit of the law, comply with India’s laws and policies fully and always be available for any clarification to satisfy the Indian authorities on the law of the land.


By when do you expect issues around the US trade deal to get resolved?
Trade deals are very complex issues. It’s not a switch off-switch on and something where we work on deadlines with a pistol on our head. We have to very carefully analyse and assess long-term impact of trade negotiations and trade transactions and deals, and neither side would like to rush it. We would like to ensure a fair deal which should be good for the people of both countries. Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and I are working through the numbers, doing a lot of number crunching and internal reconciliation with other line ministries so that what we finally decide is good for the people of India and is also good for the people of the US.


What are our redlines or non-negotiables in the trade deal with the US?
Redline issues are often there and no government compromises on any redline issue. For example, one redline issue that immediately comes to my mind is any product coming into India which has got animal feed into the food chain will be a redline if it is not properly marketed as a non-vegetarian product because of the religious sensitivities around it. Or let’s say opening up access to certain agricultural products where India is self-sufficient and we want to protect our farming community.

There are always certain issues where one takes extra precautions and ensures that it doesn’t affect the Indian ecosystem, but usually in a trade deal, there are no complete no-nos. One can always work around and find sustainable solutions which can be acceptable to all parties. The job of good trade negotiators is to find solutions.


What will be India’s position on RCEP, especially when there is opposition from industry?
Whether to join RCEP or not, this decision will be taken going forward. In what form we join it is more important. And in the form on which discussions are happening and issues being negotiated, that is an example how trade negotiations can be beneficial for India’s people and industry. How we have carefully looked at every aspect, individual industry’s concerns, benefit from market access from every country and what our needs are that other countries can fulfil. We have thought about all these and with sufficient safeguards which will take care of India’s industry and not harm them, we are thinking over all these issues.

I will assure Indian industry not to worry about it. Whatever happens will be for the good of the people and industry, boost Make in India and create employment opportunities, benefit consumers, help create infrastructure at low cost and open new avenues for India’s strength in services sector. We will go forward looking at all these for comprehensive and holistic benefit to India.


In which sectors is Sweden keen to invest in India?
In the transport sector, they have shown interest. Transport and energy are two sectors where Sweden is working a lot. Many Indian IT companies are working in Sweden. There are nearly 35,000 people of Indian origin working here, largely in the IT sector. They want many more people of Indian origin, especially professionals, to come here and work.


Do you expect any new tie-ups with Swedish companies in railways?
In railways, several companies are already present in India under the Make in India initiative. Swedish companies are working on electrification, signalling and telecom systems, train sets, coaches, metro and equipment.

We had an engagement with railway companies where Bombardier was there, Ericsson from telecom was there, ABB and SAAB were there. I gave them a few challenges. For instance, Wi-Fi has now reached 5,150 railway stations in India. In future, every train should have Wi-Fi and there are companies here which can work on it so that when we invite bids, Swedish companies can make it in India. The target is to reach 6,500 stations. The last 1,000 will take a little longer due to technical challenges as the optic fibre cable has not reached there, or the ecosystem is missing. That should take six-eight months. We will start working on Wi-Fi in trains after that.

Today, the feed on trains (data loaders) is linked to stations. As and when a train passes a station, the feed can be picked up from the stations. Going forward, all passenger trains will have Wi-Fi. We hope to achieve this target in the next three-four years.


Is this one of the big plans for the railways now that you have ruled out privatisation?
I have ruled out privatisation. It (Indian Railways) will continue to be a government entity. I do believe that we need large investment in the railways. The target is around Rs 50 lakh crore investment in the next 12 years in upgradation of infrastructure, new lines, new dedicated freight corridors, new high-speed and semi high-speed train lines and train sets, which require huge investment. We want to improve passenger services, speed of trains; we want to further improve our safety record. In the current year, from April 1, there has been zero fatality in Indian Railways.

The signalling system is going to be completely overhauled over the next five-seven years so that it adds to safety, it adds to capacity and ensures much more seamless movement of trains in a very efficient manner. All this will need a lot of capital and money and we are looking at public-private partnerships. We are looking at how railways can become a carrier where many people can serve the people.

We also believe that railways need not own the entire wagons so that Coal India can have its own wagons for moving coal, NTPC can have its own wagons for moving coal and moving train rakes. Our idea is that in partnership with Indian Railways we should be able to invite investment so that people can get better service without compromising the character of Indian Railways, which will always remain government.


Private sector has not been allowed to come into the railways, be it containers or station modernisation. How will you assure foreign investors in such a scenario?I won’t entirely agree. There are several large private players in container movement besides Container Corporation. Several companies own their own rakes, several companies have their own private freight stations. On station modernisation, we have been able to do the pilots in Bhopal, which is nearing completion. NBCC is working on 12-13 locations to modernise the stations and simultaneously develop housing, commercial connectivity, shopping malls in a cross-subsidy model. Once these models become successful, there will be a faster roll-out across the country. What we are trying to do now is segregate station modernisation with monetisation of land. There are a lot of possibilities to involve the private sector in all these activities. I also have other plans to develop railway land such as solar installations in a big way.

We want to make Indian Railways the world’s first zero emission railway. We are fast moving towards 100% electrification of the railways and in the next four-five years, we shall be 100% electric. Having said that, one other area where I think the government and railways should work together is to see where we have surplus land in big measure and can promote industrial parks. It’s a new area and we are going to try to locate certain parcels of land that the railways owns but doesn’t need for its own requirement which can at some stage become industrial parks and become generators of large number of jobs and working opportunities while adding to the economic activity in India.


Will these parks be necessarily related to railways?
Not always. They could be related to railways but not necessarily always. Usually they are located quite near the railways land. So, there will be good connectivity and goods can come in there and move from there through the rail network very efficiently.


Is there a target for land monetisation this year?
As of now, I don’t see that we are planning too much of land monetisation in the current year for housing projects, but we could consider land monetisation for freight terminals or container terminals, wagon sidings and other such ancillary activities.


The IRCTC IPO was a success. Was that only because of the attractive pricing?
Railways is an engine of growth. Also, IRCTC has done some wonderful work in the last few years, particularly on passenger bookings and serving passengers in terms of improving the quality of catering, allowing independent companies to come and cater to passengers on the train, and the services it has been giving have helped it build databases and I think those databases have a lot of value. So they have ambitious plans to look at tourism in a big way, foray into newer areas in partnership or on their own in different fields, which I think the market recognised and gave a good value.


The offer price left room for too much of an upside...
That is good. Giving an upside to investors always gives you better traction the next time you are doing fundraising. Many successful companies the world over have been successful because they gave very good upside to their investors and were able to build up a strong loyal group of people who are always willing to participate with that company in more and more offerings.

56,2019-10-25,Coal India,"Electricity generation during September declined 3.4% year-on-year on account of a 10.0% fall in thermal generation, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has stated in a recent report. The report is based on data provided by various departments.

All-India energy demand and supply also decreased by 1.5% year-on-year and 1.4% year-on-year in September 2019, respectively, resulting in a decrease in energy deficit to 0.6% (September 2018: 0.7%). Energy demand was lower due to extended monsoon and decrease in demand from industrial states such as Maharashtra (down 16.2% year-on-year), Gujarat (down 16.6% year-on-year) and Tamil Nadu (down 5.9% year-on-year).

On the supply side, the thermal sector witnessed a decrease in power generation to 78.6 billion units (September 2018: 87.4BUs) on account of lower demand and coal shortages at power plants. 

All-India thermal plant load factor – capacity utilisation, fell to 51.1% in September 2019 (September 2018: 59.8%) as central, state and private sector capacity utilisation decreased to 57.8% (69.1%), 43.2% (55.2%) and 52.3% (56.1%), respectively. 

All-India capacity utilisation at power plants is lowest since April 2015 whereas the decline in central sector capacity utilisation to 58% is substantial compared to an average capacity utilisation of 72% over FY16-FY19. Overall generation was aided by a 19.1% year-on-year increase in hydro generation to 20.8 billion units.

Coal production by Coal India declined for the third consecutive month to 23.5% year-on-year in September 2019, owing to lower production at its key subsidiaries Mahanadi Coalfields (MCL; down 33.3% year-on-year), South Eastern Coalfields (SECL; down 26.4% year-on-year) and Northern Coalfields (NCL; down 4% year-on-year). CIL’s production for 1HFY20 decreased by 6% year-on-year to 241 million tonnes.

Coal inventory at thermal power stations rose 56.1% year-on-year to 17.3 million tonnes in September 2019, however, it declined 19.9% month-on-month due to lower coal production. Coal availability at pithead and non-pithead plants on 30 September 2019 remained low at 6 days and 13 days, respectively.

The short-term power price at Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) decreased year-on-year to Rs 2.77 per unit (September 2018: Rs 4.69 unit) on account of a decrease in demand at the exchange. Difference in buy & sell bid volumes, in September 2019, in day-ahead market, increased to negative 4,504 million units (September 2018: negative 280MUs).

Transmission line addition has been lower in FY19 with 5,303 circuit kilometres added till September 2019 (September 2018: 9,932 circuit kilometres). Transmission line addition in September 2019 was 766 circuit kilometres (September 2018: 1,760 circuit kilometres) with 64% of addition coming from the central sector."
55,2019-10-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-run Coal India will invest between 15,000 and 20,000 crore by March 2024 to switch over to mechanised coal handling and loading systems at its mines. It will be implemented at 35 projects with a yearly production capacity of 4 million tonnes and above.

The move is part of its thrust on green initiatives and upgradation of mechanised loading system in first-mile connectivity — coal-transport from pithead to dispatch points.

The initiative involves setting up coal handling plants (CHPs) with silos and mechanised coal transport system through piped conveyor belts replacing existing road transport. It will enable quick crushing and sizing with the advantage of pre-weighed coal quantity being loaded.

“Piped conveyor belt transportation is a covered system for movement of coal and thus promotes environment safety and prevent possible coal pilferage,” a Coal India executive said. CHPs with mechanised loading and reduced manual intervention spurs better quality in coal supply. CIL loaded 151 million tonnes through silos/rapid loading system during 2018-19.

Around 420 million tonnes of coal is planned to be loaded through silos and surge bins, which will be set up at 35 identified mines, elevating total mechanized loading to 571 million tonnes by 2023-24. CIL aims to produce 880 million tonnes by FY 2024, 65% of which would be moved through a covered pipe conveyor system by then and loaded mechanically. Infrastructure for 24 silos and 11 surge bin loading systems will be set up in all of the subsidiaries of CIL by FY 2024 for mechanised loading.

Shifting over to piped conveyor belt transportation will result in a bundle of benefits to coal consumers and Coal India, apart from promoting a cleaner environment and easing the load on road networks. This will also result in saving of diesel.

At present, coal is transported through road by trucks from the pithead to dispatch points which tend to add up to dust and air pollution. Coal loading on to wagons is done through payloaders, which is prone to overloading or underloading apart from susceptibility of extraneous material being loaded leading to quality issues.

“Improved loading time will bring down the wagon idling. Wagon cycle time will be reduced by a few hours, thus increasing wagon availability. It is a win-win situation for the company, railways and the consumer,” the executive said.

CIL aims to produce 880 million tonnes by FY 2024, 65% of which would be moved through a covered pipe conveyor system."
57,2019-10-26,Coal India,"A 26% fall in power demand at the Indian Energy Exchange over the last seven days pulled down prices by almost 23% to Rs 2.34 per unit. This was triggered by intermittent rainfall in various regions including metro cities.

Demand for power at the Exchange was 13.51 million units last Saturday. It dropped to 9.97 million units today. Sell bids on the other hand increased 31.62% to 34.34 million units bringing down prices from Rs 3.03 per unit last Saturday to Rs 2.34 per unit.

For entire period, total purchase bids were 95.68 million units, while sell bids were 252 million units. Some 86 million units of power were successfully traded and placed for delivery. Power volume cleared for trading gradually declined over the period. During the period it fell 18%.

Demand for power has been gradually falling over the past few weeks. According to data available, all-India energy demand and supply decreased 1.5% year-on-year and 1.4% year-on-year in September 2019, respectively.

58,2019-10-26,Coal India,"Coal India has managed to command a 82% premium over notified prices for coal sold through spot e-auctions conducted during September. For the period April-September, the company managed to command a premium of 67% over its notified prices on an average.

At special forward e-auction for the power sector, Coal India managed to sell coal at a premium of 27% over notified prices in September. For the April-September period, the company managed to command average premium of 32% over notified prices.

There were no exclusive auction for the non-power sector.

Nevertheless, Coal India has decided to ramp up auction offerings by 14% during the current fiscal against the previous year when similar supplies declined 5%. This year Coal India has decided to auction 137 million tonnes of coal which would include long term supply contract auctions, spot e-auctions and forward e-auctions.

Last year, the dry fuel supplier offered 120 million tonnes through similar auctions which was a 5% drop compared to the previous year (2017-18). Increased offerings this year is expected to bring down premiums which touched 92% in the spot market last year as availability through spot e-auctions had dwindled almost 38% among other reasons like higher international coal prices and Rupee depreciation.

Last year unforeseen demand from power generators forced Coal India to send them additional coal as the sector was grappling with dwindling inventory and many power plants were stranded with critical coal stocks. Last year, premiums for special forward e-auction for power and special spot e-auction was 72% while exclusive e-auction for non-power fetched 58% premium. The number of critical plants had touched 29 in October last year while stocks and dipped to 6 million tonnes."

60,2019-10-29,Coal India,"Coal India plans to submit binding bids for acquiring stakes in coking coal assets in Australia and Canada by March 2020. The firm is in the process of appointing merchant bankers for the assets it has identified. The quantum of stake to be bought would be decided after a due diligence.

In Australia, Coal India has shortlisted some working mines, while in Canada, it is targeting ready-to-produce blocks where exploration, land acquisition and environmental approvals have been completed.

After detailed preparatory work - which includes due diligence, onsite assessment, along with technical and legal advice - the investment proposal would be put up to its board for approval if the investment is within ?5,000 crore and beyond that the state-run miner would require clearance from the central government.

Coal India’s domestic reserves are inadequate to meet India’s demand. “The idea is to import coking coal into India since the country does not have adequate reserves of this category of the fossil fuel which is mainly used in metallurgical industries,” said chairman AK Jha.

The plan is to set up coking coal and high-grade thermal coal mining business overseas with a view to acquiring coal resources, producing the fuel and importing it either by opening new mines or through acquisition of equity participation in working mines on production-sharing participation interest basis."

66,2019-10-30,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Resolution of stressed thermal assets remain slow despite various measures undertaken by the government and lenders, with only about 10% of the 40 GW stressed coal-based capacity achieving resolution, mainly through acquisition by a new sponsor, analyst firm ICRA has deduced.

In a report on the sector, ICRA said that the balance capacity is under various stages of resolution, including Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). However, resolution of 12 GW gas-based capacity continues to remain uncertain, given the inadequate availability of domestic gas and the absence of any policy measures for the use of imported R-LNG with subsidy support as well as the measures to incentivize such projects to meet the peaking / ancillary power demand.

“The progress on stressed asset resolution remains slow because of the time taken to achieve resolution, regulatory challenges in securing approvals for projects with existing competitively bid-based power purchase agreements (PPAs), still limited progress in signing of new long-term PPAs and subdued thermal capacity utilization levels,” said Girish Kumar Kadam, sector head & vice president at ICRA Ratings. “Also, improvement in discoms’ financial position remained lower than expected, which can hamper the sustainability of demand growth and signing of new long-term PPAs”

In one such instance, the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission issued a tariff order in case of a stressed asset which had been subject to partial debt write-down, directing the acquiring entity to offer tariff discount under the existing PPA. However, this particular order has now been set aside by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).

Electricity demand growth slowed down to 4.4% in the first six months of FY2020, from 6.0% growth witnessed in the corresponding previous period. The slowdown in electricity demand was primarily witnessed in the months of August 2019 and September 2019, despite a healthy growth of 7.4% in Q1 FY2020.

The slowdown can be attributed to lower demand from household and agriculture segments following heavy rains in August 2019 and September 2019 and moderation in demand from industrial segment. This, in turn, coupled with healthy growth in generation from hydro, nuclear and renewable sources in 6M FY2020, led to a decline in capacity utilisation to 57.7% from 59.5% in 6M FY2019.

The decline in capacity utilisation of thermal power plants is a reversal of improvement witnessed over the past two years. The decline was sharpest for the central sector coal utilities from 70.8% in 6M FY2019 to 64.2% in 6M FY2020.

“Nonetheless, the capacity utilisation of thermal plants on all India level is expected to show modest improvement to about 62-63% in FY21, driven by limited capacity addition (< 6 GW per year) in the thermal segment, renewable capacity addition of about 10-12 GW per year and annual energy demand growth of about 5%,” said Vikram V, associate head & AVP, corporate ratings at ICRA Ltd. Supply of coal to the power sector by Coal India declined by 7.0% in H1 FY2020 on a YoY basis, because of lower production due to extended monsoon season and the labour issues. Apart from energy demand growth, the increase in production and supply of domestic coal also remains critical to improving capacity utilisation levels in the second half of FY2020 and thereafter."

The coal behemoth had produced 30.77 million tonne in September this year.

The data indicates that the miner's rate-of-production has not been picked up, which led to a shortfall in the month.

Coal India aspires to produce 660 million tonne of the dry fuel in FY20.

According to provisional data, the miner produced 278.92 million tonne of coal till October 30 in FY20, achieving 82.17 per cent of the target of 339.43 million tonne.

The miner's data also suggested that its offtake target was 360.44 million tonne for the period while the company achieved 314.59 million tonne.

1,2019-11-01,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India aims at a net profit of Rs 14,664 crore for this fiscal – lower than Rs 17,462 crore it had secured a year ago – and a marginal rise in its gross revenue to Rs 1.5 lakh crore from Rs 1.4 lakh crore.

Analysts, however, are sceptical about the company meeting its target despite a lower profit outlook.

The state-run miner is working to boost its net revenue from operations to Rs 1 lakh crore from Rs 92,896 crore in 2018-19.

“Financial targets are kept modest which are generally surpassed by the company. Additionally, the ministry takes account of the prices of coal and the rise in input costs as well. Keeping all these factors in view, the target for profit after tax has been kept at a level lower than achieved last year,” a senior Coal India executive said.

According to an agreement Coal India signed with the coal ministry, if the company manages to produce 660 million tonnes of fuel this year, it would be rated ‘Excellent’ and if it secures 80% of its target, the rating would be ‘Very Good’.

Analysts believe that Coal India would, however, miss its production target this year. ICRA Ratings has estimated that production will fall short by around 55-75 million tonnes (MT). In such a scenario, its ratings would be ‘Poor’.

The company’s April-September output fell 6% because of floods and labour problems as against a 7% rise a year ago.

“In order to achieve the targeted annual coal production or produce anywhere close to the annual guidance of 660 MT, Coal India would have to step up production to the average of 2.3 MT per day for the rest of the year. This looks unlikely, given that in recent times, the central miner has been able to briefly sustain its 2-MT-per-day average production rate only in March 2018 and March 2019,” said Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president and group head for corporate sector ratings at ICRA.

The rating agency has also indicated that domestic auction prices for coal had been declining steadily between January and June and a large part of Coal India’s profit comes from e-auctions.

Its average premium for spot e-auctions fell from 131% in December 2018 to 55% in June 2019. With production declining by 5.1% and 10.3% Y-o-Y in July and August 2019, respectively, spot e-auction premia started rising, inching up to 62% and 87% in July and August of 2019.

Spot prices remained elevated in September and are likely to hold firm in October as well as CIL’s production remains constrained by the late retreat of the South-West monsoon to mid-October."
2,2019-11-01,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Coal India will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year and would offer around 10,000 new jobs to boost employment, Union minister Pralhad Joshi said on Friday.

Coal India (CIL) will further produce 1 billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, the coal ministry quoted Joshi as saying.

""The CIL is also likely to offer around ten thousand new jobs to boost employment,"" the coal minister said.

Joshi also directed CIL to take necessary steps to achieve this goal in light of growing energy requirements of the nation and assured the PSU of all possible help from the Ministry of Coal in this regard.

The minister announced this target during his address at the 45th foundation day of CIL in Kolkata on Friday.

The PSU is currently given the target of producing 660 million tonnes of coal amounting to 82 per cent of the country's coal output.

""It is heartening to know that Coal India has planned for huge capital investments for its works and expansion programmes, along with bringing in new technologies in its operations. The company will also be on hiring personnel and I am hopeful that it will achieve all assigned goals on time,"" the minister said.

Joshi said that with the demand for power rising steeply, there is enough opportunity for both government and private sectors to produce coal without adversely impacting each other.

Referring to the government's recent decision of 100 per cent FDI under automatic route in the coal sector as one of the much-needed structural reforms, he said that it will minimise the volume of coal import and will be mutually beneficial.

The minister sought to allay fears of domestic players and labour unions by reiterating that FDI in the coal sector does not stand for FDI in Coal India.

During his address, the minister also urged Coal India to get associated with Jal Shakti Abhiyan to conserve water and provide treated mine water to the populace living in and around coal mining areas.

On the Prime Minister's call for eradication of Tuberculosis (TB) from India by 2025, the minister appealed Coal India to eradicate the disease in and around mining areas by 2024 under its Corporate Social Responsibility programme."
3,2019-11-01,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has decided to advance its target year for achieving an annual production capacity of one billion tonnes by two years -- 2024. 

The company was earlier planning to achieve the target by 2019-20. However, lack of adequate demand and a plethora of issues with respect to raising production levels had forced the company to push back the deadline to 2025-26.

Minister of Coal & Mines, Pralhad Joshi on Friday said state-run Coal India will produce one billion tonnes coal by 2023-24 and the company has to produce 750 million tonnes in the next fiscal. This year its production target is 660 million tonnes which, analysts believe, may not be achieved due to a series of issues.

The minister was addressing employees at the 45th Coal India Foundation Day.

He also said the company will offer around eight thousand jobs in the near future to boost the employment and directed Coal India to take necessary steps to achieve these goals in light of growing energy requirements of the nation and assured all possible support from the government and ministry of coal to achieve these goals.

“Power demand is rising so fast and steeply that there is enough opportunity for both government and private sectors to produce coal without adversely impacting each other. Referring, the central government’s recent decision of 100% foreign direct investment under automatic route in coal, as one of the much-needed structural reforms in the sector, he said the decision will minimize the volume of coal import that is denting the government exchequer and will help the nation get much amount of coal.

“He made it very clear that FDI in coal does not stand for FDI in Coal India and the government wants to strengthen Coal India,” a statement issued by coal ministry mentioned.

Moreover, he said, due to foreign direct investment, there is scope for mutual learning as foreign companies – apart from providing appointment – will bring advanced coal mining technology and modern planning and management practices, which Coal India can imbibe. These companies on the other hand can learn about local conditions and the handling of various issues from Indian coal companies. Hence, the fear of domestic players and labour unions are misplaced.

He also urged Coal India to get associated with central government’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan to conserve water and provide treated mine water to the populace living in and around coal mining areas. On the Prime Minister’s call for eradication of Tuberculosis (TB) from India by 2025, the minister appealed Coal India to eradicate TB in and around coal mining areas in 08 states of the country by 2024 under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs."
4,2019-11-03,Coal India,"New Delhi: The finance ministry is likely to come out with the next tranches of CPSE and Bharat-22 exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the previous quarter of the current financial year in its efforts to meet ambitious disinvestment target of over Rs 1 lakh crore.

Based on the realisation of the disinvestment process in the three quarters, the decision on the next tranches of the ETFs would be taken during the January-March quarter, sources said.

Accordingly, the quantum will be fixed as to how much to raise through the ETF mode to meet the target set for the current financial year, the sources added.

The CPSE ETF was launched for the first time in March 2014. Thereafter, five tranches were offered in January 2017, March 2017, November 2018, March 2019, and July 2019.

The ETF invests in 11 public sector companies, including ONGC, Coal India, Indian Oil Corporation, Oil India, GAIL, Engineers India Ltd and Container Corporation of India.

The government raised Rs 11,500 crore from the last tranche of CPSE ETF floated in July.

Another ETF, Bharat-22, introduced in 2017, has helped the government mop up about Rs 40,000 crore from this.

The fourth tranche of this ETF floated in October was oversubscribed 12 times over base issue size of Rs 2,000 crore. However, the government decided to retain Rs 4,368 crore from the offer.

The central public sector enterprises that are part of the Bharat-22 ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL, NLC India, Axis Bank, ITC, REC, PFC, Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and L&T are other constituents.

Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

The government has set a target of mobilising Rs 1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds and achieving this has become more critical after it doled out Rs 1.45 lakh crore stimulus by way of a cut in corporate tax in September.

The proceeds from disinvestment will be critical for the government to stick to its target of keeping fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of the gross domestic product in the current financial year.

Last month, the Cabinet approved a new process of strategic disinvestment with a view to expediting privatisation of select public sector undertakings.

The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave nod for sale of 53.29 per cent government stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and its 63.75 per cent stake in Shipping Corporation of India, 30 per cent in Container Corporation of India, 100 per cent NEEPCO and 75 per cent in THDC."
5,2019-11-03,Coal India,"KOLKATA: In an effort to strengthen its administration to boost productivity, state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) is likely to create new posts of executive director rank in the organisation and its subsidiaries, sources said.

The coal ministry, which has asked the mining major to fast track its ambitious one billion tonne production target and look to achieve the goal by 2023-24, was in ""favour of creating new posts"" in the high rank to motivate its senior managers to work hard, the sources told PTI.

The miner had earlier said it would meet the target by the fiscal 2025-26.

Creation of new posts in the executive director rank will provide an opportunity to at least 50 senior general managers to get an elevation, they said.

Currently, there are no posts between the rank of general managers and directors, they said.

Sources said there can be executive director in every department or discipline in each of the eight subsidiaries of Coal India.

""There are about 220-300 general managers working in Coal India and its subsidiaries. Once the new posts are created, it may create an opportunity for the senior managers to get an elevation,"" sources said.

Timeline for the creation of posts has not been decided, they said.

""You (CIL) will have to fast track the one billion tonne target to 2023-24, as the current growth is not enough. There is no question of 2025-26. I will ensure all support to CIL in this endeavour,"" coal minister Pralhad Joshi had said at the 45th foundation day of the miner.

Incidentally, the next Lok Sabha polls are due in 2024.

However, Coal India chairman A K Jha said that the miner was looking to acquire some assets in Russia to meet coking coal demand in India and was also going ahead to install 3000 MW of solar power plant."
6,2019-11-04,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) on Monday emerged as the highest bidder for Gare Palma IV/1 coal block in Chhattisgarh with a bid price of Rs 230 per tonne, a premium of 53% over reserve price, said people aware of the matter.

The bid price is ironically just about a fifth of Rs 1,585 per tonne for the same mine quoted by Bharat Aluminium Company (Balco), a Vedanta group firm, in 2015 auctions that was rejected as low by the coal ministry.

JSPL stock surged 11.31% to Rs 137.25 on Monday on the Bombay Stock Exchange. A company executive said coal from Gare Palma IV/1 will be used by the company for its Raigarh plant as well as for captive power plants which are near the mines.

Coal mines in the present tranche of auctions received a tepid response and the government had to annul auctions for 21 of the 27 mines on offer. Six mines are on offer, auctions for two of which have been completed.

Another mine in Madhya Pradesh, Bikram, which was auctioned on November 1, received the highest bid of Rs 154 per tonne from Birla Corporation against a reserve price of Rs 150 per tonne.

A senior coal ministry official said that many private steel and cement companies are not evincing interest in the latest round of auction for captive coal mines because they want to hold on to their cash for commercial coal auctions. However, the companies said the blocks were far off from the end-use plants, a factor that raised the logistics cost.

The Gare Palma IV/1 coal block was owned by the company before the Supreme Court in 2014 cancelled all captive mine allocations. Later, in the 2015 auctions, Balco emerged as the highest bidder. However, the bid was not accepted by the coal ministry. The mine has been closed since deallocation, said the people cited earlier.

In the first tranche of coal block auction in 2015, the coal ministry had also rejected JSPL’s best bids for Gare Palma IV/2&3 block and Tara block that received lower bids than for other blocks. The blocks were given to Coal India for operation and the high court later upheld the decision.

The coal ministry official said the response to captive coal mine auctions will not have any impact on the commercial coal auctions planned in December this year.

ET had reported on October 13 that the government planned to keep minimal qualification criteria for companies to participate in the auctions of coal blocks for commercial mining, and had identified 15 large blocks for the pilot round of bidding in December.

Each of the 15 identified coal blocks will have a capacity to produce four million tonnes per annum. The government also plans to cap the upfront payment for some large blocks which might otherwise run into a huge amount."

16,2019-11-06,Coal India,"Individual investors, including high networth ones, are seeking comfort in blue chips as the broader market has turned volatile.

The total number of individual shareholders in Nifty50 constituent companies increased to 2.33 crore as of September end, 2019 from 2.23 crore on June 30 and 2.16 crore as of March 31,.

As options dried up elsewhere in the market, these investors went for heavy buying in select Nifty stocks, trying to make the most of a market rebound. That, even when valuations of many of these stocks hit sky-high levels.

For instance, Bajaj Finance hovered at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51 times and a price-to-book value of 3.10 times on November 1 after the scrip jumped 130 per cent since December end, 2017.

Nestle India traded at a P/E of 85.40 against the industry average of 49.20. Its price-to-book value stood at 15 times on November 1. The stock has rallied 93 per cent in 22 months to trade around Rs 7,700. Nestle became a part of Nifty on September 27, 2019.

Are these valuations justifiable?

Sunil Singhania-led Abakkus Asset Management in a recent report, titled ‘The Big Call-Bubble in Quality?’ said some of the quality stocks have now reached the bubble zone and could give zero or negative returns over the next few years.

With over 22 lakh small shareholders, 10 per cent of Nifty’s individual investors were holding Reliance Industries, the country’s biggest firm by market value. The stock jumped nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,457 on November 1 from Rs 921.10 on December 29, 2017. The domestic equity market has remained highly volatile during this period following Sebi’s reclassification of market-caps for mutual funds, credit crisis in the NBFC sector, general elections, unfavourable announcements in the Union Budget 2019, bleak macroeconomic data and adverse global cues.

More than 10 lakh retail investors held SBI, Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares each as of September 30. Yes Bank and Tata Motors shares have cracked more than 50 per cent since December 2017, while country’s biggest lender by assets SBI has largely been flat.

ITC, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, HDFC Bank and Coal India were among other players in which more than 6 lakh individuals held a stake at the end of September quarter, 2019.

IDBI Capital Markets in October maintained a ‘buy’ call on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490. Among other largecap players, Emkay Global Financial Services is ‘overweight’ on Bharti Airtel, Britannia, Grasim, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, RIL and United Breweries.


Tables: Number of individual shareholders in Nifty companies
 
 
Among other ‘expensive’ Nifty stocks, industry heavyweights TCS, HUL, RIL, Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan Company, ICICI Bank, Britannia, Axis Bank and UPL are among other stocks whose P/Es hovered above their respective industry average as of November 1, 2019.

The P/E ratio measures the relationship of a stock price with its earnings per share.

Analysts say stock investing is never only about financials and there are always some qualitative and future growth aspects to it. “Every valuation methodology has one underlying principle: the value paid today should be justifying future earnings potential,” Abakkus said in a report.

The domestic money manager listed HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, Nestle India, Titan, Siemens, Berger Paints and ABB among 27 perceived high-quality expensive stocks, where profit after tax and revenue growth stood at a CAGR of 11 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, in past nine years (See Table).

“We don’t think anywhere in the world at any point of time, companies have traded at P/Es of 50-100 for 10-15 years stretch,” Abakkus said in the report.



It said penetration levels of most of the products these companies produce are much higher today than what they were 9-10 years back, and hence, the growth over the next few years should be lower than what it was over the past few years.

On the other hand, the number of investors in the BSE Smallcap index stocks remained almost stagnant in last three quarters at 4.23 crore.

The number of individual shareholders in BSE Midcap index companies increased marginally to 1.37 crore at the end of September quarter from 1.36 crore at the end of the preceding quarter, data available with Ace Equity showed on November 1. The figure stood at 1.34 crore on March 31, 2019.

Analysts see more comfort in the second-rung stocks, which have been beaten down badly over the past 22 months. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have cracked 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019.

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak AMC, says midcap and smallcap stocks are clearly giving more relative valuation comfort and that is where you will end up making more money than the largecaps over the medium to long term.

“We have been suggesting that investors should increase a little bit of allocation towards midcap and smallcap stocks. Even in our portfolios, wherever the investment mandate allows, we have been buying midcaps and smallcaps from across sectors,” he told ETNOW during an interaction."
17,2019-11-06,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal minister Pralhad Joshi on Wednesday said his ministry was not in favour of overseas coal asset ""acquisition"" by Coal India Limited (CIL).

The minister said last year India imported 235 million tonne of coal and the forex outflow was Rs 2.71 lakh crore.

""As of now the thinking is, not to acquire assets and only to freeze the order in advance to get coal at a competitive price,"" Joshi told PTI on the sidelines of the 8th Asian Mining Congress and exhibition here.

He said our intention and goal is clear, ""we want domestic coal production.""

Joshi had already advanced the one billion coal production target of Coal India by two years to FY24.

To a question on FDI in the PSU coal behemoth, Joshi reiterated that he wants Coal India to continue to be the largest coal-producing company ""with"" India.

CIL chairman A K Jha said Coal India was scouting for stakes in coking coal assets only.

He said Coal India was also working on Coal Bed Methane tender but it has not been finalised and would seek private participation to harness the asset."
18,2019-11-06,Coal India,"The momentum is coming because the worst is getting over for many of the companies and especially the good quality companies, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Prices have come back, but the economy is not yet back. Are markets running ahead of themselves?What we are witnessing is the phenomena of what is classically termed as the worst is over as far as the markets are concerned. That means, even if the economy is painting a little bleak picture or even if some of the corporate earnings are missing their estimates (volume numbers of automobiles are still de-growing and cement is still not so good), the markets are saying that a suitable base has been formed in terms of earnings and in terms of profitability. The market starts moving up, saying the worst is over. That is what we are classically witnessing right now. We are reaching back to the all- time highs. In fact, Sensex has already crossed the all-time high of the recent months. We believe that the worst is over for most of the companies. There will be good growth ahead for a lot of them.


Have you had a chance to look at Cipla earnings? The stock has cooled off but it was a decent set of numbers. We have been looking at a whole host of pharma names on the back of earnings today.I would not look at the Cipla numbers but some of the pharma companies have reported strong numbers and this is coming on the back of the fact that we have the corporate rate reduction flowing in at the net profit level, not necessarily the PBT level. But for many of the pharma companies, the domestic environment has been relatively stronger and somewhere the US market is depending on which therapeuticals side you are in. It is a mixed bag. Some are doing well, some are not, but the common theme is that most of the pharma companies have enjoyed the tax benefit in full and that is visible in the way, some of the stocks have moved up.


Eicher is up 30%, Maruti is up 35%, State Bank of India has moved from Rs 255 to Rs 310, ICICI Bank is sitting at an all time high. If a client now asks you whether you should chase the momentum now or wait for a meaningful 10-15% decline, what will you advise?No, I do not think we can look at a meaningful decline of 10-15%. Those days are now gone for the market in the near term. If at all, you have to play the momentum game. You cannot miss out the market by sitting on cash. The momentum is coming because the worst is getting over for many of the companies and especially the good quality companies. If a Maruti for example is showing a 25% volume decline in the first half of the month and is guiding for the year to be at a negative growth rate, it tells you that this year is gone is factored in. But the next year is going to be even better and many of these companies have a built-in hope because from an operational standpoint, they have not missed margins. Their margins are not low. 

In fact, if at all, they are guiding for better margins ahead. Financial services companies are guiding for lower slippages, lower NPAs and so on. The guidance that is coming out from some of the large companies is very strong and one has to reiterate that it is a worst is over kind of a market.


What was your takeaway from the Infy conference call?It was very clear that there is no proof behind the allegations that have come from the whistleblower. That was one event which caused the stock to tank and people had the previous episode in mind when the stock tanked when you had similar allegations coming out at the time of the Panaya buy. 

Then, at least a certain proof was submitted, there was a whole lot of investigation and after the churn that Infosys saw in terms of corporate governance, a lot of senior management was changed. Nandan Nilekani came back again.

The track record of Infosys since those days has been pretty strong, both from its business point of view and even from a corporate governance standpoint I would say because this whistleblower complaint was really speaking of a meaningless kind of complaint backed by no proof. 

The entire loss that Infosys suffered in terms of the stock price fall will be recovered. That recovery has not happened still, even at the current price of Rs 710 or 712. We expect Infosys to recover quite strongly.


What is one of your high-risk-high-return ideas where there could be a 10% downside or maybe a 15% volatility, but your analysis is indicating that 30-40% even 50% gains are coming in the next 12 to 18 months?There is clearly one sector where we see something which you did mention is likely to happen and it is in the auto ancillary space. A lot of auto ancillary names have fallen quite sharply. The distinction we are making is that some of the auto ancillaries are global in nature and some domestic. One should look at only those which are domestic kind of auto ancillary companies that have sharply fallen down. 

With a large volatility and perhaps a small downside, they have the promise of delivering very good returns as we move forward. If we take a one-year or a two- year view. Many of these auto ancillaries are suppliers to the large OEMs including Maruti. You can pick names within that. We already have coverage on a small auto ancillaries like PPAP Industries which can likely do well. So this is one space. 

We have some other stocks where one can potentially get great numbers and this is the housing space. More houses built means more cement, more cement possibly means that you will require more coal. Right now, they are dependent on domestic coal but you will have Coal India upping its production after a phase of de-growth. When coal production goes up, there is the requirement of a certain kind of explosives. We recently met a company called Solar Industries which make explosives used by the mining companies. 

So, these are companies which will have solid volume growth. We are looking at companies which can have solid volume growth delivery in the next one or two years, because of a low base effect. With operating leverage coming in and margins improving, probably these companies can deliver great returns in the years ahead."

20,2019-11-07,Coal India,"Coal minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday announced three times hike in ex-gratia amount from Rs 5 lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs, for fatal coal mines accidents. He said this will cover over 3.5 lakh families of miners working under Coal India and its subsidiaries in eight states of the country.

“I announce enhancement in ex-gratia from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 15 lakh for the coal workers, both permanent as well as the contractors, in case of fatal mine accident,” Joshi said while addressing coal miners in Odisha.

He undertook an aerial survey and inspection of mining operations of Talcher Coalfields in Mahanadi Coalfields Limited in Odisha, which is the second biggest subsidiary of state-run company Coal India Limited (CIL), and contributes about 25% cent to the total coal production of CIL, an official statement said.

Joshi said that Mahanadi Coalfields would offer employment to over 4000 land oustees by the financial year 2024-25. He said the government of India is committed to uplift standard of living of common man and is steadily working towards creating more jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities for the youth.

He said Mahanadi Coalfields will invest more than Rs 9000 crore in years to come for creation of railway infrastructure enabling seamless transportation of coal from across MCL mines.

He said MCL will run Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) in the peripheral villages of its operational areas for brining free healthcare to the doorstep of the needy people."
21,2019-11-08,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has invited bids from developers for setting up a 100 MW solar power plant in Solar Power Developer and Operator mode in Chhattisgarh. It will cater to the green energy requirement of Coal India subsidiary of South Eastern Coalfields which consumes around 850 million units of power annually.

This is part of Coal India’s plan to emerge a net-zero energy company – an entity that generates its own green power. The Proposed Solar Project will be established in capex mode. 

Coal India’s total annual Power requirement for coal production is around 4.5 billion units which would require setting up 3000 MW of solar power projects. 

In order to achieve its goal, the company has formed a joint venture with NLC India (NLCIL), formerly Neyveli Lignite Corporation, to jointly set up 5000 MW of power generation capacity of which 3000 MW would be solar powered while the rest 2000 MW would be coal-fuelled. 

CIL and NCIL has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for setting up a 50:50 joint venture company that would undertake the projects. 

“Coal India has been tasked to become a net-zero emission energy company by ministry of coal, a move which requires it to generate 3,000 MW of solar power. The MoU, also extends for setting up of 2,000 MW of thermal power generation across CIL’s subsidiaries,” a senior Coal India official said. 

Solar projects will be set up over 15,000 acres on identified barren and reclaimed free land of Coal India and also at locations where free land is available. Estimated cost for Coal India’s solar power generation is pegged at Rs 12,000 crore. 

The projects will be financed through a debt-equity ratio of 70:30 as per the CERC norms. A concept paper has been initiated by both the companies to get clearance from their respective boards. 

“This is a synergistic step, combining the resources of both the companies for a common goal. CIL will be riding the core technical expertise of NLCIL in thermal power generation and Solar PV Power,” a Coal India executive said."
22,2019-11-10,Coal India,"New Delhi: Key macroeconomic numbers are likely to drive stock in a holiday-shortened week ahead as quarterly earnings season is almost coming to an end and the Ayodhya verdict unlikely to have any major impact on overall investor sentiments, according to analysts.

Equity markets will be closed on Tuesday for ""Gurunanak Jayanti"".

Industrial production data on Monday, inflation rate on Tuesday and WPI inflation on Thursday would be keenly watched by market participants amid economic slowdown concerns.

Coal India Ltd, Hindalco Industries and NMDC are among the major companies set to announce their earnings this week.
Santosh Meena, Senior Analyst at TradingBells, said Ayodhya verdict would not have any impact on equity market until any social unrest arise in the country.

""It could have sentimental positive impact for incumbent BJP government. Otherwise, it won't have any major impact on the political front as well.

""Market is in bullish momentum where this momentum will continue,"" Meena added.

In one of the most important and much-awaited judgements in India's history, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put an end to over a century-old dispute that has torn the social fabric of the nation.

The apex court said the mosque should be built at a ""prominent site"", allotted either by the Centre or the Uttar Pradesh government, and a trust should be set up within three months to build the temple at the site that, many Hindus believe, Lord Ram was born.

""Equity markets which are trading near all-time highs will be facing two important data this week which can act as a catalyst for an upside breakout or further pressure,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO of Epic Research said.

Developments related to US-China trade negotiations will also be tracked by investors, analysts said."

BJP sent ‘best wishes’ for Shiv Sena to form a government with Congress and NCP. Acting Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis accompanied by state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, Pankaja Munde and other BJP leaders met Koshyari. NCP has initiated talks with Shiv Sena to form the government. The Congress may also join such an arrangement and get the Speaker’s post and other portfolios.


Ram Temple construction from April 2The start of the Ram temple’s construction at Ayodhya may be marked by a special event on Ram Navami, which falls on April 2 next year, said people with knowledge of the matter. That timeline will chime with the Supreme Court’s November 9 order to set up a trust in three months for the temple’s construction. It’s not clear if this will be a shilanyas, or laying of the foundation stone, as such a ceremony was held in 1989. Ram Navami is Lord Ram’s birthday.


Talks with China have moved slowly, Trump admitsTrump told reporters on Saturday that talks with China had moved more slowly than he would have liked but added that Beijing wanted a deal more than he did, Reuters reported.

Capital spending has been a bright spot for the world’s third-largest economy, driven by refurbishing of aged infrastructure, urban development, automation and investments to cope with a labour crunch in the rapidly ageing population.

Brokerage calls

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Dr Lal Pathlabs and increased target price to ₹1,800 from ₹1,330. The company's Q2 results were ahead of estimates, with another quarter of strong volume growth. Overall, volume remains the point of focus, helping the company expand into the rest of India and reducing dependence on its home market of Delhi/National Capital Region (NCR), it said. The brokerage has raised FY20-22 EPS estimates by 8-12% to reflect recent tax cuts. 

• Ambit Capital has maintained buy rating on Magma Fincorp and lowered target price to ₹59 from ₹68. Poor track record of execution, deteriorating asset quality and lack of pricing power expose Magma to vagaries of market liquidity crunch, said Ambit. Shrinking margin profile with poor levers around growth would continue to keep RoA/ RoE muted. But Magma’s seasoned retail book doesn’t warrant deep discount valuation to 3-year rolling crosscycle average. 

• Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained sell rating on Eicher Motors and revised target price to ₹17,000 from ₹15,000. Eicher Motors reported 24% YoY decline in consolidated Ebitda in Q2 of FY20 led by weak volume growth and margin pressures in VECV and Royal Enfield businesses. Kotak Institutional expects volume pressure to persist in FY21 due to (1) shift towards BS-VI engines and (2) increase in competitive intensity.

29,2019-11-13,Coal India,"Asset management companies have a long way to go. They are at the same cusp where banks were may be 10, 12, 15 years back. Insurance companies have got a runway of at least 15-20 years to keep on compounding at 10-15%. These are not something which will grow at 30% though, says Nischal Maheshwari, CEO, Institutional Equities, Centrum Broking. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.

A month ago nobody wanted to buy YES Bank, it had gone to sub 40, Rana Kapoor sold out, institutional investors sold out, now everybody wants to buy into YES Bank -- be it the Munjals or the Mittals, the Adani family or some of the big funds. So what has changed for YES Bank? Why at Rs 36, there were no buyers and at Rs 70, there are a clutch of family offices, global and local investors who suddenly want to own a piece of YES Bank?Though we do not cover YES Bank, but I think Rs 36 was the market price basically because Rana Kapoor’s stake got sold in the market and it was a forced sale. So, that was not a true price of the stock. The last fund raise happened at around Rs 80 and I believe at prices lower than that, you would have found buyers earlier also, except when it was at Rs 35-36 due to a forced sale.

Going ahead, as these family offices get a chance to buy stake in a large bank, they are all looking to have a fresh look on it. As far as bank’s last quarter results are also concerned, there are challenges as yet and it requires a serious amount of capital. In the long term, some of these guys definitely look at it as a good opportunity and that is why they want to be in.


Whatever could go wrong frankly has gone wrong. At Rs 70 or sub 70 level, some would argue that fears of a run in bank and merger with one of the other banks, is ruled out, if they raise capital. Is YES Bank one of the stocks to buy right now? A year or two years from now, could it go up to Rs 150 or even Rs 200?There is a fair possibility, but as an institution I would recommend that once the capital is raised and you have a fairly good visibility of that $1-1.2-1.3 billion is coming through, that is the time you should press the button, not now. There is too much uncertainty over who will come, what will happen and whether RBI will agree to a substantial investor to be there or not. If I look at the last result, there are still a lot of challenges.


Very often we talk about classic compounders. But there is a market where you can buy businesses which are called as early birds and which have a potential to become large, big or scalable. Give me a list of two or three companies where as a house you feel that if you buy them now, these businesses can be scaled up significantly in three, four, five years?It is a tough one, given what is really changing in the Indian environment. I do not believe there will be a lot of them out there, given that the scales of the business that are changing. What I definitely feel very strongly about at the moment is the asset management companies which I believe have a long way to go. 

I believe they are at the same cusp where banks were may be 10, 12, 15 years back and the asset management companies should be having a very strong run. I think both the asset management companies which are listed, already have multibillion dollar market caps. But can it be multiples of them from here onwards? I definitely believe that this is one industry to consider very strongly. The other one is insurance. These are the two industries which we believe basically has got a long way to go. At the moment it is difficult for me to actually put out any stock which I believe is a multibagger in my hands.


A few stocks that will be in focus today on the back of earnings -- ABB, Pidilite, Bata. What are you expecting this time for those quarterly numbers?Bata numbers should be muted given that as far as the consumption pattern is concerned, it is going to be tough for Bata. A 7-8% growth basically is what we are expecting. Pidilite we do not cover it as yet basically but there also, we see a muted number only. 


What about Coal India?Coal India is a good dividend yield stock but last quarter’s numbers would have been bad for Coal India because of the rain and the flooding of several states where production takes place. So it would be a challenge for Coal India in the current quarter.


 If I map the numbers for the private sector insurance companies, we see growth has plummeted from late teens to single digit. The October, September and the July data all indicate a marked slowdown at the level of private insurers -- be it HDFC Life or ICICI or smaller franchise like an Edelweiss or Max?In the last two or three months, we have seen some amount of slowdown but what I am referring to is there is a very long runway for them, given that the insurance penetration is only 10-11% in the country. That is what I am trying to refer to. In the developed world, it is anywhere between 45-50%. People are slowly becoming aware and as the income levels go up, this is one product which will keep on getting up. 

The second one is the general insurance. As the premium goes up, people buy more houses, they want to buy more cars and everybody wants to insure them. This is a very nascent product at the moment in the country that has got a runway of at least 15-20 years to keep on compounding at 10-15%. These are not something basically which will grow at 30%, but it is a very good compounders or 10-15% kind of a thing basically for the next 10-12 years."
30,2019-11-14,Coal India,"Good morning!

The domestic stock market on Thursday showed early signs of a possible breakout from its consolidation range. And Nifty futures on Singapore traded 21 points higher this morning, signalling a good start for Dalal Street.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Prabhudas Lilladher has upgraded Lupin to hold from reduce and raised target price to Rs 760 from Rs 730 after the drug maker sold its Japanese generic business to a private equity investor named Unison at a valuation of $526 million. With strategy of focusing in complex generics, injectable and specialty products in US and acquisition of brands in US and India, Lupin is better off with divestment of nonfocus geography, said the brokerage. The stock ended down 1 per cent at Rs 728.70 on Wednesday.

• Jefferies has raised target price on Info Edge (India) to Rs 2330 from Rs 1985 while maintaining hold rating. Info Edge's second quarter revenue was largely in line with our estimate but EBITDA missed due to higher losses in Jeevansathi, said Jefferies. Weakness in non-IT hiring reflected in deceleration in Naukri billing growth. 99acres reported a profit but management did not commit to its sustainability, the brokerage said. The stock ended up 1.5 per cent at Rs 2602.05 on Wednesday.


• IDFC Securities has maintained outperformer rating on Sanofi India with a target price of Rs 7368. The brokerage has maintained rating on the stock given attractive valuations and steady improvement in operating performance. The stock trades at 20.7 times EV/ EBITDA and 31.2 times CY20 estimated price-to-earnings ratio, which are at discount to those of MNC peers like Glaxo, said IDFC Securities. The stock ended down 0.1 per cent at Rs 6599.95 on Wednesday.

• CLSA has retained buy rating on Coal India with a target price of Rs 270. Coal India’s earnings outlook is weak near-term given muted volume growth and e-auction prices coming off a high base, said CLSA. However, the brokerage still finds it a good defensive play given little demand risk, low commodity price exposure, a net cash balance sheet, strong cash flows and its 10 per cent dividend yield. The stock ended down 1.3 per cent at Rs 207.20 on Wednesday.

• Citi has maintained buy rating on Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 860. Aurobindo continues to outperform peers on growth and margins, courtesy its well diversified pipeline and superior execution in the US, said Citi.The brokerage expects this to continue and should drive outperformance over the longer term. Near term, the Street would remain focused on compliance outcomes (Unit IV inspection; corrective action at Units VII, I, IX and XI) and closure of the Sandoz deal.The stock ended down 1 per cent at Rs 433.40 on Wednesday."

48,2019-11-22,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) plans to check illegal mining and pilferage with the use of drones, which it has tested in a pilot project.

Its exploration arm, Central Mine Planning & Design Institute, recently tied up with Centre for Aerospace Research, Anna University of Chennai, for drone technology.

“A pilot project was undertaken at Coal India subsidiary, Central Coalfields’ Topa Mine where drones successfully tracked sources of illegal mining as well as the route being followed by them to take away pilfered coal,” a Coal India executive told ET.

“In a recent meeting with CMPDI executives, secretary coal directed for implementation of drone technology in identified 35 top coal producing mines of Coal India with a focus on prevention of illegal mining activities, land reclamation monitoring. It was further directed to identify other applicable areas for drone technology,” he said.

The executive said the number of drones for each subsidiary of Coal India would depend on their command area and surveillance drones are not too costly and can capture such data successfully. For example, Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL) may require two, while South Eastern Coalfields may require more, he said. At present, CIL is using drones for survey of blocks and for preparing mining and expansion plans, he said. Small operators steal coal from operating and abandoned mines, carry them in cycles and bullock carts to a central location where it is sold at a throwaway price. The coal collected there is then loaded on trucks and a large volume of this coal finds its way to the coal mandis where it is sold at half of Coal India’s notified price.

Coal from mines allotted in the past but taken back by the government is also pilfered. “Here dumper, shovels and pay-loaders are being used on a large-scale to illegally mine coal,” a coal sector official said.

There are no comprehensive study on illegal mining, but a study by Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) in 2000 showed that brick kilns used 22 million tonnes of coal while Coal India could have supplied only 2 million tonnes.

“E-auction was introduced with the aim of cutting down on the illegal market,” former Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya said.

“It has reduced the market to some extent but could not wipe it out.”"
49,2019-11-22,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Supply of coal by state-owned CIL to the power sector registered a decline of 8.5 per cent to 253 million tonnes in the April-October period of this fiscal.

Fuel supply by Coal India in the year-ago period was 276.8 million tonnes (MT), according to official data.

The supply of coal to power sector by CIL in October dropped by 19.3 per cent to 33.8 MT, over 41.9 MT in October last fiscal.

With torrential rains hitting coal production, Coal India had said that it was keeping a close watch on the current situation to ensure smooth supplies to power plants.

CIL saw its output decline by 6 per cent to 241 MT in April-September on account of monsoon.

""CIL is gearing up to regain its production tempo and keep coal supplies to power sector going after the torrential rainfall across its subsidiaries dealt a crippling blow to the company's coal production and offtake,"" the company had said in a statement.

CIL had said that a team of officials is closely monitoring coal supplies to power plants and is working on plans to divert coal to fuel-starved plants.

The state-owned firm had earlier said that it will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year.

The PSU will further produce 1 billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi had said.

The PSU is currently given the target of producing 660 million tonnes of coal amounting to 82 per cent of the country's coal output.

Joshi had said that with the demand for power rising steeply, there is enough opportunity for both government and private sectors to produce coal without adversely impacting each other."
47,2019-11-22,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Indian boards are seem to be meeting slightly more frequently than they were earlier. The median number of meetings for 91 of the BSE 100 companies was seven in fiscal 2019, compared with six in FY18 as well as five years earlier in FY15, as per data from Bloomberg. Five was the most common number for board meetings held by the companies in the year ended March 31, 2019.

Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have a higher frequency of board meetings. The median number for the 16 PSUs in BSE100 index was 13, compared with 11 in FY15. Coal India topped the list with 21 board meetings in the last fiscal year ended March 31. The company’s board had met seven times in FY15.

Incidentally, the sitting fees for independent directors of PSUs is Rs 40,000 - around one-third of the statutory limit of Rs 1 lakh. ICICI Bank is the only privatesector company on the list of top 10 companies, with 18 board meetings in FY19. The bank’s board had met seven times in FY15. Incidentally, a dozen companies have had a sharp year-on-year surge in the frequency of their board meetings in FY19. This list is dominated by banks, with ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank featuring among these dozen companies. Banks have been under increased scrutiny of the regulators and investors, warranting a higher engagement for their boards. Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Larsen & Toubro, HCL Technologies and REC are the other companies on this list.


Agencies
In the case of nearly half of the 91 companies, a positive correlation was found between the frequency of board meetings and their stock performance. The boards of companies that are performing well typically meet more frequently compared with the opposite group. For instance, pharma companies Cipla, Lupin and Sun Pharma have witnessed a gradual decline in the number of their board meetings over the past five years as industry headwinds pressed along. The board of Indiabulls Housing Finance met nine times five years ago, but only five times in FY19. Likewise, Piramal Enterprises had eight board meetings in FY18, but that dropped to five in FY19. Housing finance business has come under pressure in the recent years.

Ten of the BSE 100 companies have conducted only four meetings in FY19 - the minimum needed to comply with the Companies Act 2013. Most companies on this list, such as Godrej Consumer Products, Page Industries, Lupin, Hero MotoCorp, Bharat Forge and JSW Steel, have been under performing in the past couple of years. To be sure, the median frequency of board meetings in India Inc is akin to that in the US. As per the Spencer Stuart 2018 S&P 500 Board Index, the median number of board meetings was seven for the year ended May 2018. A majority of S&P 500 company boards met on an average of six-nine times annually."
50,2019-11-23,Coal India,"Kolkata: Coal India has managed to command a premium of 62% premium over notified prices for coal sold through spot e-auctions conducted in October. During September the company managed to fetch 82% premium over notified prices for spot e-auctions.

For the period April-October, the company managed to command a premium of 67% over its notified prices on an average.

At special forward e-auction for the power sector, Coal India managed to sell coal at a premium of 39% over notified prices in October. For the April-October period, the company managed to command an average premium of 32% over notified prices.

There exclusive auction for the non-power sector, Coal India managed to command a premium of 32% for both October and the period April-October.

This year, Coal India intends to ramp up auction offerings by 14% against the previous year when similar supplies declined 5%. This year Coal India has decided to auction 137 million tonnes of coal which would include long term supply contract auctions, spot e-auctions and forward e-auctions.

Last year, the dry fuel supplier offered 120 million tonnes through similar auctions which was a 5% drop compared to the previous year (2017-18). Increased offerings this year is expected to bring down premiums which touched 92% in the spot market last year as availability through spot e-auctions had dwindled almost 38% among other reasons like higher international coal prices and Rupee depreciation.

Last year unforeseen demand from power generators forced Coal India to send them additional coal as the sector was grappling with dwindling inventory and many power plants were stranded with critical coal stocks. Last year, premiums for special forward e-auction for power and special spot e-auction was 72% while exclusive e-auction for non-power fetched 58% premium. The number of critical plants had touched 29 in October last year while stocks and dipped to 6 million tonnes."
51,2019-11-23,Coal India,"Three meetings, two hotels, one city. These were crucial to an eight-month-long investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2010 and 2011 to expose a cartel in India’s cement industry, which resulted in a penalty of Rs 6,317 crore, the regulator’s highest in a single case to date.

The CCI has since carried out many probes into alleged anti-competitive agreements and companies’ abuse of their dominant position, but it is still best known for the cement cartel case mainly because of the eye-popping fine. It is nearly half of the Rs 13,523 crore the CCI levied in 135 cases till March 2018, according to the latest data available with the regulator. Of its total fines, the CCI has collected a mere Rs 55 crore, or 0.4%.




Compare this to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which collected $172 million in criminal penalties in fiscal year 2018 (October-September), with the highest ever being $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015. It has also sent several executives to prison.

While the CCI cannot boast figures like DoJ, the very fact that it has the authority to severely penalise violators could be working to its advantage. Meanwhile, some of the recommendations made by the Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC), which submitted its report recently, could make CCI more nimble in the resolution of cases and take it a little closer to its counterparts in the EU, the UK and the US.




 It was in 2010, almost a decade ago, that the CCI, which had only become operational in May 2009, decided to probe its most high-profile case — to find out if 10 cement companies colluded through the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) to limit supplies and raise prices. The CCI said that after two of three CMA meetings at Mumbai’s Grand Hyatt and Hotel Orchid in early 2011, the companies hiked cement prices, which, the CCI said, “establishes that they co-ordinated their decisions and fixed prices after due consultations”. There were also questions over whether Ambuja Cement and ACC, which are part of the Swiss company LafargeHolcim, had attended two of these meetings despite no longer being members of the CMA.




The companies and the CMA disputed the CCI’s findings and appealed the penalty. The case has made its way through the Competition Appellate Tribunal, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which replaced the former in 2017, and is now pending before the Supreme Court, which asked the parties to deposit 10% of the penalty last year. Aparna Dutt Sharma, secretary general, CMA, did not respond to a request from 
ET Magazine for comment. Questions sent to Lafarge-Holcim, UltraTech Cement and Jaiprakash Associates, which were handed the highest penalties, also went unanswered.

The delay in the conclusion of this case — and others where fines were levied — has meant that companies have not coughed up what the CCI asked them to. Should that be a cause for concern? Kaushal Kumar Sharma, the first director-general of the CCI, says it would be wrong to equate deterrence to realisation of penalties. Vaibhav Choukse, partner, competition law, J Sagar Associates, concurs. “Companies do not want to be on the wrong side of the competition law as there is a huge reputational loss from a penalty.” A listed company will have to make disclosures to the stock exchanges in case it is fined by the CCI, which could drive its shares down.

“It’s not that the CCI wants to make money. The CCI’s idea in the early days was to make a splash and say, ‘We have arrived,’” says a competition lawyer, requesting anonymity. Nisha Kaur Uberoi, national head of competition law at Trilegal, a law firm, says the CCI has created deterrents through a combination of factors: “its ability to levy India’s highest economic penalties on companies, imposition of individual liability as well as advocacy to foster a culture of competition compliance”. By individual liability, she is referring to the CCI’s powers to penalise the directors of an errant company.

Ashok Kumar Gupta, chairman, CCI, recently told ET that penalties are not an end in themselves in any enforcement process. “In numerous cases, parties rectify their anti-competitive behaviour during the enquiry process itself so the market correction as such has taken place.”




As of March 2018, the CCI had noted 940 competition cases, ordered probes into 400 and completed investigations in 288. Even before the cement cartel case, a CCI order in 2011 gave India Inc an inkling of the regulator’s powers. It investigated the realtor DLF’s conduct in relation to one of its apartment buildings in Gurgaon and found that the company had set terms unfavourable to buyers in their agreement, like their inability to raise objections to changes in the structure by the builder. The CCI report added: “Despite knowing that necessary approvals were pending at the time of collection of deposits, DLF Ltd inserted clauses that made exit next to impossible for the buyers.”




The CCI fined DLF Rs 630 crore, which the realtor appealed; the matter is now in the apex court. Also before the Supreme Court is an appeal related to a Rs 591 crore penalty on Coal India for discriminatory terms in fuel-supply agreements. DLF and Coal India did not respond to questions sent by 
ET Magazine. Besides looking at anti-competitive agreements like cartels and abuse of dominance, the CCI also has to greenlight mergers and acquisitions beyond a certain size. The CCI, set up under the Competition Act, 2002 (amended in 2007), replaced the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.


Change is in the Air
The CLRC, which the government set up last year, has recommended a series of changes to the CCI. These include a dedicated NCLAT bench for competition cases, given that NCLAT is overburdened with cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. Though there is no NCLAT-specific data, as of September 30, there were nearly 1,500 IBC cases pending before the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, according to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.

Some of the report’s suggestions could make the CCI dispose of cases quickly. The introduction of settlement and commitment procedures, for instance, could help avoid pendency of cases. In the EU, which has had settlements since 2008, half the cartel cases are resolved using settlements, in which the parties admit to their guilt in exchange for a 10% reduction in penalties. Since 2004 the EU has also had commitments, in which the parties agree to change their behaviour. The US DoJ has consent decrees, which need to be court-approved.




Another recommendation made by the CLRC is that the CCI should be transparent in how it arrives at penalties, like in the EU and the UK. “It’s as if the CCI is pulling figures out of a hat,” says Aditya Bhattacharjea, professor at the Delhi School of Economics and a member of the CLRC.

The CCI, according to CLRC recommendations, can levy a penalty of up to 10% of the average turnover of the preceding three years in matters related to abuse of dominance. In case of cartels, it can impose a fine of up to 10% of their turnover or up to three times their profit in each year of the period during which the cartel existed, whichever is higher. “Having penalty guidelines will be good for the CCI when it has to defend its orders in courts,” says the competition lawyer quoted earlier.


Come Clean
Regardless of when these recommendations are incorporated into the law, experts say companies could make use of an existing provision to minimise a crippling penalty. A company engaged in an anti-competitive agreement with its competitors can alert the CCI to the existence of the cartel and cooperate in the investigation in the hopes of being waived a part, or the whole, of its fine.

Panasonic Energy utilised the lesser penalty option and went to the CCI in 2016 and admitted that it was part of a cartel with Eveready Industries and Indo National (which sells under the Nippo brand), aided by their industry association, to control the distribution and prices of zinc-carbon dry cell batteries, since 2008. Eveready and Indo National also availed of the lesser penalty provision. As a result, the CCI waived 100% of Panasonic’s Rs 75 crore penalty, and reduced Eveready’s and Indo National’s fines by 30% and 20%, respectively, to Rs 172 crore and Rs 42 crore.


Tech Challenge
Cracking down on cartels without one of the participating companies coming forward is not easy, especially since in some cases the CCI may not have more than circumstantial evidence to base its conclusions on. An even bigger challenge is dealing with violations in the fast-evolving world of technology.

Acting on information filed by Jaipur-based Consumer Unity & Trust Society and Matrimony.com, the CCI in 2018 fined Google Rs 136 crore for promoting its own specialised search — say, for flights — to the detriment of other websites. The order was stayed by NCLAT. Google is also being probed by the CCI for tying some of its apps to Android and limiting handset makers’ ability to sell devices with alternate versions. “Android has enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. We look forward to working with the CCI to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less,” says a Google India spokesperson.

Google’s dominance has been under scrutiny in the EU and the US as well. Since 2017, it has been fined a total of $9.3 billion by the EU in three different cases related to its abuse of dominance by favouring its advertising and shopping services over its competitors’ and for bundling some of its applications with Android. (Google has appealed all three orders.) It is also being investigated in the US and so are Facebook and, reportedly, Amazon. “Other than in the EU, competition regulators are exercising caution (with tech companies) because consumers are benefiting from these companies,” says Bhattacharjea.

While India may have got a competition authority later than several other countries, new technologies are coming to India soon after they are launched elsewhere. This is why Sharma, former CCI director general, believes that handling tech matters may not be too hard for the CCI. One of the emerging areas of concern for competition regulators worldwide is artificial intelligence-powered pricing algorithms of competitors colluding to fix prices. Who is to be held responsible here in the absence of executives of rival companies acting in tandem?

In addition to instances of cartelisation and abuse of dominance in the old-economy sectors, the CCI will have to increasingly deal with competition cases in businesses like ecommerce, ridehailing, food delivery and online travel aggregation (the CCI is currently investigating MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, which merged in 2017, and Oyo Rooms over allegations of predatory pricing, among others). The CCI has also made clear its intent to pursue cases on its own without a formal complaint. But what is unlikely to change, till the CLRC recommendations are implemented, is the time it takes for a case to reach its conclusion."
52,2019-11-24,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The Centre wants Coal India to speed up exploration and development of all its blocks or return them for auction to private parties or allotment to state-run firms.

These include existing blocks with geological reserves of 110 billion tonnes that are yet to be taken up for production and an additional 110 blocks with reserves of around 40 billion tonnes allotted in 2012.

The government has asked the company to prepare concrete plans in the near future.

Out of the 110 blocks allotted in 2012, Coal India has managed to explore 50, of which project reports for 25 have been prepared. Among the rest, 41 blocks are under exploration and 19 remains partly explored. The Centre has asked Coal India to quickly find out if coal extraction from all these 110 blocks is techno-economically feasible.

At a recent meeting, the coal secretary said blocks which Coal India subsidiaries do not want to explore or take up for production, maybe relinquished so that the ministry could offer them to other interested companies.

The Centre also advised Coal India subsidiary, Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, to prepare a detailed report on subsidiary- and block-wise coal reserves, depleted stock, blocks with areas yet to be explored, blocks under production and its plan for future projects and their reserves-to-production ratio. The Centre has asked it to demarcate large blocks so that they could attract bigger exploration companies.

CMPDI needs to speed up exploration of the remaining coalbearing area of the country, use modern technology and consider a revenue-sharing model in prospecting-cum-mining lease with the use of seismic exploration, the government said.

In 2018-19, about 6.6 billion tonnes of additional coal resources were added to the ‘proved’ category through 24 geological reports (prepared by CMPDI) covering about 260 sq km of exploration. Till October this year, CMPDIL has been able to achieve 98% of its exploration target with negative growth of 12% as compared to the previous year."
54,2019-11-25,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-run Coal India (CIL) has liquidated 35 million tonnes (MT) of coal from its pithead stock in the first half of the current fiscal 2019-20, coal minister Pralhad Joshi informed parliament on Monday. 

“The pithead coal stock with CIL was 54.15 Million Tonne (MT) as on April 1, 2019 which reduced to 19.15 MT as on September 30, 2019. Thus, the coal stock liquidation was 35 MT in the first half of the financial year 2019-20” the minister said in a reply to the Rajya Sabha. 

The minister also informed the upper house that CIL’s coal production rose by 10.6% in the first half of FY 18-19 to 256.47 MT as against 231.88 MT produced in the corresponding period of FY 17-18. 

In a reply laid on the table of the upper house the minister also informed that India’s coal production grew by 8.14% to 730.35 MT in FY 18-19 in comparison to 675.40 MT of coal produced in the county in FY 17-18. 

Nevertheless, production has started to pick up after a slowdown during monsoon. It is expected to increase further as winter sets in and will enable thermal power plants stock fuel for meeting increased power demand during summer next year. 

“We will try to make good the production loss in recent months and strive to achieve 660 million tonnes of production target for the year,” a senior Coal India executive said. “Till now we are beyond our pro-rata target for a variety of issues including heavy rainfall, flooding, law & order issues at a number of large mines.” 

“Issues with respect to appointing a contractor for overburden removal at one of our large subsidiaries also resulted in slower coal production at some mines. This is being sorted and we hope to be back on track soon,” he said. 

“The ministry has asked all stakeholders including consumers and railways to extend all help. With the necessary help, we are confident of reaching as close to the target as possible. This company is a very resilient one and it can bounce from any situation. With a dedicated and motivated team at Coal India, it is highly likely that the target will be achieved,” he said. 

According to an executive the coal ministry has also promised to lend Coal India all possible support to solve law & order issues that the company faces at some of its large mines. The ministry will also lend support in speeding up green clearances for mines expansion and setting up of new mines. 

“Coal production has already started to pick up on a month-on-month basis. It will further rise during winter as the weather turns fair at almost all mines. In tandem, demand for power falls during the same time allowing power companies to build up stocks to meet increased demand during next summer, provided they accept increased supplies offered by us,” the executive said. 

Coal India’s production rose almost 28% month-on-month in October to 40 million tonnes. In tandem, supplies increased 15% during the same time to 40.5 million tonnes. Supplies to the power sector during the same period increased 16.1% to almost 34 million tonnes in October. Stocks at power plants, which was adequate for 11 days during the beginning of October at 17.32 million tonnes also increased to 13 days at almost 21 million tonnes last week. Stocks at non-pithead plants have also improved by 21% to 18 million tonnes which are adequate for 15 days. During the beginning of October, stocks at non-pithead power plants were adequate for 13 days. 

In another reply to the Rajya Sabha, the minister informed that 319 Billion tonnes of geological reserves of coal have been estimated in India so far as on April 1, 2018."

56,2019-11-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: State-run Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has expressed displeasure over West Bengal's land acquisition policy, as it continues efforts to procure around 3,600 acres of land for a coal mining project in Birbhum district. 

According to the policy, a company has to buy land from owners through a market mechanism while the state government only acts as a facilitator in the process, DVC sources said. 

""If the state government had acquired land directly for the Khagra-Joydeb coal block project, we could have avoided the delay in commissioning the mining activities. We are facing several issues to purchase a large tract of land directly from owners,"" a senior DVC official told on condition of anonymity. 

He, however, said the state government has been extending co-operation within the policy framework. 

The captive coal project will help the central public sector undertaking to reduce cost, he said, adding the power producer presently buys the dry fuel from Coal India. 

In FY19, the (power) 'plant availability loss' due to lack of coal till December last year was 20 per cent, a DVC document said. 

""We have already appointed Khagra-Joydev Resources Pvt Limited (KJRPL) in 2017 as the mine developer and operator (MDO). We will be able to commence mining activities only when land is acquired,"" the official said. 

A meeting between farmers at Loba village and DVC officials was held last week to fix the price, acceptable to both the parties, for the open-cast coal mine project, which was ""not successful"", company sources said. 

Of the 5,000-odd landowners, a handful of them had participated in the meeting, they said. 

""DVC had proposed Rs 14 lakh per acre in the meeting but it was rejected by the attendees,"" sources said. 

The board of the power utility had already approved an investment of Rs 1,094 crore to develop the Khagra-Joydeb coal block which has an estimated resource of 103 million tonnes. 

In addition to it, DVC has also secured the Tubed coal block in Jharkhand for captive use. 

The Kolkata-headquartered company has an installed capacity of 7,200 MW of thermal and hydel power."
57,2019-11-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India has tied up with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to develop a satellite-based system to provide air pollution data online to the company and the government.

In the recent past, five Coal India subsidiaries were slapped a total fine of Rs 53,331 crore by states for producing in excess of available environmental clearance limits in at least 60 mines. If Coal India has to pay the levies, its finances will be critically hit as the penalty far exceeds its reserves of Rs 38,000 crore.

Coal India has used services of satellites for monitoring land reclamation and reforestation. Satellite-based pollution monitoring system exists only at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the US.

“ISRO’s Space Application Centre (SAC) in Ahmedabad has been trying to develop a similar system that is not fully functional yet. We are working with ISRO’s National Remote Sensing Centre for developing a new system for our mines,” said a senior Coal India executive. This will help the company dispense with the ground equipment used to monitor pollution, he said.

Coal India subsidiary, Central Mines Planning & Development Institute (CMPDI), has taken up the project for satellitebased monitoring of respirable particulate matter and it is under implementation at Singrauli and Talcher coalfields.

A CMPDI executive said sensors in satellites can measure particulate matter over mines by the extent to which these tiny particles obstruct light. “We intend to link this data to an online server so that pollution figures are available for everyone,” the executive said."
58,2019-11-26,Coal India,"Kolkata: In October 2019, all-India energy demand declined 13.2 per cent year-on-year for the third consecutive month to 98 billion units (BUs) on account of an extended monsoon and a fall in energy demand from industrial states such as Maharashtra (down 22.4 per cent y-o-y), Gujarat (down 18.8 per cent y-o-y) and Tamil Nadu (down 5.2 per cent y-o-y) due to the economic slowdown, rating agency, India Ratings and Research said in a statement.

According to the rating firm, All-India energy supply declined 13.0 per cent y-o-y in October 2019, resulting in a reduction in an energy deficit to 0.5 per cent against 0.7 per cent during October 2018.

“On the supply side, electricity generation declined 12.9 per cent y-o-y to 98.9BUs on a 19.3 per cent fall y-o-y in thermal generation to 78.7BUs due to lower demand. Thermal generation was impacted due to a 21.8 per cent y-o-y increase in hydro generation to 15.1BUs. Average capacity utilisation for thermal power plants fell to 49.2 per cent in October 2019 against 63.8 per cent in October 2018, as central, state and private sector capacity utilisation decreased to 55.5 per cent (71.0 per cent ), 40.9 per cent (60.4 per cent ) and 51.0 per cent (60.8 per cent ), respectively,” it said in a statement.

Short-term power price at the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) decreased to Rs 2.71 per unit in October 2019 (September 2019: Rs 2.77 per unit) from Rs 5.94 per unit in October 2018 on account of a fall in demand on the short-term power exchanges. The difference in buy and sell bid volumes in October 2019 in day-ahead market widened to negative 5,848 million units (MUs) against 402 MUs in October 2018, on account of subdued demand, the Agency has estimated.

After declining for four consecutive months, coal production at Coal India (CIL) increased to 39.4 million tonnes (mt) in October 2019. However, it was still 21 per cent down on a year-on-year basis owing to lower production at its key subsidiaries Mahanadi Coalfields (down 34.9 per cent y-o-y) and South Eastern Coalfields Limited (down 30.6 per cent y-o-y).

62,2019-11-28,Coal India,"Coal India has firmed up plans to spend Rs 56,000 crore on 66 coal projects with an annual peak production capacity of 500 million tonnes.

The projects are at various stages of implementation and according to a memorandum of understanding signed between Coal India and the ministry of coal over the state-run company’s fiscal 2020 targets, almost 55% of the total capital outlay would be undertaken by South Eastern Coalfields (SECL) which is working on 23 projects with a total peak production capacity of 192 million tonnes. SECL is the largest coal producing subsidiary of Coal India, contributing almost a fourth of the total production at 157 million tonnes in 2018-19. The sanctioned capital for projects undertaken by SECL is around Rs 30,783 crore.

Mahanadi Coalfields is currently working on 11 projects with a peak production capacity of around 156 million tonnes, entailing investment of Rs 8,519 crore. It was the second largest contributor to Coal India’s production last year. Western Coalfields is working on 15 projects with a total peak rated capacity of around 35 million tonnes and would be investing Rs 5,949 crore.

Eastern Coalfields is working on four projects with a peak rated capacity of 17 million tonnes, involving a capital outlay of Rs 2,570 crore. Bharat Coking Coal has also undertaken four projects with a peak rated capacity of 18.5 million tonnes involving an outlay of Rs 2,345 crore. Central Coalfields is developing 7 projects with a peak capacity of 42 million tonnes and outlay of Rs 2,846 crore. Northern Coalfields is involved in two projects with capacity of 40 million tonnes and capital outlay of 3,038 crore.

“Coal India has advanced its targeted 1-billion-tonne production capacity achievement by two years to 2024. It intends to produce 750 million tonnes during the next fiscal, while this year the target is 660 million tonnes. In order to achieve these targets, Coal India and its subsidiaries will be required to achieve milestones for each of these 66 projects set out in the memorandum of understanding,” said a senior Coal India executive.

Recently, the ministry has asked all stakeholders, including consumers and the railways, to extend all help to Coal India to increase production. The coal ministry has also promised to lend Coal India all possible support to solve law and order issues it faces at some of its large mines. The ministry has also offered to help speed up green clearances for the expansion of mines and setting up of new mines.

From April to end-October, the company has produced 280 million tonnes of coal and supplied 316 million tonnes, including by liquidating 36 million tonnes of pithead stocks. If Coal India has to achieve its targeted supply and production figures, it needs to produce 380 million tonnes in the next five months to March 2020 and supply 344 million tonnes."

65,2019-11-30,Coal India,"New Delhi: The government is preparing to auction supply of coal to stressed power plants, which must sell the electricity produced using this fuel on the spot market.

The auctions, likely to start by February next year, will be reserved for non-captive power plants which do not have power purchase agreements (PPAs) for more than half their capacity, according to the bid guidelines released by the power ministry. Power minister RK Singh told 
ET that the move allowing coal supply for short-term electricity trade would help revive stressed power assets.

“So far, coal was allocated for long-term and medium-term PPA holders. With this, stressed power stations may be revived,” the minister said, adding that this would also enable deepening of the power market as the electricity would be traded through the power exchange.

However, industry officials said the upcoming coal auctions were not different from the special forward coal auctions held by Coal India for the power sector. They said the new auctions had many restrictive clauses, too.

According to the guidelines issued by the ministry on Wednesday, the power generated through use of this coal must be sold on the power exchanges or shortterm market through bidding on the power ministry’s DEEP portal.

Also, the net surplus proceeds generated in this manner, after meeting operating expenses, shall be entirely used for servicing debt. “The power ministry will work out in consultation with the Department of Financial Services a mechanism to ensure this,” it said.

The plan has been finalised eight months after the Union Cabinet on March 7 approved granting coal supply to power plants holding short-term power purchase agreements.

According to the rules, Coal India and Singareni Collieries Company will earmark mines for coal supply for these auctions. The quality and quantum of the coal, period for which it will be available and the schedule for the supply to start will be indicated to the bidders. Based on these facts, bidders can offer a premium on coal in the auctions.

“Auctions for coal linkage under this methodology shall be carried out every quarter to cater to the dynamic requirements and demand variations in shortterm and day-ahead markets. An annual calendar shall be published on coal companies’ website showing the months in which the auctions will be held,” the methodology said.

Sources said a dozen of the 34 stressed power plants were likely to become standard, with the steps taken by the government and resolution processes adopted outside insolvency by their lenders. The government’s coal supply auction scheme — Shakti, launched in May 2017 — and the two rounds of PPA auctions have helped ease the stress of many power plants, they said."
7,2019-12-02,Coal India,"Power plants not having power purchase agreements (PPAs) will start getting coal supplies or linkages under auctions from Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd in few months, which would help reduce stress in the sector.

According to methodology issued in this regard by the Union power ministry on Monday, Coal India Ltd (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) will earmark coal mines for supply to such power plants and auctions would be done every quarter.

Earlier, PPA was a pre-requisite for getting coal linkage. But, the government relaxed the norms under SHAKTI, or the Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India, policy this year in March.

For this purpose, the power ministry on Monday issued the methodology for the same.

Power Minister R K Singh told PTI, ""The Ministry of Power issued the methodology for allocation of coal for sale of power through short-term and day-ahead market (DAM) in power exchange. So far, coal was allocated to long-term and medium-term PPA holders. With this, stressed power stations may be revived. Further, this will also enable deepening of power market being traded through power exchange.""

Making coal available for short-term to stressed power plants was one of the recommendations of the high-level committee headed by then Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha. The panel had submitted its report in November last year.

The methodology provides that within 45 days (by January 16, 2020), the coal companies, CIL and SCCL, will earmark areas and mines within their subsidiaries that will be allocated for use as per these guidelines and publish the same on their websites indicating the quality of coal (gross calorific value/grade), the quantum of coal available, period for which such coal shall be made available and the schedule for start of supply of coal.

It also provided that auctions for coal linkage under this methodology shall be carried out every quarter to cater to the dynamic requirements and demand variations in short-term and day-ahead markets.

An annual calendar shall be published on coal companies' websites showing the months in which the auctions will be held.

The quantity of coal linkage that a plant may bid will be decided as per the heat rate, which shall not be more than 2,600 kilocalorie/kilowatt hour for the untied capacity of the plant (for which the PPA is not signed).

The Central Electricity Authority will call for applications and publish a list of eligible plants, their heat rate and capacity."

4,2019-12-02,Coal India,"Kolkata: The steel industry’s net leverage and interest coverage are likely to deteriorate in FY20 due to compressed EBITDA margins, due to a drop in realizations in the face of a demand slowdown and increase in raw material prices in FY20 on a YoY basis, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in its latest report on the domestic steel sector. However, EBITDA levels are likely to improve by Rs 1,500 per tonne in the current quarter (Q3FY20) due to marginal improvement in realisations. The agency’s views are based on its study of 38 listed and unlisted Indian steel companies. 

The report highlights the demand-supply scenario, price trends, imports/exports in both India and China, encompassing finished steel products (both flat and long), scrap, iron ore, coking coal and others, while also evaluating at the impact of end-user industries on India’s steel sector. 

While industry players have been experiencing tighter liquidity levels, as a result, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) levels are likely to improve by Rs 1,500 per tonne during Q3FY20 as compared to H1FY20 levels due to a marginal increase in realisations and decline in raw material prices, the report said. In H1FY20, EBITDA per tonne was lower by Rs 2,500-Rs 3,000/ tonne as compared to the average levels in FY19. In mid-November, steel prices increased by around Rs 500-Rs 700/ tonne on a month-on-month basis in anticipation of growth in demand over the remaining portion of H2FY20 compared to H1FY20, though it is unlikely to increase to the levels witnessed in FY19. Demand for steel long products shall partially improve from November 2019 onwards, with construction and infrastructure activities likely to pick up post the completion of the monsoon season, the Ind-Ra sector report stated. 

Prices of iron ore from the largest domestic miner, NMDC (Fines: Fe 64 per cent) reduced by Rs 500/tonne in mid-November 2019 as compared to July 2019. NMDC, cut prices by Rs 200/tonne per month in August and September 2019 and by a further Rs 100/tonne in November 2019. Coking coal prices remained highly volatile over July-November 2019, with prices being 33 per cent lower in mid-November 2019 as compared to April 2019. Ind-Ra said the fall in prices can be ‘largely attributed to low restocking needs in China amid negative market sentiments and improved coking coal supplies.’ On the domestic front, Coal India Limited (CIL) has stated that it shall focus on obtaining advance agreements for coking coal imports as against its previous plan of acquiring coking coal assets. 

The report said a key development within the sector is the Indian government’s decision to pull out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), since the anti-dumping duty that protects the domestic market from Chinese imports would have become null and void if India had entered into RCEP. The other main steel exporting nations within RCEP are Japan and South Korea, with whom India already has Free Trade Agreements (FTA)."
5,2019-12-02,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India managed to increase coal production 27% month-on-month in November at 50 million tonnes.

“The company managed to produce nearly 11 million tonnes more coal than in October. Coal off-take for November 2019 grew by almost 17% on a month-on-month comparison. CIL supplied 47.37 million tonnes of coal during the month under review compared to 40.5 million tonnes in October 2019 – the increase in absolute terms is 6.87 million tonnes,” a senior Coal India executive said.

“Coal India generally compensates for the production drop of the first half of the fiscal, during the second half and accordingly our production has begun to look up from the month of October 2019 when CIL registered a month-on-month growth of around 28%” the executive said adding “admittedly, it is a challenging task given the way our production was crippled due to the severity of the monsoon across our mining areas but with the worst behind us we are increasing our production to higher levels”.

Dipka, one of the largest opencast mines of South Eastern Coalfields Limited, whose lower benches were flooded during last week of September 2019 is now back on track producing around 71,000 tonnes of coal per day and the company expects very soon it will touch 1 Lakhs tonnes per day mark.

“These are positives for us and we plan to improve on it and keep up the production tempo,” he said."
6,2019-12-02,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government has allocated Rs 937 crore for exploration of mines that are not associated with Coal India, for the ongoing financial year, Parliament was informed on Monday.

Of this fund, Rs 120 crore has been earmarked for regional exploration and Rs 817 crore for detailed drilling, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.

""The government has allocated funds of Rs 937 crore...in the current financial year 2019-20 for carrying out exploration in non-CIL (Coal India) blocks in coal and lignite,"" he said.

Regional exploration has been planned for 37 coal blocks and 10 lignite blocks whereas detailed drilling has been planned for 121 coal blocks and one lignite block, Joshi said adding that such exploration programme is approved every year.

Exploration of non-CIL coal blocks is carried out under the Central Sector Scheme 'Exploration of Coal & Lignite' of the coal ministry.

Under this scheme, both regional exploration and detailed drilling of these blocks are conducted."
9,2019-12-03,Coal India,"Investors’ interest is likely to sustain in companies such as Varun Beverages, Endurance, Amara Raja, Bata, PVR, Gujarat Gas, and Asian Paints that have been able to improve financial performance in the second quarter despite the challenges in the economy. These companies were successful in reporting better business growth than their respective sector averages.

Varun Beverages, one of the largest bottlers of Pepsi, reported 60 per cent growth year-on-year in volume at 124 million cases in the September quarter helped by recent acquisition and growth in the rural market following greater availability of electricity.

Amara Raja Batteries, a supplier of batteries to auto companies, reported 24 per cent growth in the operating profit following a double digit revenue growth from the replacement market, which offset the pressure on earnings from sales to automakers. Also, a change in revenue mix in favour of high value products resulted in 370 basis points (bps) margin expansion to 17.2 per cent.

Endurance Technologies, an auto ancillary company, outperformed the industry growth on account of increasing volume from new automakers, 10 per cent growth in the replacement market and increasing content per vehicle from the existing customers.

India’s largest paints maker Asian Paints had double digit volume growth in seven quarter in a row after the company enhanced focus on low margin, low end products. It has recently launched an ultra-economy emulsion which is priced 20-25 per cent below its regular economy emulsion to maximise benefit of the cut in the GST rate.

Domestic and foreign investors have increased holding in these companies. For instance, Sundaram MF, Blackrock and William Blair raised holdings in Varun Beverages. UTI Asset Management and L&T MF added some of these companies in their portfolios, according to Bloomberg data.

12,2019-12-03,Coal India,"Despite the ongoing economic slowdown, some 20 firms in the BSE500 index reported a turnaround performance in September quarter on a year-on-year basis. Plus, 17 of them posted up to 51 per cent YoY rise in net sales for the quarter.

These stocks mostly come from sectors like power, hotels, banking, hospital, NBFC, engineering, pharma and cement.

Adani Green Energy, whose share price has rallied 175 per cent in last one year, posted a net profit of Rs 100 crore for Q2 of FY20 against a net loss of Rs 188 crore reported for the same period last year. Net sales advanced 51 per cent YoY to Rs 675 crore during the quarter.

The company got listed in 2018. Adani Enterprises had announced demerger of its renewable energy business into associate company Adani Green Energy as part of efforts to simplify the overall business structure.

JK Lakshmi Cement and The India Cements also managed to report profits for the quarter after clocking losses in the same period last year. While the former posted a net profit of Rs 48.70 crore against a Rs 4.80 crore loss year on year, the latter reported Rs 5.7 crore profit against Rs 4.50 crore loss for the same period.

The company’s efforts to reduce logistics cost, optimising the product mix and improved efficiency parameters enabled it to boost profitability, JK Lakshmi Cement said, adding that softening fuel prices also helped.

Ashika Stock Broking has a ‘buy’ rating to JK Lakshmi Cement with a price target of Rs 407.

“The management expects demand recovery in the second half of FY20. However, the price would remain the same in key markets. Further, the company is likely to announce brownfield expansion with around $85-90 per tonne capex within 6-9 months to cater to the growing demand. We expect JKLC to generate Rs 300 crore and Rs 360 crore fresh cash flows for FY20 and FY21, respectively, with minimal capex,” the brokerage said.

Shares of JK Lakshmi have gained 7.61 per cent since November 28 last year, while those of India Cements are down 11 per cent. Reliance Securities has a ‘hold’ rating on India Cements with a price target of Rs 90.

“We continue to believe strong cash generation and debt reduction would be the key catalysts for the stock until the stock gets re-rated,” Reliance Securities said.

In the banking space, state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) reported Rs 507 crore profit for the second quarter ended September 30, 2019. It had posted Rs 4,532 crore loss for the corresponding quarter last year.

Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘sell’ rating on PNB with a price target of Rs 45 despite a turnaround in Q2. The scrip traded at Rs 65 on November 29.

Bank of India, United Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India and Andhra Bank are among other players in the banking space whose bottom lines came into the green on a YoY basis.

“Within the PSU banks, our favourite has only been the top name. We do not recommend any other stock apart from the top PSU name,” said Gautam Shah, Founder and Chief Strategist, Goldilocks Premium Research.

13,2019-12-03,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Nifty50 has failed to extend the rally the way it was expected to, after it breached the crucial 12,000-12,050 range.

But analysts believe the broader market trend is intact and the index would head for the 12,400 level sooner than later after a brief consolidation.

A few dozen stocks from the broader market are already showing buildup of momentum, suggests moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator formed a bullish crossover on 45 counters on NSE, hinting at possible upsides. Strong trading volumes on many of these counters are lending credence to the emerging trend.

The list included Coal India, JSW Energy, Havells India, Pidilite Industries, SREI Infra, LT Foods and Radico Khaitan besides Trent, ABB India, Lovable Lingerie and JK Lakshmi Cement.




The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data also showed 53 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included Dish TV, ICICI Bank, Suven Life Sciences, Central Bank, SPARC, IRB Infra and Eicher Motors, among others.




Analysts said the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

As for Nifty outlook, Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking believes there is no sign of weakness in the market so far. “We remain optimistic and expect the index to surpass the 12,150 mark and go beyond in the near term. Traders are advised to keep a positive bias and use dips as a buying opportunity. The 12,000-11,883 range is likely to offer good support to the index,” he said.

“The trend may become bullish, once Nifty crosses above the 12,150 level,” said Amit Shah of Indiabulls Ventures. “In such a case, Nifty can move swiftly to the 12,400 level,” he said.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.

• Antique Stock Broking has upgraded 
Kansai Nerolac Paints to buy from hold with a revised target price of Rs 587. Kansai Nerolac is expected to deliver better sales growth during second half of FY20 as compared to first half of FY20 led by recovery in decorative paint sales and lower drop in industrial paint sales, said Antique. Recovery in East India from floods and lower drop in automotive volumes will be key catalysts, it said. Shares of Kansai Nerolac Paints ended down 0.55 per cent at Rs 522.10 on Monday.

• CIMB Securities has upgraded 
Timken India to add from hold and raised target price to Rs 980 from Rs 750. An increase in margins in the second quarter was driven by a better product mix, localisation of supply chain and price hikes, which are likely to sustain, said CIMB Securities. Th e brokerage said its substantial EPS upgrades over FY20-22 are due to a structural uptick in margins and lower tax rate. Shares of Timken India ended up 3.4 per cent at Rs 886.60 on Monday.


• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on 
GMR Infrastructure with a target price of Rs 25. The GMR stock may come under pressure in the short term having lost out on the bid for Jewar Airport. Nevertheless, there are other opportunities such as privatisation of six existing airports, said Edelweiss.

Shares of GMR Infrastructure ended down 2.5 per cent at Rs 21.35 on Monday.

• IIFL Securities has initiated coverage on 
Sudarshan Chemical Industries with a buy rating and target price of Rs 500.

Shares of Sudarshan Chemical ended down 0.3 per cent at Rs 393.50 on Monday.

23,2019-12-04,Coal India,"Kolkata: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has pulled up Coal India for making an excess contribution of Rs 371 crore to its provident fund body unlawfully for five years till 2018.

The national auditor has pointed out in a recent report that Coal India and its subsidiaries deposited the sum with the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO) as an employer’s share of provident fund contribution on leave encashment, though this was not permissible under law.

“The practice was not stopped despite a Supreme Court order dated March 2008 in another civil case and despite highlighting the same in the C&AG’s Audit Report of 2009-10,” the auditor said.

A senior Coal India executive, however, argued that the practice was stopped after CAG pointed out the issue.

Coal India deposits retirement benefits with CMPFO that is matched by the employee contribution every month. It is used by CMPFO to pay a lumpsum on retirement and disburse the monthly pension to the staff. It is a standard practice in public sector companies for employees to opt for cash in lieu of accrued leave. This being an income, the employer deducts a portion and deposits it with the CMPFO as part of retirement benefit.

The Supreme Court ruling mentioned that the basic wage was never intended to include amounts received for leave encashment and directed that if any payment has been made, then it can be adjusted for future liabilities.

According to CAG, even after a clarification by the CMPFO commissioner in July 2016, no action was taken by Coal India till November 2017 to discontinue the practice. Coal India subsequently instructed its subsidiaries for discontinuing the practice.

The coal ministry in its Action Taken Note in January 2018 said a process has been started to list out the employees against whom the excess payment towards PF contribution occurred and it would be completed early for initiating the adjustment process.

The CAG report mentioned that though the coal ministry stated that the adjustment process would be initiated early, it has not been implemented. “Notwithstanding the Supreme Court judgment and clear directions of the coal ministry, no action had been taken for adjustment of the excess contributions already made by the employer against its future liabilities,” it said.

“Thus, due to inordinate delay in taking action to discontinue the irregular practice… Coal India and its subsidiaries lost the opportunity to adjust the same towards future liabilities in respect of the employees already retired. The matter was referred to the ministry in October 2018; their response was awaited,” CAG’s report said."
22,2019-12-04,Coal India,"The government has collected Rs 2.03 lakh crore in revenue from state-owned Coal India in the last six financial years, Parliament was informed on Wednesday. Of the total revenue received, the maximum of Rs 44,826.43 crore was mopped up in 2018-19.

24,2019-12-05,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India (CIL) is in talks with Russian coal company Vostok-Coal-Diskon to participate in the extraction of coking coal and its imports from mines in the Siberian districts of Russia, Coal India executives said.

VostokCoal-Diskon is developing coal extraction facilities at the Taimyr coal basin of Taymyr Peninsula in central Siberia. It has been exploring the area since 2016 and has recently opened two deposits that would touch peak capacity of 30 million tonnes a year.

VostokCoal will build a coal terminal and create a specialised fleet for exporting coal round the year. Plans include bringing the coal home through the relatively new, Northern Sea Route, which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean along the icy Russian coast of Siberia and the Russian Far East, through the Bering Strait near Alaska crossing five Arctic seas.

The shipping route has opened up in the last few years due to melting Arctic polar ice cap. It cuts short the distance between Northern Europe and China by almost 40% than via the Suez Canal, and 60% than via the Cape of Good Hope, the established routes.

Vessels, however, need to negotiate dense floating ice on the route for almost 10 months a year and VostokCoal will employ nuclear-powered icebreaker ships to provide safe waterways.

“The Indian government is in dialogue with Russia for importing coking coal and participate in its production,” a senior Coal India executive said. “As part of this dialogue, and as a coal-producing company, we are in dialogues with VostokCoal and would either import or participate in coal production as directed by the Centre.”

As a first step, Coal India signed MoUs with two Russian entities in September. The first was with Far Eastern Agency for Attracting Investments and Supporting Exports, for cooperation in mining coking coal in the Russian Far East and Arctic Region. The second MoU was between Coal India and Eastern Mining Company for exploring, identifying, sourcing, negotiating and consummating mutually beneficial investment opportunities in mining in the Russian Far East.

Parallelly, VostokCoal and the Far East Investment & Export Agency also signed an MoU for collaboration and implementation of Vostok-Coal project in the Taimyr coal basin. It will allow VostokCoal to receive state’s cooperation for the project and in negotiations with potential investors and partners.

These two MoUs will follow an arrangement between Coal India and VostokCoal for mining and importing coal to India."

32,2019-12-06,Coal India,"Yesterday the government declared results for five mines and the Gare Palma 4/1 decision has not yet been taken. We are very much confident that the decision will be taken in our favour, says VR Sharma, MD, JSPL. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.


Have you received any notification from the ministry regarding the delay in allocation?Yesterday the government declared resuts for five mines and the Gare Palma IV decision has not yet been taken. We are very much confident that the decision will be taken in our favour because everything was done through e-auction and we were the highest bidders. We are very hopeful that either today or Monday, we would get the confirmation from Government of India.


Do you have any official intimation stating the same?No, there cannot be any official intimation. If there is an official intimation, there is going to be a confirmation. They have neither rejected nor have they kept it at hold and nor have they have commented on this mine. There would be some internal discussion in the ministry and we are very much confident and hopeful that either today or on Monday, we would get it.


I did not mean official intimation saying that Gare Palma goes to you... It is not an information even that it has not gone to us.


Does it happen that more than one list of coal blocks allocated in one round of e-auction is released?It is not a school or university result that it has to come out on the same day. So for each and every allocation, mines and assets, there may be some internal decisions because Coal India is already operating this mine and there must be some dialogues and discussions within the ministry. Everything has been done as per the Government of India’s requirements for the e-auction and the forward auction. We participated in it and we were declared as H1 bidders. There is no reason that government would decline our stake on this mine because we are H1.


So, we will wait for the next list. But back in 2015, the coal ministry thought that Balco’s bid of 1585 for Gare Palma was too low. Yours is at Rs 230 a tonne?Throughout the country, whenever the mines have been put on auction, they never have a reserve price like Rs 1,500 or Rs 1,200 or Rs 1,700. The government is free to put a minimum price tag at Rs 1,500, if this was the case. Since they have been operating this mines for the last five years, they must have seen that the value of this mine is Rs 1,500. Otherwise, the government could have been very pragmatic and fixed the minimum price Rs 1,500. 

Secondly the option was open to everybody. Balco did not participate this time. If this was so lucrative, than Balco should have participated at Rs 1,500 again. In five years, the government has produced more than 5 million tonne out of the mine. That is a value loss for everybody. Five years back, Balco was considering it for Rs 1,500 per tonne. They must have done due diligence before participating in any other mine and that is why they did not participate this time.


In case you name does not feature in the second list, what are the implications for JSPL? No big impact. There are two things in mining business; because we are sitting at a hub of more than 60 billion tonne of coal and there are more than 11 mines operating nearby. In India, out of 11 mines, 8 belong to the Government of India. So, we are getting coal whenever we need and now coal production has been increased as well. 

We have been participating in the auctions and we get whatever quantity of coal we need. There is problem only in the rainy season when it was monsoon because we have very heavy floods, the mines were full of water. But for the last one-and-a-half month, the production is very good. Yesterday, there was an auction of 400,000 tonnes of coal just 25 km from our plant and we have got 100,000 coal from them. 

So there is no problem and there is no dearth of coal now. so there is no issue, there will not be any impact on production or profitability. Our production in the last two months have been wonderful and in the October to December quarter (Q3), we will be surpassing all our records."
34,2019-12-06,Coal India,"State-run Coal India Limited (CIL) on Friday said it has relaxed norms for supplying the fuel to its customers of non-regulated sector by extending ""letter of credit"" to them and allowing an independent power producer (IPP) to transfer coal from one plant to another. With the credit facility, non-regulated customers from steel, sponge iron, cement, aluminium, MSMEs and IIPs need not to make 100 per cent advance payment for coal and this will enable them to run their plants smoothly, a CIL official said.

""CIL is extending the letter of credit facility to non-regulated customers, allowing them to pay coal value through Irrevocable Revolving Letter of Credit (IRLC) mode for supplies through rail mode under fuel supply agreements executed through linkage auctions,"" a statement said. This facility hitherto was extended only to power generating companies, the official said, adding that this is in ""pursuance of government's initiatives towards ease of doing business in coal sector"".

Customers of non-regulated sector are large in numbers and blockage of working capital in coal movement through railways was, of late, found to have a bearing on their financial health, the miner said. Earlier, significant amounts of money deposited by these customers against the coal value for transporting through railways were ""locked up in the form of advance"", it said.

During 2018-19, around 73 million tonne of coal was supplied to the non-regulated sector under fuel supply agreement, out of a total coal off-take of 608 million tonne. In a separate initiative, IPPs have been allowed for inter-plant transfer of coal. This means if an independent power generating entity owns two different plants and has two separate fuel supply agreements (FSA) in place, they can transfer coal from one plant to another, owned by it, to improve efficiency in generation and reduce the cost of the fuel.

Coal behemoth said this facility was earlier confined to central and state power generating companies. This would also reduce the transportation cost and take the load off the railways during peak season, the miner added."

36,2019-12-06,Coal India,"A parliamentary panel has expressed concern over the massive Rs 8,435 crore outstanding dues of Coal India from power sector and said punitive action should be taken against the defaulting power generating units. The Standing Committee on Coal and Steel in a report tabled in Parliament on Friday also noted that huge amount of dues are outstanding from the state and other utilities for years. 

 ""The outstanding dues of Coal India from the power sector as on March 31, 2019 (are) Rs 8,435.19 crore,"" the report said. The panel said it is concerned to note that huge amount of dues are outstanding from the state and other utilities for years. 

 ""The Committee therefore, recommends that more vigorous efforts need to be taken by all (three) PSUs to recover outstanding dues and if warranted, punitive actions on the defaulting parties should also be taken,"" it said. 

 The three PSUs referred to are Coal India, Singareni Collieries Company and NLC India. The panel noted that despite various initiatives taken by the PSUs to recover dues, desired results are yet to be seen. Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output."

37,2019-12-08,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: An employee association of state-owned CIL and SCCL on Sunday said it will go on a day-long protest in the national capital on Monday, over lack of pension reforms in the coal sector.

""The All India Association of Coal Executives, under the banner of All India Coal Pensioners Association (AICPA), will be organising one-day dharna by coal pensioners at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on December 9 (Monday),"" it said in a statement.

The association says that pension of Coal India Ltd (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) employees has not been reviewed since 1998 despite a provision requiring a review of the Coal Mines Pension Scheme (CMPS) every three years.

The Coal Mines Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1948, paved the way for creation of a statutory body Coal Mines Provident Fund Office (CMPFO) to formulate and maintain a comprehensive pension scheme for coal employees for the welfare of retired employees in the coal sector.

""After passage of 50 years, a so-called sustainable pension scheme came into existence and is called CMPS-1998. Coal employers and executives are covered under CMPS-1998 which is effective from April 1, 1994... Despite the provision for review of the scheme every three years, it has not been done and pension once fixed at the time of retirement has never been increased since inception,"" the statement said.

As a result, even chairman and managing directors of state-owned coal companies, such as CIL, who retired before 1997 are receiving a monthly pension of only Rs 1,000-Rs 3,000 per month.

""Whereas even the lowest-level employees of both the PSUs -- CIL and SCCL -- retiring today get more than Rs 10,000 per month as pension due to increase in salary in 2007 and 2017 pay revision for executives and different NCWA (National Coal Wage Agreement) over the last 20 years,"" the statement said.
Since inception of the scheme 21 years ago, not even once the pension has been enhanced, the statement said.

Since CMPS 1998 is a government-notified scheme, the Centre must pitch in to bail out the scheme by levying a cess on coal production in the country."
38,2019-12-09,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Independent power producers will now be allowed to use contracted fuel supply from Coal India at any plant run by the same group, a senior executive at the state-run firm said.

This is expected to reduce the cost of power generation making them more competitive because if a power company has separate fuel supply agreement for each plant, it can transfer coal from one plant to another. This would also reduce transport cost and take the load off railways during peak season.

The beneficiary plant would only need to provide an affidavit to Coal India affirming that the additional coal supply beyond the annual contracted quantity for a particular plant shall only be used for generating power for distribution under long-term power purchase agreements with power distribution companies.

“Coal India board has recently allowed this category of plants, around 40 in numbers, to avail a facility which was so far being enjoyed by state and central government-owned power plants. State-owned producers like NTPC and DVC have benefited from the facility. The development will now benefit some 45,000 MW of generation capacity,” said a senior Coal India executive.

Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head at ratings firm ICRA, said flexibility of usage will result in power companies running their plants more efficiently since they now have the freedom to use the coal at the nearest location to the source or the most efficient plant. “It will result in a reduction of variable cost leading to the generation of cheaper power. If this is passed on to consumers, will lead to a reduction in their power bills,” he said.

“Interplant transfer of coal for private power producers will lead to better usage of coal and its transportation; leading to efficiencies and benefits to consumers,” said Ashok Khurana, director general of Association of Power Producers.

During 2018-19, Coal India supplied 99 million tonnes, about 16% of their production to independent power producers, which is estimated to have generated 22,000 MW of power.

“The move is in pursuance of government’s initiatives towards ease of doing business in the coal sector,” the Coal India executive said."

A total of 63 million tonne of coal movement is currently involved under the rationalisation policy, CIL sources said.

""An estimated Rs 3,770 crore is being saved annually by 58 thermal power plants in the country in coal transportation costs after the implementation of linkage rationalisation policy by Coal India Limited since 2015,"" the miner said.

The linkage rationalisation refers to transfer of coal supply source of a power plant from a far end mine to the nearer one.

This arrangement benefits the power plants in reduction of coal transportation cost and ensures quicker supplies of the fuel and greater availability of railway rakes, the sources said.

Initially, 19 thermal power plants were identified by the task force for linkage transfer. These plants belonged to state-run power generating companies like WBPDCL, DVC, DPL, Mahagenco, GSECL, NTPC to name a few.

In May 2018, linkage rationalisation was also extended to independent power plants."

46,2019-12-11,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: Six of the seven coal producing subsidiaries of the world's largest miner CIL did not devise a policy as mandated by the environment ministry, according to a CAG report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday.

""Coal India Ltd (CIL) amended its original Corporate Environment Policy (CEP) and formulated a comprehensive Environment Policy only in March, 2012, followed by a revised policy in December 2018.

""However, six out seven coal producing subsidiaries of CIL did not formulate a policy as mandated by MoEF&CC (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change) which stipulated that a well laid down environment policy duly approved by the Board of Directors of the subsidiaries needs to be in place,"" the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said.

Further, guidelines containing the responsibility and delegation at different levels in environment discipline were formulated by CIL, but the same were not dovetailed in their operating manual by the subsidiaries, according to the CAG report on 'Assessment of Environment Impact due to Mining Activities and its Mitigation in Coal India Ltd and its Subsidiaries'.

CAG further said the pollutants exceeded the limits prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in eight mines across three subsidiaries of CIL.

""Further during 2013-18, 62 lakh kilo-litre (KL) of untreated water was discharged to nearby water bodies by Lakhanpur and Basundhara (W) mines of MCL thereby contaminating ground water,"" it said.

Coal India arms CCL, BCCL and SECL continued to use ground water for their mining operations without obtaining no objection certificate from Central Ground Water Authority. The subsidiaries did not install sewage treatment plant at the residential colonies of the collieries, thereby contaminating the ground water.

""Due to absence of mechanical brooming/industrial cleaner in Piparwar OCM of CCL, the spillage from overloaded truck/dumpers accumulated along the sides of the bridge of Safi river, was not cleaned periodically,"" it said.

These eventually drained into the river, thereby contaminating the water. Further, the rejects of Kathara washery of CCL were found to be contaminating the Damodar river."

47,2019-12-12,Coal India,"MADRID: With the BASIC nations - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - virtually threatening rich countries of derailment of outcome of the current UN climate conference (COP25) due to the latter's failure to deliver on past promises, the European Union (EU) on Wednesday suddenly announced its 'Green Deal' with an objective to achieve 'net-zero' emission by 2050 - a move seen by participants as an attempt to put the emerging economies back on track for higher ambition goal by next year.


It is learnt that the BASIC joint statement, saying ""the progress on the pre-2020 agenda will be the benchmark of success for this COP"", sounded an alarm bell in the EU camp which has been resisting linking of Kyoto Protocol pledges (pre-2020) with the progress on Paris Agreement (post-2020) actions.

Expressing grave concern on the ""current imbalance in the negotiations"" due to differences between developed and developing nations, the BASIC countries said, ""Commitments made by developed countries in the pre-2020 period must be honoured, because the completion of the pre-2020 agenda is of critical importance in building the basis for mutual trust and ambition in the post-2020 period."" 


Noting that ""there has been a lack of progress on the pre-2020 agenda, adaptation and issues related to means of implementation support, in the form of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building support"", the BASIC nations said, ""This imbalance needs to be immediately rectified, in the interests of a successful conference outcome and achieving the global goals in the Paris Agreement.""


The EU (28 nations), on its part, rushed through its 'Green Deal' proposing a European 'Climate Law' enshrining the 2050 climate neutrality objective by March 2020 and presenting a plan by mid next year to increase the EU's climate (emission reduction) target for 2030 to at least 50% and towards 55% from its 1990 levels. 


All these back-to-back development happened on the day when two key reports on business entities caught attention of participants here at COP25 for galvanising countries into action to deal with climate crisis. The COP venue also witnessed a massive protests by activists, demanding higher ambition (emission cut targets) from countries.


The first report - appeared in journal Environmental Research Letters - reflected the negative aspect of private/public entities' roles in climate crisis showing how 88 companies from across the globe, including three - ONGC, Coal India Limited and Singareni Collieries Company Limited - from India, are responsible for most of the acidification of the world's oceans threatening marine life and disrupting food chains while second one - released by the UN Global Compact - pointed out how positively 177 companies, including six from India, aligned themselves with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels by reaching 'net-zero' emissions by 2050.

The Indian companies in the 'net-zero' emission list of 177 includes Mahindra Group, Wipro, Dalmia Cement, Bharti Airtel, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Reliance Jio Infocomm. ""The 177 companies collectively represent over 5.8 million employees, spanning 36 sectors and with headquarters in 36 countries. The companies have a combined market capitalization of over US$2.8 trillion, and represent annual direct emissions equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France, "" said the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), special initiative of the UN secretary-general, in a statement.

""I am encouraged that 177 major companies have committed to set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius future through the 'Business Ambition for 1.5°C' campaign. By stepping up and setting science-based targets, these companies are pioneering new ways of doing business and driving systemic change throughout the global economy,"" said the UN Secretary-General António Guterres at an event here at COP25 venue.

Most of the countries are, however, not keen on announcing such ambition by next year. Asked about unwillingness of countries to do it, Sunita Narain, environmentalist and director general of the New Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""It's a sign of how distrustful and divisive are the climate negotiations. All countries realise the urgency and need for urgent action but given the state of distrust and the fact that developed countries have reneged on all their commitments this is what is happening."" 

The European climate experts, on the other hand, appeared quite enthused of what the EU proposed on Wednesday. “The European Green Deal is a once-in-a-generation transformational opportunity to ensure the EU embarks upon a socially inclusive ecological transition to a net-zero economy, one that delivers tangible benefits to its citizens. This is our chance for a new social contract and building a fairer and more sustainable economy and society,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and one of the French diplomats who drafted the Paris Agreement in 2015."

The fund sold nearly 25 lakh shares each TCS and SBI and 5 lakh shares in ONGC during the month.

The AMC bought 40 lakh to 1.50 crore shares each in FMCG major ITC, government-owned GAIL India and Coal India and drug major Sun Pharmaceuticals.

Sun Pharma turned around in Q2 with a net profit of Rs 1,064.09 crore against a consolidated net loss of Rs 269.6 crore reported for the same period last financial year.

HDFC Mutual Fund’s other major buys in November included Aurobindo Pharma, REC, NTPC, NHPC, Bharti Infratel, Bharti Airtel, Lupin, Tata Steel, PNC Infratech, Neyveli Lignite, Infosys and Adani Ports, Delta Corp, Rites, Indian Hotel, J Kumar Infraproject and Persistent Systems, among others.

The fund house added 10 to 42 lakh additional shares of these companies during the month.


Watch | Smallcaps don't necessarily grow faster: Prashant Jain


In his recent interaction with ETMarkets.com, Prashant Jain, ED & CIO of HDFC AMC, said the entire market is reasonably valued, except for the consumer pack, which is trading above their long-term averages.

“Profit growth is recovering and the interest rate is low, which are good for valuations. The government has taken some good steps by cutting corporate tax rates, which would drive profit growth and encourage the manufacturing supply chain to be set up in India,” Jain said.

He also though the strategic divestment route for offloading government stake is very positive for PSUs, and this would encourage foreign inflows and lift valuations of public sector companies,” he said.

The fund house also added shares of several IT players during the month, including Tech Mahindra (4.19 lakh shares), Firstsource Solution (3.87 lakh shares), eClerx (0.64 lakh shares), L&T Technology (0.50 lakh shares), HCL Technologies (3,040 shares) and Newgen Software Tech (6,200 shares).

Elsewhere, it bought InterGlobe Aviation (4.84 lakh shares), Mishra Dhatu Nigam (8.15 lakh shares), JSPL (6.53 lakh shares), Bharat Electronics (7 lakh shares), Power Grid (6.12 lakh shares), Tata Global Beverages (3.75 lakh shares), Bajaj Electronics (7 lakh shares) and LIC Housing Finance (2.95 lakh shares).

Other largecaps and midcaps HDFC AMC accumulated during the month included JMC Projects (34,600 shares) and Dr Reddy’s Labs (32,102 shares). YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and M&M Financial Services drew interest of the AMC in the financial space.

Last week, there were reports that the AMC was keen on participating in the capital infusion of YES Bank.

“Any business with reasonable quality, a sustainable business model and fair value or below-fair value is a reasonable investment. Smallcaps and midcaps vastly outperformed the largecaps for four years since 2014. That outperformance led to higher valuations. The correction seen in last two years, those excessive valuations have gone. Going forward, as valuations converge, we are not going to see a significant difference in the performance of largecaps, midcaps and smallcaps,” Jain said.

In the broader market, the BSE500 index gained 1.17 per cent last month, while BSE Midcap index rose 1.48 per cent and the Smallcap index 0.02 per cent, suggesting a widening of the market momentum, which had moved only a couple of largecaps till the previous month.

On the sell side, HDFC AMC sold over 5 lakh shares each in BPCL, HPCL, Federal Bank, Punjab National Bank, Voltas, McLeod Russel, Avenue Supermarts, Adani Power, ICICI Prudential, Repco Home and Tata Power, during the month.

It completely exited Ashok Leyland, Biocon, Info Edge, Ircon International, Lemon Tree and SAIL.

51,2019-12-13,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Coal India is hoping to increase fuel stocks at power plants to the prescribed level of 22 days, which requires 36 million tonnes to be stored at generating stations, a company executive said.

Following successive months of slowdown, the company has managed to raise average daily production from 1.27 million tonnes in October to 1.8 million tonnes now. This increased stocks at power plants by 64% since October to 28 million tonnes—enough for 17 days. It is almost double last year’s stock position, which stood at 14 million tonnes, barely usable for nine days.

“We hope to touch Central Electricity Authority’s (CEA) mandated 22 day’s stocks at power plants by January as production at Coal India is on the rise. Stocks at power plants will have to be increased by five days to touch the CEA’s number. It would require a build-up of additional 8 mt of stock at the plants,” a Coal India executive said. “At present, stocks at mine-mouth in CIL is around 22 mt, more than enough for increasing stocks to the necessary level. Combined stock at CIL and power plants stands at around 50 mt this week.”

According to the executive, a 28% month-onmonth increase in Coal India’s October production and a 27% rise in month-on-month November production has enabled the company to increase stocks at power plants.

In an effort to make sure the sector can lift adequate coal, the company has recently decided to offer limited credit facilities by doing away with the advance payment norm."
55,2019-12-14,Coal India,"NEW DELHI: The government has decided to reject Jindal Steel & Power Ltd’s (JSPL) Rs 230-per-tonne bid for a captive coal block in Chhattisgarh, claiming the valuation to be too low even though the company was the highest bidder for it in the recent round of auctions, a senior official said.

JSPL said it was not aware of any such decision on the Gare Palma IV/1 block and that it expected the government to decide fairly on the matter.

All other blocks will be awarded to the successful bidders in the auctions held in the first week of November, the official said.

The coal block was auctioned earlier in 2015 as well when it had received a Rs 1,585-per-tonne quote from the Vedanta group’s Bharat Aluminium Company (Balco), the official told ET. “Even that was rejected as low by the coal ministry. How can the government now accept this bid which is too low than the previous rejected bid?”



In response to ET’s queries, JSPL said its closing bid of Rs 230 per tonne was about 55% higher than the reserve price of Rs 150 for the block and the third highest for the six blocks that were auctioned in the recent round.

“We believe the government will decide fairly with regards to the auction of the coal block. We will respect government’s decision,” managing director VR Sharma said.

This is the second time that the coal ministry has rejected JSPL’s bid for coal blocks. In the first round of auctions in 2015, the government had on similar grounds rejected JSPL’s best bids for the Gare Palma IV/2&3 and Tara blocks. The company had challenged the bid rejection in the Delhi High Court but lost the case.

JSPL’s shares closed 2.36% lower at Rs 138.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange Friday, when the benchmark Sensex ended more than 1% higher.

The company had proposed to use the Gare Palma IV/1 block for its Raigarh plant as well as for captive power plants near the mine.

The coal ministry had auctioned five other captive blocks in the first week of November. These were auctioned for the first time and had no parameter for comparison, and hence are being awarded to the respective highest bidders, the official said.

The official said Coal India was appointed the custodian for the Gare Palma IV/1 coal block in 2015 and status-quo would be maintained for now. The coal ministry has yet to decide whether the block be re-auctioned any time soon, the official said.

In the recent round of auction, Birla Corp emerged the highest bidder for the Bikram coal block at Rs 154 per tonne and the Brahmpuri block at Rs 156 per tonne. Vedanta bagged the Jamkhani coal mine for Rs 1,674 per tonne and Prakash Industries won the Bhaskarapara coal block for Rs 1,100 per tonne. Powerplus Traders emerged the highest bidder for the Jagannathpur B coal block at Rs 185 per tonne.

Coal mines in the recent tranche of auctions received a tepid response and the government had to annul auctions for 21 of the 27 mines on offer. A senior coal ministry official said many private steel and cement companies did not evince interest in the latest round of auction for captive coal mines as they were holding on to their cash for commercial coal auctions. The companies said the auctioned coal blocks were far off from end-use plants.

ET reported on October 13 that the government planned to keep minimal qualification criteria for companies to participate in the auctions of coal blocks for commercial mining, and had identified 15 large blocks for a pilot round of bidding in December."

63,2019-12-19,Coal India,"Emerging markets guru Mark Mobius has a secret formula for stock picking, and he has finally given it away.

At the India Economic Conclave earlier this week, Mobius said he would buy a stock if it has over 20 per cent return on capital (RoCE) and debt-to-equity ratio of less than 50 per cent, has no multiple share classes and pays a dividend yield of 3-4 per cent.

He also said the company should have a turnover of at least 2 million (we assumed the figure to be in rupee terms) a day.

Applied in Indian markets, the filters threw up three stocks – PSU coal miner Coal India, global technology company Sonata Software and a state-controlled mineral producer NMDC.

The criteria were the same and applied it for past two years.

Interestingly, several domestic brokerages are already bullish on these counters.

Barring Sonata Software (up 72 per cent), the other two stocks on the list are down up to 25 per cent in last two years. BSE benchmark Sensex is up 24 per cent in the same period.

BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices are down 12 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, since December 2017.

Coal India, an almost debt-free player reported a consolidated RoCE of 109 per cent for FY19 and 45.50 per cent for FY18. It also maintained a dividend of yield of over 5 per cent during this period and posted gross sales of Rs 92,896 crore for the year ended March 2019.

Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services had a ‘buy’ rating to Coal India in November with a price target of Rs 278. “Over the medium term, we expect volumes to continue growing at 5-6 per cent. Besides Coal India has managed to keep costs in check on the back of productivity measures and shutting down of old mines. Ongoing efficiency measures, along with growth in volumes should drive 4 per cent adjusted Ebitda growth CAGR over FY19-21 despite a high base of FY19,” the brokerage said.

Sonata Software reported an RoCE of 48 per cent in FY19 and 40 per cent in FY18, while NMDC’s RoCE stood at over 25 per cent during the same period. Where the former posted gross sales of Rs 2,961 crore for FY19, the latter reported a turnover of Rs 12,152 crore.

Centrum Broking in October maintained a ‘buy’ rating on Sonata Software with a price target of Rs 400. “Sonata enjoys strong competency in Microsoft Dynamics and SAP hybrids. The company’s recent acquisitions (Scalable Data Systems and Sopris Systems) have further strengthened its positioning in Microsoft Dynamics offerings. We believe acceleration in organic revenue growth momentum is key to drive P/E re-rating,” it said.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services recently gave a ‘buy’ rating on NMDC with a price target of Rs 126. “Most packages of the steel plant are complete. We believe the company’s steel plant would be valuable given the low-cost iron ore and economy of scale,” it said."

71,2019-12-21,Coal India,"ET Intelligence Group: Sustainable and socially responsible investment is gradually moving into the mainstream, thanks to increasing awareness among companies. The rising clout of fund managers who focus on sustainable investment based on environment, social responsibility and governance (ESG) parameters have acted as a trigger for such investments.

A case in point is a fund manager at one of the largest ESG funds in India who included Hindustan Unilever in his portfolio after learning that it had started producing detergent bars that require less water while rinsing clothes, amid reports of a water crisis in Chennai. ESG-based investing is still in its infancy in India, with just two ESG funds having cumulative assets under management worth under $ 500 million, compared with the global ESG fund size of $30.7 trillion.

The performance of certain stocks show that investors, too, are conscious of their ESG responsibilities. For instance, Coal India has underperformed the benchmark index for the last five years despite growing coal volume and consistent dividend payments.

Consumption stocks are not an exception either. “The widening valuation gap between Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC shows that the former is rewarded for efforts to reduce the carbon footprint,” said a domestic fund manager. After trading at similar valuations five years ago, HUL now commands a 40% premium over ITC.

“Investors interest in companies related to fossil fuels is bound to wane in the long term considering the risk to company valuations,” said Abhay Laijwala, an ESG fund manager at Avendus India.

The risk of funds moving towards cleaner fuels from carbon-intensive fuels may affect the performance of Indian equities, as the weight of energy stocks is over 12% in the benchmark indices.

Also, the company with the largest market capitalisation, Reliance Industries (RIL), has fossil fuel exposure. It has been consistently working on sustainability measures. It has a zero water discharge refinery and uses only desalinated sea water. RIL also has a facility to convert PET water bottles to polyester thread. In FY19, RIL recycled about 2 billion PET bottles.

Similarly, India's largest power producer NTPC has put up its first ultra-supercritical unit in Madhya Pradesh which will consume less coal, thereby lowering emissions.

Investors should, however, not shun fossil fuel and thermal power producers as they are a pivotal part of the existing ecosystem, said Chirag Mehta, the ESG fund manager of Quantum AMC. “The key thing to watch for these companies is their vision and delivery to reduce carbon footprint. If they show intent to cut it, there is no harm in holding them,” he said. Indian cement companies are more efficient than global peers. Shree Cement, for instance, uses only 72 litres of water to produce a tonne of cement, compared with the global average of 300 litres per tonne.

Companies including Mahindra & Mahindra, Havells India, Bharti Infratel, and Ashok Leyland have set up captive solar power projects to reduce carbon footprint. Given the rising awareness about sustainable growth, India Inc is well poised to meet the challenges of a cleaner environment."

75,2019-12-23,Coal India,"KOLKATA: New areas for additional coal reserves, economical for mining should be identified at a faster pace, said coal secretary Anil Kr Jain.

“Areas already identified needs to be explored and mining should start at a faster pace,” the secretary said at a workshop organised by Central Mines Planning & Design Institute (CMPDIL) in Ranchi.

He emphasised on the need for a paradigm shift from present exploration method to new technologies according to the statement by CMPDIL.

At the workshop, Sekhar Saran, CMPDIL’s chairman and managing director talked about the introduction of 2D/3D seismic survey and other modern available technologies which may be implemented for faster coal & lignite exploration to cover more area in a shorter time. He also talked about limitations of a seismic survey in the exploration of Indian coal & lignite.

“After detailed deliberation with all experts and stakeholders, a roadmap will be prepared and submitted to the coal ministry for implementation,” the statement by CMPDIL said.

Nevertheless, last year, Coal India’s exploration arm, CMPDIL, added 6.6 billion tonnes of coal to its proven category of reserves – meaning it can be economically extracted and could fuel almost 145 gigawatts of power plants for 10 years. The company also prepared 31 coal mining project reports which when taken up by Coal India could produce 128 million tonnes of additional coal a year.

Addition to the proven the category was achieved through detailed exploration and exploratory drillings in 114 blocks spanning 260 square km.

“In the current year, CMPDIL is targeting exploratory drilling of 13.75 lakh meters of which 5 lakh meters would be departmental while the rest would be outsourced. Given, the recent trend of adding to proven category of reserves, the arm hopes to add at least 5 billion tonnes of additional coal to the existing proven category of reserves this year,” said a senior executive from CMPDIL.

Last year the arm achieved 13.60 lakh meter of drilling, against a target of 13.67 lakh meter, through departmental resources and outsourcing. Last year, the company also added two specialised equipment (Vibroseis ) and analytical software, to its exploration arsenal. These are expected to increase success rates of exploration, the executive said.

Vibroseis, the equipment that was added last year, is a truck-mounted system which uses a large oscillating mass to put a range of frequencies into the earth. It helps estimate the density of matter underground helping miners ascertain the possibility of deposits till at least 800 meters under the earth’s surface. Indian coal typically is found at depths ranging between 300 meters and 600 meters.

At present, 148.8 billion tonnes of coal has been categorised under proven reserves in India and CMPDIL has been adding at least 5 billion tonnes to this reserve every year since 2012. Executives from the company believes, this will rise gradually as advanced machinery are added."

80,2019-12-25,Coal India,"A levy of Rs 10 on every tonne of coal produced will be imposed by the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organisation (CMPFO) on its member producers, including Coal India and Singareni Collieries. The levy will help bridge an asset-liability mismatch that was predicted to completely deplete the pension fund by 2028.

The levy is estimated to raise Rs 650 crore from Coal India this year if it manages to meet its yearly production target. The resulting increase in the cost of power generation would be less than 1 paisa per unit, a Coal India executive said. It will, however, benefit some 5 lakh pension holders and ensure provisions for future pension payments for another set of at least 4.8 lakh coal employees in the future.

The trustee board of CMPFO, at a meeting chaired by the coal secretary, last week decided to adopt some of the recommendations by an in-house panel, including enhancement of the government’s monthly contribution to Rs 249 per employee into the pension fund instead of Rs 26.56 paise per employee per month earlier.

“CMPFO is a statutory body under the coal ministry, and decisions taken by its trustee board are binding on member companies and the Centre will accept the recommendations,” said DD Ramanandan, president, All India Coal Workers Federation.

Employees of Coal India, Singareni Collieries, the mining division of DVC, coal mining workers of Sail, Jindal Steel & Power, Jindal Power, Usha Coal Mine, Jayaswal Neco Industries, Monnet Ispat & Energy and Sarda Energy & Minerals are covered by CMPFO.

At the meeting, the trustee board decided against imposing an upper cap of Rs 45,000 on monthly pensions as recommended by the in-house panel. There will be no upper limit on monthly pension payments.

Pensions will be calculated on the basis of 10 months average salary drawn by an employee before retiring – the current practice. The inhouse panel had recommended it be increased to 30 months.

Member employees of CMPFO contribute a monthly amount that is matched by their employers. The bulk of this fund, along with interest and bonus, is returned to the employees as provident fund after they retire. A portion of this contribution goes into a pension fund that provides a steady pension.

According to the last actuarial study, the pension fund was expected to completely go dry by 2023. The study indicated that employees and member companies jointly needed to increase their contribution by some 14% for the fund to sustain in the long run. It was, however, increased by 7% for Coal India recently, which would help the fund sustain until 2028."
81,2019-12-26,Coal India,"KOLKATA: The 16 coal blocks allotted to Coal India in the last one year will enhance annual output by 125 million tonnes, a senior company executive said, pointing out that production at these blocks could start in the next three to six years.

“It is expected to help the company meet its 1 billion tonnes per annum production target, which it intends to achieve by 2023-24,” an executive of Coal India said. “Production at some of the recently allotted blocks can start in the next three years, while for others it may take a little more. However, we hope to start production at all the allotted mines within the next five to six years.”

The government is keen on Coal India hastening up exploration and operationalising all its blocks soon. These include existing blocks with geological reserves of 110 billion tonnes that are yet to be taken up for production, 110 blocks with reserves of about 40 billion tonnes allotted in 2012, and the recently allotted 16 blocks. The coal ministry has advised Coal India’s exploration arm, CMPDIL, to report annually on reserves with every subsidiary company and block, reserves depleted, blocks with areas yet to be explored, blocks under production, and its plan for future projects and their reserve to production ratio.

The Centre has also asked CMPDIL to demarcate large blocks which could be attractive to established exploration companies."

The fuel supply by SCCL during the month of November also dropped by 6.1 per cent to 4.6 MT, against 4.9 MT in the corresponding month of previous fiscal.

Stating rain as the 'enemy of the coal sector', a government official had recently blamed extended monsoon for the loss of coal output for a few months from July onwards in the current fiscal.

CIL saw its production decline by 7.7 per cent to 330.4 MT in April-November period, over 358.3 MT in the year-ago period.

The state-owned firm had earlier said that it will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year.

The firm will further produce 1 billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi had said.

The the public sector undertaking is currently given the target of producing 660 million tonnes of coal amounting to 82 per cent of the country's coal output.

Joshi had said that with the demand for power rising steeply, there is enough opportunity for both government and private sectors to produce coal without adversely impacting each other."

88,2019-12-26,Coal India,"The government is planning to give a big push to private sector mining of coal, underground coal gasification and coal bed methane as it spent most of 2019 laying ground for diversification of the coal sector.

""This year (2019) we have been able to lay the ground for diversifying the coal sector... Now in the coming year, we are hopeful of diversifying the mining base of the country and inducting private capital, FDI.

""So we have to work out the terms and introduce private sector mining on very big terms...Coal Bed Methane (CBM), Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), Surface Gasification-- in very big terms,"" a top official at the coal ministry told PTI.

Stating that in 2019 the ground has been set up for CBM, UCG, he said the coal ministry has been able to firm up a business model and in the coming years some tangible steps would be seen on the ground in CBM, UCG and surface coal gasification of technology induction.

""The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has been of the view that the coal sector should induct technology, help to supply the gas sector needs of the country. Coal sector should adapt itself in such a way that it is not hit by the climate change considerations which are becoming every day concerns of the whole world,"" he explained.

UCG is a method of converting coal still in the ground to a combustible gas that can be used for various uses, including power generation.

CBM is a form of natural gas trapped in coal seams underground. Such gas can be extracted by drilling into the seam.

The government in 2019 liberalised foreign investment (FDI) norms in coal mining. For sale of coal, allowing 100 per cent FDI for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure, is expected to attract international players and create efficient and competitive coal market.

Stating that the coal sector had a single mindset of coal production from Coal India Ltd, he said the sector has to be dynamic, respond to the challenges coming from non fossil fuel component and answer the technology challenges.

Coal India accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic coal output.

Stating that 2019 has been a year of highs, lows, and again highs, he blamed the extended and heavy monsoon for the loss of output in July-October period of the ongoing fiscal.

The coal position now in the country was very comfortable and the Centre exuded hope that the imports of the fossil fuel in the country would be contained to 235 million tonne (MT) in FY'20.

""But July onwards there was a setback. Normally during monsoon every year there is a setback. But this year there was a little more setback. In Coal India there are 35 mines in which each mine has a production of more than four million tonne per year. So they are responsible for almost 75 per cent of Coal India's production. So in those mining areas there is heavy rainfall. So rain is the enemy of the coal sector...This time rain was not only heavy but it continued till October. So we lost production,"" he explained.

Asserting that coal stocks at power plants today were double of what they were on the same date last year and the mines were also stocked much higher, he said he was looking at a comfortable coal position in coming quarters.

""And in the coming times we are also hopeful that the demand of the non-regulated sector is fulfilled to a large extent it is actually the biggest importer. Out of the total import the country does, 50 per cent import comes from the non-regulated sector.

These are captive power plants , cement, steel and others. Now that we have good stocking at power plants and coal mines, now we are in a position to give more coal to them,"" he explained.

""If I start giving them (coal) now, the reduction in imports may come in February or March. But the coal which we are producing now, its salutary effect will come in the domestic supply in the last quarter of this year and the first quarter of the next financial year. So we are looking at comfortable coal position in the coming quarters,"" he said.

The country produced 730.35 million tonne of coal in FY'19 while the imports were 235.24 MT.

Coal India produced 330.4 MT of coal in April-November 2019-20, registering a decline of 7.7 per cent over 358.3 MT produced in the same period of the previous fiscal.

Debasish Mishra, Leader, Energy Resources and Industrials said, ""After growing at a healthy rate of almost eight per cent in FY'19 over the previous year, coal production in FY'20 has been dismal year till date with production contacting by more than five per cent.""

He is of the view that the extended monsoon, slowdown in economy leading to negative growth in electricity generation and overall poor performance by Coal India were the reasons for lower output.

""This may result in thermal coal imports touching almost 200 MT in FY20,"" he said.

On the policy front, the government has taken several steps in 2019, including auction of coal blocks and move towards further liberalising policy for attracting foreign investment in merchant coal mining, he said and added that ""the government might carve out bigger blocks and lower upfront payment to make these attractive.""

""Given the negative global outlook for coal as major contributor to global warming, several regulatory, land acquisition and law and order related challenges, it remains to be seen if large global mining majors will show interest in investing in India,"" he explained.

Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal said,""We expect the government to open more coal blocks for commercial mining...We are of the view that the measures to open India's mining sector will significantly raise its share in GDP from the current three per cent, thereby boosting overall economic activity."""

94,2019-12-29,Coal India,"KOLKATA: Amid concerns that Coal India Ltd (CIL) may fall short of its 660 million tonne (MT) production target for the current fiscal, the miner has planned to ramp up daily output to meet the goal, officials said. 

Till December, the miner is expected to produce close to 390 MT of coal and will require another 270 MT in the last quarter of this fiscal to meet the annual production target. 

Currently, Coal India produces 1.8 MT per day while the asking rate to achieve the target is 2.9 MT, they said. 

Internally, Coal India has planned to raise its production to 3 MT per day at least in February and March next year to inch closer to the target, Coal India officials told . 

According to the provisional data, the miner produced 330.38 MT of coal during April-November in the 2019-20 fiscal, down by 7.8 per cent from 358.30 MT in the year-ago period. 

Unless the miner increases its daily production to 2.5 MT per day from January to March period, it will struggle to surpass the production figure of the last fiscal, company sources said. 

In 2018-19, Coal India produced 606.89 MT while dispatch was at 608.14 MT. 

Coal India's offtake at 363.63 MT during April- November period was down by 7.2 per cent from 392.02 MT supplied in the year-ago period. 

CIL officials said the coal offtake was at 410 MT till December 27, 2019 as against a target of 467 MT. 

In October, a rating agency had projected that the coal behemoth might miss the production target by 50-75 MT in the current fiscal. 

Performance of Coal India's two key subsidiaries- Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) and South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL)- will be crucial in remaining three months of the current fiscal to meet its production target, the officials said. 

Mining activities in the two subsidiaries had been hit severely during monsoon and also due to law and order issues, they said. 

According to production data, SECL and MCL registered a negative growth of 14.5 and 9.8 per cent respectively as on December 27, 2019, a CIL official said, adding that these companies have been taking all measures to overcome hurdles and ramp up production. 

CIL, however, is apprehensive about coal demand with declining electricity generation of thermal power plants in the country till November this year, officials said. 

""If the current trend continues, it have an adverse impact on CIL's production and dispatch,"" they added."

103,2019-12-30,Coal India,"Mumbai: After a week of consolidation, India’s benchmark equity indices are expected to struggle for a direction as they enter a new calendar year, making it tricky for traders to pick the right bets.

Sensex shed 0.26 per cent last week and Nifty 0.21 per cent, as holiday mood among investors brought down volumes.

Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities, said while Nifty is trending higher, it may face resistance at 12,300 level as profit booking may emerge.

“On the weekly chart, Nifty50 has a formed a Doji pattern, indicating confusion. However, many sectors are not replicating Nifty movement and, hence, action will shift to specific stocks going forward,” Modi said.

In this backdrop, here is a list of 12 money-making ideas that, analysts say, can deliver solid gains over the next few weeks.

Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking

IndusInd Bank | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,550 | Stop loss: Rs 1,495
In the banking space, private banking majors are leading from the front and are still looking buoyant. After breaking out of its consolidation range, IndusInd Bank has taken an intermediate pause, offering a fresh buying opportunity, the analyst said. He advised traders to buy the stock in the Rs 1,510-1,515 range with a stop loss of Rs 1,495 for a target of Rs 1,550.


PVR | Buy | Target price Rs 1,960 | Stop loss Rs 1,820
PVR has been consolidating in the Rs 1,710-1,900 range for last three months. It surged on December 27 and came closer to the upper band of the range, which coincides with its record high. The analyst believes the chart pattern and positioning of the indicators are pointing to the strong possibility of a breakout in the near future. He advised traders to buy the stock in the Rs 1,855-1,870 range for a target of Rs 1,960 with a stop loss at Rs 1,820.

		}7 stocks that have potential to rally up to 20-40% in 2020 of 8NextPrevPlay SlideshowMoney making30 Dec, 2019Calendar 2020 is set to begin amid mixed sentiments in the market. While broadly the expectations are that Dalal Street should do better in 2020 than in 2019 and the broader market will start performing better, yet investors do not have the confidence to take the plunge and go value hunting in the deeply beaten-down counters. We rummaged through a dozen year-end brokerage reports to shortlist seven stocks from across sectors that, they say, offer decent potential to deliver solid gains in the year ahead.Next​Larsen & Toubro: Upside potential 37%30 Dec, 2019Axis Securities values this stock at 20 times FY21 EPS to arrive at a target price of Rs 1,736. With the surge in order intake of Rs 86991 crore in H1Fy20, the company crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore order book milestone at the end of September quarter, with international orders accounting for 22 per cent of the total order book. Deal pipeline remains strong at Rs 5.2 lakh crore for H2FY20, with 18-20 per cent win run-rate, Axis Securities said. L&T, it said, is well placed to surpass its inflow guidance of 10-12 per cent. for Fy20   NextKEC International: Upside potential 33%30 Dec, 2019Brokerage SMC Global noted that KEC International is continuously performing well and delivering in all the three parameters of revenue, profitability and order intake. The T&D business of the company has delivered a stellar performance, backed by robust execution in SAARC and the Americas, while the railway business has continued its growth momentum as it expands portfolio in other segments. The company has maintained its annual guidance of 20 per cent growth for FY20 revenue. SMC Global expects the stock to see a price target of Rs 392 in 8-10 months’ time frame on a one-year average P/E of 14.06 times and FY21 earnings per share of Rs 27.90. Next​Gujarat Gas: Upside potential 22%30 Dec, 2019Religare Broking noted that the company has a strong infrastructure and distribution network and enjoys near monopoly in the Gujarat state. The network expansion in other states may boost volumes going forward. The company is likely to deliver robust performance in FY20 as it has witnessed remarkable industrial volumes so far, the brokerage said.

The company has adjusted to new tax regime, resulting in an writing off of deferred tax liabilities that led to 13 times YoY growth in quarterly profits in Q2FY20. “Although the growth is likely to taper down in FY21, given higher base of the last year, we expect the company to deliver strong profit CAGR of over 35 per cent during FY19-22E,” the brokerage said.
 NextHindustan Unilever: Potential upside 28%30 Dec, 2019After incorporating GSK Consumer Healthcare merger, the opportunity for HUL is huge, said Nirmal Bang Institutional Research, which sees see the FMCG firm’s earnings to grow at a CAGR of 23 per cent over FY19-22. This is  without assuming any synergy benefits in margin estimates. On the valuation front, the stock is trading at 46 times/39 times  Y21/FY22 EPS and has delivered a return of 20 per cent in the past one year.



Volume delivery has been ahead of its much smaller peers and margins visibility could help sustain such premium valuations in the current environment, supported by best earnings growth visibility in the Indian FMCG space with the highest return ratios, the brokerage said.



“On a target multiple of 54 times September’21 EPS, we derive a target price of Rs 2,490,” the brokerage said.

Jay Thakkar ,Assistant Vice President - Equity Research, Anand Rathi Stock Brokers


Jubilant FoodWorks | Buy | Target price: Rs 1,680 | Stop loss: Rs 1,599
This stock has seen a breakout from the Triangular Pattern with a clear ‘buy’ crossover in its daily momentum indicator MACD. Hence the probability of an upside is quite high, the analyst said. He advised traders to buy the stock for a price target of Rs 1,680 with a stop loss at Rs 1,599.


Coromandel International | Buy | Target price Rs 545 | Stop loss Rs 510
This stock has seen a breakout from the Symmetrical Triangular pattern, and with that the probability of an upside has increased.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in


Edelweiss Financial Services | Buy | Target price Rs 134 | Stop loss Rs 108
This counter appeared to be in the consolidation mode for last 15 trading sessions, but at the lower end of the consolidation phase, it is witnessing relatively huge volumes hinting at some sort of accumulation. Moreover, price action over the last 28 sessions appears to be unfolding in a contracting triangle, which can pave the way for a spurt on the upside. Hence, if it sustains above Rs 108 level, this counter can be expected to witness a breakout sooner than later. In such a scenario, it can head to test its 200-day moving average at Rs 140. However, for time being, in anticipation of a breakout, positional traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 134. Stop loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 108.


JK Tyres| Buy| Target price Rs 81| Stop loss Rs 70
This counter appears to have registered a fresh breakout after a 10 days of consolidation in an extremely narrow range between Rs 71 and Rs 74. With a sudden spurt in last session, this counter appears to have initiated a fresh leg of upswing. Hence, if it sustains above Rs 71, it should ideally head to retest its swing high of Rs 81. Therefore, positional traders are advised to buy into this counter and look for a target of Rs 81 with a stop below Rs 70 on closing basis, the analyst said.


Gateway Distriparks | Buy| Target price Rs 117| Stop loss Rs 98
This counter appears to have initiated a fresh leg of uptrend with a huge breakout, after moving in an extremely narrow range between Rs 96 and Rs 94 in last 12 sessions. Hence, initially it can head towards its recent swing high of Rs 117, and beyond that, a bigger move cannot be ruled out. For the time being, the analyst advised positional traders to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on declines in the Rs 105 – 102 zone and look for a target of Rs 117. The stop loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 98.


Shrikant Chouhan, SVP Technical Research, Kotak Securities


Sun Pharmaceutical | Buy | Target price Rs 460 | Stop loss Rs 410
This stock witnessed sustained selloff in last few weeks from Rs 470-460 levels. Currently, it is holding above the important retracement zone on the daily charts and a rebound from these levels cannot be ruled out. For short term traders, it offers buying opportunity at current levels with a decent risk-reward ratio. The analyst expects the stock to resume its uptrend towards the target of Rs 460, with a stop loss of Rs 410.


Punjab National Bank | Buy | Target price Rs 70 | Stop loss Rs 63
This stock has reversed from its strong long-term support zone of Rs 57 where buying from strong hands has emerged. On weekly charts, stock is forming a complex inverse head and shoulder pattern which is a bullish reversal pattern. With a strong up-move in the PSU bank space, the analyst expects this stock to show a smart move and which in turn could start a new uptrend wave. He suggests buying the stock with a target price of Rs 70, and a stop loss of Rs 63.


Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst, Reliance Securities


M&M Financial Services| Buy | Target price Rs 365 | Stop loss Rs 308
This stock has made higher bottoms on weekly charts over the past one quarter and completed his price wise and time wise correction. Positive cross-over in RSI and rise in Stochastic from its oversold zone are indicating probable turnaround in the stock, the analyst said. He advised a long position on dips for the target of Rs 365 with a stop loss of Rs 308.


Vaishali Parekh, Senior Technical Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher


Coal India | Buy | Target price Rs 220-230 | Stop Loss Rs 188
This stock has almost formed a Double Bottom pattern near Rs 183 and seen a decent bounceback with the RSI getting stronger. It implies strength for further upside in the coming days. The bias is positive with favourable indicators and the analyst suggests to buy and accumulate this stock for an upside target of Rs 220 -230 levels keeping the stop loss near Rs 188.


Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst Angel Broking


Indoco Remedies | Buy | Target price Rs 211 | Stop loss Rs 162
After a long time, the midcap stock has finally joined the bulls’ party and outperformed during the week gone by. This midcap stock after gyrating in a broad range of Rs 135-175 for the last five months has finally broken the range on the higher side confirming a ‘Rectangular Channel’ breakout. In addition, prices on the daily chart have also closed above super trend indicator which acted as stiff resistance four times in the last few months. Moreover, there is also a fresh bullish crossover with 50-EMA crossing 89-EMA from below supporting the buy call. Hence, the analyst recommends buying this stock at current levels for a target of Rs 211 over the next 14 sessions. The stop loss should be at Rs 162."

I have 70,000 shares of TTML bought at an average price of Rs 5.50. What is your outlook on this company and what is the maximum price that can I getRs I can hold for long term. – TAPAN MUKERJEA
Unfortunately, the chances of losing the entire invested amount is very high as Tata Teleservices has a debt of Rs 11,938 crore, which is nearly 7 times its total assets. It is most unlikely that any possible resolution will leave any significant stake for the shareholders after meeting the debt obligations. As interest cost is more than its current revenues, it is very difficult to revive the company in my view.


I purchased IRB at Rs 180, Karur Vysya Bank at Rs 134 and CDSL at Rs 264. Please advise whether I should sell or hold them. — G SUNIL
Having lost over 60% of your capital in IRB Infra, you may hold the stock for the longterm. Its net debt of around Rs 15,000 crore gives some fear in the slowing economy. However, recent proposal of GIC infusing over Rs 4,000 crore gives some hope on the recovery of this stock in the longterm. You may add some quantity of Karur Vysya Bank to reduce your average cost as this stock trades at around just one time current year’s adjusted book value. Historically, Karur Vysya traded around 1.5 to 2 times its adjusted book value and hence, conservatively, you may keep Rs 100 as the target price for the next 12 to 18 months. You may continue to hold CDSL for one or two more years with a target price of around Rs 280 as it is engaged in almost perennially growing business and hence, around 19 PE on current year’s expected earning is quite reasonable.


I am holding 500 Coal India shares that were bought at Rs 275. Please suggest whether I should hold or sell at present rate? —MUKUND RAO
Hold Coal India with a target price of around Rs 240. It is possible for the stock price to spike in the short term itself as the fiscal stress of the central government may possibly induce this PSU, which is sitting on cash pile of close to Rs 50 per share, to declare attractive special dividend. Recent expansion of mines and also transport infrastructure would increase both its revenues and profits from FY2021 onwards.


I have 10,000 shares of Tata Power, which I had bought at Rs 60 in 2013. Now it's at Rs 56. Please advise me what to do. – SRICHAND TOLANI
You may hold it for the long term; although, in the short term, it is unlikely to reward significantly. Expansion of solar energy capacities and foray into charging stations for electric mobility would reward the investors in the long term.


I had purchased 30 shares of Aurobindo Pharma at Rs 674 apiece, 40 of Sun Pharma at Rs 574 and 30 Motherson Sumi shares at Rs 200. Should I hold or sell? — SUHAS MEHTA
You may hold Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of around Rs 530 for one year and then monitor whether the company is able to fulfil the requirements of US FDA for its major plant. In case it comes out successfully on these regulatory hurdles over the next one year, then you may hold it till you recover your cost. You may hold Sun Pharma with a target price of around Rs 470, which is a fair value based on 22 times expected FY2021 earnings. Motherson Sumi trades around 23 PE on one year forward earnings, which is a fair valuation in my view considering the possible further slowdown in the global automotive sector. Hence, you may sell the stock if it moves beyond 5% from the current level.

Nifty opened Tuesday’s session with a marginal loss and breached the sequence of higher highs and lows of last two sessions. The bears were active from initial trade, and continued to make lower lows as the day progressed. The index formed a negative candle on the daily chart even as it formed a Doji candle with a long lower shadow on the monthly chart.

The RSI oscillator showed a negative divergence on the daily chart, and thus, we may see small price or time correction in the coming days. The index is expected to move in the 12,000 – 12,300 range in the coming days.

However, the overall trend remains positive and we maintain our ‘buy on dips’ strategy till Nifty holds above the 12,100 level. On the upside, we may see an up-move towards the 12,250 – 12,300 zones, while on the downside, support was seen at 12,100 and then 12,000 levels.

In January options, maximum Put open interest stood at strike price 12,000 followed by 11,500, while maximum Call OI was at 12,500 followed by 12,200 levels. There was Call writing at strike prices 12,300 and 12,500 while Put writing was seen at 11,800 and 11,500. Options data suggested a wider trading range between 11,900 and 12,500 levels.

India VIX moved up 5.97 per cent to 11.66 level. It is currently hovering around its strong support zone at 10 – 11 ,and thus, we expect it to reverse in the coming sessions.

Bank Nifty formed the same open and high and corrected 0.60 per cent to form a negative candle on the daily chart, while it gained 0.67 per cent and formed a Doji candle on the monthly scale. The index is consolidating in a broader range between 32,000 and 32,600 levels. While buying interest emerged around the 32,000 mark, supply was witnessed in the 32,500 – 32,600 zone. As long as Bank Nifty sustains above the 32,000 mark, we will maintain our positive stance on the index for an up-move towards the 32,500 – 32,600 zone.
